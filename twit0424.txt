[00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.700]   It's a great lineup.
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.400]   We're going to talk about iOS 7, all of the new iPhones,
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.900]   changes coming afoot at Google.
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.700]   We're all going to live forever.
[00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.100]   What's going on with Cyanogen?
[00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.300]   And much, much more.
[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.000]   An RIP Blackberry, perhaps.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.300]   I'll let more next.

[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.300]   Leal Report is on vacation in Italy, in Venice, or wherever
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.300]   he is now.
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.300]   So the TWIT staff all decided to draw straws and I lost.
[00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.300]   So I am Sarah Lane hosting this episode on a beautiful sunny
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.300]   sunny now.
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.300]   I'm just kidding.
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.300]   We actually have a great studio audience.
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.300]   You can't see them, but they're here.
[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.300]   Thanks to everybody who came up to watch the show live with all of us.
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.300]   I have quite a panel on the show today.
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.300]   First, Martin Sargent.
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.300]   Is there anyone else?
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.300]   Yes.
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.300]   We've got what we're going to start with you because you're in studio.
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.300]   You're sitting right next to me.
[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.300]   In fact, we carpooled up because we do that sort of thing.
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.300]   We do.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.300]   And boy did I enjoy it.
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.300]   I did too.
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.300]   Martin Sargent, I don't think that you've been on TWIT since we did this about a year ago.
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.300]   It's been about a year ago and it hasn't gone unnoticed.
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.300]   Thank you very much for the presentation.
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.300]   Leo has to go on vacation in order to bring him to want me to do this.
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.300]   And then I ask you because that's what we do.
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.300]   It'll never be Leo and I sitting at the same desk.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.300]   No, thank you so much.
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.300]   It's so great to be back on TWIT.
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.300]   I love doing this show.
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.300]   Always great to be here.
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.300]   Thank you.
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.300]   Absolutely.
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.300]   And of course, Brian Brushwood, who is a TWIT regular, NSFW, plus frame rate with Tom
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.300]   Merritt on Mondays.
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.300]   Thanks for joining us, Mr. Schwood.
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.300]   Absolutely.
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.300]   Sorry if I'm all bedraggled.
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.300]   It was a 4 AM get up from the airport in Boston and sleep on the plane and land and read the
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.300]   stories and hope you sound like you know what you're talking about kind of day.
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.300]   That's, yeah.
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.300]   I mean, I'm wearing Batsorette beads from last night.
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.300]   I thought that it would just, you know, illustrate a little bit of what I've been through in the last 12 hours.
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.300]   One of the ladies almost lost and I, she's fine.
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.300]   But by the way, I'm not getting married.
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.300]   But, you know, I just thought that they were kind of fun.
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.300]   So Brian, I'm kind of probably on your level.
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.300]   See, this is what, this is what's great.
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.300]   Between you and me and Martin, we form like one brain and then the whole rest of the show will be covered by Tim.
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.300]   That's right.
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.300]   Tim Stevens, features editor over at CNET.
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.300]   I'm not sure at all.
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.300]   Who's going to try to, you know, sort of bring an adult spin on some of these stories.
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.300]   Somebody who really actually does his research and is writing the stories that we then are reading.
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.300]   Hey, Tim, how are you?
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.300]   I'm a great story.
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.300]   How are you? Thank you for having me.
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.300]   Well, thanks for being here, of course.
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:24.300]   Martin, before we, before we get into some of the stories, I mean, a lot of people on Twitch know exactly who you are.
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.300]   You and I go way back with Leo, the tech TV days, but what do you do these days?
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.300]   I give a lot.
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.300]   Actually, I'm in the advertising business.
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.300]   I currently been working for an agency.
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.300]   I've been doing a lot of work for, you know, Corning, actually.
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.300]   Gorilla Glass is one of my clients right now.
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.300]   All right.
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.300]   And fantastic.
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.300]   Been doing a lot of really cool ads for them.
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.300]   They're actually going to come out this week.
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.300]   So, I want everyone out there to go watch these things.
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.300]   I think you're really going to like them.
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.300]   They're a lot of fun.
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.300]   I think actually one of them has been floated out.
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.300]   If you were to do a YouTube search on Brokeface, Brokeface, I think that you would find it.
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.300]   Do they, do they like monitor like Twitter hashtags?
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.300]   Like, should everybody right now just start tweeting like, "Wow, does this ad ever really make me like that?"
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.300]   That would make me so happy.
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.300]   That would be the best thing in the world.
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.300]   If everyone did that.
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.300]   Let's just start buzzing.
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.300]   Even if you didn't watch the ads.
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.300]   It's the greatest thing you've seen since "Where's the Beef?"
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.300]   That would be fantastic.
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.300]   Yeah, no, check it out.
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.300]   And definitely stay tuned for this week because these other ads are going to come out.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.300]   And I'm really excited about those.
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.300]   Well, excellent.
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.300]   Gorilla Glass, that's, you know, I like it.
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.300]   It's nice not to have a scratched up face.
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.300]   Although, you know, my iPhone 5 is pretty darn scratched up.
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:47.300]   I guess we should probably start the show talking about who of us has ordered their new 5S,
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.300]   5C, anything.
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.300]   I'll start.
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:58.300]   I ordered a 5S on, well, I stayed up late Thursday night, 1201 Pacific time Friday morning,
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.300]   which is basically Thursday night.
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.300]   The Apple store was supposed to open up and allow me to buy the 5S.
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.300]   It took till about 1204.
[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.300]   I refreshed 400 times in those three days.
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.300]   I had 100 times in those three minutes.
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.300]   Then I get through all the whole thing.
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.300]   I say, "64 gigs.
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.300]   I want the gold.
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.300]   I'm on Verizon.
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.300]   We're all good."
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.300]   Yep, our data plan is, I'm like, "Wait a second.
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.300]   I have an unlimited data plan and I don't have that option.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.300]   What the heck?"
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.300]   I go to Twitter and I say, "What am I missing?
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.300]   Am I just tired?
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.300]   What's happening?"
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.300]   And everyone says, "I can't do that anymore.
[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.300]   That's the end of that."
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.300]   And I thought, "Well, that's ridiculous.
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.300]   I mean, what are you telling me?
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.300]   I'm not going to get a new phone because I can't keep my limited plan.
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.300]   Here's what you do."
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:47.300]   You go to Verizon.com, you log in, you basically go through the exact same process, and then
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.300]   Verizon will try to trick you into saying, "Oh, yes.
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.300]   I'd like the 10 gigabyte per month for like 80 bucks or something.
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:01.300]   Some stupid, ridiculous, so I'll pay 175 bucks a month type of a thing where it's like,
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.300]   "What?
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.300]   I pay $85 for unlimited data right now."
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:09.300]   And then you say a bunch of "nose" and "yeses" and finally it'll say, "All right.
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.300]   You want your unlimited plan?
[00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.300]   Fine.
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.300]   All right.
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.300]   Do that."
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.300]   But you have no option to do that if you're a Verizon customer through apple.com store.
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:25.300]   So by the time I figured that out, the freaking 5S Gold 64 gig was like delayed two weeks.
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.300]   It happened really quick.
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.300]   Did you still go for the gold?
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.300]   Yeah.
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.300]   Yeah, I just had to pay $900 for it.
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.300]   Did you really want that?
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.300]   Did you even really want that to get you at all?
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.300]   Or would any of you guys who bought this thing, if you weren't in this industry and it was
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.300]   incumbent upon you for your jobs, would you have upgraded this phone?
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.300]   That's a good question.
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:48.300]   I mean, it's impossible for me to know because I do need this for my job and Leo's paying
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.300]   me that $900 back.
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.300]   But...
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.300]   I want every single iPhone.
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.300]   Every single iPhone I bought on release day until this cycle.
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.300]   This will be the very first time that I don't upgrade day one.
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.300]   It may not upgrade at all.
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.300]   And I'm really surprised.
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.300]   I was trying to figure out why.
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:11.300]   And it hit me that every single iPhone up until this has had a major new aspect to it that
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.300]   I was really excited about.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.300]   And for example, going to 4, you had the Retina display, which was huge.
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.300]   4S, it was fast, fast enough to add Siri.
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:24.300]   Going to the 5, of course, you got the bigger display in True 16 by 9.
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:31.300]   But then this, it's like, this vague promises of faster and slightly better photography.
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.300]   Like, I can't point to anything that I'm jazzed about.
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:39.300]   And especially, like, whatever excitement I had kind of got killed when iOS 7 came out
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.300]   and all of a sudden my phone felt shiny and new.
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.300]   And so, I can't believe it.
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.300]   But this is the first time I'm going to sit one out.
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:49.300]   Tim, where do you stand on this whole situation?
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:54.300]   I was lucky enough to have a loaner device from Apple here, so I actually didn't need to pre-order.
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.300]   Wow, fantastic.
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.300]   So I have one here which is great.
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.300]   I think probably the biggest thing to get excited about here is the fingerprint scanner,
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.300]   which for a lot of people really isn't anything to get that excited about.
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:07.300]   I use a pin on my phone and it's very, very, very annoying to have to type that in every time I turn the thing on.
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.300]   It's also very annoying to type in your password whenever you buy anything through iTunes.
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.300]   So not having to do those things is definitely a nice step forward.
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.300]   But yeah, I think the performance improvements that we're looking to see in the new CPU,
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.300]   we won't really see until a little bit down the road when developers kind of get their head around the thing.
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:28.300]   You know, no bigger storage, gold is nice, but there aren't really that many people who are going to go out and buy a new phone
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.300]   just to get gold.
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.300]   There's definitely a bit of a blaze in the market right now.
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:37.300]   I do think it is a nice step forward, but I can definitely see why some people are kind of sitting this one out as it were.
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.300]   But you know, you keep hearing that and then gold is totally hard to come by.
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:47.300]   So either Apple deliberately kept it in short supply at stores to make it seem like it was selling like hotcakes,
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.300]   which of course is a tactic that's done by lots of companies.
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.300]   Or really everyone underestimated how much everybody wanted to say,
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.300]   "I clearly have a new phone because it's champagne going."
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.300]   No, it's so...
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.300]   That's why people want to get it.
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.300]   And that's the only reason.
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:06.300]   In fact, did you guys watch, there was this video, this is on the kind of like short documentary some guy made
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.300]   about the folks standing in line at the New York show.
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:17.300]   I mean, these are the real fanboys, the guys that are standing in line for two weeks to get this gold phone.
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.300]   Nobody was in line for two weeks.
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.300]   Oh, yeah, they were.
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.300]   Okay, no, the first guy on there.
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.300]   Yeah, he said, you know, there's one guy.
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.300]   There's one guy.
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.300]   Okay, one guy.
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.300]   Two weeks.
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.300]   You know, they sell off their spot.
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.300]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:34.300]   Anyway, the first thing these filmmakers asked these guys, they held up a sign, they said, "Why?"
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:41.300]   And now one of them could give a cogent answer as to why they were standing in line, not just standing in line,
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.300]   but upgrading this phone.
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.300]   But you know what, I don't...
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:49.300]   Other than I'm excited about that, there's something about the culture of standing in line for something and being
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.300]   excited with everyone out.
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:56.300]   I mean, getting the first iPhone and standing in line was one of the most fun, exciting experiences I've had.
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:00.300]   And you do enter this kind of like group think mentality and get excited about it.
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.300]   So it's like, I don't want to harp on them for that.
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:06.300]   But I do think it's interesting, like every single time they've done an upgrade and done a release,
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.300]   they've released pre-order information.
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:15.300]   I think all the way since the 3GS, this is the first time that they haven't announced how many pre-orders that they took for the 5C.
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.300]   Did you guys hear about that?
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.300]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.300]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.300]   Go ahead, Tim.
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:25.300]   I think it's great that they finally are going to stop doing this because ultimately, you know, they're setting the bar for themselves
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.300]   higher each time.
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.300]   At some point, they weren't going to get over that bar and ultimately, you know, that's...
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:34.300]   investors, you know, seem to be taking any opportunity that they can to knock Apple.
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:37.300]   And of course, not beating your own numbers from before is one good way to do it.
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.300]   But of course, this time they had two new phones that are launching.
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.300]   So in a lot of ways, they're kind of splitting their excitement across these two devices.
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:47.300]   So you can almost expect those numbers to go down, but you know, we don't see numbers from Microsoft,
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.300]   we don't see numbers from Amazon.
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.300]   So I think it makes sense for Apple to kind of step away from this.
[00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:55.300]   And I would be surprised if we see them stepping back into it again, going forward.
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.300]   But I wanted to talk about the line-waiter thing.
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:03.300]   You know, that guy stood in line for a long time to be first at the New York line.
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.300]   He wanted a gold iPhone.
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.300]   He showed up front and they said they don't have any gold iPhones at the store.
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:12.300]   He was the number one in line and was told that they didn't have any gold iPhones.
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.300]   Could they tell him that two weeks before he got in line?
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:19.300]   Just so you know, this is all for now.
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.300]   We don't even have what you're waiting here for.
[00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.300]   Yeah, it's just sort of a cruel joke.
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:29.300]   But you know, that definitely points to the sort of shortages that Apple had for their gold phones.
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.300]   There's speculation maybe they shipped a lot of them overseas,
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.300]   where the expectation is that gold will be a lot more popular than here in the US.
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.300]   Certainly they didn't have a lot of gold to go around.
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:42.300]   And I was there at the New York store that morning and it was pretty crazy.
[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:46.300]   I think it's the most people they've had waiting in line in the history of iPhone launches.
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.300]   So, you know, that's definitely a good sign for Apple anyway.
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:55.300]   Do we think that we're going to hear a here are the combined sales between the 5C
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.300]   and then the opening weekend for the 5S come tomorrow morning?
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:05.300]   Because historically Apple releases something like this in a press release Monday after the iPhone to say,
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.300]   "Best selling iPhone yet."
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.300]   Again, like you mentioned, Brian, we never got that for the 5C.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:14.300]   But around this time last year when we got the iPad 4th gen and then the iPad mini,
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:19.300]   Apple did the same thing, where they didn't really tell us how well the mini specifically did.
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:25.300]   But they said, "Combined, our new iPad lineup has these really, really impressive numbers."
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:30.300]   And this way, even if the 5C was a joke, which I'm sure it's sold perfectly fine,
[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:36.300]   but it seems like the 5S is going to have some really strong numbers combined, it's going to look great.
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.300]   Well, first of all, yes, I can totally see them do that.
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:47.300]   But I'd love to pick Tim's brain on this is to me, I don't understand why they decided to go with this 5C.
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.300]   I mean, I guess I understand why.
[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:54.300]   Why didn't they just keep the original 5 available if that's what they wanted to do or keep previous generations available?
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:14:01.300]   But instead what they did was they positioned it as a cheaper version of it and it looks cheap.
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:05.300]   And they even, they even, what do they say, unapologetically plastic.
[00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:09.300]   I understand the desire to do this.
[00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:15.300]   Whenever a brand establishes dominance as a high end brand, for example, we'll say Cadillac.
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:20.300]   Cadillac for almost 100 years was synonymous with you have to be rich in order to buy a Cadillac.
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:28.300]   And then at some point you top out on your market and you start to get really tempted to cash in your brand to cheaper levels.
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:36.300]   So they started making cheap Cadillacs to where now it's like Cadillac doesn't mean anything because anyone can afford a Cadillac and all of a sudden they're not special anymore.
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.300]   In this case, it seems like the 5C is lose, lose.
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.300]   It's not significantly better than the 5.
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:50.300]   It looks different from it and it's it's it looks like a play school toy and it's allegedly cheap, but it's not even that cheap.
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.300]   Because when you buy it subsidizes $99 in which case you end up spending almost $1,000 for it.
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:59.300]   Anyway, it's as though they they did nothing but cash in their brand value.
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:05.300]   They reduced the image of the iPhone and it looks to me like they got nothing out of it except for a short term payday.
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.300]   I'm kind of pissed about it.
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.300]   Keep in mind that Apple never said this was a cheap phone.
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:13.300]   In fact, Apple has been very pointedly saying that we never tried to make a cheap phone.
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.300]   This is just a different iPhone.
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:18.300]   So the whole idea of a cheap iPhone was something that that ultimately was created by the media.
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:22.300]   Something that we were all expecting to see and something that Apple ultimately didn't deliver.
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.300]   Whether that's good or bad, you know, some people are optimistic about the phone.
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:29.300]   Some people, you're obviously a little bit more pessimistic about it and I can totally understand that.
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.300]   I mean, as far as I'm concerned, this is definitely just a margins game.
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:37.300]   The iPhone 5 in its original configuration was now that cheap device to manufacture.
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:44.300]   It's a very complicated chassis with custom pieces of glass that we sold it in to fit in the back and the chamfer edges and all that stuff.
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:49.300]   I mean, it looks really nice, but if you're talking about trying to get your margins up, that's a very difficult thing to do.
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:56.300]   Molding a piece of polycarbonate and drilling some holes in the bottom is a much easier thing to do if you're wanting to, you know, simplify the manufacturing process.
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.300]   In theory, this is a device that they could get cheaper down the road if they want to, and maybe that's the way that they want to go.
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:05.300]   But it's also a good way for them to differentiate last year's model, which is ultimately what the 5C is.
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:14.300]   From this year's model even further, you know, I think that adding gold helps out in that regard, but it's even better to basically discontinue the old one and make it look radically different.
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:19.300]   And that could be a point to them going forward and having very different looking models each year.
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:28.300]   Some people were a bit disappointed by the evolution of phones looking exactly like the non-S versions, and people of course always want to show off that they have the latest and greatest device.
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:32.300]   And if your phone looks exactly like last year's phone, then that's not a good way to do that.
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:42.300]   So perhaps this is a pointer to Apple moving forward, having more drastic revisions each year, and they basically kind of pushed the 5 out of the market to kind of jumpstart that trend going forward.
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.300]   There's a lot of different reasons that they could go forward.
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.300]   I think ultimately you should check out the 5C.
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:51.300]   It does feel nicer than you might think it does despite being plastic.
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:54.300]   But ultimately it is a cheaper looking and a cheaper feeling phone than the 5.
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.300]   It just doesn't quite have that level of engineering in it.
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.300]   And so that's why you have to look back at the margins.
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.300]   I think ultimately that's probably why they're doing it.
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.300]   It looks like a Lumia, doesn't it?
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.300]   Yeah, it does.
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.300]   Yeah, it looks like a cheap Windows phone.
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.300]   Okay, so I guess he was a close chat.
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:12.300]   Very nice.
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.300]   I think the Lumia phones feel very nice for being polycarbonate.
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.300]   And I think that the 5C feels very nice for being polycarbonate too.
[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:23.300]   I did kind of chuckle a bit at the unapologetically plastic line from Johnny I, that was a bit silly in my eye.
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.300]   But I think it is a nice feeling phone in the hand.
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.300]   I'm curious though, how is going to weather?
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:31.300]   I mean, we saw of course the black iPhone 5 get scratched up really easily.
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:36.300]   Polycarbonate of course has a well-earned reputation for being easy to scratch.
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:39.300]   This is a clear-coded device, so maybe that'll add some durability.
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.300]   But I'm curious what this is going to look like after a couple of months of being thrown in your pocket with your keys.
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:47.300]   Is it going to kind of get a nice patina to it or is it just going to look scratched up and cheap and ugly?
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:53.300]   Yeah, well, I mean this iPhone 5 I've had for less than a year and I've never had a case on it.
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.300]   And it is extremely scratched up.
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.300]   And I don't even, it's not like I'm doing anything on purpose.
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:02.300]   It's just in my purse with my keys and maybe some crumbs.
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:06.300]   It's never in your purse, it's constantly sitting at dinner.
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.300]   When I am...
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.300]   Sarah Lane's across the dinner too.
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:10.300]   Come on.
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.300]   It's 2013.
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.300]   I'm supposed to look you in your eyes.
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.300]   She may be a sandwich when she's texting too.
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.300]   Yeah, she does.
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.300]   That's her ringtone.
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:25.300]   So, so did, okay, so Tim has it.
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:30.300]   What, to the point I was asking earlier, is there a single thing that you would show off?
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.300]   Like if we were at a bar and I was like, all right, prove to me, make me want the 5S.
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:38.300]   Well, yeah, I guess besides the fingerprint sensor, which is just kind of cool because it's new,
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.300]   what else is so great about it?
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:44.300]   But also they did kind of a clever trick with iOS 7 where they just made it part of the setup.
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:48.300]   They're like, and now you have to pick a pin unless you think to do the little dismiss thing.
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.300]   And so now I've never used a pin for like four and a half years.
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.300]   And then now they're, they're, they're kind of tricked me into doing it.
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:58.300]   And so now I, it's like they created this inconvenience and yes, there's added security.
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:02.300]   But now I could see wanting a fingerprint scanner.
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:06.300]   Yeah, the police departments are trying to get everyone to do just that.
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.300]   That's what you had to do, Brian, right?
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.300]   Because, you know, it does increase security.
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.300]   And it's a huge problem right now here in San Francisco.
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:14.300]   It's a massive problem.
[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:18.300]   People getting their phones stolen all the time because they're like Sarah Layton.
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.300]   They're walking down the street and they can't put the phone in the purse.
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.300]   I can outrun them.
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.300]   They sneak up from behind.
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.300]   They push you.
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.300]   They clog you to back.
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.300]   It's a legitimate problem.
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:31.300]   And you drop the phone and you fall on the sidewalk and grab the phone and run away.
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.300]   I mean, it happens daily.
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.300]   Absolutely.
[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:35.300]   That's exactly how it happens.
[00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.300]   I used to do it.
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:45.300]   But Tim, I mean, what is, what, what do you think are the standouts?
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.300]   Yeah, Brian's absolutely right.
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:51.300]   Beyond fingerprint scanning, there's nothing really that makes you think, oh my God, I have to have this phone.
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.300]   It's a combination of a lot of smaller features that may or may not be appealing to you.
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:58.300]   I mean, having dual LED flashes that can adjust color temperature is pretty interesting.
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:02.300]   But ultimately, how often do you actually use flash for a smartphone camera photography?
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:06.300]   If anything, we've all been trained to never take a picture with a flash with your phone
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.300]   because ultimately it's just going to be a terrible picture.
[00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.300]   Maybe we can relearn that.
[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:15.300]   Better photography is nice, but again, it's not really night and day better than the iPhone 5 and my experience.
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:22.300]   Yet, and again, it's really, I think the CPU that has the most potential for greater delivery down the road,
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.300]   but of course, all the apps that exist now have been written for the older CPU.
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.300]   Well, it's easy to port them up to the new 64-bit chip.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:32.300]   Ultimately, there aren't going to be any gains until we see new development going forward
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:38.300]   to make use of all the new registers and the increased pipeline and all that other good stuff that it brings along with it.
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.300]   So I think that we'll see some great games going forward and a lot of cool stuff.
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.300]   But again, it's not something that's out there right now unless you're really, really hard to play the new Infinity game.
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:49.300]   And all this glory, then again, it's not a really huge strong selling point right now.
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.300]   But the fingerprint scanner is legitimately good.
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:58.300]   I mean, I use a note too, and I have a pin on there, and it feels archaic now for me to have to type my pin in all the time on that thing,
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.300]   versus just scanning my finger.
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:06.300]   Can you use your fingerprint to buy apps in the App Store, or is it just to unlock your phone?
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:10.300]   See that to me is worth $900 right there.
[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.300]   It is pretty huge.
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:16.300]   For me anyway, it's going to be extended across other services and other platforms as well.
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:21.300]   I mean, I hope that Apple opens that up so that other applications can kind of tie into that, and I think they probably will.
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:30.300]   And I also hope that we start to see these on MacBooks and not too distant future because presumably, we saw glass track pads not too long after the iPhone came out.
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.300]   Presumably they could take this tech and pop it onto MacBook without too much trouble.
[00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.300]   And you can sign into your laptop with your fingerprint too.
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:41.300]   That to me is also quite exciting, and so we can also see some cross-pollination in that regard.
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:48.300]   All right, well, I do want to talk a little bit more about what you brought up, Martin, about safety and the story about New York City.
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:55.300]   But before we do that, we should take a moment to think Stamps.com for sponsoring this episode of this week in tech.
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:22:00.300]   If you're not familiar with Stamps.com, you probably have a guess as to what the business model is.
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:05.300]   You buy in your print official US postage using your own computer, your own printer.
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.300]   It's very convenient. Who wants to go buy Stamps anymore?
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:14.300]   Stamps.com will send you a digital scale and will automatically calculate exact postage.
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:20.300]   For any letter, you sometimes letters, you put a bunch of stuff in there and all of a sudden you need two stamps, and then it gets returned.
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:29.300]   And, oh, who needs it? Any package, any class of mail, you never have to waste time going to the post office because sometimes there's something about the post office where it's like, people just wait for it.
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:32.300]   It's like, people just do not want to be in a rush there.
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:38.300]   And the way that Murphy's law works is if you're in a rush, you will be 10 people back at the post office.
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:43.300]   And you don't want to waste money with some expensive postage meter type of thing.
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.300]   You just want to use Stamps.com and keep it simple for yourself.
[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.300]   For example, if you're a small business, you got to send Stamps out.
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.300]   You want a nice professional look.
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:55.300]   You don't have to hand write addresses onto letters and packages with Stamps.com.
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:23:01.300]   You can print your own barcoded postage, return and delivery addresses, all professionally done.
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:04.300]   You don't have to get it sent out and then buy all the stuff in bulk.
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:13.300]   You can do it directly onto the envelope, makes everything you do and send out using the Post-World Service look as professional as possible.
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:21.300]   Now, there's a special offer for anybody who's interested and who likes and watches and listens to Twitch.
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:32.300]   If you use the promo code TWRT, you get a no risk trial plus you get a 110 bonus offer, which includes a digital scale,
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:36.300]   and up to $55 of free postage.
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.300]   Think about everything you can do at the post office.
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:43.300]   Plus a lot of things you can't do at the post office because think about it.
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.300]   Post offices have really annoying times.
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.300]   You want to go there at seven?
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.300]   Well, they say no.
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:53.300]   Stamps.com is never going to close, so you can buy postage, print it 24/7.
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:57.300]   You can import addresses from all of your address books across many of your computers.
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:02.300]   You can use cost codes to track postage spending by specific customers.
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:07.300]   Again, if you're that small business that really comes in handy, automatic address verification.
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:11.300]   Stamps.com will even offer postage discounts that the post office never offers.
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:17.300]   You can get discounted package insurance in just one click and then you don't have to hand write stuff.
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.300]   You can't stand a hand write an envelope anymore.
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.300]   Go to stamps.com right now.
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:27.300]   Before you do anything else, click on the microphone at the top of the homepage and type in TWIT.
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:34.300]   Again, you get that $55 free postage, which includes a digital scale to 110 bonus offer.
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:41.300]   That's stamps.com and enter T-W-I-T to take advantage of our special today.
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.300]   Thanks to stamps.com for sponsoring this episode of TWIT.
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:51.300]   So, to summarize, basically standing in line at the post office is about as ridiculous as standing in line at the Apple Store.
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:53.300]   Don't do it.
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:58.300]   If only I could print out my own iPhone at home, I'd really be in business.
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.300]   With 3D printing, how far away are we really?
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.300]   You get a marry through the post office.
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.300]   You get what?
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.300]   You get a meld to you so you don't have to wait in line.
[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.300]   Exactly. That's true.
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:13.300]   You mentioned that it's an issue.
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:21.300]   But iPhones have a particularly bad reputation because they don't want to take your identity.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.300]   They want nothing to do with your iPhone.
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.300]   They just want the hardware and then they wipe it and then they sell it on the black market.
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:32.300]   What's interesting is not only with the fingerprint sensor, hopefully unless somebody steals your hand.
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:37.300]   It's not really working unless it's attached to you.
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.300]   But in general, it's harder to get in.
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:48.300]   But also, there's a new feature so that if your phone gets stolen and you've got find my iPhone turned on,
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:55.300]   if I've got find my iPhone turned on and I leave it here and I look it up from my MacBook or iPad letter, I see that it's here.
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:26:04.300]   Well, in the past, a thief turns that off and then you're screwed.
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:10.300]   But now the thief will need to enter a passcode or some other way to get in.
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:15.300]   And if they don't have that information, they still steal your phone, but it's much easier to check them down.
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:20.300]   Of course, the New York Police Department has started this, I don't know, I guess a citywide, a boroughwide PSA saying this is why you should update to iOS 7.
[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:26.300]   Because this is a great feature that's part of iOS 7. Still means someone's going to have to go after a thief and it shouldn't be you.
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:33.300]   But it does make sense for law enforcement to at least have some more control over where all these phones are going.
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:39.300]   Yeah, absolutely. It makes sense for law enforcement to actually make sense for people who actually use these things to do this.
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:40.300]   Exactly.
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:45.300]   This happens to them. Well, hopefully this will be enough of a deterrent now that it'll take a little bit of time,
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:53.300]   but people will stop clocking people in the back of the head so they drop their phone and they can snatch it because it'll be useless to them, presumably.
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:59.300]   Tim, have you ever had an issue with anybody taking your phone or having to look it up on my iPhone?
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:03.300]   Or is this just sort of seemed like good safety precaution in general?
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.300]   I'm happy to say no one has ever hit me over the back of the head and stole my phone.
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.300]   I have lost my phone though.
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:11.300]   And so being able to track it down, that sort of thing, I think is definitely a great feature.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:15.300]   And something that everybody should be doing and ultimately it's something that not everybody knows they can do.
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:20.300]   So it is part of the iOS 7 setup now to have these extra security precautions enabled.
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:23.300]   I think it's really nice for the police, honestly, to be doing these sorts of things.
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:34.300]   And like I said, yeah, I think hopefully down the road, this will sort of change the perception of stealing someone's phone because now it's basically like stealing a tracking device that will help send the police right to your house potentially.
[00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.300]   And yeah, who knows?
[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:38.300]   Maybe people will stop hitting people over the back of the head.
[00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:45.300]   Well, and keep in mind also that iPhones have the same thing that we like about them as a consumer device is a liability.
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:50.300]   It has a very characteristic look and thieves know that they'll have a high resale value immediately.
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:28:04.300]   But if people are saying like, "Oh, government wants to get in your passwords, that's why they want you to upgrade to iOS 7" or whatever, no, these people are just as lazy as you are and they would like it to make it easier to catch the bad guys.
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:18.300]   But think about it this way, it's almost as though they're reminding you to get your shots, to get your immunizations because if enough people upgrade iOS 7 and take advantage of the security features, all of a sudden the iPhone ceases to be such a tasty treat for the criminals.
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:26.300]   And even if you don't upgrade, you might benefit from kind of a herd immunity where all of a sudden the iPhone is just too much trouble theoretically.
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.300]   I'm sure that's where they're headed and obviously we're not there now.
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:37.300]   But I actually applaud them going forward. In fact, my co-host on NSFW, Justin Robert Young, was robbed at gunpoint.
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:44.300]   He was actually carrying two $300 Bluetooth speakers in his hands on the phone.
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:54.300]   So he had like $600 in speakers and a phone up to his ear. Guy pulls a gun on him and he's like, "Oh, so obviously you want these speakers?"
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:59.300]   And the guy said, "No, man, just the phone." And he's like, "Are you sure they're really nice speakers?" He's like, "No, I just want the phone."
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:09.300]   And they ran off with them. So again, it's like the iPhone has a reputation of being fast and easy to turn around and anything they can do to stop that I think would be a benefit to all consumers.
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:22.300]   Yeah, you know, Brian, that's an interesting analogy you make to the government trying to get you to get immunizations than the government trying to get you to upgrade this phone because people are paranoid about both things.
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:32.300]   I mean, sort of for different reasons, but you know, yes, guy like Alex Jones, he's probably going to be against both of these things because there is this conspiracy theory out there.
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:38.300]   A lot of people think this, that fingerprint scanner, this is a way for the government to get your fingerprints.
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:45.300]   You no longer have to be arrested for them to harvest your fingerprints. Yeah. Does anyone feel this way?
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.300]   The chat is alive.
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:54.300]   Yes, of course. The chat is bubbling up with people saying like, "How long do we hear about someone cutting off a finger to use it to deactivate a phone or whatever?"
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:30:08.300]   It's like, I don't think that people are going to do that. If they're stealing a phone for, you know, whatever, the $200 they can get for it, my guess is there's a big difference between like a petty theft and a, you know, attempted manslaughter or whatever.
[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:20.300]   Apparently too, this has been thought about and for reasons that now are escaping me, that blood has to be flowing to the fingerprint or it's not going to work.
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:25.300]   Tim, you probably not so ready limbs to try this out for yourself, but one has to assume.
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:35.300]   That's not true actually. A club has managed to make a 3D print of a finger from a cat's fingerprint basically and unlock a phone that way, which is a pretty typical way of getting past fingerprint sensors.
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:42.300]   But ultimately, you know, you think of the level of effort to take someone's fingerprint and to capture it and then to have the means actually do a 3D printing.
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:50.300]   Already, that's the barrier of entry of reselling this thing way beyond the point of like Brian's point, you know, getting your $200 back. It's just not worth it at that point.
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:55.300]   So even if that is theoretically possible, in no way does that compromise or reduce the value of the security.
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:59.300]   Boy, the more I hear about 3D printing, the more it just terrifies me.
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:00.300]   You're fascinating.
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.300]   I mean, it's a great, great thing.
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.300]   That's my mind.
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.300]   Printing guns, printing fingers. I don't know.
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.300]   This is where we headed.
[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:10.300]   That seems like a hoax. How do they do that?
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.300]   Well, it's not a hoax. It's a real thing.
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:14.300]   I know it's not a hoax, but it's hard to believe.
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:15.300]   It's hard to wrap your head around.
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.300]   I don't want it to exist.
[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.300]   Some of the possibilities I know.
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:22.300]   The chaos computer club, CCC.de, they've been talking about it in chat currently.
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:26.300]   It's an all technique that I mean they used to use it in the old line scanning fingerprint sensors.
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:29.300]   They had to run your finger over, which actually have a 9-line Lenovo laptop.
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:33.300]   You worked in those and it still works for the new devices too.
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:37.300]   Well, on a lighter note, are we all following Tim Cook on Twitter?
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.300]   Apple CEO Tim Cook joined Twitter a couple days ago.
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:44.300]   He currently stands at 214,925 followers.
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:50.300]   That's up from, you know, 93, 3 days ago, the last time I checked.
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.300]   He has tweeted exactly once.
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.300]   His tweet was, "visited retail stores in Palo Alto today."
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:59.300]   Seeing so many happy customers reminds us of why we do what we do.
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:09.300]   Then 20 years ago, he retweeted Conan O'Brien, who said, "Iowa 7, more like iOS Heaven, #applepleaseendmaniped."
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:13.300]   Oh, the long national nightmare is truly over.
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:16.300]   Finally, we know what Tim Cook is going to do.
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:17.300]   Seriously.
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.300]   Yeah, really.
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.300]   I'm not going to follow Tim Cook and let Tim Cook follows me.
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:24.300]   Well, he's not following me either if it makes you feel any better,
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:28.300]   but it's interesting to look at the 27 accounts he is following.
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:34.300]   You've got the App Store, iTunes, Music, Nike, sits on the board there.
[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.300]   I books.
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:46.300]   But then you've got Conan O'Brien, Bill Clinton, The Pope, Duke basketball, Anderson Cooper,
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:47.300]   Jimmy Fallon.
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.300]   I mean, he likes to laugh.
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:50.300]   This guy loves his late night.
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:55.300]   That would be an interesting dinner party, his people he's following.
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:33:00.300]   Now, at one point, Tim Cook was following the rock band Kings of Leon.
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:01.300]   Oh, no, he still is.
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:06.300]   Kings of Leon is clearly something that Tim Cook likes to listen to, which is just fine.
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:11.300]   It just gives, I don't know if I ever thought of Tim Cook as a Kings of Leon guy.
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:12.300]   Maybe more of a...
[00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:13.300]   Hear that America, stand down.
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:16.300]   Put down your pitch for it 'cause he still likes Kings of Leon.
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.300]   Yeah, Kings of Leon, still cool.
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:19.300]   Tim Cook likes that.
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:25.300]   Check and see if, if Federé G's following Journey on Twitter, I'll let you know.
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:29.300]   Tim Cook of Corsa, Southern, Southern gentleman, went to Duke.
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.300]   Is this a surprise at all?
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.300]   Like, does he have beef with Twitter?
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.300]   Is that why we should be surprised that he finally jumped on?
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:39.300]   I don't think it's a surprise so much as it's just sort of weird in this day and age when
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:45.300]   a very high profile executive at a company like Apple takes so long to tweet something.
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:48.300]   He's had an account, apparently, for a couple of months, but this was his first tweet and
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:53.300]   it was retweeted by Federé G, I think, which, or maybe it was Phil Schiller.
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:56.300]   It was sort of like, okay, obviously, that's really him.
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:01.300]   It was sort of proved as a little bit of verification, but I think that's weird, don't you?
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:03.300]   Yeah, I think it's weird.
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:05.300]   But whatever.
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.300]   Pairs.
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.300]   That's like, I don't care.
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:10.300]   That's about where I stand too.
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.300]   Yeah, no, all right.
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.300]   Should we talk about iOS 7 or are we all done?
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:15.300]   I love it.
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.300]   Are we done with it?
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:17.300]   I really like it.
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:18.300]   I upgraded the thing and I...
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:20.300]   We were talking about that on the right up.
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.300]   Yeah, I mean, I don't really have anything bad to say about it.
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.300]   I don't have any problem with it.
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:25.300]   I don't find it any way offensive.
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.300]   I mean, it's a change.
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:31.300]   I've been staring at the same desktop on my phone for so many years now.
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.300]   Yeah.
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:35.300]   And it's just nice to have this sort of fresh new look on there.
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:39.300]   And so far, I haven't found anything that I really dislike except this.
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:40.300]   Except this.
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:43.300]   This morning, I was woken up and I was like, what is...
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.300]   It was terrifying.
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.300]   What is this noise in my ear?
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:50.300]   Well, apparently when you upgrade, be warned about this.
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.300]   Your ring changes, your alarm changes.
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.300]   Yeah, they've got a whole new set of ringtones.
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:57.300]   It was extremely disconcerting.
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:00.300]   It was this whole new chorus in my ear that I had no idea what was going on.
[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.300]   Do you sleep in your phone up to your ear?
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.300]   No, but it's on the bedstand.
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:04.300]   It's not that far away.
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:05.300]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:08.300]   You know who doesn't like iOS 7?
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:09.300]   The Vorek.
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.300]   Well, probably.
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:15.300]   But you know who's in good company with Vorek is Miley Cyrus.
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:17.300]   She does not like iOS 7.
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.300]   She tweeted about it as well.
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.300]   And we all know that she is quite a trendsetter.
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:28.300]   I think actually just before we started this episode, we have video of Miley Cyrus after she saw...
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:29.300]   In fact, we do.
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:30.300]   Yeah, Chad, you have that?
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:31.300]   Did you hear all that video?
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:32.300]   Oh, poor Miley.
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.300]   No, no.
[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.300]   What is that?
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:35.300]   Miley.
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.300]   What is that?
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.300]   Miley.
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:42.300]   What is that?
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.300]   Well, you're just going to have to get used to it.
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:50.300]   No, I am loving.
[00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:54.300]   I prefer that actually to that video of her swinging on a wrecking ball nude.
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.300]   She's not as bad as I thought.
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.300]   So much better.
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.300]   I know.
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:35:59.300]   She speaks for a nation.
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:06.300]   There was a really funny piece on Buzzfeed about people who were startled by this episode.
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:07.300]   By this upgrade.
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:12.300]   And all of a sudden they looked at their phone and they thought, "Oh my God, my phone is broken.
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.300]   What's going on here?
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:15.300]   Somebody's hacked into my phone.
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:18.300]   There was a great deal of paranoia about this upgrade."
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:21.300]   Because they, unlike us, were paying attention.
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:24.300]   We know very well that this upgrade is coming out.
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:29.300]   Most people, the average American, has no idea that there's going to be a phone upgrade, right?
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:30.300]   I would say that that's true.
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:31.300]   I think that's true.
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:32.300]   Yeah.
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.300]   And when it happens...
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:34.300]   Because why would they care?
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:38.300]   And, you know, why wouldn't you think that there was something maybe broken?
[00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:42.300]   I think you would probably understand soon and wouldn't have to go tweeting about it.
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:46.300]   And of course the ability for Apple to actually push these updates is a fairly new thing.
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:50.300]   So people, you know, this is the first time a lot of people have seen such a radical change go through.
[00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:54.300]   It might have been nice for Apple to do a push notification the day before.
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:59.300]   Like, "Hey, guys, you know, your phone's going to look a little bit different tomorrow and you're not getting hacked honestly."
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:03.300]   I mean, that's the kind of thing that you would expect, you know, from a financial institution or that kind of thing.
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.300]   And something radical is changing.
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:06.300]   That might not have been a bad idea.
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:09.300]   I do want to ask if anybody's noticed any battery life issues.
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.300]   I've heard a lot of complaints.
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:11.300]   I haven't seen anything myself.
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:14.300]   But I certainly heard a lot of people talking anecdotally about it anyway.
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:16.300]   I have heard exactly that.
[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:21.300]   I've heard stories of someone being at 70% and two minutes later, their battery's dead.
[00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.300]   Now, I don't know.
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:27.300]   This is a little early to say this, but I think my battery life is better.
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:28.300]   Oh, I hope that's true.
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:32.300]   I mean, I got out of my car fully charged.
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.300]   And well, I really haven't been using my phone.
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.300]   But I mean, it hasn't moved at all.
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:41.300]   It seems to be holding a charge longer in the day than before.
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:45.300]   Maybe I'm just Snapchatting less since iOS 7 came about.
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:48.300]   I have not noticed any difference in battery life.
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:54.300]   The only thing I've noticed is I guess does it, when you have groups of icons here, I'm going to put mine on camera here.
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:58.300]   When you have groups of icons, like, how does it determine the color for the background?
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.300]   Does it take that from the background?
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.300]   Because it makes it really hard.
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:07.300]   Well, it's just everything's gray on mine now because the grouped apps.
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:08.300]   Oh, the folders.
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:09.300]   Yeah, the folders.
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:10.300]   Sorry.
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:12.300]   Some of us don't host i5 for the iPhone.
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.300]   Yeah, well, they're called folders, Brian.
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:15.300]   OK, thanks.
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.300]   But there's no way to change that.
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:21.300]   That's what bums me out is I used to really like my background and now I don't.
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.300]   Tom, Tom Merritt on TNT said the same thing.
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.300]   We were all sort of saying, "OK, iOS 7 first thoughts."
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.300]   And he goes, "I really hate these gray folders.
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:35.300]   I think it has a lot to do with what your background is behind that gray folder because my background is sort of a--"
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:36.300]   I don't know if you can see it.
[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:37.300]   You can kind of see it.
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:41.300]   It's a gray, darkish-themed photo of my cat Sam.
[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:45.300]   And I actually think it works pretty well with the gray folders.
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:48.300]   I mean, they stand out, but they're not crazy.
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:52.300]   But I, as Ak-Tarr and I, were comparing folders on our iPads.
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:57.300]   And he had kind of this nice background that he had put-- it was sort of a snowy, mountain-scape type thing.
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:02.300]   And the folders were more annoying, I thought, because there was more of a contrast.
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:08.300]   But yeah, I guess it would be nice to be able to customize the color of your folders, but Apple doesn't like you to have too much control.
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:12.300]   Yeah, people in the chat are agreeing that now my background looks terrible.
[00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:15.300]   Thanks. Thanks, Obama. I mean, Apple.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.300]   Obama.
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:17.300]   Yeah.
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:19.300]   That's Obama for you.
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:26.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.300]   But I was expecting, because I saw so many photos and mock-ups of what iOS 7 looked like.
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:33.300]   And I didn't have a review unit until I chose not to download the beta, because I thought, "Yeah, it'll be buggy, and who needs it?
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.300]   I'll just wait till-- I'll wait till it's actually released to the public."
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:43.300]   I thought that the color scheme was just going to throw me off, and I was going to think the whole thing was ugly, and it doesn't bother me.
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.300]   A tick.
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:45.300]   Quite pleasing.
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:46.300]   Quite pleasing to the eye.
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.300]   I find it pleasing as well, but I know not everybody feels it.
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:54.300]   Do you find that you get used to it quickly, or do you still think it's sort of neon and awful?
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:56.300]   The more I use it, the more I get used to it.
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:06.300]   But it is rather bright, and it is rather vibrant, and especially if you have kind of a muted or a simple background that doesn't match the colors of the foreground, obviously, at that point,
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:08.300]   things are going to be even more care-ish.
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:12.300]   I'm still not a fan of the icons, but ultimately, overall, it's still a huge step forward.
[00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:17.300]   I think it does look a lot more mature and a lot more simple and a lot more sophisticated than the last version of iOS, for sure.
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:26.300]   But I do wish you had some color customization options to be able to choose from templates or choose some colors for menus and colors for backgrounds and folders and that kind of thing.
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:33.300]   I think that would appease a lot of folks, and ultimately, it's the kind of thing that you can do in OS X and obviously in Windows, you can do it too.
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:35.300]   So why not in iOS?
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:38.300]   In terms of usability, you think it's an improvement.
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:46.300]   That just looks -- you're right, the icons are a little garish, but you tap, you swipe, you swish something, fun's bound to happen.
[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:48.300]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:50.300]   Seriously.
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.300]   I'm going to open up a menu as well.
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:41:01.300]   Leo has been a very vocal opposition to the swiping and the swishing.
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:07.300]   He says it makes him feel like he's on a boat and he's out on the open seas and he's sick.
[00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:08.300]   He's a drug.
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.300]   Get that mason dragon, I mean.
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.300]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:18.300]   I'll tell you what, I would have -- I would upgrade to OS 7 just for the -- whatever this thing is.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:19.300]   What's I find?
[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:20.300]   What's it called?
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:21.300]   Great question.
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:22.300]   Control center now.
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:24.300]   Control center.
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.300]   There we go.
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:30.300]   The control center and the fact that they finally, you know, they built in a flashlight on there, super valuable and the brightness you can fix.
[00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:31.300]   It is great.
[00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:32.300]   It is super easy.
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:38.300]   I use -- all of that has been astonishingly intuitive and the fact that you're only one swipe away from going into airplane mode or whatever.
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.300]   I love the hell out of it.
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.300]   I think it's -- that part's really good.
[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:46.300]   Everything else is just difficult to just find -- just -- everything's just a little bit different.
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:53.300]   There's a couple of times, especially on maps, where you have to go through a couple of extra clicks or swipes and -- and nothing's where you left it.
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:55.300]   But, I mean, that's just maybe an old man.
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:56.300]   So, again, who cares?
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.300]   Brian, how'd you do that?
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:41:59.300]   Yeah, see, okay.
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:05.300]   No, this is -- this is actually -- the point I'm about to make is that you have to -- you have to, like, aggressively swipe up.
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:07.300]   If you just swipe up, nothing will happen.
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:12.300]   You have to be, like, aggressively swipe up to get that control center.
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.300]   You've got to do it with purpose.
[00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:15.300]   I'm starting a lawn mower.
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:16.300]   Yeah.
[00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:23.300]   You just got to -- I think it -- it seems like you got to -- make sure to start it from below where the screen is.
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:25.300]   It's got to touch the edge of the screen.
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.300]   Yeah, look at that.
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:27.300]   You didn't even know what you had.
[00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.300]   You were just sitting there, a gold mine.
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:29.300]   What's all this?
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:30.300]   Amazing, right?
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:31.300]   See?
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:32.300]   You know what's fun?
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:34.300]   You can toggle your Bluetooth all day long now.
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:35.300]   Ooh, there's a moon and a plane.
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:40.300]   Yeah, and it took me -- even though Apple told me quickly where it was when I was sitting up Iowa 7,
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:43.300]   it still took me a better part of an hour to figure out where my spotlight went,
[00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:45.300]   because I was like, "Swipe into the right?
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:46.300]   Doesn't go anywhere now.
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:48.300]   How do I find anything?
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:49.300]   I'm lost."
[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.300]   Oh.
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:51.300]   You swipe down.
[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:52.300]   That was not intuitive.
[00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:53.300]   It took me forever.
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:54.300]   I had to look at that.
[00:42:54.300 --> 00:43:00.300]   I thought I would like the parallax backgrounds, but I really don't notice or care about them.
[00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:02.300]   I noticed a lot more that it's harder to see.
[00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.300]   I'm surprised at how disappointed I am.
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:09.300]   It took -- well, I mean, are you disappointed or are you just never going to think about it again?
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:15.300]   No, I'm just -- I wanted to be blown away by that, but instead the effect was so small.
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:20.300]   And I don't know if that's a saving processor thing or what, but it's subtler than I hoped it would be.
[00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:22.300]   And as a result, I don't really dig it.
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:27.300]   I don't really -- yeah, I feel like it's just not at all something that I am impressed by.
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:31.300]   What's weird too is that, okay, we've got people who say a little too much to do.
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:35.300]   A little too much swishing and animation going on here in iOS 7.
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:36.300]   So you go into your settings area.
[00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:40.300]   If you go into settings, I think it's general.
[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:47.300]   And then down at accessibility, you've got a new option to -- is that where it is?
[00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:52.300]   No, not accessibility.
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:53.300]   Well, I don't know.
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:54.300]   It's in there somewhere.
[00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:59.300]   You have some sort of an option to turn off some of the motion in iOS 7.
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:00.300]   And I thought, oh, that's cool.
[00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:02.300]   All right, let's do that.
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:04.300]   And it doesn't really change anything.
[00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:09.300]   The only thing it does is turn off the parallax effects, which I think is not even the part
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:11.300]   that bothers people the most.
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:13.300]   What am I doing wrong here?
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:14.300]   What do you mean?
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.300]   [ Laughter ]
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:18.300]   This is original, where we all just play with our phones.
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:21.300]   I'm trying to get back to Brian's secret myself.
[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:22.300]   There you go.
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:23.300]   There you go.
[00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:24.300]   You found it.
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:25.300]   You didn't show me how.
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:29.300]   Tim, is there any other big feature that we haven't touched on for iOS 7?
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:33.300]   Something that maybe you know to be excited about, but I'm too dumb.
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:34.300]   Nope.
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:35.300]   I have a career.
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:38.300]   Pretty much covered everything at this point.
[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:39.300]   No more Easter eggs.
[00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:41.300]   By the way, it is an accessibility.
[00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:44.300]   It's accessibility and then reduced motion, which is now off.
[00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:46.300]   If I say, yeah, let's turn that on.
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:51.300]   It'll say reduce the motion of the user interface, including the parallax effect of icons and alerts.
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.300]   Okay, that sounds good.
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:58.300]   But all I can figure out that it does is specifically only turn off the parallax effects.
[00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:00.300]   So you're still getting all the swishing.
[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:02.300]   Reduce motion is on.
[00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:04.300]   Look, I'm still swishing around.
[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.300]   It's all the same.
[00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:08.300]   So I don't know.
[00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:09.300]   We are.
[00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:12.300]   I feel like we've appled this whole thing.
[00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:13.300]   Yeah.
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:14.300]   I concur.
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:15.300]   We're down to the core, people.
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:16.300]   No more.
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:17.300]   No more from Apple.
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:18.300]   This is Apple Free Zone after this.
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:24.300]   Probably a good time to take a little break and thank Shutterstock.com for sponsoring this episode
[00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:26.300]   of This Week in Tech.
[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.300]   Aussie, the dog loves Shutterstock.
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:29.300]   You know why?
[00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:35.300]   Because you can type in, let's say pictures of, like, well, you can type in Papillon, which
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:37.300]   is the breed of dog that he is.
[00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:38.300]   Very specific.
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:43.300]   Or just dog, as Chad was all set up to do before I threw him off.
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:47.300]   Papillon is spelled with two L's as a French word, Chad, by the way.
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:49.300]   But the neat thing about...
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:50.300]   She's not just me.
[00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:51.300]   You know Chad's dyslexic.
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:52.300]   You're teasing him.
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:53.300]   What is this?
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:55.300]   Yeah, I'm not even going to try that.
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:56.300]   Didn't actually know that.
[00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:59.300]   All of a sudden this has turned into some dark or dark comedy.
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:04.300]   But at Shutterstock.com you can find the perfect image or a video for your next creative project.
[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:07.300]   You see, we're looking at all these great, great images of dogs.
[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:11.300]   Well, you can search something as simple as dogs or let's say you're putting together a new
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:15.300]   website or some sort of advertisement or putting together a video, whatever.
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:17.300]   Any type of creative project.
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:21.300]   And maybe you need not just a picture of a dog, but a picture of a dog that also has
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:26.300]   some sort of an incorporation of yellow into that because you're going to make it your
[00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:31.300]   banner for your new review site or I don't know what that kind of site would be.
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:33.300]   But you get the idea.
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:37.300]   Any type of project you can choose from over 28 million high quality stock photos, illustrations,
[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:39.300]   vectors and video clips.
[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:44.300]   What's cool about it is that not only is there a huge variety of the kind of images and videos
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:49.300]   that you find on Shutterstock, but the contributors are professional photographers.
[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:54.300]   This is not like some guy who's just mocking up some stuff and hoping to get a few bucks
[00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:55.300]   from Shutterstock.
[00:46:55.300 --> 00:47:00.300]   This is really, really high quality stuff and what 10,000 images are added every day.
[00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:01.300]   Every day.
[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:06.300]   I mean, think about how many new images you would have just per week if you had an account.
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:08.300]   There's always something new every time you go.
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.300]   Flexible pricing at Shutterstock.
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:15.300]   So depending on what you're looking for, you can do individual image packs or a monthly
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:16.300]   subscription.
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:20.300]   If that's the kind of deal that you're looking for, you can download 25 images per day with
[00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:22.300]   a standard subscription.
[00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:23.300]   So just starting off.
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:26.300]   I mean, that's a lot of content to work with.
[00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:30.300]   And you can download any image in any size and you just pay in one price.
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:33.300]   So if there's something that you like, you feel like, wow, I can use this in a few different
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:34.300]   places.
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:36.300]   You don't have to pay for it over and over again.
[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:43.300]   For anybody who may be familiar with how Facebook ads can look pretty unprofessional, Shutterstock
[00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:44.300]   recently partnered with Facebook.
[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:50.300]   They're now providing advertising customers free access to Shutterstock images through Facebook's
[00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:51.300]   ad creation tool.
[00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:54.300]   The goal is let's make some of the stuff look more professional.
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:59.300]   If you're the kind of person who's thinking about your own Facebook ads or maybe using
[00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:03.300]   them and you think that your traction could be greatly improved and this is going to be
[00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:05.300]   what Shutterstock is helping you with.
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:09.300]   Great resource for local businesses that want professional looking ads.
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:14.300]   Now, if you're interested in Shutterstock.com, you don't need a credit card to try it out.

[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:46.300]   for their continued support of this week in tech.
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:51.300]   You know, Chad, this is probably a good time to look over the last week of TWIT the network,
[00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:56.300]   not TWIT the show because, well, we just like to confuse people that way.
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:57.300]   It's a show and a network.
[00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:00.300]   What else has been going on in the TWIT universe?
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:02.300]   This week in tech.
[00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:04.300]   Previously on TWIT.
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:06.300]   This week in Enterprise Tech.
[00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:11.300]   The FBI superlily took control of Freedom Hosting in July 12th and they used those servers to
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:16.300]   distribute malware onto computers that were connecting to Freedom Hosting servers.
[00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:17.300]   This week in Google.
[00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:20.300]   I got my Nexus 7 LTE.
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:22.300]   And all your dreams came true.
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:23.300]   Right, Jeff?
[00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:24.300]   No!
[00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:25.300]   Here we go.
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:26.300]   I've got a tweet from Rosie and say,
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:31.300]   "It's not part of our lineup and can't be activated."
[00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:37.300]   So today I wrote and sent a formal complaint to the Federal Communications Commission saying,
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:39.300]   "Go after a bastard."
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:40.300]   GizWiz.
[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:44.300]   This is a tool that you use to start campfires.
[00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:46.300]   I mean, nothing could possibly go wrong with this right now.
[00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:48.300]   Oh, oh, oh, gosh, okay.
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:49.300]   TWIT.
[00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:51.300]   This place used to be a drugstore.
[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:55.300]   Is that our new tagline, it's TWIT?
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:57.300]   I've never heard that before.
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:59.300]   Do we say that every week?
[00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:00.300]   No.
[00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:01.300]   That's a gym color.
[00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:03.300]   He comes up with those on the fly.
[00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:05.300]   Oh my god, you know, this big used to be a drugstore.
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:08.300]   We're sitting in an old drugstore right now.
[00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:09.300]   A former drugstore.
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:10.300]   It was Tully's drugs.
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.300]   Tully's drugstore.
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:12.300]   Tully is?
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:13.300]   Not Tuddles.
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:14.300]   What happened to Tully?
[00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:16.300]   I don't, you know.
[00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:17.300]   God.
[00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:18.300]   He's gone.
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:19.300]   Tully is.
[00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:20.300]   He's actually in the basement.
[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:21.300]   Did I see Tully Heaven?
[00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:25.100]   It looked like you were, when you were demonstrating that fire starting thing, I thought I saw a lot of
[00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:27.100]   people saw an envelope with my logo on it.
[00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:32.100]   What we had about it was what I was doing was burning things that would be, I would be
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:33.100]   -- Oh, I see.
[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:36.100]   You'd normally catch on fire.
[00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:42.100]   One of them was an old photo of me that I wanted to burn, like old memories.
[00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:46.100]   The other one was Brian Brushwood, you're a fire eater.
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:48.100]   So I thought that's why you were there.
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:49.100]   Except my ears, stuff.
[00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:52.100]   I wasn't studying for it either.
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:56.100]   It was kind of stretch as all I had on my desk.
[00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:58.100]   As Mooncat in the chat says, "Keep digging, Jed.
[00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:01.100]   You're doing great."
[00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:02.100]   Oh, great network we have.
[00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:03.100]   I loved that.
[00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:10.100]   If you haven't seen the Jeff Jarvis rant on last week's This Week in Google, I don't think
[00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:11.100]   he was laughing.
[00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:12.100]   He was pretty fired up.
[00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:14.100]   But it's a good one.
[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:15.100]   It's a good one.
[00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:17.100]   I love it when Jeff gets fired up.
[00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:18.100]   You?
[00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:19.100]   Love it.
[00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:20.100]   Yeah.
[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:21.100]   It's one of your favorite things.
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:22.100]   You should do that with him.
[00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:23.100]   He's on fire too.
[00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:27.100]   Second only to Steve Gibson when he goes on a security rant.
[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:29.100]   Oh, don't get me started on Gibson.
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:30.100]   And his security.
[00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:31.100]   Love him.
[00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:32.100]   Love that guy.
[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:33.100]   Shields up.
[00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:34.100]   Shields up.
[00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:37.100]   Hey, should we talk about Google flattening its logo?
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:39.100]   Everybody wants to go flat.
[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:41.100]   Got rid of some drop shadows in the Google logo.
[00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:42.100]   Martin, what do you think?
[00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:44.100]   Is it the wave of the future?
[00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:47.100]   I didn't notice anything.
[00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:49.100]   No, seriously, I didn't.
[00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:52.100]   You know, supposedly there were some changes on there.
[00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:56.100]   When I looked at the Google homepage, I did not see any changes.
[00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:57.100]   So I don't know what I'm missing here.
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:58.100]   Well, look it.
[00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:00.100]   I mean, we can look at the logo.
[00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:07.100]   It's not going to look drastically different, but this is the next generation of Google.
[00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:11.100]   When I tried it earlier, like right now I still get kind of drop shadow-y on there.
[00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:12.100]   Yeah.
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:14.100]   When I go to Google.com, I'm not going to look at it for me or something.
[00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:15.100]   It's here.
[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:17.100]   I'm not going to open a cognito window.
[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:19.100]   Where they bait it?
[00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:24.100]   Well, you know, I think it's some sort of a rollout because I actually don't have it either.
[00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:28.300]   And I still have the black bar, which is another thing that's going away for anybody who spends
[00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:29.300]   a lot of time in Gmail.
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:30.300]   Maybe you use Google Drive.
[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:32.500]   You're on Google+.
[00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:39.100]   You've got your top black bar that has nice, easy links to, certainly in my Google profile,
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:42.100]   maps, YouTube, Gmail, Calendar, et cetera.
[00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:43.100]   Using those all the time.
[00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:47.100]   I mean, the navigation is very, very important, but never really liked the black bar.
[00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:50.100]   Not a huge fan of the black bar.
[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:54.100]   And apparently, eventually, some people already have it.
[00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:55.100]   I know Tom--
[00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:59.700]   You know what's weird is downstairs I tried it and it worked, but then-- but now upstairs,
[00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:00.900]   I wonder if it's kind of thing.
[00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:04.100]   They're just rolling it out to some servers and it's just taking time for--
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:05.100]   Apparently.
[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:06.100]   --to the cash or whatever.
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:07.100]   Yeah.
[00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.100]   But--
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:09.100]   Is it when I tried it before?
[00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:10.100]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:11.100]   Oh, it's OK.
[00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:12.700]   I remember live on TNT.
[00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:13.900]   I guess it was Friday.
[00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:17.300]   In the middle of the show, Jason Howe was like, oh, look, it just updated for me.
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:21.700]   And we're sitting right next to each other and I can't get it to work on any of my Google
[00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:22.700]   accounts.
[00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:23.700]   And I have a few of them.
[00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:24.700]   But it is an improvement.
[00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:26.700]   I mean, goodbye black bar.
[00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:32.460]   And now you've got a nice little-- looks like a little-- I don't know, a little grid.
[00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:33.460]   Click on it.
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:34.460]   And then you've got some other options.
[00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:37.540]   I don't know if we can pull up what we're all going to enjoy.
[00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:40.700]   So four out of four of us don't have this working.
[00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:44.100]   Well, and people in the chat are telling me to clear my cash.
[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:47.260]   But I've opened an incognito browser, so I would think it should matter.
[00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:50.500]   I'll try it in Internet Explorer and see if that's any different.
[00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:53.340]   Well, maybe before the show was over.
[00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:54.340]   Yeah.
[00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:55.340]   So all right.
[00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:58.580]   So this is what it's going to look like when we all get upgraded.
[00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:00.020]   So no more black bar.
[00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:02.660]   Now you've got a nice little-- it's just a little--
[00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:04.420]   They call it an app tray.
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:05.420]   An app tray.
[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:07.500]   Yeah, you click on it and then you get all your good stuff.
[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:08.860]   The branding looks better.
[00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:09.860]   It looks cleaner overall.
[00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:15.140]   I mean, I have to say, there are certain Google services I use more than others.
[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:22.020]   But I always have several Google-- not just that I'm using the Chrome browser, but I've
[00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:26.140]   got several Gmail accounts, everything that I do for Twit goes through Google.
[00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:29.780]   So this is an experience that I live in constantly, all day, every day.
[00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:36.100]   So the improvements like this are welcome for me.
[00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:38.500]   What is up with Flat being so awesome now?
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:39.940]   Like, is this have something to do?
[00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:41.340]   Like we hated 3D TVs.
[00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:44.620]   So now everyone's just like, you know, don't even look 3D.
[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:45.620]   Everyone be flats.
[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:46.620]   It's sort of a normal thing.
[00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:49.700]   I don't find it all that more attractive.
[00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:52.220]   Smaller displays that they kind of get rid of a lot of that detail.
[00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:53.460]   It just sort of looks messy.
[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:56.660]   So when you have something with bevels on under shadows, it just makes the image look
[00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:57.980]   muddy or when you make it smaller.
[00:54:57.980 --> 00:55:02.260]   So as we smaller displays on phones, our logos are getting cleaner.
[00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:04.700]   But of course, while that's happening, our displays are getting high resolution, which
[00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:07.420]   enables us to have bevels and shadows and things like that too.
[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:10.540]   So, you know, probably in two or three years, suddenly we'll have a lot of new logos with
[00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:15.220]   a lot of bevels and shadows and probably some blingy effects too, just to keep it exciting.
[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:16.620]   It'll probably be a cyclical thing.
[00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:18.660]   Yeah, this is exciting.
[00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:19.660]   It's exciting stuff.
[00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:25.500]   Well, you know what is exciting is the concept that Google may help us just live a lot longer.
[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:26.500]   Have you heard about this?
[00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:30.380]   Yeah, no, this actually, this is very exciting, potentially.
[00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:35.020]   Well, emphasis on potentially because we don't know a whole lot about a new company called
[00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:38.380]   Calico, which is, this is not just Google investing in some company.
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:41.980]   This is actually Google announcing a new company called Calico.
[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:48.660]   It's going to focus on health and well-being and focus particularly on aging and associated
[00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:50.300]   diseases with aging.
[00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:55.260]   Arthur D. Levinson, chairman and former CEO of Genentech, chairman of Apple, will be a
[00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:57.220]   chief executive officer.
[00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:59.740]   He's also a founding investor in Calico.
[00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:02.780]   And Larry Page, Google CEO, had a statement about it.
[00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:08.780]   And I mean, these Google guys, you take them seriously because they really do like to put
[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:13.380]   a lot of effort into stuff that goes against the idea of, you know, searching, advertising
[00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:14.380]   through money.
[00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:18.500]   He says, "Illness and aging affect all of our families with some longer-term moonshot
[00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:20.620]   thinking around healthcare and biotechnology.
[00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:24.380]   I believe we can improve millions of lives."
[00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:25.380]   Then he talks up art.
[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:29.940]   He says, "It's impossible to imagine anyone better than art one of the leading scientists,
[00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:33.460]   members and CEOs of our generation, to take this new venture forward."
[00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:34.460]   What we don't-
[00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:36.460]   Yours, I thought, was really interesting.
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:37.460]   Go ahead.
[00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:38.460]   I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.
[00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:39.460]   No, it's fine.
[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:43.300]   But he specifically mentions in there that, look, we're not just, we're not trying to
[00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:44.300]   cure cancer here.
[00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:48.940]   Not because cancer doesn't need to be cured, but because if you do cure cancer, you live
[00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:50.660]   maybe three more years.
[00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:54.860]   We're going for solutions that'll get you 20, 40, 100 more years.
[00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:57.940]   And in fact, I think they even said that, like for folks who are younger than 20 years
[00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:02.020]   old, they want to see them living 100 extra years through these initiatives, which is
[00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:03.020]   super ambitious.
[00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:04.020]   Yeah, I mean, it's super ambitious.
[00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:05.020]   It's great.
[00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:09.780]   With that cancer, he said, "We think of solving cancer as this huge thing."
[00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:11.100]   Dot, dot, dot.
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:12.780]   I'm cutting to the end here.
[00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:16.820]   It's not as big as of an advance as you might think.
[00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:19.260]   And the thinking of this is, "Well, that doesn't make any sense."
[00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:21.900]   I mean, of course, if you cure cancer, that's a huge thing.
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:23.460]   A lot of people suffer from cancer.
[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:28.940]   But his point is when people get cancer, they usually, you know, that takes three years
[00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:31.380]   off their life, whatever the average is.
[00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:34.260]   Hopefully a lot, you know, they live a lot longer than that.
[00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:37.700]   But he's talking about making people live for decades longer.
[00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:42.860]   Well, and there's a lot to do because, you know, when people die of old age, you know,
[00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:45.940]   maybe they die of heart failure, but then they open them up and there's like 12 other
[00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:48.300]   systems that are just about to go.
[00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:52.980]   So I mean, it's ambitious, but they're talking about everything from nanobots that repair
[00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:59.260]   DNA to what is a planarian flatworms.
[00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:03.860]   That is the comparison because planarian worms are able to repair their own cells.
[00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:05.420]   So let's all be like worms.
[00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:06.660]   So let's cut to the chase here.
[00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:08.220]   Is this going to help us?
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:09.220]   Yeah.
[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:14.220]   You know, guys, like, we're probably pretty much all around the same age, you know, grant
[00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:17.020]   you within plus or minus 10, you know, I don't know.
[00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:22.500]   Is it going to help us or do you have to do you have to do it?
[00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:23.500]   Do a great mark.
[00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:24.500]   Just keep digging.
[00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:25.500]   Everything's everything.
[00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:31.420]   How many of you did I just think?
[00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:35.020]   But no, is it going to help us or is it our kids?
[00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:40.300]   I think I'm lucky to get to 90 as it is.
[00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:42.860]   It's like, do I really want to be 90 for another 20 years?
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:45.740]   Do I want to be a hundred and a hundred and a hundred and a hundred and a hundred and
[00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:46.740]   a hundred and a hundred and a hundred and a hundred and a hundred and a hundred and
