[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.920]   and a great round table today.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.080]   We welcome first Jason Calicanis,
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.720]   who is a regular on the show and always glad to have you
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.720]   on Jason.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.080]   This week you were very much in the news.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.360]   We're going to talk about your Mahalo layoff story,
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.160]   if you don't mind, unless you want to leave that on the table.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.160]   No, no.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.160]   I'm rather willing to be transparent about it and talk
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.480]   about it and hopefully people can learn from some of the
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.480]   lessons.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.040]   Well, and you have been, and one of the reasons I wanted to get
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.440]   you on is I read your email and learned as a budding
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.800]   entrepreneur learned an awful lot.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.120]   I thought it was really, really interesting.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.320]   So we'll talk a little bit about that.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.200]   But also, I think there's no better person to have on as we
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.280]   head into this kind of tech crisis, this cash crunch,
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.960]   something that might even be worse than the last dot boom
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.960]   bust.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.920]   Much worse.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.840]   That we get somebody like Jason who's been through it and knows
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.840]   a thing or two about business on the show.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.080]   Also with us, I'm really pleased to have him back.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.480]   He's not on nearly enough.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.600]   From Channel Flip, it's Will Harris.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.800]   Hello, Will.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.000]   Hello, how are you greetings from--
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.520]   From Great Britain.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.000]   What's a me Oxford?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.520]   I like--
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.200]   You guys say fall, right?
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.760]   Fall, but it's autumn.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.440]   It can be both, right?
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.520]   You don't say fall?
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.760]   No.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.560]   Anytime I say fall, my friends slapped me around the head
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.760]   and caught me in a stupid yank.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.760]   That's a yank term.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.080]   I had no idea.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.760]   Well, I thought it'd be good to get somebody from the
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.360]   international crowd on because it's turning out not to be
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.800]   an internet-- not to be a US only bust, but it's a
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.400]   communist perspective on the credit crisis.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.200]   Let's get the communist, Sin.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.480]   Also, I'm really pleased to welcome my good friend and a
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.960]   longtime collaborator, Sarah Lane, is also here.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:56.800]   Hello.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.800]   Hey, Sarah.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.720]   Yay.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.200]   From Revision 3, she's the director of programming and
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.800]   community there, but also host a pop siren and, of course, a
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.160]   long time host of the screen savers and
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.920]   attack of the show.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.960]   So nice to see you.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.720]   I can't believe it took this long.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.560]   Never been on Twitter.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.160]   That's weird.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.920]   It is weird.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.840]   I think we talked about it and then you're a busy man.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.760]   I'm busy, busy.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.440]   Always busy.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.480]   He is the busy man.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.400]   So we have lots of stories to talk about kind of an
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.280]   infinite number.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.840]   One of the ones that kind of grabbed my eye, and it's not
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.240]   exactly a tech story, but boy, it's kind of a shocker, is
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.040]   that the New York Times is in far worse shape than we ever
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.600]   imagined.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.360]   It's according to some about to go out of business.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.400]   Well, it's the advertising.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.320]   It's the advertising.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.840]   The online advertising has disappeared.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.840]   The New York Times, while it does have some successful
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.600]   online properties, including about.com, it was just a
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.800]   couple of years or maybe last year that the publisher
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.400]   said, we'll be out of the paper business in 10 years.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.760]   And we all kind of poo-pooed that when that happened.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.200]   But apparently, The New York Times is in dire straits.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.480]   Jason, is this kind of part of the general decline or is this
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.240]   something that would have happened anyway?
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.000]   This is a double sort of whammy.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.880]   You have the general decline in newspapers and their
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.480]   cost structure not being part of sort of the new news
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.480]   process.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.640]   Basically, they spend too much money.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.760]   And then combine that with what's happened in the markets
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.880]   and the amount of debt they have and their ability to pay
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.000]   back that debt is very much out of sync.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.080]   So they're going to have to sell about.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.640]   They've been trying to sell about.com from what I
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.120]   understand.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.640]   But isn't that one of their few profitable--
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.040]   You know, the problem with it is, it hasn't changed in,
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.040]   I don't know, six or seven years.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.480]   And all The New York Times has done since they've got it is
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.280]   really destroy it.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.680]   You're right.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.480]   I don't go there anymore.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.040]   I mean, I'd go to Mahalo over about.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.880]   You're kind of the same--
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.080]   You're not investing.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.480]   Yeah, I'm not saying that because we're quasi-competitors.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.160]   But because they really haven't invested in it.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.920]   And what they're doing is they're putting more and more
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.520]   ads on it.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.200]   So when you go to the page, it's very hard to tell what's an
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.600]   offer, what's an ad.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.840]   And that's when you know something's wrong with a site.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.960]   When you try to squeeze as much revenue out of it as you
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.960]   can, you corrupt the user experience.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.280]   You corrupt the user experience.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.280]   The users go away, which is how Google has been able to take
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.400]   such incredible market share.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.560]   They actually show less ads on Google.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.560]   And they traditionally have been showing less.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.880]   And they call that the investment in the user experience.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.000]   So if you go do 10 searches, you may only see ads on three
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.480]   or four.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.920]   You go to--
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.840]   That's interesting.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.840]   I didn't know that.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.400]   Yes.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.280]   I know this specifically.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.320]   So then what that does is when they have a down market
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.520]   come in, they can actually increase the number of ads.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.440]   So they have a dial inside of Google from what I've been
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.600]   told by people where they can pick how much money they
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.080]   want to make.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.640]   And they're really--
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.680]   I want that dial.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.360]   Exactly.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.200]   Because they can just say, oh, put more ads on.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.280]   So they've been conservative.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.520]   So in a dark period like this, they can actually ramp it up.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.020]   Right.
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.720]   The really sinister part of it, or genius part of it, or
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.240]   whatever is, they will show more ads on, say, a partner
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.040]   site like AOL uses Google Search.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.040]   So they'll show more ads there while showing less on their
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.040]   own, which over time, convinces people don't use AOL
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.480]   Search, use Google's.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.200]   Is this a problem though limited to the New York Times,
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.440]   or are all newspapers about to go out of business?
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.240]   All of them are going to have fundamental problems because
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.520]   you have too high a cost basis.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.680]   People don't look to them first for their news.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.760]   They have a speed problem.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.160]   They have a product problem.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.360]   And then they have a business model problem.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.440]   And then you have an economic problem at the same time.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.040]   So the business problem is they don't have any--
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.880]   they're competing with Craigslist, which is free
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.520]   essentially.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.600]   So Craigslist has taken a large revenue stream and
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.560]   basically decimated it by making it free.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.240]   And then you have blogs and shows like this and
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.760]   Engadget and political blogs basically taking away their
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:49.760]   readership.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.280]   But it's the Journal of Records still.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.120]   I mean, is the paper the one paper in the US that is kind
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.920]   of the--
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.400]   You figure if all other papers were to go away, you'd
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.040]   still have the New York Times.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.080]   You'd have to.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.520]   That's nice.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.440]   It's not going to go away.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.560]   I mean, they just may have to sell things.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.840]   They may have to do fundraising.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.600]   So when all this stuff happens, that's when smart people
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.640]   are able to buy things.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.840]   So you saw the Wall Street Journal get bought by
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.240]   Murdoch, don't be surprised.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.960]   I mean, he wouldn't be able to buy the New York Times, I
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.640]   don't think, because of ownership rules.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.680]   Because then he would own the post, The New York Times, and
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.520]   The Wall Street Journal.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.680]   New York newspapers.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.400]   Kind of not good.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.680]   Not good.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.240]   We are in a tech bus.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.440]   There's no question about it.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.360]   In fact, if you go to TechCrunch, they have a
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.320]   layoff tracker.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:41.680]   And according to their layoff tracker, 19,683 jobs
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.280]   eliminated since mid-September.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.440]   That's not including the 25,000.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.480]   HP is going to layoff as a result of its merger with EDS.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:55.640]   It is including 3,000 at Xerox, 9,000 at Dell, 1,500 at Yahoo,
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:00.240]   1,500 at eBay, 6 at Mahalo.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.240]   Makes you sound pretty good.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.760]   But as a percentage, it's roughly that you laid off about
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.560]   10% at Mahalo.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.000]   Yeah, essentially, we looked at it and said we have three
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.600]   years' worth of capital F. We did something really smart.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.800]   We raised a lot of money in the upmarket.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.880]   And so as I always say, what smart entrepreneurs do in an
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.720]   upmarket is raise capital and sell their companies for the
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.880]   highest valuation possible.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.240]   And then in a downmarket, what smart
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.960]   entrepreneurs do is build value.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.040]   And so we raised money when the market was very hot a year
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:33.960]   and a half ago.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.760]   And now we're going to build value in the downmarket and not
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.720]   look for an exit or not look to raise more caps.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.240]   So your cash position, it gives you what you call runway?
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.160]   They call it runway.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.840]   How many months can you go without raising capital?
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.240]   A typical startup company has six to 18 months.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.240]   We had three months of capital F.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:57.560]   We then did a reorganization/layoffs.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.280]   Looks more like a reorganization.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.480]   With the intent of gaining more, how much now runway do you
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.200]   have from--
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.400]   Four years of runway?
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.320]   You went from three months to four years?
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:06.720]   No, no, no.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.800]   Three years to four years.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.960]   Three years to four years.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.440]   OK.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.320]   Are you anticipating that this downmarket is going to last
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.120]   four years?
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:19.080]   I think the downmarket is going to last 18 to 36 months.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.680]   And I would like to have a year or two of runway coming out
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.800]   of it or the ability to buy companies during the downmarket.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.320]   Ah, this is a good time to snag some deals.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:29.880]   Exactly.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.280]   So I've been looking at things.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.720]   We're not in the blog business, but we own Hackaday
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.840]   because we had previously owned it at WebLogs Inc.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.760]   And you didn't sell it.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.680]   You did that with something else.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.560]   I didn't sell it to AOL because they wanted to shut down
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.200]   all the blog posts about hacking time-1 or cable boxes,
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.920]   which is quite reasonable.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.160]   Considering time-1 is an A-1 company.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:48.680]   Yeah.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:48.960]   Right.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.960]   So we didn't sell to them.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.200]   So Mahalo actually owns Hackaday.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.440]   And Hackaday breaks even.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.040]   It pays for the people who write for it.
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.000]   But if there were other blogs that we could buy,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:58.800]   I would consider it.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.400]   Or other sites that are search related
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.920]   because a lot of the search companies
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.760]   don't know how to build a brand.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.440]   And actually, that's one of the things we've done pretty well.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.800]   Is it impossible to get more money nowadays?
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.080]   Or is all that venture money that's gone?
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.320]   The venture money is still there.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.920]   What's going to happen is venture capitalists
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.920]   are starting to circle the wagons.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.800]   And so what they're doing is they're
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.440]   looking back in their portfolio and saying,
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.720]   which one of these companies are going to survive?
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.880]   I have to allocate all the money I have left to my companies,
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.920]   my children, as opposed to maybe adopting more kids,
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.760]   which would be the metaphor would be to invest in other people.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.200]   So all the VCs are calling each other right now saying,
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.280]   hey, will you invest in my B-round for this company
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.040]   or the C-round for this company?
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.880]   And people are like, well, I don't really
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.400]   know if that's going to make it.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.120]   I would say the flip side of that
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.760]   is it really depends on the kind of money
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.480]   that you're looking for.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.080]   Because if you're the sort of person that wants to do a tech
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.960]   company and it's looking for less than a million dollars
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.560]   to get started, there are still
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.360]   a lot of opportunities to raise that kind of money out there
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.720]   at the moment because there are a lot of high net worth
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.600]   individuals who are still wanting to invest.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.200]   The one who invest the one who's like, angels.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.160]   They ain't going to put it on the stock market right now.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.600]   Yeah, I would imagine there's a lot of people
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.920]   who are sitting on cash looking for some.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.480]   And so the prospect of investing in an internet business
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.760]   that's probably kind of risky, but no more risky than putting
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.680]   it in the stock market right now and potentially with huge returns
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.960]   is quite attractive to a lot of people
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.040]   in the sort of million dollar range.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.680]   What's it look like in the UK right now, Will?
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.080]   Are you seeing the same kind of people
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.760]   hunkering down, getting ready for the nuclear winner?
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:34.520]   Well, a little bit, but not quite to the same degree.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.680]   I think what's driven it all in the States
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:40.440]   has been this huge problem with the housing markets.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.440]   And we haven't had that to quite the same extent in the UK.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.760]   We've had the sort of dodgy loans and banks being bailed out
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.880]   and things, but not the same amount really.
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.200]   So things are comparatively better.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.760]   There's not really--
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.880]   The feeling over here at the moment
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.200]   is that there's lots of sort of hype about it.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.080]   And lots of people sort of saying, oh, Christmas is canceled
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.440]   and all these kind of things.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:02.920]   We don't know.
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.920]   But then we actually look at it.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.880]   People are sort of thinking, well, actually, my life hasn't got that much worse.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.880]   My groceries went up a little bit, but now the cost of petrol's coming down.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.880]   So the price of petrol here is now like the lowest it's been for us six months.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.680]   Same here.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.960]   It's dropping-- well, the cost of oil went.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.520]   How much is it there?
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.920]   It's 94-pencil-litre.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.240]   Well, 94-pencil-litre.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.800]   That's about the same as here.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.320]   It's about three bucks a gallon.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.960]   How many liters to--
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.280]   Don't get me doing this.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:33.760]   Metro.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.360]   Sarah, you're in San Francisco.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.320]   You're part of the San Francisco elite--
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:38.840]   Elite.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.880]   --web 2.0 crowd.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.960]   Is it gloomy in the city?
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.600]   Well, OK.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.360]   It definitely depends on where you work.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.000]   But yeah, people are worried.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.120]   People are really worried.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.200]   There are layoffs here and there.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.560]   Seismic laid off a few people.
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.920]   I mean, these smaller companies, but they're still laying on them.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.360]   Smaller?
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:54.880]   Yeah.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.040]   But I mean, we're all reading the same Valley WAG article.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.160]   I mean, everyone knows what's going on as it's happening.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:06.600]   And the startup world is definitely shaking in its boots.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.360]   I've not having been to New York in a while.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.000]   I can't really speak for anything but San Francisco.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.720]   But I can imagine that people are worried everywhere.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.960]   Jason, why do you say this is worse than the dot boom bust?
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.200]   Very simple.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.880]   If you look at the last bubble, it was based upon companies
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.520]   having too much money and spending it too freely.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.360]   So their balance sheets were out of whack.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.000]   They were spending more than they were making.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.320]   They got over-aggressive.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.000]   So you had a large amount of investment in dot coms.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.360]   And they were doing things like buying
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.840]   super broke commercials and renting huge offices
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.560]   and hiring 1,000 people with no chance of catching up
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:46.440]   to that amount of burn, that amount of capital being spent.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.920]   This time, it's not the companies that have bad balance sheets.
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.640]   And we didn't have all these IPOs this time around.
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.440]   I thought that was going to protect us.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.480]   It does.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.640]   That's why you're not seeing a bunch of companies laying off
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.320]   more people.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.240]   That's why you're not seeing a bunch of companies explode.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.360]   It could be worse.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.000]   Much worse.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:02.400]   Absolutely.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.840]   Well, listen, it's not like revision three.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.480]   What do you have?
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:05.800]   What do you have?
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:06.680]   15 people there?
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.600]   20 people maybe?
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.440]   Full time?
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.280]   It's not 30.
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:09.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.760]   So I mean, 30 is actually kind of high for that size company.
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.320]   But it's not like it's like 100.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.720]   If this had been the dot com era, it would be pseudo dot com.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.560]   Let's use Twitter as an example.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.480]   And here's the poster child for web 2.0.
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.840]   No revenue model, none in sight.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:23.920]   Lots of employees.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:24.840]   Doesn't matter.
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.080]   They have three years of capital.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.720]   You know what I was surprised about is I mean, I mean, laid off for
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.680]   a few people, not that many.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.440]   But it's, you know, they had 80 employees.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.080]   What do they do?
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.840]   I mean, I mean, I like I mean, I think they do stuff.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.560]   I don't even know what they do.
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.560]   I mean, they have more than twice as much music.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.560]   Music, music, community.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.960]   But they're killing it.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.800]   I mean, I mean, has--
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.640]   They're everywhere.
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.720]   That's for sure.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.880]   They have a huge number of people coming to that site.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.080]   I mean, I'm trying to remember what their uniques are.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.360]   I'm looking it up on Quantcast right now, but it's a lot.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.360]   But anyway, they're--
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:58.120]   So if that's enough, if you have a lot of uniques, if Twitter's got
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.600]   3 million in its community, is that enough to survive?
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:07.640]   In other words, the people who invested in Twitter or Revision 3 or Mime
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.920]   would they let it die, I guess, at this point?
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:11.800]   Twitter, absolutely not.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.400]   There's just too many users using it.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.720]   There's too much value there, and it's still growing.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.840]   So no, I mean, it's not an N.A. trouble.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.640]   But you asked what was the fundamental difference?
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.200]   So last time it was companies had bad balance sheets.
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.480]   This time, its individuals have bad balance sheets.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:31.080]   And individuals are two-thirds of the spending in this country.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.120]   That's what drives our spending in this country as consumers.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.080]   Consumers got way ahead of themselves.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.080]   A lot of them own homes that are underwater.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.320]   They're mortgages greater than the cost of the home now.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.280]   They can't sell it.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.080]   They're losing jobs, all that kind of stuff.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:49.840]   So it will take a company, maybe, I don't know, six months, 12
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.200]   months, 18 months to get their balance sheet in order.
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.480]   An individual who has got a million dollars
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:58.320]   owed on their house, and they can only sell it for 600,000
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:05.920]   or something, those people have no hope of ever balancing their checkbook,
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.520]   balancing their debt, which means you're going to see a lot of people go bankrupt.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.600]   And consumers are really scared.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.600]   So there's this group belt tightening effect that occurs.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.640]   So people read ValleyWag or the Wall Street Journal or TechCrunch.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.000]   They see all the cuts.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.200]   They know friends who have cut.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.280]   And so I'm sure everybody on this phone call has put off buying something,
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:28.760]   not because they don't have the money, because they wouldn't feel right doing it.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.680]   And that emotional state is occurring across the entire economy
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:36.800]   with even very affluent people who are just like, it doesn't feel right to buy a new car.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.040]   No, you're exactly right.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:38.520]   You're right.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.080]   You're exactly right.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.880]   One of the things we were talking about earlier today
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.280]   is I'd like to have a twit--
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:46.000]   we'll take the Twit House, the Twit College, and do one of those big Christmas displays
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.880]   where the thing goes and syncs to the music, and it can have the Twit album art and stuff.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.760]   It cost about $5,000 to do it.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.520]   And it's not that we didn't have the $5,000, but I thought, that's--
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.120]   I couldn't do it.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:56.920]   It's ostentatious.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.120]   It's like thumbing your nose at people.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:00.640]   Exactly.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:07.040]   So this tightening effect is going to occur where three less people are working
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.880]   at a retailer or a--
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.120]   What would be the bellwether?
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.880]   Will it be a bad sales Christmas?
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:14.280]   Will it--
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.880]   Black Fryer?
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.240]   Fourth quarter is a disaster.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:17.760]   Already.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:22.720]   Because I know a lot of people who actually make merchandise and then sell it.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:28.080]   What happens is when you are a manufacturer, let's say you make diaper bags or something
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:34.600]   like that for Target or a tea set for Target, you actually have to get a letter of credit
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.080]   from your bank to float that expense to send it to Target.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.440]   Target can't move your stuff.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.040]   The bank's not giving you a letter of credit.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:46.360]   So there's actually tons of product that are just stuck, like stuck in China, stuck
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:52.840]   in factories, stuck in storage spaces, where they're not going to make it to even retail.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:57.840]   And then what happens is you'll see retailers go out of business this fourth quarter.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.720]   When the retailers go out of business, they flood the market with inventory.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:07.640]   So then, you know, Hank and Barry's or whatever that one is, the sports store, they went bankrupt.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.800]   A bunch of people have gone bankrupt.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:14.440]   Then all that product goes on the market and it makes it really difficult for the strong
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:18.480]   retailers to compete because this whole stuff flooded on the market combined that with people
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:22.000]   not wanting to spend because they feel guilty or they don't have the money.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.400]   And it just becomes this ripple effect.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.960]   And it's already started and it's going to continue into next year.
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.920]   And it's going to be a major disaster.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:35.320]   The stock market is going to take a major hit in the fourth quarter, like--
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.320]   First and yes.
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.120]   And so get out of the stock market.
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.320]   Is that your advice?
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.200]   I think the stock market, the Dow will trade at 85.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:46.800]   I said the bottom of the Dow was 8500 plus or minus 10%.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.440]   My belief is the Dow has that.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.040]   Now 10% is a pretty good swing.
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.680]   So that means, you know, 87700 up to 9500.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.960]   It will be in that range for the next two years is my belief.
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:01.440]   I'm hearing a lot of people saying that saying you're not going to see a sudden resurgence.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:05.080]   It's going to stay at this whatever bottom is at this level for a while.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:09.160]   But also, just to say, you know, I think what you were pointing out, Leo, which is that
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:15.960]   as much as anything, this is partly a kind of group thing effect where, you know, a lot
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.560]   of people have still got the money.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.560]   A lot of people have not been hit as I was other people.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.080]   You know, you've got your money to do your Christmas display.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:26.640]   But for whatever reason, whether it's fear of being ostentatious or, you know, just
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.200]   sort of adhering mentality is--
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.080]   Or thinking I may not get my money.
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:35.040]   I may not get a chance at that money ever again and better hold on to it, just a case.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:40.600]   So it's in some ways it's not as-- although it is as bad.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.520]   It's not as bad as it could be, I suppose.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:48.200]   Microsoft's quarterly results offer hope to tech sector.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.400]   A rare glimmer of hope to Wall Street this week.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:56.880]   Microsoft's net profits $4.37 billion for the three months ending September 30th.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.680]   That's compared to $4.29 the year before.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:04.360]   Revenue $15.06 billion, 9% up.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.520]   And yet, people are saying still bad news.
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.800]   Microsoft's forecast support Apple had a great quarter.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:16.520]   Apple said sales of the iPhone, $6.9 million.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.640]   They made a ton of money.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.840]   Net profit of $683.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.920]   I'll do that for you, Will.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.120]   I mean, things are going good.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:31.240]   And yet, both companies are saying, but don't count on this lasting.
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.920]   So the thing is interesting to note that the headline number for Microsoft is that quarter
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:44.080]   one was up 10% in his revenue in quarter one, despite vista, the sort of so-called--
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.320]   So it's a good quarter.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.880]   So why did Apple stock tank when that news came out?
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:55.360]   Well, I mean, if you look at the price earnings ratios of these companies, they're still in
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.240]   the 12 to 15 range.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:05.800]   And during a brutal depression prolonged recession, they go down to eight or nine from what I
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:06.880]   understand.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.960]   And that would be the start buying opportunities.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.800]   And they've been trading at 20--
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.960]   Gee, gee, it's at eight right now.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:17.400]   Yeah, but that's because we don't know how much their earnings will take a hit.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.400]   So that eight sounds really low.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.360]   Unless their earnings are coming off, are going to fall off a cliff.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.440]   And if that's the case, then the earnings could continue to drop.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.800]   They can continue to make cuts and it doesn't move anywhere.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.760]   So that shows you how pessimistic people are.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.720]   And in great-- in down markets, great companies build market shares.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.520]   So in some ways, Apple and Microsoft will be fine.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.640]   They'll both going to take market share.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.720]   The bottom for me, when you see Google do layoffs--
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.480]   Yeah, Google's just kind of sailing along.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.800]   Google has never had a layoff.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.280]   So right.
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:55.040]   And in order to make their number this quarter, supposedly they cut like $250 million in
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.040]   capital expenditures.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.040]   And they--
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.480]   Did they turn that dial?
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.560]   Well, nobody knows money.
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.560]   We need money.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.480]   Yeah, nobody knows about the secret dial.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:10.320]   But the fact that they cut-- the way they hit their earnings numbers from what I've
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.280]   read is by cutting costs.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.360]   So when you see companies that are great companies, cutting costs in order to make their number
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:21.480]   as opposed to it being growth, et cetera, that's when you know there's a slowdown coming.
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:28.080]   So when Apple and Google start laying people off or curtail hiring, which they already
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.920]   announced they're going to do, that's when you know things are going to--
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.320]   That's their way of saying.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.520]   That's my way of finding the bottom.
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.840]   I think the bottom is when Google lays people off.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.480]   So watch for that.
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:44.680]   And now the New York Times parses Microsoft's quarterly profits announcement and said, "Here's
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.160]   the problem.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:52.600]   The Windows unit reported only a 2% rise in revenue and a 4% decline in operating income."
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.520]   Which still means a lot of revenue.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:57.520]   For the billions.
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.520]   In the billions.
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.520]   Right.
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.520]   With a B.
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:05.240]   But what they're saying-- and I think this might be true-- is that the problem is that
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:10.360]   Vista take up is not very good and that people are moving to the less expensive netbooks,
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:15.680]   which often don't run Vista, usually run XP or Linux, worse for Microsoft.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:21.240]   So these sub $500 netbooks are becoming more and more popular about a quarter now of the
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.240]   PC.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:27.560]   Although it's worth noting that one of the best performing divisions in Microsoft that
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.400]   quarter was the entertainment and devices.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:35.040]   The historically unprofitable Xbox 360 and Zoom market.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:40.520]   And so the Xbox 360 didn't really change much from last year.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:44.400]   But the quote that I'm reading is that the numbers were buoyed by sales of software for
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.360]   the Mac and Zoom and Boba.
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.360]   Can you believe it?
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:53.560]   So the entertainment and devices went up 51%.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:56.800]   51% based primarily on Mac and Zoom.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:01.320]   You have a 51% of a buck is only still a buck 51.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.760]   Well, it's 216 million.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.760]   All right.
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.760]   So it's not the billions.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:06.760]   All right.
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:07.760]   All right.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:08.760]   All right.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.560]   Well, I don't want everybody listening to the show to get depressed.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:13.560]   I'm depressed.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.160]   I know it's kind of sad.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.600]   Well, there's actually a lot of silver linings to it.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.920]   I mean, I'm actually writing an email about this that I haven't finished yet, but maybe
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.320]   I'll finish it after the show today.
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.120]   It's basically like this is when value is created.
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:30.760]   You know, my first company Silicon Hour reporter, I started in '96 and built in '96, '97, '98
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:36.480]   Weblogs Inc, Gawker, Twitter, Delicious, StumbleUpon, Flickr.
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:40.040]   Those were all, you know, 2003, 2004 kind of companies.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.840]   Again, the down market.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:47.560]   So, you know, you can, what are the great moments of creativity comes when people are unemployed
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:50.400]   and, you know, they're not looking to get paid.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.880]   They're looking to or get rich.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.720]   They're looking to just do something interesting.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:59.200]   And I think that's what we're entering the third golden age of technology, you know, in
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.200]   terms of the internet.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:05.400]   The first was in '95, '96, '97 when people just did it for the fun of it.
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:11.800]   2002, 2003, 2004 when blogs and social media, Web 2.0 was built again for the fun of it.
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.040]   Just because people were looking for interesting things to do.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:18.560]   Well, that's kind of what I've been saying is that, yeah, okay, times are tough, but
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:23.120]   this doesn't mean that innovators, the kids getting out of MIT and Stanford just say,
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.880]   oh, forget it, I'm going to go work at Burger King.
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:26.880]   They continue to innovate.
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.480]   They just go into a garage and they invent stuff.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.080]   And you know, people gave McCain a really hard time for saying the fundamentals of the
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.680]   economy are strong.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:40.280]   But to be honest, the thing that makes this country successful is that innovation, that
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.160]   spirit, that doesn't go away in tough times.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.680]   No, actually, and it actually increases because people have more free time.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:52.400]   I mean, if you look at what happened just in your own world when tech TV imploded, that's
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.240]   when Kevin Rhodes started doing dig, right?
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.040]   And built it for $6,000.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.040]   What happened?
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:01.240]   Peter Rojas, you know, I think got laid off from red herring or red herring imploded.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.920]   That's when he started Gizmodo and then came to work with us on Engadget.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:09.040]   You know, what happens when really talented people have nothing to do is they build something
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.320]   really interesting.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:15.160]   And so if it wasn't for the down market the last time, I don't think web logs, Inc or
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.080]   delicious Josh Schechter's company stumble upon.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.080]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.480]   Look, those things wouldn't have been built because those people would have been busy
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.480]   working for the man.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.960]   Dig wouldn't have happened, right, Sarah?
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:27.260]   I mean, Kevin and Vinod dig while he was at tech TV, but he would never have had the
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.160]   time to throw into it.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.480]   He was a G.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.720]   He was, I think was still San Francisco, but then he was a G4.
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:34.720]   Well, you would know.
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:35.720]   He was in LA.
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:36.720]   He was in LA.
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.720]   G4.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.720]   I'm not sure he'd be the definitive expert on this, I think.
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.720]   I remember the commercial.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.720]   I know.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.200]   So he was in LA when he had the idea for dig.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.040]   But it was, yeah, but it was this.
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.040]   And he quite shortly after.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.560]   I remember we had, he was on the show.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.560]   He said, I'm going to leave.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.520]   I mean, there was definitely some overlap when he was trying to figure out if it was
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.520]   the right thing to do.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.720]   And had he not left, he would never have had time to make it.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.720]   Oh, never.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.720]   He had to leave.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:01.760]   I mean, he wanted to anyway, but he would have had to make a choice.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.520]   And obviously it was really, really the right one.
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.520]   In retrospect.
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:07.520]   I guess.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.520]   I know.
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:09.520]   Who got your dig?
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.600]   I tried to buy it from him.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.920]   I took him to lunch in Santa Monica and had sushi.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:18.560]   And I was like, yeah, I said, that's the sort of back story to the whole thing was, you
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:22.640]   know, I realized it was sending like a thousand people to engage it every time somebody got
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.640]   in the home page.
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:27.200]   And I was like, listen, we'll put dig buttons on the entire web log sync network, which was
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.800]   much bigger than dig at the time.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.880]   And I was like, listen, I want to buy half of it, two million bucks, make it a four million
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.120]   dollar valuation.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:37.880]   We want to get, you know, give you 25% cash or 25% equity, whatever.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.560]   I wanted to make it a web log sync property.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:44.160]   And he was like, well, my friend knows Mark and Driesin and he might invest.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.640]   And I guess that's when he met Jay and lucky for him, he didn't do the deal with me and
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:48.640]   he did the deal with Jay.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.640]   I don't know.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.640]   So lucky.
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.640]   Yeah, I would have, I mean, I don't know.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:52.640]   He would have.
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.160]   He definitely if he became part of what's like, saying would have made a couple of million
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:58.120]   dollars, but I think he's done much better doing his own thing.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.120]   Speaking of ink, he's on the cover of ink this week.
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.120]   Wow.
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:05.080]   And now he's in the other like the inside the magazine.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.080]   The foot.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.080]   Is he in a gatefold?
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.080]   Yeah.
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.080]   Well, it's like a fireplace.
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.360]   It's a bunch of people chasing him down the street.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.360]   You're kidding.
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.360]   No, I'm not.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.360]   You see London.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.600]   I was in London with him for Foa.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.600]   And he did a dig.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.680]   You know, we both spoke of the same conference.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.600]   He did a live dignity.
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.560]   And it was packed with people.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:29.080]   And then they had an after party and there were so many people trying to get to him and
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:36.320]   Alex that they created like a VIP area for him where, you know, it was along these stairs
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:41.160]   and a balcony and they couldn't let him walk through the restaurant alone because it
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:46.720]   like the Bono or Jesus Christ or something like 100 100 people would collapse on him,
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.720]   literally.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.920]   Can you feel the jealousy emanating off of me right now?
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:52.040]   Like Bono and Jesus Christ.
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.840]   I swear to God, I want that.
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:55.840]   You want that?
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.200]   He's the it says the hottest small company in America.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:03.280]   I have Kevin Rose, founder of dig captured the hearts and minds of the most desirable.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.000]   And I can't read the rest.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.480]   La la la la la la.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.480]   Something really good.
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.480]   La la la la la.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.480]   Something really good.
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.240]   I think it's a very nice cover.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.680]   So let's talk about other crazy tech mainstream endorsements.
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.480]   Oprah and the Kindle.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.480]   What?
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:18.480]   This is weird.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:19.480]   She spends the whole show.
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.480]   Did you see the show?
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:21.480]   Anybody?
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.480]   I saw part of it.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.360]   She spends the whole show talking about the Kindle.
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:28.000]   Well, you know, it's it's it's like it's such a weird Oprah effect.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   I mean, I understand it.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   But it's like an ad.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Did they pay for that?
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   I don't know.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.280]   I I can't imagine that that would have that would be like a full show.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.240]   The full show doesn't have.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.240]   She doesn't need the money.
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:44.440]   No, I can't imagine that she was just on the show or is it over?
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.320]   It's on the show supposedly.
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:48.640]   Did he laugh?
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.640]   I want to hear.
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.640]   I see him.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:55.120]   You would have remembered that.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.120]   So she she.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.720]   I can't wait to see the Kindle sales.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:02.240]   See, this is why I think it's an ad because she offers a $50 off coupon, right?
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.240]   Well, hard book club.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.240]   Oh, man, it did.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.240]   It did.
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.240]   A tremendous amount of money.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.240]   So I think if she I wouldn't.
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.600]   It's all related, I guess.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:13.000]   When she when she stopped doing the book club publishers all over the world broke down in
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.840]   tears, she was making it.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:21.320]   She hopefully do an Oprah, um, an Oprah version of the Kindle that comes with hard 10 favorite
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:24.160]   books and charge an extra $99 for it.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.680]   That would be the dope move.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.360]   I'm absolutely sure that will happen.
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:31.280]   She calls it her now favorite or new favorite gadget.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:36.400]   There is a 30 second commercial on the Amazon site in which she describes it as life changing
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.160]   for me and the wave of the future.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.120]   Oh, everything's life changing for Oprah.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.000]   That is true, actually.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.440]   It's not like the definition of what's on Oprah is it has to be life changing.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:51.440]   Yeah, but but everybody watches Oprah whatever she says.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.440]   I mean, it's true.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:55.040]   I mean, what if Kevin Rose has an army?
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:58.800]   Oprah's got a small leg on up on Kevin.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:30:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.560]   She got it as a quote gift.
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:03.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:05.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.200]   I get a gift gift.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:15.480]   You know, Charlie Rose, Martha Stewart, uh, also have talked about the Kindle and and and
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.840]   effectively endorsed it, but Oprah is the big one.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:22.480]   So unfortunately the, um, it was just an ice this week that the, uh, the Kindle is,
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.080]   is going to be delayed until the new year in England.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.360]   It was supposed to come out of Christmas.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.000]   Oh, you don't have it, Kindle?
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.520]   No, you can't buy it over here.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.520]   Losers.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.520]   Otherwise I would have one.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:34.240]   So it was supposed to come out in time for Christmas here, but, um, problems with the
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:39.240]   licensing, um, for the three, for the, for the, for the cellular networks over here.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:42.600]   I mean, it's not going to be out until the beginning of next year.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:50.720]   The New York Times posits that this makes the Kindle a mainstream gadget now.
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.120]   I don't think that's going to, I don't think.
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:56.360]   As much as Oprah, wait as Oprah carries and I have to admit on my radio show, somebody
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:57.880]   called and said, I'm not an early adopter.
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.280]   I'm not a gadget queen, but I saw Kindle on Oprah.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.800]   What do you think?
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:05.560]   But I just can't believe that that would make the difference and put Kindle over the
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:06.560]   top.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:07.560]   I think it's going to take more than that.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:08.560]   Don't you?
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:13.920]   Um, this is going to have a big impact and the products, the products getting better.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:19.480]   So, um, I think a lot of people who watch Oprah are going to get it home and go, huh?
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:23.200]   I think what the Kindle needs is another spin.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:28.240]   It needs just another go around the block, just a slightly nicer hardware design and another
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.440]   sort of marketing push.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:33.040]   And I think, I think, you know, with Oprah, it's kind of got like three quarters of the
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.760]   way there to mainstream.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.880]   And I think if they just re-spin it and do another push on it, they could really put
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:38.880]   it over the top.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:42.520]   You know, the iPod wasn't big until the second or third revision, right?
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.520]   Oh, really?
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.520]   Is that true?
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:45.520]   It didn't really take off right away.
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:46.520]   No, it didn't.
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.520]   Yeah, it took a while.
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.520]   Interesting.
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:51.000]   I did from the very beginning, but I guess in terms of-
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   We liked it.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   Very expensive.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   People didn't understand it.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.880]   It was when actually when they got iTunes store working right, that's when it really
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:00.160]   took off.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.840]   Google's founder's own a fighter jet.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:02.840]   Yay.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:03.840]   Maybe they may have done.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.160]   Now, maybe this is the sign of the bottom.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:09.600]   There has been a fighter jet spotted at Moffat Field.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:14.040]   It is owned by the company that owns all of Google's other jets.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:16.400]   Uh, this, this is the weird thing.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:20.720]   It's not the first time a tech entrepreneur has owned a fighter jet.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.720]   L'Orealison.
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.120]   L'Orealison is owned one.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.320]   Well, because I read this and I was like a fighter jet.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.240]   Now, this is just getting wild.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.320]   And then I read on and oh no, that's already been done before by L'Orealison.
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.680]   That's so weird.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.440]   So it's one of yours, Will.
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.360]   It's a Dornier Alpha jet.
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:37.360]   Okay.
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.360]   Uh, I'll pretend like I know what that is.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.520]   Well, you know, one of yours.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:43.080]   It's a British thing.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:44.080]   Cool.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.560]   Or at least they're buying sensitively.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.760]   I think it's British.
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:49.760]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:50.760]   I don't know.
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:51.760]   It's uh...
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:52.920]   What do they need a fighter jet for?
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.240]   Is it just for giggles?
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.760]   Oh no, it's German and French.
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:57.360]   Now there's a weird combination.
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.520]   Well, one of them is a pilot.
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:00.520]   Yeah.
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:01.520]   What happened?
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:02.520]   I think it's...
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.520]   So I think it's, you know...
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.520]   Schmitt's a pilot.
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:08.200]   And also Larry Page is learning how to fly helicopters.
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:13.400]   What happens is when people make a lot of money, there is this phenomenon called toxic
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:17.880]   wealth where they basically make enough money to kill themselves.
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:22.160]   And they have all this free time and they start pushing me up below.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.400]   And there was a famous story about it.
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.960]   The guy who did Eagle Computer, which was supposed to be...
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.560]   Remember it very well, yeah.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.840]   Eagle Computer was supposed to be like HP or...
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.480]   It was my first IBM clone.
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.080]   I bought a bunch of them.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.080]   Exactly.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:40.240]   And the guy who was running it killed himself in Dennis Barnhart was killed in the crash
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:42.400]   of his new Ferrari leaving the company.
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.400]   Oh, geez.
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.360]   This is the day of the IPO.
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:49.640]   He bought a Ferrari and he lost control of it.
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.840]   I think him and his lawyer were killed.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:57.520]   So that's always the anecdote they tell people who get rich with their IPs.
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.520]   Well, yeah.
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:59.520]   Yeah.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.520]   Well, I mean, look at John Denver.
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.680]   Like this guy's flying experimental planes.
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:02.680]   It's like, you know what?
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:03.920]   Well, I'm working another story there.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:04.920]   I don't know.
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.120]   Well, I mean, but why is he flying experimental planes?
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.120]   Right.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:10.440]   I think that's a special pilot.
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:14.320]   Why don't you get like this master of the universe feeling where you just feel invulnerable
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.320]   and you can do anything?
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:18.280]   And then there's the other problem is you have so much money, you can't spend it fast
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.280]   enough.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:23.160]   It's a Tony Stark kind of a thing, you know, where it's like, okay, when you get to the
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:29.080]   point where every single desire or want has been taken care of, you start thinking about
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.800]   experiences and pushing the envelope and there is a little bit of that master of the universe
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.800]   slash...
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:34.800]   Invulnerable.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.800]   What next?
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.800]   Right.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.520]   You know, like, okay, I can own the plane.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.520]   Now I need to fly it, you know, like you start...
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.040]   Lily is like a Tony Stark kind of a...
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.040]   Who's Tony Stark?
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.040]   Is that Alan Strud?
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.040]   Yeah, Iron Man.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.040]   Iron Man, Iron Man, I should...
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:52.440]   You know, like you have all those money and then you start doing crazy things because
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:55.640]   it's to a certain extent, it's boredom, you know.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:59.520]   Do you think that Larry Page will become the next superhero?
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.480]   I think there's a chance he already is actually.
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:06.480]   I think that he might be operating underground taking out Al-Qaeda guys.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.040]   They have a fighter jet.
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:12.600]   I actually know he looked diesel when I saw him at Fucamp a year ago.
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:13.720]   He looked like he was working out.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:14.720]   I mean, he is like...
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:22.360]   Hey, if I could afford a gym in the house, a cook to make perfect meals for me, a 24/7
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.920]   trainer, I could look good too.
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:26.440]   No doubt.
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:27.440]   Maybe not.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.480]   But anyway, these planes are very dangerous.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.480]   I know I had a friend that I had one.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.680]   Yeah, and they burn a lot of jets.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:37.120]   They go really fast and it's just like...
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:41.040]   Here's somebody who isn't saying, "Oh gosh, I better not buy this.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.040]   What will people think?"
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.760]   Here's somebody who probably bought it a long time ago.
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:45.760]   It's not on their radar.
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:46.760]   Well, one of the things, they do have a deal.
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:50.920]   The reason they're storing it in NASA Ames beside the fact that they lease this government
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:55.240]   property to house all their jets is that they have a deal to do scientific missions for
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.240]   NASA.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.240]   And that's what they say.
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:58.240]   This jet is going to be...
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.240]   We're going to use it.
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.280]   Maybe they could fix the Hubble.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:06.440]   It's a great...I've actually flown into that airport on a friend of mine playing.
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.440]   Really?
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:10.160]   Yeah, I can't say who, but it's basically...
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:14.240]   The rich guy, cool thing to do is to fly into that airport because it's right next to
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.240]   the plane.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.240]   Right.
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:21.640]   And it's cool enough to fly into SFO, but you fly into SFO, you go through the private
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:27.120]   terminal and the private terminal is like, "You see people there, but when you fly into
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.960]   the government thing, you don't see anybody."
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.400]   It's like really cool.
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.520]   The men in black come to help you.
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.120]   So I watch Entourage.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:39.400]   Is it true that in the private jet port like they have these really hot storitizes?
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.400]   Yes.
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:43.400]   Next question.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.800]   That doesn't seem right somehow.
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.800]   Yeah, that sounds about right.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.400]   They just hate for trade, exactly.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.120]   It's really what it's like?
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.120]   They portray it pretty accurate.
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.240]   I mean, just so everybody's clear, I don't have the money to have a play and I don't
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.240]   fly.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:58.240]   No, you have friends in high places.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:01.800]   Yeah, I fly on private just a couple of times a year probably.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.640]   It's exactly like they showed on Entourage.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:06.240]   You fly into a hangar like that.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:11.120]   In the hangar, there's like two or three planes and they're parked on angles and the entire
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:15.160]   crew is out there waiting for you and you pull up in your car, you get out and then they
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.160]   take your car.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.160]   So it's pretty dope.
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.400]   Yeah, it sounds, you know.
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.200]   Would you like that kind of life stuff?
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.200]   Sure.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.200]   Pretty ridiculous.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.760]   It's totally unjustified.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:29.560]   I have too much of a New England Puritan streak.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:30.560]   I would feel guilty.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:31.560]   I couldn't enjoy it.
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:35.160]   I thought guilty for about the 15 minutes.
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.160]   I thought guilty for about 15 minutes.
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.960]   And then enjoyed it.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:39.960]   Absolutely.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:42.960]   I'm going to feel really guilty if I don't take a break and mention Audible.com.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:47.040]   Jason, you may start squirming.
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.960]   Jason gets orgasmic whenever I mention it.
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:54.640]   Audible.com is the place where you go to get your audiobooks, the best audiobooks
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:55.640]   in the world.
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:56.640]   51,000 titles.
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.400]   I'm a big fan of Audible.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.320]   There are two plans that we talk about.
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.480]   There's the gold plan.
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.480]   That's a book a month.
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:06.800]   But I also want to mention the Audible Platinum plan.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:12.600]   That is for, I think it's 15, 25, I can't remember the price, 25 bucks a month.
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:13.600]   I pay it.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.040]   I don't even know what it is.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.360]   You get two books a month.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:22.600]   Now if you sign up now at Audible.com/twit2, the number two, for the Platinum plan, we're
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.400]   going to give you two free books.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.800]   So you're going to have the chance to download and enjoy two free books if you decide not
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:28.800]   to stick around.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.680]   No charge and you get to keep the books.
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:31.680]   But I think you're going to want to.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:32.680]   There's so many great books.
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:33.680]   What are you listening to these days, Jason?
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:34.680]   You got one to...
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:35.680]   You know what?
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.680]   I just bought this book and I got to get my iPhone because I've got the name of it.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:44.120]   I bought this globalization book that Fred Wilson keeps talking about.
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.120]   It's not the world is flat, but it's like that.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.240]   Well, Thomas Friedman does have a new book on there.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.240]   I noticed.
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:50.240]   He does.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.240]   Yeah.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.520]   But there's this other book on globalization that I've been reading or listening to.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.840]   I was listening to a playing poker the other day and it's awesome.
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:56.840]   And I just...
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:57.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.240]   Now you told us that you listen to music while you play poker.
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.400]   You also listen to books?
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.640]   Yeah, I do that sometimes.
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:03.640]   That's pretty funny.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.840]   So you really don't have to pay attention.
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.400]   Is that on the beginning tables?
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.400]   But then I have another...
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.440]   I have a trick I use when I'm in tournaments, which is I put my headphones on, I play with
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:16.960]   my phone, but I don't actually turn on the music and I pretend like I'm totally distracted,
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.880]   but I'm actually paying attention and then people start talking about...
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:20.880]   They think you're not listening.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:21.880]   You actually sing.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:22.880]   You actually start...
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.640]   That would be good actually.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:28.680]   I just like not your handle.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.960]   How about the five temptations of a CEO?
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:31.960]   Is that it?
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:32.960]   No.
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.960]   I'm looking at the...
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.760]   The business books are really good, but see, and I listen to some of those.
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.320]   I love the history.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:44.400]   I love the nonfiction, but I also love the fiction.
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.720]   They've got a great selection of sci-fi and fantasy.
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:47.720]   There's just a ton of great stuff.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:51.000]   Let me just recommend you visit audible.com.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.880]   Browse around when you find something you want.
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.240]   You see, I got two credits right here.
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:59.120]   When you find something you want, go to audible.com/twit2.
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.960]   You're going to get two credits, two free credits towards books.
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:02.960]   Most books are a credit.
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:06.240]   Some of the larger books are two or more credits, just so you know.
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:11.520]   Anitham turns out to be a couple of credits, but you're just going to have a great time.
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.240]   The seven habits of highly effective people.
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.240]   What is the...
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:17.960]   Is there one business book that you think is just a must read, Jason?
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:20.320]   Oh, I think the degrade and crossing the castle.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.320]   I love good degrade.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:22.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:26.120]   The last time you were on, you recommend good de ray.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:27.560]   I don't think it's on all of them.
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.320]   It's not on there yet now.
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.320]   Which is a bummer.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:31.320]   Let me see if...
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.560]   By the way, that is not audible.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:33.560]   That is the publisher.
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.800]   The publisher gets to decide.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:39.200]   A lot of times publishers, for some reason, how about crossing Hoffa?
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.840]   A Teamsters story.
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.840]   Black Creek crossing, crossing the lines.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.280]   They don't think they have that one either.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.440]   Crossing the castle is not out here.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:52.000]   I just bought one from iTunes and when you buy it on iTunes, some of them are audible.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.200]   I know it's audible because when it started, it said...
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.800]   This is audible.
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.600]   This presentation was brought to you by all of them.
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:58.760]   I thought them to let me do.
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.160]   This is audible.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.200]   I could do something a good job of that.
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.680]   This is audible.
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:07.600]   Awful.com/twit to check it out.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:08.600]   Really, you're going to love it.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.160]   If you listen to podcasts, you will love audible.com.
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:13.360]   We thank you so much for their support.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:16.280]   This a week in tech.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.280]   Let's see.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.280]   What else is on the agenda?
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:19.480]   There's a lot of news this week.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:24.480]   We got into the political stuff, but we didn't mention the woman who's going to jail over
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.480]   murdering.
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:26.760]   Well, this is weird.
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.400]   I almost don't even believe this story.
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.560]   If the BBC hadn't published it, I wouldn't have known.
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.360]   No, I read it somewhere else.
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:37.480]   Yeah, but it's a woman who's been arrested in Japan after she allegedly killed her...
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:38.480]   Online.
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:39.880]   Virtual husband.
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:40.880]   Yeah.
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.800]   Well, he divorced her online.
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:45.800]   She got mad and supposedly hacked into his computer.
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:46.800]   Killed the character.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:47.800]   Yeah, killed the...
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:48.800]   I don't know.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.680]   The game is Maple's story, which I don't know.
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.320]   I guess it's probably big in Japan.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:43:00.960]   I guess it's a matter of that she invaded his privacy.
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.600]   Yeah, she broke the law in the sense that she hacked him.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:08.040]   It's just the circumstances are you can't help it bath a little.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:11.800]   Yeah, the crime is unauthorized computer usage and hacking and all this kind of things.
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:12.800]   Yeah, but five years.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:13.800]   I know that has lied in it.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:14.800]   Five years.
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:18.120]   You know, the woman goes to jail for killing virtual person.
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:19.480]   Which is pretty hilarious.
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:23.240]   So a police official according to the Associated Press said the woman had used the man's ID
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:27.840]   and password to log into the game last May to carry out the virtual murder.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:31.800]   She said, "I was suddenly divorced without a word of warning that made me so angry.
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:32.800]   You could see...
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:33.800]   I could see doing this.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.800]   It's better than killing the guy."
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:36.800]   Well, yeah.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:37.800]   Yeah.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:39.800]   I mean, do you even know each other?
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:40.800]   Exactly.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:41.800]   Do the real people know each other?
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:42.800]   Do you think they ever met?
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:43.800]   I don't know.
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:44.800]   Maybe they never even met.
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:46.080]   I mean, word to the wise.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.320]   Don't kill your online.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.080]   Don't divorce your online wife.
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:54.560]   Even if the online world divorce is a tricky, it's a tricky.
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:58.800]   She lives 620 miles away, a thousand kilometers away.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:02.400]   In southern Miyazaki, her husband lives in Sapporo.
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.120]   He's a 33 year old office worker.
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:06.840]   She's a 43 year old housewife.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:08.000]   It was never going to work.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.640]   I'm sorry, piano teacher.
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:10.800]   Doomed from the start.
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:14.440]   Long distance, age difference.
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:15.880]   She likes pianos.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:17.040]   He likes piano bars.
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.040]   It's just not going to work.
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.040]   It was just, yeah.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:22.240]   I mean, it's a...
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:25.800]   She was a woman scorned who happened to play online games.
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:29.800]   I tell you, I can understand that.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.000]   I think it's a great story.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.400]   Women can be very...
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.400]   Men.
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:34.400]   Men can be vengeful too.
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:35.800]   Let's not be sexist here.
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:36.800]   That's true.
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.600]   Well, on the subject, what is this?
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:42.200]   Apple donates $100,000 to...
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:43.600]   What is prop eight?
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:44.760]   Oh, we get to that in a second.
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:45.760]   I just want to...
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:49.680]   Jerry Brace in our chat room said she auto-exec.bat at his head in.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:49.680]   Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:45:01.840]   Little doss humor to make sure that the geeks are still awake.
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:02.840]   Probably.
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:04.840]   This is actually a little bit controversial.
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:09.040]   Well, with some anyway, prop eight is a California state proposition.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:15.600]   California, we have this kind of weird proposition referendum thing that is not very hard to
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:18.480]   get something on the ballot.
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.720]   The problem is that people were upset with the state legislature for not getting anything
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:22.720]   done.
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:27.000]   So they put this mechanism in where the voters get to just throw anything up there and everybody
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.920]   has to decide it.
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:32.720]   This prop eight is a yes vote on it.
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:37.600]   Over turns California state law and adds a constitutional amendment saying it's illegal
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:41.080]   for anybody to get married if they're not a man and a woman.
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:43.920]   In other words, gay marriage.
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.160]   And this is confusing by itself.
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:47.400]   A yes vote says no to gay marriage.
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:50.000]   No vote says yes to gay marriage.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.720]   This is, you already see the problem here.
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.920]   So Apple, which Apple is a very...
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:56.480]   Steve Jobs is a liberal guy.
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:57.480]   He's a vegan.
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.480]   His wife...
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:45:59.480]   Is he a vegan?
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:01.480]   How did I not know that?
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:02.480]   Yeah.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:03.480]   No, in fact, his wife wanted to start a...
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.640]   I don't know if she did a vegan food company.
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:06.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:07.640]   You're right.
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:08.640]   I do remember that.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.080]   No, he's very hip.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:17.040]   Apple has always had good workplace rules for...
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.240]   What do they call it?
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:19.240]   Partners?
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:20.240]   Domestic partnerships.
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.240]   Domestic partnerships.
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.520]   They have great domestic partnership benefits.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.880]   So they've always been promoted that.
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:30.720]   So just sort of thing that you would sort of expect from this company about the same
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:31.960]   time, it's quite a statement.
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:32.960]   It's very political.
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.600]   Google also put money into this.
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:39.840]   It's about time because the fact is the fact that we're even having this discussion is
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:40.840]   day and age is just...
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:45.200]   People are going to look back 20, 30, 40 years from now and be like, "How could anybody
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:49.480]   not speak up when people's fundamental rights were being taken away from them?"
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:50.480]   That's not right.
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.480]   It's just unbelievable.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:56.840]   But as a business, it's a little risky because there are some very...
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:59.920]   There are people who feel very strongly about this issue.
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:01.600]   And I'm sure they're...
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:03.360]   The Christian right is big on boycotts.
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.360]   I'm sure there'll be a boycott against Apple.
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:07.040]   Yeah, but you know what?
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:11.160]   I think that at a certain point, there'll be a tipping point where it's like, "Okay, you
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:15.720]   have all these middle American folks who are against gay marriage, but they have gay
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:21.720]   people in their families and they watch Ellen DeGeneres and they like Lindsay Lohan if she's
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:22.720]   gay or not.
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:24.280]   Who knows exactly what's going on there?
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:25.280]   Lindsay Lohan is gay.
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:26.280]   Leo, come on.
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:29.280]   Yeah, she was dating this woman Samantha Ronson.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:30.280]   Anyway, pointy...
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.320]   Oh my God, my hopes and free stuff.
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.160]   Yes, what a catch.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.720]   She's probably by second.
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:36.720]   Oh, anyway.
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:37.720]   It's over yet.
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:39.720]   I think we've gone to the point where we're...
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:41.840]   That's the title of this show, by the way.
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:42.840]   Lindsay Lohan is gay.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:49.440]   I don't think they're actually playing out on too hard of a limb here.
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:52.640]   The fundamentalists are such a small group of people even though they're vocal.
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.600]   You're at a certain point, smart people in the world have to speak up and go, "You
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:56.600]   know what?
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:57.600]   Enough.
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:58.600]   Let people...
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:00.320]   I think they want to be married, be married."
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:04.000]   I think it's a great quote from the chat room, which is, "What gay people have as much
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.720]   right to be miserable as a man could be."
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:09.640]   I've never really understood this man as a woman thing.
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:10.640]   You know what they're doing though?
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:13.840]   In the ads here in California, it's one of the reasons this is actually a very close
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:16.000]   vote, believe it or not.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.400]   The no-one, eight people had a strong lead that's been eroded away and the polls say
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:21.120]   now it's almost neck and neck.
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:25.760]   One of the reasons they've run ads that are a little scurrilous in which they say, "Hey,
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:30.680]   if this law passes, or rather, if it doesn't pass," which is very good of you.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:32.840]   I mean, half the people are going to vote wrong just because they don't understand what
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:33.840]   the...
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:34.840]   Yes, for James' marriage.
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:35.840]   Yes, on gay marriage.
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:36.840]   No, it's...
[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:38.840]   Yes, vote is a no-one gay marriage.
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:44.760]   Anyway, the ads say, "If we don't pass this, then kids as young as...
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:47.960]   Kindergarteners will have to be taught about gays marrying."
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:49.480]   That's, I guess, as scarce people.
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:50.960]   I don't know why.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:57.000]   If you had gay parents as a kindergartner, I would think that this would be a good thing.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   Right.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   Anyway, I think it's a brave thing for both Apple and Google to do, and do so publicly.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   Apple put $100,000 into it.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   Yeah, it's awesome.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   It's awesome.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.440]   It's to be commended, and everybody else should get it lined.
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:12.200]   By the way, the book I was talking about before Leo, I hate to do an audible ad in the middle
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:17.160]   of the show, but The Post American World by Farid Zakari.
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:21.320]   Oh, Farid Zakari is a news week, great news week author.
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:22.800]   He has a CNN show.
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:23.800]   It's fantastic.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:25.720]   His book is amazing.
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:30.360]   I mean, he really is breaking down on the book exactly what is going on in the world.
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:37.240]   And after I just did a three week trip, Athens, London, Korea, man, the world is changing
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:38.240]   radically.
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:41.120]   Well, you know, I believe that.
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:44.760]   I travel a lot, and I'm making sure my kids travel a lot because I think the world they're
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:46.960]   growing up into is a global world.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:52.840]   And you know, our business, a twit, is 30% of our audience now is outside of the US.
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:55.200]   It's a very global business, and I think this is the future.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.200]   30%, huh?
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:58.360]   Yeah, we're not talking about offshoring jobs.
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:00.760]   We're talking about the fact that it's a global economy now.
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:04.120]   We've been talking 35% of your audiences outside the US.
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:10.640]   You would not believe people know me as much for the companies I've done or the TechCrunch
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:13.160]   50 as for twit at this point.
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:15.600]   When I went to Athens, they had an open coffee.
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:17.520]   There were 250, 300 people there.
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:22.000]   I would say half the people who came up to me said, "Ah, dvorak/org.blog."
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.360]   When I was in London, people were like, "F" I was at the dignity and recording.
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:30.360]   And as we're walking out, people were like, "Dvorak, dvorak."
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:33.520]   You know, it's like, "Ah, I'm not going to do it.
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:34.520]   You know what I mean?"
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:36.360]   Now I know why John won't be on the field.
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:38.160]   It's that lousy impression.
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:41.600]   Oh, that impression is spreading so much.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:42.600]   It's incredible.
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:44.960]   In Korea, people were like, "I love you on twit."
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:46.440]   Oh, that's really great.
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:47.800]   And I had the same experience in Australia.
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:53.280]   I told you about the guy who on the plane wants to take a picture with me because he
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.040]   knows me from twit.
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:59.200]   I'm not using this as a way to tout twit, but I think it's an example of the fact that
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:03.840]   if you allow your business to be global, it absolutely will be global.
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:04.840]   And it's interesting because here we are.
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:08.680]   This is an English language broadcast and many of those countries, Korea, Greece, they
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:09.680]   don't...
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:12.160]   English is not their first language and yet they listen.
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:15.520]   For people under 20 years old in those countries, they all speak English now.
[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:17.920]   And they want to know about tech.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:18.920]   And they're...
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:24.880]   Yeah, the English language, the spreading of the English language is truly going to
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:30.280]   be amazing because this is amazing, amazing advantage for companies in the US.
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:35.880]   Like, Ignatian probably has as many people watching it outside the US as it is.
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:38.440]   I think it's really interesting that Kevin gets that response in London.
[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:39.440]   I mean, that's a very good example.
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.400]   Much bigger response than he would in the US, I think.
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:43.240]   And I should point out, the tech TV...
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:46.080]   Well, I guess we were seen in Britain, but not by a lot of people.
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:49.640]   I mean, tech TV was not a particularly global phenomenon.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:50.640]   And yet, a lot of the people...
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:52.920]   I don't think we could even get tech TV in Britain.
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:53.920]   I'm pretty sure that didn't be this difficult.
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:56.920]   We were big in Malaysia.
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:58.920]   And there was a club in Abu Dhabi.
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:00.520]   Not a lot of them.
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:01.920]   It was a little tech TV club.
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:02.920]   Aww, really?
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:03.920]   Isn't that cute?
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.800]   Yeah, they would gather and they would watch the show.
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:06.800]   Philippines?
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:07.800]   I remember we used to get a lot of food.
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:09.360]   We're big in the Philippines, Net24 broadcast.
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:13.640]   It's a huge business opportunity for Twit, I mean, and for Ignatian.
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:18.800]   They had Virgin sponsored, they did two shows over there.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:19.800]   You could...
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:21.400]   It's going to translate into dollars and cents.
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:23.880]   Well, what's interesting is advertising is not...
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:24.880]   Not yet global.
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:30.120]   It's very much at best national, usually regional, sometimes local.
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:34.320]   And so it's very hard for us to sell ads based on our international numbers.
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:39.320]   We actually cut our numbers by 25% when we sell our ads because...
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:40.320]   It's going to change quickly.
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.320]   It should.
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:44.040]   I mean, Audibles everywhere, Dell was everywhere, Visas everywhere.
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:46.040]   So they get the benefit, but they don't...
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:48.320]   The agency is only an American agency.
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:49.320]   So they...
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:50.320]   Well, wow, wow.
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:53.080]   No, no, what's going to happen is there is actually Google AdSense is operating now in
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:54.080]   these countries.
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:56.560]   Overture has been operating in a short while.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:57.720]   And there are ad buyers.
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:01.720]   So I remember at WebLogs Inc, we started getting people emailing us saying, "Can we buy your
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:08.520]   Canadian traffic from you for $5 CPM and we'll resell it for 25 or whatever?"
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:10.320]   So we started doing that.
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.640]   And I basically would put out a standing offer.
[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:15.960]   I'd tell people, "Give me $5 for each unit and you can do whatever you want with it as
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:19.200]   long as it's within tasteful means."
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:20.200]   And that's going to happen.
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:22.440]   People will come to you and say, "Can I..."
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:25.840]   "Can people download the show or auto insert the ads?"
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:27.760]   That technology is all being built right now.
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:33.000]   Yeah, unfortunately, our ads are really based around this kind of live read that we do.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.480]   And that may not translate well to that kind of thing.
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:37.480]   But I don't care.
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.960]   I'm happy doing what I'm doing.
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:41.880]   You'll wind up doing...
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:43.480]   You'll have a licensee.
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:44.480]   So that would be the way to do it.
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:45.480]   Yeah, that's a good idea.
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:46.960]   Yeah, that's what we do with a radio show.
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:50.800]   We license it to internationally and they take the ads out, but they put their own ads
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:51.800]   in.
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:53.680]   They catch out life for that.
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:54.680]   You should do it.
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:59.840]   You should go to the BBC or the Guardian or the Times of London or any of those people
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:02.240]   and just say, "Would you like to syndicate the show?"
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:06.520]   They'll put it on their website with their ads and just charge them a fee.
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:07.520]   It'll work.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:08.520]   I guarantee it.
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:11.360]   And it's going to be easier and easier to do as the infrastructure is built out.
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:12.360]   I've got...
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:15.360]   I think for the British ads, I actually can do...
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:16.360]   I think I have a...
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:17.360]   I just...
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:19.520]   Or put in these bad teeth.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:20.520]   And I say...
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:21.520]   I don't know, mate.
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:23.720]   Or like to sell you some candy.
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:25.480]   I think they go well, wouldn't it?
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:29.200]   Hello, I'm Gordon Ramsay for Twit this week in tech.
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:30.200]   Oh, they're so awful.
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:31.200]   Don't be a donkey.
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:32.200]   Don't be a donkey.
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:33.200]   Don't be a donkey.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:35.200]   Boy, what's a product there?
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:36.200]   I could sell.
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:38.560]   I'm literally crying right now.
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:41.680]   Smarties are like M&Ms, but for smart people.
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:42.680]   They're great.
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:43.680]   Eat more.
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.680]   Please, we love them everywhere.
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:46.680]   I love you.
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:47.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:51.440]   I'm sorry to tell you what's going on with those teeth and how much you look like a couple
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:52.440]   of people right now.
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:54.120]   Yeah, well, it's a British thing, you know.
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:55.120]   We don't go to the dating.
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:57.240]   It's so bad being next to you.
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:59.040]   It transforms your entire face.
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.040]   It's awful, isn't it?
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.040]   It's really...
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.040]   My kids hate it when I put those in the beat.
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:03.040]   I don't know why you were willing to...
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:05.360]   But we have free dental care.
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:06.360]   Halloween is not...
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:07.760]   You know, I think that's...
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:10.240]   Isn't that a colony against the Brits?
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:12.240]   You all have good teeth now.
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:16.880]   Although, you don't have the same fetish that we have in the States for earth, Adoncha.
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:20.480]   Oh, well, only in children.
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:21.960]   Oh, okay.
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:30.280]   So, there's a great amount of pediatric orthodonty, if that's a word, orthodonticism, which is
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:35.480]   how you get, you know, in all the tragic British books, sort of not tragic comedies,
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:36.480]   it's sort of...
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:39.680]   You know, all the kids grow up with these huge braces on their faces and this is what twists
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:40.680]   them into the name.
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:41.680]   Welcome to America.
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:42.920]   Let's take a break.
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:46.760]   I want to talk about the new G1 Googles first phone.
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:48.000]   It's out on the T-Mobile network.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.760]   I'm holding one right here in my little hand and I don't know if any of you have them,
[00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:52.920]   but we'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:58.720]   Before we do, though, I want to mention our friends, our good friends, that go to my PC.
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:00.720]   This is a product I've been using for a long time.
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:05.240]   If you travel, GoToMyPC is a lifesaver.
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:09.440]   GoToMyPC allows you to access your office computer from anywhere you can get online,
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:13.280]   whether it's an internet cafe, a hotel, the airport.
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:17.040]   You know, frankly, you can go home early or even spend one day less at the office and
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.040]   work from home with a boss.
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:19.240]   I'll never know you're gone.
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:20.560]   It's just like you're there.
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:24.840]   You go to GoToMyPC.com, there's your office computer, full screen.
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:26.800]   You can run any program, send and receive email.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.280]   You can access any network resource.
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:29.280]   You can...
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:30.540]   Well, that's my Google phone making noise.
[00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:32.000]   You can copy stuff over.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.080]   It's not a cute sound.
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:38.640]   You can do all of that just as if you're there in real time.
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:42.360]   And by the way, 128-bit SSL encryption.
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:43.720]   So you are...
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:44.720]   It's like a VPN.
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:49.120]   So if you're at an insecure place in every hotel, internet, very dangerous or internet
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:51.880]   cafes, very dangerous, not if you're using GoToMyPC.
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:55.720]   You're encrypted from that place, whether it's a Mac or PC, whatever you're using to
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:58.240]   get online, all the way to your office computer.
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:00.280]   So the security is fantastic.
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:03.840]   I want you to try GoToMyPC free right now.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:05.600]   30 days, absolutely free.
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:06.600]   Just go to GoToMyPC.
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:07.600]   Yeah, free.
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:08.600]   Free.
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:10.600]   I don't know how they make money, but that's their problem.
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:11.600]   Free for 30 days.
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:12.840]   So you try and get nothing to lose.
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:14.080]   They know you're going to get hooked.
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:15.080]   That's why.
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:19.960]   And in this economic times, you got sales calls, et cetera, you cut half the sales calls,
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:20.960]   you do a GoToMyPC.
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:24.480]   It's going to be just as effective and you're probably going to get the sale.
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:26.280]   And what's not to love?
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:30.400]   I just want to let you know that you don't have to do the ads with me, Jason.
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:35.640]   I'm just pointing out, in fact, if you're in a recession, this is something where everybody
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:37.240]   can look at their budgets for their startup.
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:39.120]   They can think about the sales calls.
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:41.960]   You cut half the sales calls, you're doing four or five a month.
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:42.960]   That's really true.
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:45.160]   10 grand a month is 100 and 20.
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:48.240]   Don't confuse this with GoToMeeting, another of their products where you could do the sales
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:49.240]   meetings.
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:50.240]   That's really cool.
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:51.240]   As GoToMyPC, right?
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:53.320]   This allows you to access your office computer.
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:54.320]   Same technology.
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:56.160]   Citrix, really, these are the guys.
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:57.160]   I remember at Yakobuchu.
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:59.200]   I'm a professor of support too, like your training.
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:00.200]   Oh, yes.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.200]   I use it with my mom.
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:02.200]   Right.
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:03.200]   So that's what I'm talking about.
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:06.680]   You could go and take over somebody's PC, train them how to use the software or walk
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:07.680]   through the stuff.
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:08.680]   Oh, no.
[00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:12.080]   You know, mom's not going to get through the firewall and the security I put on, but she
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:13.080]   doesn't have to.
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:18.640]   Go to my PC completely, securely, configures itself to go through them.
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:23.960]   They use basically a triangle method so that you're outbound on both edges.
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:24.960]   You geeks know what I mean.
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:27.120]   It is an absolutely secure, safe and easy way.
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:28.120]   I want you to use it free.
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:29.120]   Go to myPC.com/twit.
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:30.920]   That's all you have to know.
[00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:32.960]   Go to myPC.com/twit.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.200]   30 days.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:36.040]   Absolutely free.
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:38.840]   You got a Google phone yet, Jason?
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:42.160]   I don't have one, but I was playing with it yesterday, actually.
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:43.880]   What do you think?
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:45.360]   It's a beautiful screen.
[00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:47.680]   Yeah, it's much better than I expected, frankly.
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:48.680]   Great keyboard.
[00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:50.840]   I've seen some of the work I used.
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:52.440]   I love the way this flips.
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:53.440]   It feels good.
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:54.440]   Well, you used a sidekick.
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:55.440]   I was a sidekick user.
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:56.840]   Weren't you a sidekick user for a while, sir?
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:57.840]   Yeah, it was.
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:00.040]   And it's the same guy, Ruben, the guy who designed this for Google.
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:01.440]   I like this a lot better than the sidekick.
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:02.440]   It's much better.
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:03.440]   It's a grown-up sidekick.
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:08.000]   You feel when you slide it up, the keyboard is excellent.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   The build is good.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.400]   HTC did a really solid build on this.
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:14.800]   Android is a good operating system.
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:15.800]   It's fast.
[00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:16.800]   The touchscreen is good.
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:19.480]   I wish there were more apps, but that's going to happen soon, right?
[00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:26.280]   And applications like that, the people at iTunes won't approve will be available, so...
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:27.280]   Exactly.
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:30.360]   It's like, this is really going to force...
[00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:33.280]   I think this is a serious threat to the iPhone because I looked at it and I was like,
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:35.320]   this is not much different than my iPhone.
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:36.320]   And if I can get such...
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:37.320]   Oh, Josh, I'm telling your wife.
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:38.320]   Whoops.
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:39.320]   Sorry, she's in Mexico.
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:40.320]   Press the red button.
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:41.320]   She'll never know.
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:42.320]   There we go.
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:43.320]   Sorry, Jennifer.
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:45.320]   If the phone rings in Mexico, don't pick it up.
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:48.160]   Just say it, but I'm looking around.
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:50.160]   Yeah, it's easy.
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:51.680]   You see, I made those buttons on the front.
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:54.760]   That's where the program called AnyCut that allows you to dial or text somebody right
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:57.240]   from the front, which I really love.
[00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:59.160]   So already, there's some interesting third-party stuff.
[00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:00.840]   It doesn't come with a video player.
[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:01.840]   Weird.
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.240]   But somebody wrote one.
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:04.240]   Yeah, that'd be the cool thing.
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:09.720]   I was like, why can't I use Ustream on my iPhone or, you know, quick on my iPhone?
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:12.480]   And, you know, it's gonna happen.
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.160]   It's gonna happen on this thing, I think.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:19.480]   And, you know, the iPhone, no matter what they do, they're still gonna start charging
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.000]   two or $300 for that device.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.040]   So this device is gonna wind up being free, I'm sure.
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.320]   What does it cost now?
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.400]   It's $179.
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.400]   It'll be.
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:32.440]   From T-Mobile is the negative because T-Mobile's third-generation wireless data network isn't
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.240]   very good yet, not very widespread.
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.320]   So I'm using Edge here, but it works great with Wi-Fi.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:41.400]   I'll tell you where the real townfall is, and it's the same problem with the iPhone.
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:42.400]   Three hours' battery life.
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.400]   I mean, it dies.
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:44.400]   You can't get it through the day.
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:45.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:46.400]   I mean, I can't deal with that.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.400]   It's a tough problem.
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:48.400]   I can't.
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:52.200]   No, it does have a USB power adapter as opposed to the proprietary adapter on the iPhone.
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.160]   So I just have little USB plugs everywhere.
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.640]   You can even charge it from your computer.
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.520]   But it doesn't have great battery life.
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:58.920]   And I have to say that just kills me.
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:01.120]   There is something about it too.
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:05.080]   You know, it feels great, but it doesn't feel like an iPhone.
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.920]   And I'm not trying to be like a snobby.
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:07.920]   Are you an iPhone user?
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:08.920]   I don't even have an iPhone.
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:12.000]   I'm still rocking the Blackberry Pro, which is not really what I'm not for meaning for.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.480]   Well, I think that the bolt comes out tomorrow and the storm will be out soon.
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.480]   Here's the iPhone.
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.480]   It's just...
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.480]   It's just...
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.480]   It's just...
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:20.480]   There's this...
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:21.480]   There's that.
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:22.480]   There's the elegance.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:23.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.480]   You know, I don't want to say sexiness because everybody says that on the iPhone.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:25.480]   No, it's elegant.
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:26.840]   I don't think this phone is sexy, but it is elegant.
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:27.840]   Yeah.
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.680]   I think that's probably the exactly right word.
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:30.680]   And that's Steve Jobs.
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:31.680]   I think I got good taste.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:32.680]   Good taste.
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:33.680]   That vegan.
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:36.440]   I mean, I hear he's a piscitarian.
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:39.360]   Has anyone ever gone on a bathroom break during Twit before?
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.360]   Please do.
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:41.360]   Thank you.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.360]   You know why when you do take off the microphone?
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:43.360]   Yeah.
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:44.360]   We don't want to...
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:45.360]   Yeah.
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:46.360]   Yeah.
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.360]   It's much different.
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:48.360]   I'll be right back.
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:49.720]   And when we do that, by the way, I say...
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:54.160]   Actually, I was the first to do it and all we do is we say another Twit is in the can.
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:55.160]   Let's...
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.880]   Now, you were a big...
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.680]   You were a big iPhone guy.
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:02.440]   Will, are you excited about the G1?
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.120]   Will it be available in the UK?
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.120]   Yeah.
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.360]   So it's available here right now.
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:14.040]   I am not overly excited because the thing that really gets me going about my iPhone is
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:15.880]   the iTunes integration.
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:16.880]   Right.
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:17.880]   This is not a media...
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:20.360]   This is emphatically not a media player.
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:21.360]   And so...
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:22.360]   I think it doesn't have a standard...
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:23.360]   I mean, that's...
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:25.360]   Over the last couple of years, I...
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.360]   Well, not a couple of years.
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:27.360]   Last year.
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:34.480]   I'm just just having my one device that is my phone and my PDA and my iPod.
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:37.120]   And so this is not going to be an iPod replacement.
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.560]   So it's not really interesting to me.
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:40.560]   It does have...
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:41.560]   I like this.
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:43.920]   It comes with the application to buy on the Amazon MP3 store.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.200]   Customized for the phone.
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:46.200]   Works very well.
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:49.840]   I bought the police for $5.
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:52.600]   It's very easy to use downloads right to the phone.
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:56.160]   The phone stores it on the SD card, unprotected, easily accessed.
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.320]   So there's an advantage, but it just doesn't...
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:02:59.960]   The media player is just not as good.
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:00.960]   And mostly...
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:01.960]   I think for me is...
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:02.960]   Yeah.
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:06.880]   Is that the iPod or rather the iPhone, the advantages in the ecosystem, it's in the software
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:07.880]   on the desktop.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:09.880]   Well, you've got to look at the Amazon software.
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:10.880]   I'm just going.
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:11.880]   All right.
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:14.160]   I mean, it's pretty obvious where this is going, right?
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.160]   Where Android is going.
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:16.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:17.160]   Right.
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.880]   I mean, this is going to be a desktop operating system.
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:19.880]   I mean, it's so obvious.
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:20.880]   It's starting to...
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:21.880]   It already is.
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:22.880]   Well...
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.080]   I mean, in the sense that this is...
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:25.640]   I would say this is a great OS.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:26.640]   You know, it's Linux, right?
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:27.640]   I mean, it's not like the...
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:30.720]   It's Linux card, but I mean, it's got this whole runtime on top of it.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:36.840]   But the real future of computing right now is not mobile and it's not desktops.
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:37.840]   It's that space in between.
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:41.600]   I don't consider the iPhone a phone as much as I consider it like a small laptop.
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.600]   Right.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.600]   And these netbooks are people getting really excited.
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:45.600]   I agree.
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:49.040]   Imagine the iPhone with maybe twice as big a screen and you could still fit it in your
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.040]   pocket.
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:51.040]   That's what's coming.
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.040]   I completely agree.
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.040]   And it's that...
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.040]   Apple's going to make one.
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.040]   Everybody else is going to make one.
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:59.600]   And I bet you that, you know, if you think about people's usage, 90% of what people do
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.600]   is in a browser.
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:01.600]   90%.
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:02.600]   So why do you...
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:05.240]   Which is actually amazing when you think about it.
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:08.920]   Because if you consider what we were doing with computers, you know, 10 years ago before
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:13.240]   the internet was sort of mainstream, when you load up a computer now without the internet,
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:15.080]   you're like, "What do I do?"
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:17.720]   It's a dirty nose what to do when they haven't got the internet connection.
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:18.720]   It is.
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:19.720]   It's a calculator.
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:20.720]   And it's bizarre, isn't it?
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:23.080]   Because there was a time when we didn't have the internet and we used computers.
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:25.080]   You'd open up your book of CD...
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:29.560]   You'd open up your book of CD-ROMs and then you would put in your Voyager CD for the Beatles
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:32.160]   hard days night and then you would look at photos of the Beatles.
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:34.160]   So you remember...
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:35.160]   Ancata?
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:36.160]   Oh yeah.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.160]   Of course.
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:38.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:39.160]   This is...
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:42.440]   There is one application in here that may, in a way, spell something else.
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:43.440]   They put a decent phone.
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:48.440]   It's a three megapixel camera, three megapixel camera with focus, with autofocus.
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:55.000]   And there are three now barcode applications that allow me to take it to a store, scan
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:02.280]   the barcode on anything practically, and it then looks up alternate locations and prices
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:05.000]   for that item.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.560]   And I think that's very cool.
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:09.280]   Let me see if I can do that here with this book.
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.760]   So I've got a barcode right there.
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:12.960]   It takes a second to register it.
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.400]   It buzzes at you.
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:16.360]   And then now it's going to look up the book.
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:17.720]   This is compare everywhere.
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:18.720]   There's another one too.
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:19.720]   It's going to look up the book.
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:21.240]   Oh, it said it couldn't find it.
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.240]   All right.
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.240]   Let me...
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.800]   That's the first time that's happened.
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:27.040]   But it's very...
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:29.840]   It's been very good at finding stuff.
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:30.840]   That's kind of cool.
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:35.080]   When you take a phone into a store, you get the retailer to show you some stuff.
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:36.400]   Oh, it works.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.280]   And they say, "Let me just take a picture of that."
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:42.280]   You scan it and then you find out where you can get it cheaper.
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:45.320]   And then you turn it over and you show it to the retailer and they give you the best deal.
[01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:46.320]   There you go.
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.320]   I like that.
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:48.760]   But you know that I can go to...
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:53.320]   This program, it's kind of interesting, does in fact, because it knows your location, say,
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:56.160]   "Here's the nearest place it's selling it."
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.160]   That's pretty nice.
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:58.160]   Yeah.
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:02.880]   I mean, you go to imagine that Google is really hot on the location-specific stuff in a way
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:05.320]   that the iPhone is still not quite yet.
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:08.120]   Well, I would say it's a parody with the iPhone on this.
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:09.440]   You know, there's some...
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:10.720]   There's a compass in this too.
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.840]   So the street view, it's kind of cool.
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:13.840]   It's amazing.
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:14.840]   Yeah, knows where you are.
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:17.440]   It's like the tone sheet that demonstration from Tech Run Shrissy.
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.200]   It's where you are and it's showing you what's in front of you.
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.200]   Somebody showed me that yesterday.
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.200]   It was pretty cool.
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:24.000]   It's very cool.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:29.320]   There's no doubt in my mind that this will be a Windows Media Center and a desktop computer
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.320]   in the next year.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.320]   Interesting.
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.320]   So this is the Google operating system.
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:33.320]   Okay.
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:34.320]   This is the Google operating system.
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:35.320]   Absolutely.
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:36.800]   Just on smaller footprint devices.
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:39.240]   They'll just build on this because look at, they got the browser now.
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:40.960]   They got the operating system.
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:42.920]   They got people developing for it.
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:46.360]   This is a shot across the bow of Windows and Mac.
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:52.960]   You know, we're going to compete with you and Google is not afraid to compete with anybody
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:53.960]   anymore.
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:55.360]   Now they're like, "We're going to do a browser.
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.560]   We're going to compete with Firefox and IE.
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:02.440]   We're going to do an operating system for phones," which also happens to run on laptops
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:05.040]   and will run on your television set.
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:08.600]   I mean, it's pretty clear what they're doing.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:13.520]   You know, if somebody's only used a phone before, when they start to see the kinds of functionality
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:17.200]   you can get out of something like this, I just looked up a book by scanning the barcode.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.000]   I found the nearest store that sells it.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.760]   I've got a phone number here I can call.
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:22.280]   I can show the map.
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:25.520]   I can also find a cheaper price online.
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:26.520]   Where is the nearest store?
[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:27.520]   Here I live with.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:29.920]   Well, it says it's in Santa Rosa, which is wrong.
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:31.600]   Well, it's looking at Barnes and Noble.
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:35.000]   So the database doesn't have our local independent bookstore, which is depressing.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.480]   That's annoying, but not really.
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.480]   That's surprising.
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:41.080]   I think that's the other thing that's really interesting about this stuff is when I look
[01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:47.840]   at people who are carrying around a phone that is just a phone and you think, "You
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:53.080]   put something in front of them and just say, 'Have you seen all this new stuff you can
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:54.080]   do?'"
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:55.080]   I don't think that's true.
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:56.320]   I think there are a lot of people who are not on the internet.
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:00.800]   I think there are a lot of people who just want to make a call, don't you?
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:05.440]   I think you only just want that when you haven't experienced what else you can have.
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:06.880]   Sarah doesn't even want to make a call.
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:09.160]   Obviously, I mean, my phone...
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.160]   Do you text?
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:11.160]   I text.
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:12.800]   This is a great texting phone.
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:15.160]   It has, "I am very good I am built in."
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:16.360]   Well, and it's got the real key for it.
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:17.360]   It's got a real key for it.
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:18.360]   It's a very good texting.
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:22.800]   I'm to the point now where if someone leaves me a voicemail, I really just rather that
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.560]   they hang up and text me.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:26.360]   Whatever I need to know.
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:27.360]   Yeah, me too.
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:28.360]   It's just...
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:29.360]   Phonetag.com.
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:30.360]   Yeah.
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:31.360]   I use it.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:32.360]   What is phonetag?
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:33.360]   What is that?
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:34.360]   It's basically you pay $20.
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:38.000]   If anybody on the Twitter audience would like to call my cell phone, they can call it
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.600]   now.
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:42.600]   I will not pick up unless I know the caller ID.
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:44.880]   If you call me, it goes directly to voicemail.
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:49.400]   The voicemail gets sent to some outsourcing place outside the country and they transcribe
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:50.400]   it.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:54.800]   They email you an MP3 file with the transcribed...
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:57.720]   How much does that cost?
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:58.720]   Who knows?
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:08:59.720]   I'll check.
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:01.240]   I'm on the site right now.
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:02.960]   I think it's 20 bucks a month or something.
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:03.960]   Here it is.
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:04.960]   Unlimited is 30.
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:07.200]   Look, now people are starting to call me.
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:08.200]   Thanks.
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:09.200]   I should have said that.
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:10.200]   How do they have your phone number?
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:11.200]   I put my phone number out there.
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:12.200]   This is a 717 number.
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:16.200]   So I'm going to send it to a record of voicemail.
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:21.040]   So if 30 bucks for unlimited 40 months is 10, that's probably what I would use.
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:22.040]   I don't get more than 40 messages.
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:24.960]   Or you just do a 35 cents a message.
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:28.280]   If you were to get 20 a month, that's 7 bucks.
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:29.280]   That's not bad.
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:30.280]   That'd be a one a day.
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:31.640]   And then you get it as text.
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:32.640]   So you don't have to...
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:34.640]   See, I never check my voicemail because...
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:39.840]   And the groovy thing is, if you give them your address book, they do the caller ID and
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:43.520]   they make the reply to the email address.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:48.520]   So if I had you in there and I had your phone, I hit reply on the message that they send me.
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:49.520]   Boom.
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:50.520]   It's got the transcript.
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:51.520]   Who do that with your iPhone?
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.520]   How do you do that?
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:53.520]   I do it with my BlackBerry and my iPhone.
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:54.520]   I carry it.
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:55.520]   You probably work with the G1.
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:56.520]   I'm sure it would.
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:57.520]   It's got email.
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:01.120]   What are you doing is forwarding your call to their number.
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:05.040]   And they transcribe it within a minute.
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:06.760]   So I'll be in a meeting.
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:08.880]   I'll send somebody to voicemail in the same meeting.
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:09.880]   I go check my BlackBerry.
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:13.560]   I see, "Okay, my wife called and she wants me to pick up the dry cleaning."
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:14.560]   Whatever.
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:16.160]   It's phonetag.com now.
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:17.880]   Is this kind of company going to...
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.760]   This kind of company has nothing to worry about with a downfall, right?
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:21.760]   This company is...
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:22.760]   Because it's a revenue.
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:23.760]   They've got a good revenue model.
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:26.920]   I know the guy, I met the guys from this after I started using it and they're killing
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:27.920]   it.
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:28.920]   They're making a lot of money.
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:30.640]   So they have no problem.
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:31.640]   How about me?
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:32.640]   Jot.
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:33.640]   Jot was free for a long time.
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:35.520]   They're now starting to charge for premium.
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.040]   Can you go from free to premium?
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:38.040]   Yes, you can.
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:42.460]   I mean, actually the person who did it most brilliantly during the down market was Scott
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:43.460]   Hyferman of meetup.com.
[01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:44.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:46.200]   Meetup.com has been charging.
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.200]   They have...
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:51.600]   I know their revenue numbers, I can't say, but they're making millions of dollars a year
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:53.520]   off of their paid service.
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.240]   And they are profitable for...
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:57.280]   Do they offer a free and then premium?
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:58.280]   Is that how they're doing it?
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:10:59.280]   No.
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:01.280]   People who are hosting the groups, I think.
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.480]   Anybody who joins the group is free.
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:04.680]   There goes another phone call.
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:07.160]   That's great.
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:09.480]   And they're killing it.
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:12.720]   Wall Street Journal has hundreds of thousands, if not a million subscribers, they're killing
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:13.720]   it.
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:16.040]   So Twitter could immediately...
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:19.640]   Twitter could immediately be profitable if they put ads like the Japanese version has
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:20.640]   in it.
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:21.640]   Yeah, I mean...
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.360]   Yeah, I wouldn't tune out of Twitter just because they had ads.
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.920]   That wouldn't stop me.
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:29.560]   If they want to make money, all they have to do is let people subscribe to a professional
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.200]   version with no ads, right?
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:36.160]   So they should put a leaderboard and a medium rectangle and text ads on every page tomorrow.
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:40.160]   Then you should be able to pay for private groups, i.e. Yammer.
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:46.040]   And you should be able to pay for metrics and being able to put JavaScript on your page.
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:51.680]   So I would like to put JavaScript on my page, put my own ads, design it myself, Google Analytics
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:53.480]   on my Twitter page.
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:59.760]   So basically, if you want to soup up your page, you pay 50 bucks a year or five bucks a month.
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:00.760]   And if you want to...
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:01.760]   I love it.
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:02.760]   I love it.
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:04.600]   I mean, they would have a thousand...
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:09.160]   So I imagine that they're going to do something like that.
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:13.920]   We talked last week about ever replacing Alex.
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:14.920]   Do you have any...
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:15.920]   Jack, I'm sorry.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.480]   Do you have any insight into what happened there?
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:19.120]   I know both of the guys over there.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:20.880]   I know the investors are over there.
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:21.880]   I think...
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:22.880]   Was that a firing?
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:23.880]   No.
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:25.880]   I think the company's done fantastic.
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:26.880]   And there are...
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:30.800]   There's a time for a tech-based CEO and a first-stage CEO.
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.360]   And there's a time for a second-stage CEO.
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:37.640]   So my guess is, you know, Jack's done such a great job of getting the company to where
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:39.280]   it is today.
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:41.960]   The next phase of it's going to be like the business phase of it.
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:44.560]   Maybe they wanted somebody who was a little more business-focused than tech-focused.
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:48.640]   But you know, nobody gives them credit for the fact that they've fixed the scaling problem.
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:49.640]   They sure have.
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:50.640]   It works well now.
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:51.640]   In fact, it's survived.
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:52.640]   Yeah.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:53.640]   It's a great product.
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:56.080]   So, I mean, there's a lot of haters out there.
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:59.880]   It's like eBay had tons of problem of uptime.
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:03.320]   All the great sites have uptime problems during their peak.
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:05.120]   Or almost all of them.
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:07.320]   So I think they're going to do just fine.
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.800]   There's a guy in our stick-em chat has claimed to me, Kevin Rose.
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:10.800]   I have a...
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:11.800]   It is.
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:12.800]   It is?
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:13.800]   Yeah, he twitted it.
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:14.800]   Okay.
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:15.800]   Well, Kevin, why don't you call us?
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:16.800]   I know, Kevin.
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:17.800]   Rockstar.
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:18.800]   Talk to his agent.
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:19.800]   Yeah.
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:20.800]   Oh, no.
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:21.800]   He has to have somebody protect him against the...
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:22.800]   Yo, it was crazy.
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:23.800]   Let me call him.
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:26.240]   Let me get him in here.
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:28.240]   You know what's funny too is that Kevin is...
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:29.400]   Oh, he's not on Skype.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.040]   Kevin got on Skype.
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.040]   He's on IM.
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.280]   Yeah, but he's not on Skype.
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:34.280]   He doesn't launch the Skype.
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:36.040]   So he launches his Skype all the way up.
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:37.040]   Oh, man.
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.040]   People are putting Kevin's...
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:39.040]   I'm glad, dude.
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:40.840]   I am in the chat room.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:42.640]   Don't do that, people.
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:43.640]   There he is.
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:45.640]   Well, he can turn off.
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:48.080]   I don't care if people know my IM either.
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:50.080]   Could you just turn off everybody that's not on your bike?
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:51.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:53.160]   I mean, you can guess my IM.
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:55.160]   Kevin Woes.
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:56.160]   Hello, Kevin.
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:57.160]   Hello, hello.
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:00.160]   He's always got to steal my thunder.
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:02.160]   He couldn't let him blow up alone.
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:04.160]   He wouldn't just sit back and watch the video.
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:05.160]   You looked at one that was...
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:07.360]   First of all, no, no.
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.360]   It's true.
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:11.160]   Sarah, I am me and she's like, "You should get in here."
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:12.160]   Oh, lies.
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:13.160]   That is a good experience.
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:14.160]   It was her idea.
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:16.760]   Just because you created Diggogong.
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:18.600]   So, Kevin, they were talking about...
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:19.600]   We were...
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:22.520]   These other guys, I wasn't saying anything because I'm just insanely jealous.
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:24.440]   We're talking about A, your ink cover.
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:25.440]   Pretty cool.
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:26.600]   Oh, thank you.
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:27.600]   It's pretty cool.
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:28.600]   Respect.
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:29.600]   I'm learning it.
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:30.600]   Look at that.
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:37.040]   And then the incredible Eric Clapton is God-like treatment they gave you at Foa.
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.840]   Foa was nuts.
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:40.240]   Foa was a lot of fun though.
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:42.200]   Is it getting more...
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:43.200]   Are you getting...
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:47.040]   Is the fan stuff increasing?
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:48.640]   I was listening to you guys a few minutes ago.
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:54.640]   I think you're absolutely right that internationally, there's a lot more fans out there, it seems.
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:59.320]   We do stuff in the States and you'll have 400 or 500 people come out, but you do it
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:01.720]   over in London and it's a couple thousand plus.
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:02.720]   That's really interesting.
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:05.080]   Will, do you have an insight into that?
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:10.640]   Yeah, because if you're in the States and sort of dignity, maybe going around a bunch
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:11.640]   of different States...
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:12.640]   No big deal.
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:13.640]   ...you can wait for it to come to your home state.
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.200]   In England, it's going to be London on nothing.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:18.160]   People travel from all over England to come down.
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:22.440]   Also because it's a much smaller and denser place than a lot of places in the US.
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:24.360]   But you don't think that people are more rabid?
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:25.760]   Well, it's also pent up.
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:29.440]   You've got the whole year, like it's the one time that Kevin comes over.
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:33.720]   So you get the whole 12 months and a two-day thing.
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:34.720]   You should've seen it.
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:39.480]   There were kids, like, not a 10-year-old kid, 12-year-old kid, 14-year-old kid.
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:43.840]   Like, dig, you know, one-year forehead, dig shirts, dig tattoos.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:47.200]   Kevin, you need colors so that people can paint themselves the dig colors.
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:49.800]   Kevin, does anyone ever met you and cried?
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:50.960]   I've had that happen to me.
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:51.960]   Have you?
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:52.960]   Yeah.
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:53.960]   Wow.
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:54.960]   There are the heavens to you all the time.
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:55.960]   Please.
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:56.960]   No, you've had what happened, I'm sure.
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:57.960]   They cry.
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:58.960]   When somebody comes up to you and they can't...
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:02.400]   They cry because I'm a lot shorter than they thought.
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.400]   They're crying.
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:04.400]   You're my biggest fan.
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.400]   No, that's the one thing I get them...
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.400]   You've had somebody walk up to you.
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:08.400]   ...the number one thing I get is...
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.400]   You have a smaller one?
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.400]   You're so much smaller than you look on TV.
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:12.400]   TV makes you big.
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:15.480]   You look big here because of the perspective.
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:17.200]   You look like you're bigger than me.
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:18.200]   Wow.
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:23.080]   I think the internet celebrity thing is starting to...
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:28.520]   I think there's a couple of people like Kevin, Perez Hilton, who are starting to cross over.
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:29.520]   Yeah.
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.280]   Well, that was the interesting thing this week.
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:35.360]   Britney Spears showed up on Twitter and everybody said, "Okay, Twitter is now.
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:37.600]   That's the Britney moment, the transition."
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.120]   And she's got like 5,000 followers.
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:40.120]   Nowhere near it.
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:41.120]   She'll never catch Kevin.
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:42.120]   She could.
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:44.120]   No, I don't think so.
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:47.120]   But the thing is that people know it's really Kevin.
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:48.120]   It's clearly not really Britney.
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:49.120]   No, it's Britney.
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:51.120]   I think somebody who works for Britney's.
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:52.120]   Yeah, it's Britney, but it's for PR agencies.
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:53.480]   Well, it's Britney and her PR agency.
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:54.480]   And they all sign it.
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:56.240]   I think they've actually done something very intelligent.
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:58.040]   When it's her, she says it's her.
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.040]   When it's her PR person.
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:00.040]   Look at the...
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:01.040]   It's the real Britney.
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:02.040]   All right.
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.040]   All right.
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.040]   So I think...
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:05.520]   I think she doesn't even know the password that I can.
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:06.520]   Oh, look.
[01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:07.520]   I talk about Britney a lot more than I want to.
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:08.520]   No, no.
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:09.520]   I think it's really her.
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:12.120]   Like I'm taking the kids to the pumpkin patch now.
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:14.680]   See, but it would be so easy for someone to do that.
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:16.400]   I don't think Britney's on Twitter.
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:17.400]   She's not doing it herself.
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:18.400]   I don't think so either.
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.400]   I think she is.
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.400]   She will.
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:21.400]   She will.
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:24.000]   Just like, I mean, the same thing happened with MySpace, but they actually, for better
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.520]   or worse, published their MySpace blogs without clearing it with their PR people.
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:31.360]   Like, Lindsay Lohan does that all the time and gets herself in trouble.
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:33.880]   Is that how you found out about her thing?
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:35.600]   That she's like dating that.
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:36.600]   No, like low TMC.
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:37.600]   No, that's a risk.
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:39.400]   That's like really big news.
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:41.400]   Well, it's kind of old.
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:43.160]   I don't really care.
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:45.400]   But I know Kevin's broken up about it.
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:52.240]   So I just think that Kevin's going to always be bigger than Britney on Twitter.
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:53.240]   I don't know.
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:56.400]   You know, it's 50,000 fans is a lot or 30 or 40 or 50.
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:01.000]   But when you start talking Britney Spears level, like she might have a couple of hundred
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.080]   thousand people in her.
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.240]   Maybe fan club who don't even know about this yet.
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:09.120]   She might have somebody celebrity have hundreds of thousands of emails on their list or they
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:12.480]   have, I don't know, what 500,000 a million friends on MySpace.
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:13.480]   Yeah.
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:17.760]   Well, that's going to be the test of Twitter as if you get a hundred thousand people following
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.320]   Britney Spears if they can survive.
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:22.760]   Obama, by the way, crossed the hundred thousand mark a couple of weeks ago.
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:24.920]   Kevin, what's up to these days?
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:26.720]   Today, not much.
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:28.720]   Just hanging out, relaxing Sunday.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:29.720]   Take a minute.
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:32.400]   I got to go get your tea.
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:34.440]   You went tea tasting at Samavar, didn't you?
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.080]   I did a little bit earlier.
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:38.720]   What kind of tea do you have?
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:44.680]   Today, Gyrokoto, which is a Japanese, really fine green tea.
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:46.240]   We don't need to talk about this on here.
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:48.040]   We talk about this afterwards.
[01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:49.040]   Juleel laughed.
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:51.040]   I mean, I'm trying to hold you on the show.
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:53.240]   The show is the best I can.
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:57.480]   Kevin, tell us more about your new car.
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:00.480]   I don't have a new car.
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:02.240]   You were going to get on there, weren't you?
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:03.240]   Look, this is cool.
[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:05.040]   This is Kevin Rose Tea from Adagio.
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:06.760]   Hey, I have some tea too.
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:07.760]   Is there a Sarah Lane?
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:08.760]   Send me that.
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:11.640]   Is this last year's tea the white ginger or is that this year's tea?
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:13.000]   Look at that picture.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000]   Good lord.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.680]   Yeah, that's a small picture.
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:16.680]   I have no idea.
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:18.080]   Prager does all these tea deals.
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:19.080]   See, this is the thing.
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:22.640]   I'm not going to ever drink David Prager tea.
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:24.160]   Green curtain.
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:25.680]   It is the most god-awful tea.
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:26.680]   Just smell this.
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:27.680]   It is the most god-awful.
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:28.680]   What smell?
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:29.680]   We've got this at work.
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:30.680]   Can I stay far away?
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:32.240]   Your tea is actually quite good.
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:33.240]   Your tea is actually quite good.
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:36.000]   It's got a little bit Prager essence of Prager.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.000]   What do I smell?
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.000]   It smells like pipe tobacco.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000]   No, it smells worse.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.800]   But your tea smells quite good, Kevin.
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:42.800]   It smells like you.
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:44.040]   Well, it's the ginger.
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:45.040]   It's the ginger.
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:46.040]   It gives it a nice fresh--
[01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:48.480]   My tea has Roy Boast in it.
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:49.480]   Oh, you have a tea?
[01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:50.480]   I have right.
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:51.480]   Yes, that red tea.
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:52.720]   I'm a big fan.
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:53.720]   It's caffeine free, though.
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:56.560]   So it's something that you can drink later on in the day.
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:58.480]   I'm not going to get a tea.
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:19:59.480]   Yes.
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:00.960]   I actually had-- I'm going to point out.
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:03.120]   I had an afternoon tea this afternoon.
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:04.120]   You actually are a tea drinker.
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.120]   So, okay.
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:06.120]   Do you have some?
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:36.120]   I have some tea drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drinker drink
[01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:37.120]   Is it tea?
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:38.120]   You can.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:40.600]   I had Devin Cream and Cucumber sandwiches this afternoon.
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:41.800]   So, you're very welcome.
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:42.800]   Oh, man.
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:44.760]   Now, is that 11 sis or no?
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:45.760]   You have two?
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:46.760]   No, no, no.
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:47.760]   That was an afternoon tea.
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:49.560]   That was like a four o'clock tea.
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:50.560]   My parents came down.
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:52.160]   So, we had a little thing going on.
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:53.160]   That's next.
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:55.560]   But what would have been better if I could have had some Kevin Rose tea than I could
[01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:57.560]   have served my parents up some Kevin Rose.
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:58.560]   Kevin, Kevin, Kevin.
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:20:59.560]   Kevin, Kevin.
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:00.560]   But still, you know which one I drink?
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:02.560]   I drink the matcha green tea, which is delicious.
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:03.560]   I like matcha.
[01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:04.560]   I like matcha.
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:07.080]   I like the little leaves and I have like the little whisk at my office.
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:10.320]   So, my assistant goes out of make it and I put honey in it.
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:11.320]   Oh, wow.
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:13.880]   You can't have your assistant making your tea for you.
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:14.880]   Sure.
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:15.880]   No, no, no.
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:17.560]   The matcha tea is using the Japanese tea ceremony.
[01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:18.800]   It's something you're supposed to do yourself.
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:19.800]   Yeah, but, but, really?
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:20.800]   Yeah, yeah, totally.
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:21.800]   Oh, Jason, he has.
[01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:22.800]   I feel like sometimes.
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:25.720]   I'm special assistant just for making the tea.
[01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:28.400]   My matcha green tea and assistant, you know, you don't have one, Kevin?
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:29.400]   I don't.
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:32.920]   Oh, you have to have a matcha green tea because I have a regular tea assistant.
[01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:35.280]   I have one for the downturn in everything, the economy.
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:36.440]   I had to lay them off.
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:37.440]   How's the fighter jet though?
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:39.520]   Is that still, you still have that, right?
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:42.360]   No, comment, no comment.
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.360]   I missed that.
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.880]   No, he had to sell his fighter jets.
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:45.880]   He's getting a chest.
[01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:46.880]   So sad.
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:49.600]   Oh, let's see.
[01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:50.600]   I think we're done.
[01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:51.600]   Are we done?
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:52.600]   Anything else?
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:53.600]   Kevin, I'm so glad you called in.
[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:54.600]   That's wonderful.
[01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:57.880]   Yeah, Sarah was just texting me non-stop and I am.
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:01.880]   Like I said, whoever I am, Kevin's sure to follow.
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:02.880]   He's jolly.
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:03.880]   His nose around.
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:04.880]   He's a little jolly.
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:05.880]   Maybe you want me on the show too.
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:09.360]   So, Sarah, your fabulous parting gift, a delicious container.
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:10.960]   He's giving me that green curd.
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:13.920]   David Prager, the man behind the green curd and tea.
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:14.920]   Oh, Prager.
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:17.120]   Because I don't see enough in hand or anything.
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:18.520]   It's so disgusting.
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:19.520]   It smells like socks.
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:20.520]   I don't know what it is.
[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:21.520]   Okay, you know what?
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:22.520]   Let me smell it again.
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:23.520]   I'm telling you, pipe tobacco.
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:24.520]   Pipe tobacco.
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:25.520]   I mean, it smells like chemicals.
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:26.520]   No, you can't give it away.
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:27.520]   It smells like a cleaning product.
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:28.520]   It's the most disgusting tea.
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:34.200]   Kevin Rose tea sold out.
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:35.200]   I don't know what that is.
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:37.000]   Alex have a tea too, Kevin?
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000]   Yes.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000]   Beer flavored.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000]   So does Glenn.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000]   It's like a beer flavored tea.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000]   All the puffs are in girls have teas.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000]   Very hoppy.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000]   Yeah.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000]   Very hoppy.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000]   Very hoppy.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.120]   I don't know if there's even any other stories.
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:50.120]   I just want to wrap it up.
[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:55.280]   Can I just say the other one story I want to say was a rack space vice general.
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:56.280]   Of course.
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:58.480]   And I'm pissed off about this.
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:22:59.480]   Because I love jungle this.
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:00.480]   Why is that?
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:01.720]   Because jungle this ties to S3.
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:06.680]   This is rack space trying to create their own storage in the cloud solution like S3.
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:08.680]   They announced their own storage.
[01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:09.680]   Is that a bad thing?
[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:10.680]   Yeah.
[01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:12.800]   Yeah, it's a bad thing because I use jungle this to it to go to S3.
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:15.400]   You think they're going to leave jungle this because an S3 class?
[01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:16.720]   Oh, okay.
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:20.640]   So now rack space is going to basically kill off jungle this or at least I would.
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:24.200]   So if I were to keep you as cheap as S3, they're cloud thing.
[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:26.440]   But the point is I'm happy with S3.
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:27.440]   I use S3.
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:30.840]   I use jungle this to access S3 and jungle disk.
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:32.640]   I mean, maybe they'll keep it up.
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:37.920]   The problem is with the stuff is like we started building some applications like pieces of
[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:38.920]   Mahalo on.
[01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:39.920]   You see too.
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:43.520]   Well, we use a dupe for our storage now and that works fine.
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:45.640]   But EC2 is just not fast enough.
[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:50.560]   Like if you want to have quarter second page load times, you can't really do it with EC2
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:51.560]   yet.
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:54.320]   So storage is fine running different instances is fine.
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:55.320]   But how about Google apps?
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:56.320]   Is that better?
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:57.960]   No, Google apps is worse.
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:01.760]   We have a couple of Google apps and we were blowing out the, they have a bunch of limiters
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:03.480]   on it.
[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:05.840]   And so it's just not ready for primetime.
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:08.240]   Nobody's really built the real opportunity.
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:13.840]   Somebody's got to take a CDN, a content delivery network, like Edgecast, which we use or any
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:14.840]   of these.
[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:16.400]   We use cash fly here.
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:18.160]   Cash fly, which is really good.
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:20.640]   Somebody has to take that and build it into EC2.
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:24.640]   So when you're writing your HTML files, you can actually write in the big homepage.
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:28.480]   It can actually, like dig could be run or Mahalo could be run on EC2.
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:29.480]   But it can't be served.
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:34.000]   I heard that Rackspace was doing that with Lime.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.560]   Oh, you know what I'm talking about.
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.080]   I know exactly what you're talking about.
[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:41.400]   I won't always say Lime Wire, but it's not.
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:43.400]   So Lime, Lime, Lime.
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:45.400]   They're a good CDN actually.
[01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:46.400]   I T- Limelight.
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:49.640]   I T conversations users and they're actually very good CDN.
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:53.840]   Apparently, according to our chatroom, Jungle Dave has said they are not going to kill the
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:58.200]   S3 implementation of Jungle Disc, which I'm very happy about.
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:04.560]   But I'm not crazy about the idea of, it just feels like to me, Rackspace moving in on this.
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:05.560]   I guess competition is good.
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:06.560]   No, no, it's a good thing.
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:07.560]   It's a good thing.
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:13.280]   I mean, the idea of spending $2,000 or $3,000 a month renting servers is crazy now.
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:14.280]   But wait a minute.
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:15.280]   Now, wait a minute.
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:18.760]   I have three dedicated servers at SoftLayer.
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:23.800]   You think that I could replace for the Twitter.tv, the leo.ville.com, the leo.am for all those
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:24.800]   sites.
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:28.120]   Do you think I could replace those with this kind of in the cloud solution?
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:29.840]   I think you probably will.
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:30.840]   Yeah.
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:33.040]   And what's coming is really- Why is that better?
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:37.880]   Because you never have to maintain the hardware and the hardware will scale.
[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:38.880]   And it's distributed.
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:40.440]   And it's distributed.
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:44.280]   So you'll go down when the EC2 people go down, which is fine because it's not going to,
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:46.880]   they just announced they have an SLA, a service layer agreement.
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:47.880]   Oh good.
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:48.880]   Which is a good step.
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:51.280]   Because EC2 has gone down several times.
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:54.520]   There's actually a couple of businesses going around pitching themselves now for an idea
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:26:00.360]   I had, like a year ago, which is somebody should make a load balancer that goes across
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:01.360]   clouds.
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:02.520]   And there has to be a cloud standard.
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:08.280]   So if you were to build, let's say, Dig or Mahalo or Twitter or Pounce on one of these
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:15.880]   systems, what you should have is a load balancer that when people commit, if EC2 fails, it
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:18.480]   just rolls over to Google App Engine.
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:20.680]   And if those two fail, it goes over to Rackspace.
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:21.680]   Yeah.
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:26.440]   And so if that could happen at the load balancer level, then you would have Sky computing,
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:31.360]   which would be multiple clouds and just point your users to whichever cloud happens to forming
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:33.760]   the-- Well, you've got to believe Microsoft wants to get in this space too.
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:35.600]   Microsoft's got a big announcement next week about this.
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:38.120]   Yeah, PDC is coming up, starts tomorrow.
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:40.000]   Is this where Skynet comes from?
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000]   Skynet.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000]   It's Skynet.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.000]   It's just--
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:48.600]   When we did TechCrunch 50 this year, we asked people how much was invested in their companies.
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:52.840]   And a lot of them, like, Metrix was built on Google App Engine or a bunch of these were
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:54.720]   built on EC2.
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:56.200]   And we asked them what their costs are.
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:57.680]   And they're like, well, we don't have any server costs.
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:26:59.440]   We have no office space.
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:04.680]   The only cost, the marginal cost of a startup today is the person's time.
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:05.680]   That's it.
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:09.280]   We were in a-- Which means you're going to see a lot of interesting things in the down
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:10.920]   market when people have a lot of time on their hands.
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:15.520]   In charted territory now, making up history as we went along.
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:16.520]   Yeah.
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:18.520]   Skynet's coming, baby.
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:19.520]   You guys didn't get--
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:23.240]   This machine was the only one who measured up.
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:25.440]   You guys didn't get it, did you?
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:26.520]   Totally on it.
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:27.520]   The Geeks--
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:29.840]   The Geeks got it.
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:32.040]   So Kevin, what are you doing now with Dig?
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:34.640]   You still own all your own servers and all that, or?
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:35.640]   Yeah.
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:39.840]   I mean, Dig's in a little-- it's a little bit different.
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:42.000]   When you serve-- I mean, Jason, you know how this is.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:47.280]   It's kind of hard to do stuff on EC2 and S3 when you're doing 30 million uniques a month.
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:48.760]   You can't do it.
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:49.760]   Yeah, you can't do it.
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:51.480]   So we got our own stuff.
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:55.160]   Well, publishing-- oh, it's just not-- it's not there yet, because when you have a site
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:59.960]   that's this active, you have to write the files as opposed to people making database
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:02.440]   calls or else your server would crash.
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:04.440]   So I'm assuming, like, every--
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:05.600]   A lot of caching, you mean?
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:11.560]   Yeah, you have to basically go from the system-- actually writes pages that can then be cached
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:17.200]   by squid cache or by your Cisco router, whatever you use to do your caching, where you're
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:19.080]   edgecast, whoever.
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:24.480]   You can't really have database calls going out, so you have to write the files.
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:29.720]   And that just means you preclude you from doing something like EC2 today, but I think
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:31.720]   that's where they're going to go with it.
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:38.280]   So you could store all the images or all the data on EC2 from Dig or Mahalo or Engaget
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:40.760]   or whatever, but you just can't serve it out of there.
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:43.280]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:44.280]   You just are too demanding.
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:48.000]   And of course, you got Jay, who is a lot of experience, or this is a founder of Equinix,
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000]   so he knows--
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.600]   How many servers does Digon, like 200, I would guess?
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:56.640]   I don't think we ever talk about numbers, but yeah, it's a little bit more than that.
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:57.640]   Yeah, makes sense.
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:01.080]   And are you in one knock or you're in multiple knocks now?
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:03.680]   We have a East Coast West Coast.
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:05.320]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:08.760]   Yeah, I basically have to-- and you serve people dynamically out of each one.
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:13.680]   Yeah, I mean, it's quicker to serve London from the East Coast and Japan from over here.
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:16.000]   So just get excited when we talk about Big Iron like this.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000]   It's just hot.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.800]   All that data moving around.
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:22.360]   I got like guys, a little server.
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:23.360]   You're CDN.
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:24.360]   We're CDN.
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:26.360]   We don't use one.
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:27.360]   They don't use one.
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:29.360]   They're their own CDN.
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:32.080]   No, but actually the pages on Dig are very light.
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:34.080]   They have very few requests.
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:38.240]   Yeah, it's mostly all text, you know, and we can compress the hell out of it.
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:42.440]   Do you-- all those images on the front page, are those served from one sprite or from multiple
[01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:43.440]   images?
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:45.680]   That's a good question.
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:48.880]   I don't even know what they-- we use-- what's that?
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:51.840]   Distributed File System, Mobile Fs.
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:52.840]   Yeah.
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:54.680]   But I'm not sure where it's being served out of.
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:55.680]   Yeah.
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:30:00.320]   That's the sort of next level when you have all those dynamic images making one dynamic,
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:01.760]   you know, sprite out of them.
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:02.760]   Yeah.
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:04.240]   So you don't have to serve up 20 requests.
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:06.240]   But it looks like 66 requests.
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:10.360]   But the response time for Dig was 0.1 second.
[01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:12.960]   That's the first request, which is extraordinary.
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:16.320]   Kevin, at the beginning of the show, Jason told a story about having a meal with you
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:18.520]   in Santa Monica and offering you $2 million.
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:19.520]   Sushi lunch.
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:20.520]   Sushi lunch.
[01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:21.520]   Yes.
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:22.520]   Offering you $2 million for Dig.
[01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:23.720]   Do you remember that?
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:24.920]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:25.920]   That was--
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:26.920]   Was it even before the redesign came out?
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:28.920]   What did you order?
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:31.360]   No, more to the point.
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:35.040]   Was that a tough thing to say no to or was it a very easy thing for you to say no to?
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:40.400]   Well, if the thing was that there was-- Jason, you had some kind of aggressive terms baked
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:41.800]   into the whole deal.
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:44.280]   Was it just like straight up $2 million cash?
[01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:46.520]   Yeah, I wanted the option to buy the whole thing.
[01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:47.520]   And pieces.
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:48.520]   Oh, I remember this.
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:49.960]   You actually talked about this.
[01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:51.520]   I do remember this.
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:53.400]   Well, I mean, it was--
[01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:56.960]   I don't know how many people were using it, but in gadget was much bigger at the time.
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:58.680]   Yeah, it was big.
[01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:00.760]   So-- and you had just--
[01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:06.440]   were just-- you were showing me the version 2.0 at that time, which was much more beautiful.
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:07.440]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:10.000]   That was when I brought Daniel on and had him reason on the site.
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:13.160]   I don't know if you talked about it on a Twig Kevin, but I do remember talking with you,
[01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:15.920]   I think, maybe offline about this.
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:18.840]   And that was exactly why you turned it down as you wanted to retain control.
[01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:19.840]   Yeah.
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:22.040]   I mean, it was very early days.
[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:26.920]   If you had brought a check and written down $2 million and put it in front of my face and
[01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:30.680]   I had just started the project four or five months earlier, I probably would have said
[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:31.680]   you.
[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:32.680]   Well, that's what I was wondering.
[01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:35.760]   I thought, boy, that's got to be tough to say no to that when you-- you know, this is
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:37.720]   something brand new.
[01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:39.920]   And who knows how it was going to go?
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:40.920]   I mean, if you had--
[01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:42.200]   I mean, I knew it was going to be big.
[01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:45.920]   I could tell it was going to be bigger than the blogs it serves because we started to
[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:48.400]   see that it was sending, like, 1,000 people to--
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:49.400]   Right.
[01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:50.400]   --engage it at a time.
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:51.400]   And I was like, oh, wait a second.
[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:54.760]   This thing is going to be bigger than all the blogs because it's a layer on top of all
[01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:55.760]   of them.
[01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:56.760]   So I knew it was--
[01:31:56.760 --> 01:32:00.360]   Jason, this is why I think you'd make a great VC because you found us very early on.
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:02.960]   This is like we had almost very little traffic.
[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:07.200]   And you found us and made me an offer like over a sushi lunch.
[01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:09.880]   It's like, why-- do you ever consider like going to VC?
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:10.880]   Or out?
[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:13.040]   You know, I like to build stuff.
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:14.040]   So--
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:16.560]   But you know, also, he knew because he had inside information.
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:18.720]   He knew what traffic you were sending to Engage it.
[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:20.120]   Had to refer a file.
[01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:21.120]   So yeah.
[01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:22.760]   Not everybody would know that.
[01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:23.760]   But I know.
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:26.320]   I mean, it's-- listen, I wouldn't give myself too much credit for that one.
[01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:29.080]   But being a VC is actually kind of boring.
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:30.080]   And I'm about--
[01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:31.080]   Sounds really boring.
[01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:32.080]   How about the part of some companies?
[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:37.240]   I mean, it can make you crazy because you can't tell another entrepreneur what to do.
[01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:38.800]   And you're really limiting your role.
[01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:40.800]   I much rather just build myself.
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:45.280]   I love the fact that now I can just build whatever I want and get a large amount of
[01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:46.840]   funding for it and take five years.
[01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:49.680]   It's like-- it's like, you know, you get to a certain point in your career.
[01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:53.920]   You can actually build for a couple of years without worrying about it.
[01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:54.920]   It's like--
[01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:57.840]   How are you doing with the economic downturn, Kevin?
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:00.360]   Are you guys comfortable with your position?
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:01.720]   You got enough cash?
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:02.720]   Yeah.
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:10.000]   Dig just closed around to funding for 28 million here about three weeks ago.
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.320]   So we're in good position.
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:14.520]   You have plenty of runway as Kevin would say.
[01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:15.520]   Plenty.
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:16.520]   I mean, Jason would say.
[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:20.000]   Also, you have-- you guys have a guaranteed deal with Microsoft for your ad inventory,
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.680]   which was a brilliant move to sign that when you did.
[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:23.680]   Turns out, yeah.
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:24.680]   Yeah.
[01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:28.480]   Yeah, we signed a three-year deal with Microsoft, so they handle all of our ad sales for us.
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:31.560]   So really, for us, it's just like putting our heads down and just, you know, building
[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:33.040]   for the next few years.
[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:35.160]   Does that have a guarantee on it?
[01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:37.600]   I mean, do they guarantee you a certain amount of money?
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:40.840]   We can't talk about the terms for it, unfortunately.
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:43.280]   But I can tell you what the other deals were like Microsoft did.
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:47.440]   They did guarantee a CPM when they did a bunch of those deals.
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:51.200]   I don't know the dig deal, but when they did those deals, they guaranteed, like, typically
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:56.960]   five bucks, four bucks, six bucks to make sure that that's how they got it over Google.
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:33:57.960]   So they went and overpaid.
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:33:58.960]   Right.
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:33:59.960]   Right.
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:01.960]   In case I case, I think they overpaid.
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:02.960]   Right.
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:04.440]   With Facebook as well.
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:05.440]   Facebook, they overpaid.
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:06.440]   No.
[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:07.440]   So.
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:09.240]   It's nice to have a big daddy with deep pocket suits.
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:10.240]   What?
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:12.880]   Essentially, they're doing it for the data.
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:16.840]   So basically, they get all the data from the Facebook and dig users.
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:17.840]   It's not on an agency.
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:20.720]   It's more than just the ads, in other words, it's a valuable purpose.
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:25.240]   That's their play is they're trying to create profiles so they can serve ads across networks
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:26.840]   to groups of people.
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:33.240]   So that's the big, the big way I'm going to grab today is the data for the profile information,
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:34.240]   which is right.
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:35.240]   Facebook's very valuable.
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:36.920]   It's getting on to 2 a.m. in the UK.
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:40.680]   We're going to let Will Harris go to bed now.
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:41.680]   I think he already did.
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:43.480]   He's like, I'm bad at it.
[01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:44.480]   Whatever.
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:46.320]   No, no, no.
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:49.280]   It's only coming up to midnight because the clocks went back.
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:51.120]   Oh, your clocks have already gone back.
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:52.920]   So I got a bonus hour in bed this morning.
[01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:55.560]   Well, thank Alex for letting us steal you for the evening.
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:57.160]   Yeah, not at all.
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:01.920]   Channelflip.com, go there and see Will's crazy interview with me in a smoking jacket.
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:03.800]   I watched that just yesterday.
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:05.680]   There's some good ones on it.
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:07.040]   There's also Molly in her pajamas.
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:09.000]   Did you get all the mollies up?
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.240]   Oh, Molly was a YouTube sensation.
[01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:14.560]   She did over 100,000 views in the space of a day.
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:15.560]   Wow.
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:17.320]   And it's all because of the tongue and tattoo, right?
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:19.080]   Hey, so can I ask you a question?
[01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:20.840]   Are you seeing a lot more?
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:23.720]   I know you guys have open positions and we have some open developer positions.
[01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:26.440]   Are you seeing a lot more activity from resumes coming in?
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:27.440]   Absolutely.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:28.440]   Oh, boy.
[01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:30.520]   I've seen 10 times the amount of resumes.
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:31.800]   Oh, boy.
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:34.840]   People are qualified and I'm like, wow.
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:35.840]   It's insane.
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:37.880]   Number of people coming from Yahoo all over the place.
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:39.080]   Oh, it makes me want to cry.
[01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:41.720]   What are you thinking of hiring Molly Wood?
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:42.720]   I would.
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:45.160]   If I had the money, I'd hire Molly.
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:46.960]   I'd hire Sarah, but I can't afford you guys.
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:48.840]   I can only hire Dane.
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:50.760]   I work for like below minimum weight.
[01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:51.960]   Okay, you're hired.
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:52.960]   Yay.
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:56.400]   I'm stealing it.
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:57.400]   Thank you so much.
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:36:00.880]   We'll have a great night channel flip.com to see the Molly Wood interview and you've got
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:01.880]   more I know to come.
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:03.880]   Is the arena a slits key going up soon?
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:05.600]   That'll be fairly soon.
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:06.600]   Yeah.
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:07.600]   I hear she was a pistol.
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:10.680]   That's when we're putting it.
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:11.680]   Yes.
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:12.680]   She's a legend.
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:13.680]   She's a legend.
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:14.680]   A legend, a legend.
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:15.680]   Thank you.
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:16.680]   Thank you.
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:17.680]   Well, it's great to talk to you.
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:18.680]   Jason, always a pleasure to have you on to you.
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:19.680]   You're the greatest.
[01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:24.600]   Glad to hear that while you're saying this is the worst depression we've ever experienced
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:27.320]   in our little lifetimes, we'll survive it.
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:32.080]   I have a great investment tip for everybody in the audience, which is going to pay huge
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:35.160]   returns if they listen to me carefully.
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:36.320]   Invest in yourself.
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:37.960]   That's the best thing to do in a down market.
[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:41.960]   Invest in yourself in your own projects because they will pay the biggest dividends.
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:43.520]   And I can eat dog food for a while.
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:44.520]   It's okay.
[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:48.680]   If you're a PHP programmer and you're like a level seven out of 10, invest in being an
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:49.680]   eight.
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:54.120]   If you're a video editor and you're level eight, invest in being number nine.
[01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:58.720]   Invest in yourself in the down market, invest in your projects and you'll be fine on the
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:36:59.720]   other side.
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:00.720]   Excellent.
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:01.720]   Great advice.
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:02.720]   Thank you, Jason.
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:05.960]   mahalo.com, M-A-H-A-L-O.com.
[01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:07.920]   Sarah Lane is at revision three.
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:09.800]   You can see her on Pop Siren.
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:11.800]   That's right.
[01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:14.880]   Anything else in development?
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:15.880]   For me?
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:16.880]   Anything you want to talk about?
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:22.800]   There's always things in development, but for now, I spend most of my waking hours on
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:25.560]   Twitter or Tumblr or my own blog.
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:27.520]   I'm actually trying to blog more lately.
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:30.080]   No mention of the show we're hosting tomorrow.
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:31.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:32.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:33.080]   Thank you, Kevin.
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:35.680]   Kevin and I are going to host the Digreel this week.
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:36.680]   Okay.
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:41.040]   So that'll go live on Wednesday at 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern.
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:42.040]   That'll be fun to see.
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:44.040]   That's the first time you've done that together?
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:45.040]   The Digreel.
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:47.040]   It's the first time Kevin's been on the Digreel period.
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:48.040]   Wow, that's great.
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:49.040]   It's pretty fun.
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:52.040]   I'm hoping to get some fur flying.
[01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:54.040]   Kevin, what do you think?
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:58.040]   I think last time we hosted a show together was probably back G4 Tech TV days, right?
[01:37:58.040 --> 01:37:59.040]   It was.
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:01.040]   Yeah, it was like Attack of the Show.
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:02.040]   Wow.
[01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:03.040]   Years ago.
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:04.040]   Wow.
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:05.040]   Yeah.
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:07.040]   You were just a TV back then.
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:10.720]   Kevin was like, remember how like, Pudgy he used to be in the cheeks?
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:12.480]   I know he looks so skinny in that ink thing.
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:13.480]   Are you eating okay?
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:14.480]   You know what he is.
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:15.480]   He's a man of raxxic.
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:16.480]   He's a man of raxxic.
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:17.480]   I'm not.
[01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:21.200]   Just because I decided to drink a little less and work out of the gym, all of a sudden,
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:22.200]   I'm a man of raxxic.
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:23.200]   You know he was.
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:25.200]   He's got kids.
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:27.200]   Uh, got cannons.
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:29.440]   I mean, you're diesel compared to how you used to be.
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:31.680]   I mean, you look like you're hitting the weights.
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:32.920]   I just do a lot of climbing.
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:35.520]   Honestly, I'm not, I'm not in it to be like, oh, you're short hours.
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:36.520]   Oh, whatever.
[01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:38.120]   Look like, or Michael Fuff or something.
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:39.120]   Do I see Nick Loade?
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:40.600]   No, yeah, it does look good.
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:41.600]   I don't know about the hair.
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:42.600]   Not zoom in, Lee.
[01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:43.600]   I'm watching the video.
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:45.120]   Oh, look at the haircut.
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:46.120]   What is that haircut?
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:47.360]   I think it's nice.
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:48.360]   It's very military.
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:51.120]   It's nice, good old fast, real quick.
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:53.120]   It's going to war with the Twitter.
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:54.120]   That's right.
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:55.680]   But look at those guns.
[01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:56.680]   They're good.
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:57.680]   Look at that.
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:38:58.680]   Photoshone.
[01:38:58.680 --> 01:38:59.680]   Oh, cannons.
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:00.680]   Oh, geez.
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:01.680]   It's got the cannon.
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:05.920]   I didn't quite like going to show.
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:07.240]   We I don't know why we always review.
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:08.480]   It's like you're the kid brother.
[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:09.480]   That's why you're the kid brother.
[01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:10.480]   It's like that.
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:11.480]   I really feel like that.
[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:13.560]   I feel like Kevin's years younger than me, but he's only like, you know, like, I'm
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:15.440]   only like four months younger.
[01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:17.760]   He believe Kevin's almost 32 years old.
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:18.760]   This is that's nothing.
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:20.360]   You should see the tiger beat cover.
[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:23.320]   That's how we see the tiger beat cover.
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:26.560]   When the dream day cameras, no, you're not joking.
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:27.880]   No, he's on tiger beat.
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:28.880]   You didn't see?
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:31.960]   No, the one that says you're on the day.
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:35.680]   That would be so you know, you've made it if you make tiger beat.
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:36.680]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:37.680]   Zach F.
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:38.680]   Really?
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:40.240]   Evan Rose, who is your dream prom date?
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:41.240]   He's so hot.
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:45.480]   Sarah Lane.com is the blog.
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:50.520]   Kevin Rose is at dig.com and he and Sarah are going to be on the dig reel this Wednesday.
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:51.520]   Whatever.
[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:52.840]   Kevin, thank you for calling in.
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:54.240]   It's always great to hear from you.
[01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:55.240]   Thanks for having me.
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:58.160]   You called in after the halfway mark, so I don't have to actually pay you for this show.
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:39:59.160]   I just wanted to let you know.
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:00.160]   Oh, it's all good.
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:01.160]   No, I'm just kidding.
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:05.480]   I still haven't been getting my direct deposit, Leo, for sure.
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:06.480]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:07.480]   We'll work on that.
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:08.960]   Hey, great.
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:10.920]   We do means testing now in the checks.
[01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:11.920]   I should warn you.
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:16.800]   You'll have to send me your 1040.
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:17.800]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:26.680]   Another twin is in the can.
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:36.240]   What's happening is there's underneath you when you talk.
[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:37.760]   There's a.
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:40.280]   Let me call you one more time.
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:41.280]   Oh, Jesus.
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:42.280]   He's a womanizer.
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:43.280]   Did you see that womanizer video?
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:44.280]   The problem is.
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:45.280]   Ready spirits?
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:46.280]   I don't know.
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:47.280]   Is it hot?
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:48.280]   I haven't seen it.
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:50.280]   You can cover anybody with oil, put her in a steam room and have her lie on a bench.
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:51.280]   She's going to look good.
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:52.280]   Who screams like forget it.
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:53.280]   I'm killing you.
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:54.280]   I'm going to do it.
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:55.280]   I'm going to do it.
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:56.280]   I'm going to do it.
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:57.280]   I'm going to do it.
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:58.280]   I'm going to do it.
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:40:59.280]   I'm going to do it.
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:00.280]   I'm going to do it.
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:01.280]   I'm going to do it.
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:02.280]   I'm going to do it.
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:03.280]   I'm going to do it.
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:04.280]   I'm going to do it.
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:05.280]   I'm going to do it.
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:06.280]   I'm going to do it.
