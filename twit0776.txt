[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.760]   Yes, we will talk about WWDC and what you won't see
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:17.200]   at WWDC, how K-Pop stands and TikTok fans ruin Trump's rally.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.280]   And then Owen and I are going to compare grills.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.080]   It's all coming up on Twit.

[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.800]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech, the show
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.880]   where we cover the week's tech news.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.520]   It's Father's Day, so I'm wearing my flamingo shirt.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.000]   That's it.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.680]   That's the entire celebration right there.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.880]   It's over.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.040]   We'll say hello to our panel today.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.160]   It's going to be a good one.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.400]   We've got Andy Inaco here from WGBH in Boston,
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.200]   Boston Public Radio.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.760]   And of course, a regular host on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.760]   It's going to help you, Andy.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.080]   Thanks for being here.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.480]   I rarely get to do this show, so I'm really glad to have you on.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.240]   Well, because today is the Lord's Day.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.680]   I'm usually tied up in mass.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.160]   I shouldn't laugh, but I am.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.440]   OK, I shouldn't laugh.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.040]   You might be-- it might be sincere.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.040]   I don't know.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.600]   I'm not the most-- everything I know about the Bible
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.000]   is what things that Linus has said in peanuts.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.320]   That's a pretty good collection, actually.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:09.120]   Also with this-- Owen, JJ Stone-O-Dok-Dok-Dok from IQMZ.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.520]   And a great page on IQMZ and your lower third.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.280]   I want to recommend everybody check it out,
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.920]   because I just looked at it myself.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.600]   IQMZ.com/TheSystem, which is a compilation of videos
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.960]   from a variety of sources and some history
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.600]   about the system that we all grew up in.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.840]   But you know, like fish and water,
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.920]   sometimes if you grow up in something, you don't see it.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.560]   It's not there.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.560]   So this is an eye opener.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.960]   It's good.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.360]   Thank you.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.000]   You're welcome.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.440]   I appreciate it.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.120]   Oh, Dr. On the Twitter.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.640]   Also joining us from Canadian, the land of the north,
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.880]   where everything is better but a little bit blue.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.200]   It's Georgia Dow, anxiety-videos.com.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.720]   And she's giving out her email address,
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.800]   and that's on the lower third.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.480]   I'll give it out again a little later if you were having a--
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.760]   that's what you said last time, Aaron.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.480]   If you have a little hard time, you
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.840]   could send your note, because she's a trained psychotherapist.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.480]   She could talk you off the ledge.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.640]   Hello, Georgia.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.200]   Hey, how are you doing?
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.720]   I'm great.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.640]   Nice to see you.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.000]   Nice to see all of you.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.040]   The best thing is, at the end of the week,
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.200]   to get together was people I really love and talk
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.480]   about the week's news.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.400]   What did you want to say, Owen?
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.240]   Can I break a rule?
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.680]   Normally, at the end of the show, I give people a message.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.560]   But since his father's dad's want to give a father's day
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.680]   message, they're not there at all.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.840]   Kick it off.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.880]   Love, OK.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.480]   So the moment my child was born,
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.040]   my dad was outside the room.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.640]   And I'm holding my child.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.760]   And my dad walked in the room.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.720]   I started crying like a baby.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.680]   I looked at my child.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.400]   I looked at my dad.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.920]   I said, do you loved me this much?
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.920]   Like you love me this much.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.760]   Oh, you can't believe in my heart
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.480]   that you've loved me like this my whole life.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.760]   Like I love you, dad.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.680]   And I know that you.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.560]   But did no having my own child looking back at me
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.600]   and that it made me love him 10 times more.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.240]   And so every time one of my friends as a child,
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.600]   I try to give him a little bit of time.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.360]   But usually by the next day, I call him.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.960]   And I say, how amazing is it to know
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.840]   that someone loved you that much?
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.000]   You can get married.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.960]   You can get dogs.
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.520]   You can do all kinds of stuff.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.080]   But there's nothing like having your child in your hands
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.000]   and looking at your child.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.680]   That is the unconditional love.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.120]   And that is an amazing bond.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.760]   So happy Father's Day to all the dads out there
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.520]   doing their job and kicking butt.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.400]   And isn't it amazing to know that someone loves you
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.720]   the way that you love your child?
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.000]   And it is a beautiful thing.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.200]   Happy Father's Day to everybody out there in these streets.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.600]   Oh, that is really well put.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.120]   Thank you, Owen.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.320]   That's really true too.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.800]   You don't really know what it's like to be a parent
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.640]   till you're a parent.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.800]   Yeah, I literally-- he walked in the room
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.160]   and I'm holding her and I just started crying.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.040]   And I was like, I can't believe your heart had the capacity
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.880]   to do this for me.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.240]   And I mean, my dad was always-- my dad loved me and stuff.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.520]   But I was like, oh, you really, really love me.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.520]   Like--
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.320]   Big, nice gift.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.120]   He know that.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.920]   Got the treasure.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.120]   I was like, you don't love me.
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.720]   You don't give-- but I was like, he really--
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.880]   like, we've got 1,000% with everything in his being loved me.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.280]   And that is an amazing feeling for anybody
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.600]   who gets to have it mother or father.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.120]   That's really awesome.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.760]   Oh, I am supposed to console you, both of you,
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.120]   on your lost Friday.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.680]   We had our after hours this week was Texas Hold 'em Poker.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.120]   Combined with it, ask me anything.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.680]   It was kind of an unusual mix.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.160]   And I think you can blame the distraction
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.160]   of the questions on your law.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.000]   Who took the pot?
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.880]   I didn't get to see it yet.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.960]   Who took the pot?
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.520]   Ian the mustache, man.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.440]   Of course he did.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.000]   He did.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.520]   He did.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.040]   Podr to the close, though.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.600]   Podray, Ian Thompson, and of course, Jason Howell,
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.320]   who ran out of money early on, but his rendition
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.040]   of the Spice Girls to get more money.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.920]   I did see that.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.800]   That was pretty special.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.360]   He had to shake it a little bit to get some extra coin.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:18.960]   If you want to be--
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.760]   I think he enjoyed it.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.360]   Oh, he enjoyed it.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.360]   He enjoyed it.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.120]   He went all out the eyes at the end.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.480]   He was like, he had it all.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.800]   He was doing it.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.360]   Oh, and then they rebank rolled him, I guess.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.480]   That's good.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.000]   Oh, yeah, he earned that.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.040]   I should also say thank you for joining us on Juneteenth.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.200]   And when I was very proud, we had a donation button
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.120]   on the event the whole time.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.400]   So I don't know how much money we
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.920]   managed to raise for Black Lives Matter,
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.920]   but I'm glad we could do that as well.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.200]   So I was looking money way.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.240]   Yo, we're raising money.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.240]   I demand a refund.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.240]   Poor Owen is coming out on the wrong side
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.600]   of the stick a couple of times.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.320]   You know what?
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.400]   Florence Ion has not yet cracked my Bitcoin wallet.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.680]   Would you like a triad at Owen?
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.360]   I'll put it out there to anonymous.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.240]   I'm going to get in that thing.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.480]   Let anonymous break it.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.320]   Let anonymous do it.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.440]   My daughter's on anonymous list, but apparently my daughter
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.360]   tweets them all the time.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.320]   They be tweeting back at her.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.640]   She's about to be an anonymous one.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.560]   I know about to get these coins.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.960]   Uncle Leo, she about to join the--
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.400]   I have a-- if she wants, I have a V for Vendetta mask.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.680]   She could borrow.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:25.960]   If she--
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:26.960]   Ooh.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.680]   You need that.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.200]   She didn't need that.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.200]   Oh, no, we need that.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:31.960]   Oh, you didn't need that.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.680]   I'll send it off to you.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:39.920]   I have both that and the fake Mr. Robot V for Vendetta mask.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:40.920]   They don't look the same.
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.320]   It's kind of funny, but they're suggestive of one another,
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.000]   I guess.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.880]   At least you got something in pop culture, right?
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.600]   You know what I mean?
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.160]   Oh, I know.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.120]   You know, I'm proud that I don't know anything
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.000]   about pop culture.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.320]   Nothing.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.360]   Not a broom and--
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.000]   That's not enough room in my brain, that's right.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.160]   You're like, there's 42 diodes in the third chip
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.120]   that was made in 1874.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.080]   Thirds is right.
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.680]   I mean, who's that?
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.160]   I don't even know that anymore.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.320]   It's all going.
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.080]   It's trickling out like sand in a sand bag with a little hole
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.040]   and it's just trickling out all of it.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.120]   Come on, B.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.680]   B. Bebe, aren't you happy?
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.560]   You can still remember your library card number
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.120]   from when you were like nine or 10 years old.
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.040]   Those things never go.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:21.520]   Yeah.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.720]   I know my copies serve ID.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.400]   75106, 3135.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.320]   A lot of good that's going to be.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.520]   Nerd.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.520]   Nerd.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.720]   Nerd.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.720]   Nerd.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.720]   Nerd.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.960]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.360]   Tomorrow is WWDC 2020.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.520]   The kickoff, we will do our live coverage of the keynote.
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:50.200]   From the Steve Jobs Theater, empty, I presume, 10 AM Pacific.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.680]   Mike Asargin and I will be sitting right here.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.480]   I'm a little excited about WWDC.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.200]   We've been talking about it and we talked about it
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.240]   on Mac Break Weekly at length, last couple of weeks.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.440]   But there was a suggestion for some time
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:12.080]   that there might be some new hardware, like a new iMac,
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.840]   maybe a new Apple TV.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:19.200]   John Prosser, who is the premier Apple leaker these days,
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.440]   and Mac's Wineback both said any new hardware,
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:29.040]   reveal it, WWDC tomorrow, has been scrapped.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.200]   So if you're waiting for a new iPad Pro or a new iMac
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:36.120]   or a new Apple TV or a new AirPods Studio, AirTags,
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.400]   which we know are in the future somewhere, not tomorrow.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.560]   That's the one that's really pointed.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.160]   I'll be devastated.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.000]   I'm with you, Andy.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.240]   I will be devastated if I don't get my AirTags.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.760]   So hopefully they're wrong, at least about the AirTags,
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.120]   because I think those could be.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.360]   If done well, I think that they could be really life changing.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.120]   I mean, if half of what we've heard about these things
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.840]   is true, that they're not just Apple pointing at, hey,
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.160]   you know, these Bluetooth LE trackers?
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.080]   Let's do one of them too.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.120]   But as opposed to let's get support
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.520]   for really, really precise location through hardware
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.720]   in our phone so that they can be more useful than a vague, oh,
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.400]   some dude on a bike passed by where your bag used to be 10
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.160]   hours ago, as opposed to-- no, no, no, here's exactly where
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.160]   your dog-- here's exactly where your cat is hiding.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.880]   Or here's the room that you left--
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.520]   that you left your keys in that one time.
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.720]   And it really was the only-- apart from the iMac,
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.680]   it was the only piece of hardware that I thought
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.120]   was-- at least was anticipating some sort of an announcement
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:38.720]   about.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.880]   So I hope that the AirTags counts
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.120]   as an accessory, as a lifestyle add-on,
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.600]   and not technically as a piece of hardware,
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.720]   because I would love to finally see a demo of it.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.360]   And by the way, Mark German confirms
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.560]   that he heard this too.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:12:00.760]   If you have three of the top Apple rumor leakers saying this,
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:05.760]   it seems likely to me that they were told this by Apple
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.200]   in effect, that Apple said--
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.280]   and Apple wanted this to go out.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.920]   And of course, they would, because if they weren't going
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.720]   to announce anything tomorrow and everybody expected something,
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.000]   there would be-- that would be a Paul over the--
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.720]   yeah, there'd be a lot of disappointment.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:24.040]   So I'm not-- but why, George, did you think Apple would have--
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.040]   I mean, surely they've got tags ready?
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.160]   Why would they be holding on?
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:29.840]   I don't know.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.480]   I would think that there's something
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.960]   that they need to wait on.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.280]   I would like for them, even if they're not
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.640]   going to release them soon, that we can just go through them.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.160]   Give me a little bit of excitement.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.160]   I think that people need it right now.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.280]   And I think this could be really helpful to everyone.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.840]   So I'm hoping they still release AirTags.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.920]   I know everyone else is, it's the max.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.720]   And I'm good with just giving you my tags
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.440]   so that I can find my dog and my children and my phone
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:01.400]   and my car and myself and my purse.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.520]   I would love that.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.080]   I would love it.
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.160]   I need a little bit of all of that.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.160]   So I think that it would be that they weren't ready.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.480]   If I could just put a tag in there.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:09.880]   Wouldn't you have them?
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.400]   I would have 12.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.320]   Everywhere.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.280]   Well, we had Tracker as an advertiser.
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.720]   And I've used both the Tracker and the Bataille.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.920]   They're both Bluetooth trackers.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.800]   But I get the feeling that what Apple's doing
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.800]   is a little different from that.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:33.080]   One of the rumors around it is that it is Bluetooth-le,
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.160]   but it's also based on some of custom Bluetooth hardware
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.360]   and Bluetooth wireless hardware that is inside every single--
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.360]   and every single iPhone already.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.520]   This UWP chip.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   And that's what's weird because they put this in the iPhone.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.480]   It's been out six months.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.000]   The only thing I know of that it uses it
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.600]   is the airdrop where you can point it at the person
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.160]   and you're going to send it to.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.360]   That seems like such a trivial use for something clearly
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:04.800]   that added to the cost of build on the iPhone.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.040]   They must have expected air tags before this.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.680]   Well, not just that, but remember that Apple--
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.120]   I'll make that quick.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.760]   But when you realize that Apple builds iPhones
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.320]   to last four or five years, they could put that chip
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.920]   in anticipating an announcement two or three years from now
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.320]   and still decide that it's cheap enough
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.560]   and it's relevant enough to put this inside every hardware.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.320]   Particularly if we put inside the hardware at a point
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.960]   where not everybody's going to use it
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.400]   so it's not going to cause anything to blow up.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.760]   So if this stuff-- if they announce it,
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.240]   they're going to announce it, right?
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.320]   They're going to release it.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.520]   Here's the problem.
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.480]   The world is upside down.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:44.200]   So you getting a hold of one is probably their issue.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.960]   Because you know how they always have their first wave
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.680]   and then there's a stall and then the next wave comes in
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.400]   because they only make so many of something
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.480]   with their expectations of their first wave.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.600]   But something like this, they might have a production problem.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.640]   Could be, yes.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.760]   Like only have X amount.
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.760]   And some people like Georgia, Georgia, yeah, my email.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.560]   You might want to email me.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.200]   You're about to have super duper sadness in your heart
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.280]   if you don't get one of these--
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.280]   Oh.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.280]   I will.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.280]   I really will.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.280]   If we get nothing, nothing at all, I will be sad.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.080]   Like I like software.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.640]   But actually something you could afford.
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.400]   Like, oh, I'm going to look at the new Oracle Leo
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.520]   "Miss Gonduras to Bett trip."
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.280]   You just have someone's sadness in your heart.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.280]   About these tags.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.480]   That is what should be worn.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.080]   There's only 14 of them.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.080]   There's a lot of Apple nerds on YouTube that get first dibs.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.400]   So just relax.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.640]   Know that they're coming.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.320]   But you probably won't get one.
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.240]   That's going to be the issue.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.560]   You're probably not going to get one.
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.840]   But they will be out in the world.
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.120]   That's my thought process on that.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:40.800]   Isn't that funny?
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.640]   Because of course, it could just be that there's a production
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.560]   issue.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.160]   The world is locked down under pandemic.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.000]   But we've all kind of--
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.720]   At least I have in my mind kind of said,
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.240]   oh, China's back open again.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.240]   They're kind of open.
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.680]   They're not fully open.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.160]   They kept saying iPhone production for the iPhone 12
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.680]   is on track and things like that.
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:59.320]   But who knows?
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.280]   Maybe they couldn't make it.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.720]   Maybe it wasn't important enough to devote limited factory
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.280]   capability to those.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.360]   They got behind on other things that they need to get made.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.920]   So it's not just about having--
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.000]   Got to make the iPhone.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.600]   They can't not make the iPhones.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:13.960]   You know what I mean?
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.920]   There's a level of production and importance there.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:17.360]   You know what I mean?
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.120]   So I don't know.
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.400]   Like I said, we're going to find out tomorrow.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.840]   They say, I know they're going to come out.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.720]   I know they're going to have them.
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.960]   But they're only going to have 12.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.280]   I just think.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.680]   It's a very important point.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:27.840]   Don't to share.
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.080]   Very important point.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.440]   You get to--
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.880]   I'll take two.
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.960]   Apple is closing.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.240]   Re-closing.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.800]   Apple is re-closing some stores, 11 stores
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.040]   that were reopened in Florida, Arizona, North Carolina,
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.560]   and South Carolina are being closed due to COVID spikes
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.880]   in that area.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.480]   So that's another probably factor.
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.560]   And this Apple has slowly been reopening its US stores
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.880]   and stores around the world.
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.880]   With some obvious precautions, you
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.400]   have to get your temperature taken.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.560]   You have to answer some health questions.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:06.160]   You also have to socially distance when you're in there.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:11.400]   And most importantly, you must wear a mask inside.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.160]   But nevertheless, they decided, even though they've
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.960]   reopened, the majority of US retail stores
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.560]   are going to re-close 11 of them in those hard hit states.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.360]   I just feel like it's going to be hard hit in a lot of places.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.920]   So maybe that store opening was a little premature.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.200]   I don't know.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:32.360]   Well, both Florida is famous for being super, super aggressive
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.440]   with the political end of, oh, we've
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.280]   got to get everything reopened as quickly as possible.
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.240]   So it's similarly Arizona results.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.480]   A lot of governors that have been really on the bandwagon
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.400]   of this isn't a medical crisis.
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.160]   This is a political crisis.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.480]   And then, secondarily, it's a financial crisis.
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.800]   Only number three health crisis have
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.840]   been racing to get things back to as normal as possible,
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:55.840]   as quickly as possible.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.160]   And these are the places that we're
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.480]   seeing these research and spikes.
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.240]   So I don't know.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:03.400]   Maybe this is going to be a maker of a political ad saying,
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.560]   the reason why you can't get these new beautiful air
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.520]   tags from Apple is because your Republican governor
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.280]   decided to reopen.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.640]   Possibly, although I have to say it's
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.400]   spiking in other places, too, including I think here in California,
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.560]   we're going to start to see a spike.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.600]   But that's not fun.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.480]   So let's not talk about that anymore.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.040]   Let's talk some more about WWDC.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.040]   OK.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:33.360]   Like maybe we'll get to see the new super pro AirPods.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.840]   No, we're not going to see any hardware.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.960]   Any, they say no.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.600]   I mean, that's the other big disappointment, if that was true.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.320]   I mean, it makes sense that they would kind of wait
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.240]   for an iPhone event.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:46.240]   But given that we've seen like sneaks of that
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:50.040]   and help files and info files that have been embedded in,
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.440]   like a previously saw it was, at least somebody at some point
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.640]   thought that that was going to be imminent a few months ago.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.720]   No, this was, it seemed to me, a very well-sourced leak
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.280]   because you even had images of a new iMac, a new small bezel
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.760]   iMac.
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.960]   The tags have been-- but for sure must have been available by now.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.800]   So there's something, you know, who knows.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.480]   And it could also be Apple's dampening down the expectations.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.960]   So when they announce only five new products,
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.960]   people will be very, very happy.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:22.000]   We just-- I feel like Apple plays us like a fiddle.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.400]   And they don't have seals this year.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.400]   So it's going to be rough for them
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.200]   to do their whole song and dance.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.280]   Yeah, they don't have the applause.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.480]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.480]   Have Apple.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.600]   I bet there'll be some workers that are in there that
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.480]   will cheer like extra loud.
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.960]   Like they'll be like 10% less.
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.640]   So they have to cheer 10% more.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.200]   I'm sure it won't just be dead air.
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.040]   I'm sure there's a little tip in there.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.760]   Here's a little tip if you're at an event that
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.520]   didn't have the turnout, people expected,
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.040]   for whatever reason.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:57.680]   I learned this when I used to do live with Regis and Kelly.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.240]   Their producer, Gellman, would come out
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.880]   to do the warm-out before every show.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.560]   And the funny thing is, he got great laughs,
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:09.080]   but he said exactly the same thing every single time.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.280]   It never varied.
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.120]   One of the things he said is, if you clap faster,
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.640]   it sounds like there's more people.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.920]   Just a little tip.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.960]   Clap three times faster.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.480]   It sounds like there's 19,000 people in that arena.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.720]   Just clap faster.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.160]   That's the key.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.280]   I'm just hoping that it'll be like the old Tom Snyder show,
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.480]   where it's just all about trying to make the crew laugh.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.920]   I love that show.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.280]   The person's running the Snapchat, running the camera.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.000]   Yeah, you're Tim, you nailed it.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.880]   Yeah, I can see Tim talk to the camera guy, Alex.
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.240]   You know what I'm saying, Alex?
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.280]   You know what I'm saying, right?
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.280]   I did watch that show with--
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.960]   you must be the only person on this panel.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.360]   I'll remember Tom Snyder and besides me.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.040]   I used to watch Letterman and then watch Tom Snyder on to that show.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.040]   And so just, again, just knowing that all he wanted to do
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.120]   was make those six union guys laugh,
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.720]   and that was pretty much it.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.320]   But you also have a point.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.400]   Today, the New York Times had, I think,
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:12.040]   their first sticking their neck up prediction of, oh, well,
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:15.000]   according to unnamed sources that we have inside Apple,
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.480]   Apple is definitely going to be transitioning
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.120]   to arm processors away from Intel.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.120]   And whenever that happens immediately, at a time
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.280]   where it's really useful for Apple to--
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.920]   for a piece of Apple news to come out,
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.200]   I don't know that it was an authorized leak,
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.680]   but that's the sort of thing where I start to wonder
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.080]   if we're seeing some manipulation here,
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.920]   that Apple wanted a big story to be out in the newspaper
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.840]   of record the day before.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.680]   It's a sort of soft on the ground for announcements
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:44.800]   that we're going to have.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.280]   I do think that the-- and by the way, I think from now on,
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:52.240]   we should no longer say it's a transition to arm,
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.960]   because I think that misrepresents it.
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:54.400]   Oh, true.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.120]   Apple leaving Intel for its own chips is really a more--
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.240]   isn't that more accurate way to put it?
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.880]   And it's the way that they'll describe it when it happens.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.160]   They're not going to know what arm is.
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.320]   They'll say, oh, we're doing it.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.800]   And they'll say, here's all the things
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.400]   we can do now if we're--
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.960]   they're going to go into--
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.600]   here's the amazing things we've been able to do
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.280]   with the iPhone's performance and the iPad's performance
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.880]   and the iPhone and iPad's features.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.080]   Here's the reason why there is touch ID, biometric ID,
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.840]   on every single iOS device that we ship,
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.920]   because we have all the iPhones and iPads.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.120]   But we've only been able to recently put it on the Macs.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.400]   It's because we were able to bake that stuff right
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.440]   into the CPUs.
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.280]   And now we're going to make Macs just as good
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.800]   as the iPhones and the iPads, which I think has been--
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.720]   That's an interesting spin.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.120]   Big Aria for the past three years.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.280]   Oh, that is a very interesting way to put it.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.280]   Because one of the concerns people
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:49.800]   who have an experience with ARM, particularly Windows on ARM,
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.560]   have is that it's going to be not very performant.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.000]   Windows on ARM is a pig.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:54.720]   It's awful.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:59.600]   But they're using off-the-shelf Qualcomm chips primarily.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.600]   So Apple's got to fight a little bit, fight that perception.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.120]   I think that's a very good point.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.040]   Look how fast our iPad Pro is.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.560]   We wanted to bring all that power and performance
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.120]   to our test tops.
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.320]   It's a much better story.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.720]   And to be fair, I mean, I don't know--
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.720]   I'm not going to say I've killed them,
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.240]   but I've got to shovel in my backyard
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.160]   in the whole bunch of Intel chips right there.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.800]   Are you all AMD now?
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:24.840]   Have you moved to the rising?
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.760]   Yes.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.760]   Look at that.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.080]   Let me tell you something.
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.840]   Let me tell the people about my new system.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:30.880]   Let me look at it.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:31.640]   Look at it.
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.160]   Love it while you're talking about it.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.280]   Give it a love and love.
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:37.840]   You never knew you could love a computer so much.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.000]   Dad.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.640]   Brother right here.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.520]   Just a big Roy right here.
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.680]   AMD 3900.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.200]   Oh.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:51.120]   DDR Corsair Dominator Ram 128 gigs.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.360]   Don't have to do what I recommend.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.080]   I don't think I want to do that.
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.880]   I don't know.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.120]   The most I do is 4K video, which is
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.640]   blazer-fast moment.
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.280]   That's my-- just blinkety-bligga in my face, OK?
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.680]   I got 8 gig video corner, but this thing,
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.720]   I got the core set cool and water cool in this piece.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.080]   I'm-- oh, this-- oh, you're so sexy.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.120]   Look, I have--
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.800]   What a dominant Ram knows where it's at.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.800]   I was--
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.960]   AMD is out here destroying Intel.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:19.480]   And now--
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.480]   It's true.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:25.160]   Intel is the new world girl sitting in the corner
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.400]   that can't dance at the party.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.720]   Why don't you come?
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.480]   Don't answer.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.160]   You used to shake it for us, but now you don't.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.800]   So now you're sitting there in the chair,
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.960]   and we got arm over here dancing, having fun.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.960]   We got AMD over here, break dancing,
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.840]   and bring everybody onto the floor.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.520]   And Intel just said, said, "representational."
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.520]   It used to be.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.160]   I love that when you're talking about it, Owen,
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.440]   it almost sounds like even more enthusiastic
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.960]   when you're talking about the birth of your child,
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:50.960]   which I know it isn't.
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.200]   I don't want to just love her.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.920]   But I see that that excitement that's coming.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.480]   No, no, no.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.760]   For your computer, my husband's the same way,
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.800]   so I totally get it.
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.000]   The last thing helps me out.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.920]   The enemy will leave me trash out fast.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.840]   The thing is popping up.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.480]   No, I'm totally with you.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:11.240]   If I were in the showroom and I'm looking at, OK,
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.600]   well, here's the new Mac Pro.
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.040]   Here's the new iMac Pro.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.320]   And then the salesperson wanted to get me--
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:20.160]   swing me towards a more high profitability--
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.080]   Windows machine.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.520]   Well, this one's got the Threadripper.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.360]   You mean that I could get a computer with a Threadripper?
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.080]   Wow.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.280]   That's very hard.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.080]   That's the-- no, no, on the Mac Pro.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:34.320]   The Mac can get the i7 based on Icy Lake 10th century.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.280]   Oh, it's too icy.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:35.800]   I won.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.160]   I'm not a Threadripper.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.080]   I'm not a Threadripper.
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:39.800]   I'm such a man.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.600]   I was making funny about men and cars,
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.000]   but it is just like that.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.040]   I saw the interbank, and I said to myself,
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:49.720]   I don't care that this Red Cross $650.
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.280]   I mean, it don't really do--
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.080]   again, I don't really need it.
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.560]   But in case I got to have it.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:55.880]   You got it.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.000]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.360]   There we go.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.560]   I showed it brought to you by LinkedIn Learning.
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:01.520]   I know you guys love--
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:05.320]   we've loved LinkedIn Learning for years.
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.720]   We've been talking about it for years.
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.760]   Part of that is because I know a lot of the teachers there.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.800]   Some of the best people in photography, Photoshop,
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.320]   in my area are teach at LinkedIn.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.520]   But boy, they have a lot of courses,
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.680]   and it's not just geeky subjects.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:24.120]   Its courses always taught by industry experts.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:28.880]   There's more than 16,000 courses on LinkedIn Learning.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.160]   Beautifully shot, but in a variety of skills.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:37.360]   I mean, there are skills like how to master working from home.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.080]   There's entrepreneurship courses.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.720]   There's one called Entrepreneurship Foundations.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.080]   How to be a resilient leader?
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.600]   Everything you need.
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:50.320]   10 ways to stay motivated while job hunting.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.080]   Marketing on LinkedIn.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.880]   This is the one I've got to take.
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.840]   It's called simply grit.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:57.760]   Grit.
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:01.040]   How teams persevere to accomplish great goals.
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.600]   It is LinkedInlearning.com/twit.
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.080]   You'll get custom tailored course recommendations.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.680]   And it's more than just some old video thrown up on YouTube.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:13.160]   But not only is there a series, and they're nice and short chunks.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.000]   So you can absorb them at your break time
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.240]   or whenever you get a chance.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.040]   But each lesson has project files and quizzes.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:23.600]   So it's really in a whole custom curriculum.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.560]   So you really will learn.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.280]   And courses are available any time you need them on a computer,
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.200]   on a phone.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.600]   You'll get a certificate that you can print when you complete a course.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.480]   Or do what I do.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.480]   Put it on your LinkedIn profile.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.640]   LinkedIn Learning is where you can grow your skills,
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.680]   grow your career, learn from expert instructors

[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.480]   And I bet you you can find a course or two
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.640]   that you'd like to take right now.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.880]   Well, here's some good news.

[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:05.720]   LinkedInlearning.com/twit.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.000]   It's time now is a good time to learn.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.920]   Thank you LinkedIn Learning for supporting this week in tech.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:18.440]   Apple is sending out these beautiful--
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.520]   the part of the reason people love WWC
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.400]   is the jackets and the pins.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.360]   Nobody's going, so there's no jackets and pins.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:28.440]   But they are sending them out to their winners
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.200]   in the Global Swift Student Challenge.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.240]   And these are the pins.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.000]   There's an apple.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.680]   There's also the applications icon.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.360]   There's a 2020 icon.
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.240]   There's a juice box with an apple on it.
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.680]   I love that.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.480]   A chilly guy.
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.360]   It's kind of like an emoji, but he's chilling.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.760]   California Republic Bear Flag, that's their state flag.
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.120]   Some Googly eyes.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.880]   But my favorite is this one, the unicorn
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.280]   looking over the top of a laptop lid, a MacBook lid.
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.280]   I want that so bad.
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.680]   Is that awesome?
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:01.840]   Yeah, the unicorn.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:02.920]   Oh, man.
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.600]   I need someone just to send me the unicorn.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.320]   You can have the rest of them.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.320]   Well, that's--
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.400]   That's my daughter's logo.
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.040]   So I was going to give her the unicorn to somebody
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:11.240]   five-day unicorn.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:15.240]   350 winners in the Swift Student Challenge.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.240]   They're going to get their pin sets.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.600]   And they're going to get their beautiful jackets.
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.320]   And that's pretty cool.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.200]   The jacket-- I may be overstating things
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.160]   a bit to say beautiful.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.160]   Chat was that member's only?
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.400]   Not sure about the jacket.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.280]   But only jacket.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.640]   Members only?
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.920]   It's a-- yeah, what is that design?
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.120]   I'm not sure.
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:39.880]   It looks like it would go well at the roller skating rink
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.360]   when it's--
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.920]   you know, skate back--
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.120]   Is it saying something on it?
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.560]   Is it written or is it just--
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:48.560]   Well, there's a tag that says WWDC 20.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:51.600]   But I imagine sometimes there's something inside that's--
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.960]   in the past, they've been reversible.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.680]   But they're not showing it-- well, maybe this is just a winner.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.160]   So this isn't Apple's picture of it.
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.880]   So maybe it is reversible.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:00.840]   I don't know.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.960]   You see, there's this zipper pull and it says it.
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:07.840]   So a more grew-- there's a--
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.760]   here's a more blue-green-- now there's going to be a debate.
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:11.920]   Is it pink?
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.880]   Is it blue?
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.280]   We don't know what color it is.
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.120]   It's a little purpley to me.
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.120]   Purpley.
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:17.960]   I'm going to try this.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.760]   We might get to see it tomorrow.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.000]   The stripes do not say anything.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.960]   They look a little bit like bling.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.280]   Look like they blinged the jacket.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.440]   So arm-- I'm sorry.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.160]   I did it, see?
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.040]   It's easy to do, Andy, isn't it?
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.520]   The Apple chip transition will be happening.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.280]   Beginning tomorrow.
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.960]   I believe that's going to happen.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.600]   And we know there'll be iOS 14, which
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.120]   will have some new features like you
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:46.000]   could start your car with it.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.280]   Car not included.
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.320]   I don't know.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.640]   There's not much more you can do.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.880]   I'm hoping that they will come through on the rumor
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:59.000]   that there will be widgets on the screen.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:30:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.120]   There's a lot that they can do now, particularly now,
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:05.240]   that they've really aggressively moved towards,
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.800]   hey, the iPad is not just this amorphous device that
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.080]   does a whole bunch of stuff.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.080]   They really are saying we're giving you
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.480]   as much value for $1,000 as $1,000 spent on Windows
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.760]   or any other sort of device.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.000]   So I'm hoping that this means that they improve iPadOS
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.080]   and they approve the launcher.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:24.080]   They do things to make it more feature-for-feature
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:27.920]   competitive with a computer that runs at desktop OS
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.720]   and can conceivably do anything.
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.560]   And I think that we're hearing a lot of rumors
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.320]   towards that effect.
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.240]   It'll be closer, but it's still going to--
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.440]   it's not-- anything is probably too far, right?
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.560]   They're not going to fix Siri.
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:41.680]   We're still going to get--
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:42.680]   No.
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:43.520]   No.
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.760]   Will they-- I guess if they're not going to announce
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.720]   any new hardware, I'm going to have to buy an Apple TV
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.880]   because mine's on the Frits I was waiting.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.360]   The HomePod, there were lots of rumors
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.960]   they might have a small HomePod, a less expensive HomePod.
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.160]   That thing has been a unicorn, speaking of unicorns,
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.320]   all by itself for more than a year now.
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.560]   It seems like it's almost two years.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:04.400]   There's anything with that.
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.160]   There's no market share of the Deakin.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:10.280]   There's too many good smart speakers out there right now.
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:12.320]   You'd be nuts to buy it.
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.840]   I don't know who bought it besides, like,
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:16.600]   if you bought one of those, you have an addiction
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:17.840]   and you're a super fanboy.
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.120]   Because no other reason to get it.
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.840]   Siri is trash.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.640]   Like right now, Amazon, I can literally put Amazon
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.240]   in my nostril right now.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:29.120]   They got a speaker from my nostril where I can talk to my face
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.560]   and get information.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:34.440]   Like there's no way Apple can compete with the smile.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.400]   It's a blink.
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.640]   It's just bad for them.
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:41.280]   I don't know, that should just die off until they buy something
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:41.480]   out.
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.920]   It's a very weird product.
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.240]   It may well be the way it is.
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.560]   I like it for sound.
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.120]   I think the sound is pretty good.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.560]   But it's not.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:51.160]   But there's a lot of things that have the right sound.
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:51.360]   Yeah.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.760]   I guess that's right.
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:53.880]   But it's smart features.
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:54.760]   It doesn't help you.
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.840]   You just complain and want to see her to be better.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.360]   There is a rumor.
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.960]   There is a rumor.
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:00.880]   She makes me angry.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:01.480]   You're right.
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.760]   There is a rumor.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:03.680]   This is exciting.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.400]   You'll be able to put Spotify on it.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:12.920]   You know, it's just, I want, you know, like, I--
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:13.440]   It's not.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.080]   I want to be able to start a series.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.280]   She doesn't scream at me back.
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.680]   Yeah, because she doesn't know what's going on.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.080]   She needs--
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:20.600]   She needs--
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:21.080]   Yeah, we can kind of--
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.720]   --for a little bit of an intelligence upgrade.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.320]   So you're right.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.440]   I said hi to Google the other day,
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.040]   because I have both, obviously.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.520]   And I was like, ah, I said something.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.240]   And Google's like, are you doing OK?
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.520]   The world's in a rough time.
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:36.040]   Wow.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.040]   OK.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.040]   I'm like, OK.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.920]   I think that's a little intrusive to be honest with you.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:46.120]   Go get my little foot tub and then rub that.
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:48.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.280]   You're up to you right back.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:51.040]   Don't write checks.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.960]   You can't cash, Google.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.680]   Yeah, I don't think serious garbage.
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.520]   But man, when you compare it to either of the two-wall
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.040]   alternatives--
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.040]   Not even close.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.560]   --it doesn't do the thing that Apple stuff is supposed to do,
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.520]   which is to really create a sense of joy about it.
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.520]   But then there's a simple failure.
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.040]   No, it doesn't want that.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.560]   I mean, there's also the--
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.160]   Have you tried to-- hey, Google the floor is lava?
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:17.080]   And I was like, oh, no, the floor is lava.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.560]   And then they'll be like, earthquake-ing,
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.000]   because you're supposed to, like, then you're
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   with your kids, like, for the next 30 seconds,
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.280]   like, not step on the floor.
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.280]   I'm like, oh, right.
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.520]   Somebody got paid to do that.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.480]   And I approve of that.
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.720]   But it's not just the software.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:29.960]   It's so great.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.040]   If I want a smart speaker from Apple,
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.840]   I have to spend hundreds of dollars
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:37.160]   on a speaker that's not necessarily better than another smart
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:37.920]   speaker that's been--
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:38.400]   Not smart.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.240]   --coused about 20.
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:42.160]   But also, I want one of these, too, in the lineup.
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.000]   I want one of these next to my desk,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.080]   so I don't have to shout into the next room
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:49.040]   so that the one smart speaker that I can afford
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.800]   can actually set a reminder or tell me whether I need a jacket
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.640]   or do any of the soul comforting things that these things do.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:00.800]   When you can spend anywhere from $30 for a basic one,
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.040]   to $100 for one with a very good speaker,
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:08.160]   to now $100 for one with an actual screen on it,
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.960]   Apple just doesn't seem to be interested in competing
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:11.480]   on this level.
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:13.120]   They just need to think that--
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.200]   Honestly, it feels like--
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:18.160]   You cannot say Apple's heart is in this unless they do that
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:18.880]   and they have it.
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.440]   And it's been two years and they have it.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.760]   But they did do it.
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:24.960]   Apple's response is, you have crack cocaine in your hand
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:25.960]   at all time.
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:27.920]   This is the little speaker that you carry around
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:28.600]   that you could talk to.
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.320]   Your phone is the $30.
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:34.000]   It's not the car, the closet.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.640]   If you're in a pool, you got it right here with you.
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.680]   Do any of you listen to music on your iPhone speakers?
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.080]   No.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:41.760]   I do.
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:42.280]   What?
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:43.040]   I do.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:43.560]   I do.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:44.040]   I do.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:44.880]   It's with me.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.240]   I don't have to worry about the kids changing the state,
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.160]   like whatever playlist I have.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.680]   So you just grit your teeth and say,
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.840]   I know this sounds like an AM radio, but it's OK.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.680]   You know what?
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:56.120]   I don't even care.
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.000]   I don't even care.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.480]   I'm not really an audio file.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.760]   I don't really even care.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.920]   I just want to get into the zone.
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:05.080]   I have my own jam, and I don't have to worry.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.320]   But Andrew, you are so right.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:08.560]   I'm going to ask more often to people,
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:09.880]   does Siri bring you joy?
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.400]   We're going to marry Condo this.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.120]   It's not spark joy.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:13.800]   Does not.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.840]   Does not often anger many times frustration.
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.520]   Sometimes you're just shaking your head.
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:23.400]   But yeah, I do play music on my phone all the time.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.360]   Even in my heart.
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.760]   By the way, Andy, I just want to mention that at least two
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.160]   people in chat room said you just
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.960]   turned their floor into lava.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.840]   But did you-- I just hope they found a nice place to stand on
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.640]   so they didn't get burnt by the time it ended up?
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.120]   That's pretty funny.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:39.640]   Yeah.
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:42.200]   No, I even like the fact that I'll do, like,
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.200]   in the morning or when I'm going to bed, I'll have like,
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.280]   oh, remind me of this and wake me up at this time
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.040]   and then whatever.
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:51.720]   And then at the end, just to turn off the microphone,
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.000]   I will say thank you.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.640]   And I'll say happy to help.
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:55.800]   I'm like, it's nice.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:56.720]   That's nice.
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:57.960]   I can thank it.
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:01.520]   Also, I'm worried that people spend so much time talking
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.720]   to speakers, like little kids, that they forget that you're
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.000]   supposed to say please and thank you.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.280]   So I'm glad that these devices now reward us for good behavior.
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.600]   It's a fun line in each other.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.040]   Because you want it to be funny.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:11.880]   You want it to be cute.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.040]   You want it to be entertaining.
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:15.480]   You want it to ask you from time to time how you're feeling.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:18.520]   But you don't want it to do that too often.
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.600]   Because then it's just you want to throw it through the window.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:23.720]   So it's got to be hard to design these things.
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.840]   Maybe we don't know the best way to do it.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:29.040]   But it is as often the case around this time.
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:34.240]   Apple is also heading into some controversy with the Hey
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:36.360]   email app.
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.680]   Andy, you were with me on Macbreak Weekly
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:42.560]   when Alex Lindsey launched into a spirited defense
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:45.920]   of Apple's right to take 30% of anything on its platform.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.440]   They built the platform.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.720]   They put a lot of R&D into it.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.520]   And gosh darn it, if you want to be on it,
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.720]   it's fair for Apple to charge you 30%
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.360]   to be in the store.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:00.720]   Hey is an email program that Apple has refused
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.880]   because they don't have an in-app subscription.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:07.840]   It's $100 a year, $100 a year email service.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:11.720]   But they didn't put it and they were refusing to put it
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:12.280]   in the app.
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.760]   The reason it's important is it comes from Basecamp,
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.480]   Jason Frieden, David Hanamier-Hanson, who
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.720]   are very well known, highly respected.
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.640]   And I think there's a certain amount of excitement.
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:24.400]   I signed up immediately after reading about Hey.com.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.600]   Because it's an interesting take on email.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.880]   But Phil Schiller says, nope, we're
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:34.160]   not going to change the rules until Hey offers in-app purchases
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.880]   of their service.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.520]   It ain't going to happen.
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:41.280]   Is Apple right or wrong on this?
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:47.680]   Now, Andy, you and I got to tussle and Renee
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:50.120]   got to tussle a little bit with Alex.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.360]   Or actually Renee wasn't there.
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.040]   Laurie Gil got a little tussle with Alex.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.280]   But Axel's really adamant.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.880]   What do you think, Georgia?
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:00.880]   Should Apple relent and let Hey be in the app store
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.520]   without in-app purchases?
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.720]   I think they should.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.720]   I think they should actually overhaul the entire system.
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:09.480]   I think that there's so many developers that aren't making
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.440]   anything you already have to pay for the developer kit.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:15.520]   I think that it should be a percentage of how much you make.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.240]   So if you're a new struggling developer,
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:20.080]   it should be a very small amount of percentages they make.
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:21.520]   I think that if you're a bigger developer,
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.240]   you could make a larger percentage.
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.680]   It's not going to hurt Apple.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:27.200]   And I think they should be a little bit more open about not
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.720]   trying to squeeze every single person for as much as they can get.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.120]   Because it's not like Apple's struggling.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:35.160]   So I think that a lot of the people
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:38.440]   are recognizing these large trillion dollar billion dollar
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:41.160]   companies are kind of swallowing up all the things that
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:41.840]   are good in the world.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.360]   And there's a lot of backlash because of that.
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.440]   And I think it would cause Stapple very little
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:46.560]   for a lot of goodwill.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:50.920]   30%.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.080]   It seems like a lot, especially-- and now you
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.280]   can buy the service online.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:56.920]   And that's what base camp wants you to do,
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:00.760]   is pay for it online and then download an app.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:03.720]   Their contention is it's kind of like the Kindle app.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.840]   It's just an email reader.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.800]   It lets you read your email.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.160]   But the service is separate.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:13.600]   Apple says, no, that's not a reader app.
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.560]   And so you have to do it differently.
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:17.640]   Owen, you have an opinion on this?
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.320]   I think you do.
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:19.820]   I do.
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:22.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:24.920]   I'm anti-Apple in most ways other than my phone
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:28.240]   and my watch and my iPad and my menus.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.080]   Me too.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:29.960]   I'm wiggy there.
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.920]   I hate Apple except for my iMac Pro and my MacBook Pro
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.520]   and my MacBook Air and my--
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.120]   I hate it.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:36.120]   And then Apple watch.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:36.760]   I hate it.
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:39.920]   The thing that drives me crazy is,
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.800]   do you want to play in the NBA or do you
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.560]   want to play in the circus league?
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.480]   Do you want to play in the NFL or do you want to play in the XFL?
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.940]   Because when somebody has a major league
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:52.540]   and they make the rules, either you play by the rules
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:53.700]   or you don't.
[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.180]   Here's the thing.
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.420]   Apple is Apple, which gives everyone
[00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:59.740]   the benefit of having the possibility of having
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:02.180]   that one hit Wonder app and make a bajillion dollars.
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.780]   Yes, a lot of people are struggling,
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:06.920]   but they've also made a mint for a lot of companies
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:09.540]   that would have never have made a dime anywhere else.
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:10.820]   You got Android this free?
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:12.580]   Why aren't you out there making a mint on Android?
[00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:14.020]   Because you can't.
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:17.800]   So the payment structure to Apple is facilitated,
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.360]   the brand facilitation that they have,
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.300]   the quality control that they have.
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.520]   If you don't want to pay, then you don't want to play.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.760]   I really don't have a problem with it.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.580]   Now, if you want to say 30% is too high,
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:30.560]   you're saying, sure, let's cut it down to 20%.
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.520]   And in 10 years, we'll be crying about 20%.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.680]   Then you'll be down to 10%.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:35.080]   And then Apple won't have any money.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:37.080]   And then I won't have to pay 1,000 and something dollars
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:37.720]   for this phone.
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:41.080]   So Apple makes the rules because it's their company
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:42.520]   and that's the way it goes.
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:44.140]   Either you pay the player or you don't.
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:46.100]   I don't care about companies crying about it.
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.020]   I don't care about people trying to get around it.
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.260]   Go ahead and make your application so great
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:53.220]   that it makes me switch from an iPhone to a Samsung.
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.100]   And then I'll come and get your email.
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:56.820]   Hey, how you doing about that?
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:57.620]   I don't know.
[00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:58.660]   That's just my thought.
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:02.260]   - Yeah, and Apple, the other complaint people make
[00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:05.180]   is not necessarily that they want the 30%,
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:07.460]   but that they're just not consistent
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.620]   in the application of these rules.
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:13.880]   That some email programs that don't do this
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.820]   are on the app store.
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:18.460]   Apple's in this letter to a base camp said,
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:21.220]   "Look, your app doesn't do anything.
[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:26.120]   It doesn't read email unless you pay $100 on hay.com
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:27.720]   to get it.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:30.520]   And we don't want an app on our phone that doesn't do anything
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:33.620]   unless you pay outside to turn it on.
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:36.260]   And if you're going to do that, you have to have it in the app.
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:38.260]   And that's a reasonable thing from an end.
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:39.320]   Their position is, look,
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:41.020]   end users are going to download that app and say,
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:42.520]   "Well, now what?"
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:45.280]   And there's no way they can do anything in the app.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:50.120]   So I don't disagree that that's a problem.
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:53.320]   And I also think that base camp is very happy
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:56.520]   to have this controversy going on because hell of a lot more
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:58.920]   people know about hay.com than before.
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:42:59.760]   - You know what they'll do though?
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:03.400]   They'll bump it up to 115 and then put it in the app store
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.520]   and then the margin-- - It could.
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:06.880]   - To charge us.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.560]   But they're just going to get free advertisement
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:09.560]   right here talking about it.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:14.240]   - That by the way is the basis for a class action lawsuit
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.800]   the Supreme Court allowed to go forward last year
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.640]   against the app store saying,
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.800]   "You're at effect charging end users this
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:23.280]   because the companies just passed the 30% along
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:24.760]   in their price."
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:28.120]   And so that's a case that is ongoing.
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.440]   So we'll keep an eye on that.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.440]   - For me, it's a question of,
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:35.560]   Apple is running the risk of turning into Ticketmaster
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:40.520]   where for the most part, the idea that they're establishing
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.880]   this app store and all these APIs in Xcode
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:47.440]   to allow you to create a word processor or a game
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:48.880]   and then sell it to the store.
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:50.520]   They will handle all the distribution.
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:53.520]   They will handle all the taking of the money
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:54.520]   and that sort of thing.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:55.960]   And that's when you start to say,
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:57.640]   okay, well, here's all the things they're doing
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:00.640]   for this thing which is a piece of software.
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.520]   But then when you get into situations like,
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:06.120]   why are they insisting that,
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.840]   why can't I simply buy books through the Kindle app?
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:12.400]   Why can't I buy comic books through the Comicsology app?
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:14.280]   And you start to ask yourself,
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.160]   "Well, what the hell are they doing
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:20.880]   that would entitle them to 30% of my Superman comic?"
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:22.600]   That's the sort of thing that they want to avoid.
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:26.640]   'Cause I do see the need for developers
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:27.800]   to pay something into this.
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:30.120]   This Apple can't simply run this as a charity.
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:32.720]   This is something that they are delivering value
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.520]   providing a service and they deserve to be paid
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:35.360]   for that service.
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.640]   But there are certainly exemptions to this
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:39.960]   where again, you say,
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:44.960]   why is the $75 ticket costing me $156?
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:49.120]   What is Ticketmaster doing to justify a $75
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:51.480]   like add on to this purchase price?
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.480]   When the answer is no,
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.280]   I'm not upset with the venue promoter,
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:55.280]   I'm upset with the band,
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:58.040]   I'm upset with Ticketmaster.
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:00.560]   And the second problem is always,
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.160]   something that's been very consistent,
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:06.600]   which is the inconsistency with which Apple seems to promote.
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:08.920]   It's a rules for the app store.
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:10.520]   Apple said that,
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:13.920]   "Well, the only reason why your iOS app got accepted
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.600]   to begin with was because of a mistake.
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:17.320]   We shouldn't have let it in to begin with."
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:20.440]   And there are so many times I've talked to developers
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:22.800]   where they've had problems exactly like this,
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:27.600]   where an app on a totally non-controversial sort of issue
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.080]   that they've been submitting
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:32.480]   and updating this app for three or four years.
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.360]   And now suddenly they produce an update
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.360]   and it gets rejected because they're saying,
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:37.600]   "Oh, well, three years ago,
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:40.680]   you should have switched from using this API for time
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:43.000]   or for text or for whatever to this new API.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.520]   And for that reason, we're rejecting it."
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:45.360]   And then they'll say,
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.560]   "Well, we talked to you three years ago
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.640]   and told you that there's no way we can make our app work
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:52.000]   with this change that you're suggesting."
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.400]   And their response is, "Well, nonetheless."
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:57.800]   So it's a problem for people who think that Apple
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.520]   is cheating amount of a lot of money,
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:01.960]   but it's also indicative of how powerless
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:04.280]   a lot of developers feel when they're trying to deal
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:08.040]   with this black box whose judgments
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.760]   are not to be tampered with or questioned.
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.000]   - I think that's the real complaint
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:12.840]   of the market development. - Which is the problem, right?
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.680]   - Is the power differential is that if your app gets thrown out,
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:17.440]   there's nothing that you can do
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.840]   if Apple says no for whatever reason they choose to.
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:21.200]   You can't really do anything, right?
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:22.440]   If you're a really large company,
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:23.840]   you probably have big lawyers and odds are,
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.440]   you can kind of put some pressure on it.
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:27.040]   Or if you're really famous, right?
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.800]   If you're Taylor Swift, you can put pressure on Apple
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.280]   and something could actually happen.
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:32.280]   But for most developers, they have nothing.
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:33.200]   There's no recourse.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.320]   They don't have the money from it
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:35.960]   'cause they're not making any money.
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:40.320]   And they're already having to pay Apple to be a developer.
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.000]   But if, and I'll just say it, it might be controversial,
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.360]   but if like all developers kind of created a union
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:47.120]   where they were unionized and they had a union
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:49.080]   that could fight for them versus Apple,
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:51.560]   then they would have at least a recourse
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.360]   if something that they think is unfair
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:56.480]   or possibly is unfair happens to them.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:01.280]   Can I just say something on a regular world point?
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.760]   So if I have a business and I go into a strip mall
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:06.000]   and I buy a rent a storefront
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.440]   and my business is booming and I'm paying rent.
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:10.760]   And my landlord says, oh, your lease is up.
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.400]   I'm gonna raise the rent XYZ
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:14.880]   'cause you're making this much money and I want it.
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.840]   Well, do I close up my store and move away
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:19.680]   or sell it out on the street across the street?
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:22.400]   Like I have to pay this rent and somebody could--
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.440]   But you could, you could actually move.
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:29.440]   And you could move to Android.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:33.040]   There's another platform out there that's for you that's free.
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:34.480]   I'm just saying, this is the,
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.520]   and this is how things work in the world.
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.920]   You're paying rent somewhere
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:40.440]   because you wanna sell your stuff at this storefront.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.800]   And at some point things change in the lease
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.160]   and they say, look, you have to do this or do that
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:46.000]   or you have to move out.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.520]   We're gonna cut your square footage.
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:49.840]   There's all kinds of things that happen in the regular world.
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.560]   This is average business stuff.
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:54.000]   And we have a personal affinity to it
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.720]   because we want our apps or we feel like these companies
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:58.400]   are being trampled upon.
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.040]   But this is just business.
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:01.920]   And I hate sticking out for app like this.
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:02.880]   It's driving me crazy.
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:03.720]   Isn't there a risk though?
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:05.280]   But if business is in a monopoly, right?
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:06.560]   Like they have in a monopoly.
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:07.680]   Well, and this was Alex's--
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:08.520]   It's different.
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:09.360]   There's two malls, right?
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:10.200]   Like two malls back.
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.040]   This was Alex's point.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.760]   Is it isn't a monopoly that in no country
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:17.160]   does Apple have more than say 50% market share?
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:18.440]   I don't know, what is the market share in the US?
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:20.480]   Maybe in the US they have 80%.
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.440]   But it's not monopoly size.
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:24.400]   And you do have a choice in that respect.
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.000]   There's also a risk to Apple.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.440]   And Daniel Jalkut, who is a great developer, Red Sweater
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:31.360]   software posted this on his microblog,
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:34.200]   something I haven't emphasized is Apple's approach
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:37.960]   to hate.com and others who are actively dissuaded
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:39.640]   from distributing apps to customers.
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:42.640]   Basically, Apple's saying, yeah, no, you can't distribute this.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.880]   Is it creates a threat to Apple's platforms?
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:47.280]   Is it a point in which both developers and consumers
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.080]   will turn away?
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:53.760]   Is that a risk that Apple has to be a little more generous
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.440]   because they could lose developers.
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:58.000]   They could lose users on this?
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.760]   Somebody just suggested a union.
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:01.000]   And that's super scary.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   Go ahead and put that on blast on a loop clip.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.200]   Put it on Facebook and block it.
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.200]   Don't worry.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.240]   That's an excuse on it.
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:07.960]   Because that's scary.
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:08.960]   No one likes that word.
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:10.400]   What does that mean?
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:13.280]   Meg, look, I'm about to start that Apple App.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.200]   Right now, I want my--
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:15.200]   Wouldn't that be interesting?
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.280]   A developer's union?
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:17.080]   2%.
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:18.560]   I think it should happen, right?
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:20.480]   Every single corporation hates two words--
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.560]   union and regulation.
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:23.080]   That's right.
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:24.680]   So that's one of the two.
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:28.160]   So that would be a threat to Apple if developers.
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:29.320]   But see, I don't see that happening.
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:31.640]   Developers make too much money.
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:33.200]   Very famously, Tim Sweeney--
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:34.600]   Oh, but it would be an app.
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:37.080]   The union itself would be an app that then that app would
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:40.480]   make money from other app developers then bring back money.
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:41.000]   I don't know.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.440]   I see someone being able to do it.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:42.960]   They do.
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:44.160]   I said, I'm trying to run this game.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.040]   Give up getting that in the App Store.
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:47.480]   I'm about to beat Tim Cook.
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:48.080]   We got to have to--
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:48.080]   We got to have to.
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:48.600]   We got to have to.
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:49.600]   We got to have to.
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:50.120]   Woo!
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:50.880]   Tim Sweeney, who's--
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:51.400]   I want to piece.
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:51.400]   I want to piece.
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:54.360]   The founder of Epic Games and has made billions of dollars.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:58.360]   I think he made $7 billion in year one of Fortnite.
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:01.080]   Puts Fortnite on the App Store.
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:02.640]   Well, mainly because there's no choice.
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:06.080]   And he gives app that 30% of his billions of dollars
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.280]   because he has to.
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:09.400]   But notice, he's not putting it there.
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:12.720]   He tried for a while not to put it on the Android Play Store,
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:15.280]   but just offer it as a sideload, which Android allows you
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:15.840]   to do.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:17.080]   But that became such a problem.
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.120]   He's even a given in.
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:20.400]   And he's put it in the Android Play Store.
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:24.160]   You need those platforms if you want to succeed on either
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:25.600]   Android or iOS these days.
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:29.400]   You have to be in the store on the one hand in Apple
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:30.840]   because you have-- just because you have to.
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:32.000]   There's no other way.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   But even on Android, where you have a choice,
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.120]   there's no way to make money.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:36.480]   So it's interesting.
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:38.720]   There's a good test.
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:40.440]   If Sweeney's not willing to walk away
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:42.800]   from what must be billions of dollars
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:45.840]   that Apple's taking out of his pocket with their 30%,
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:47.960]   then I can't imagine many others doing it.
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:48.360]   It's just--
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:50.360]   Because he's still making money.
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:50.640]   Right.
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.440]   That's the--
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:54.000]   And it's not a third to him.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.680]   A business is the cost of doing business.
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:58.160]   The cost of doing business.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:50:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:50:59.180]   OK.
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:01.280]   Leo, don't you have to pay lights and employees?
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:02.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:03.200]   I mean, this--
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.480]   I can't go to the power company.
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:05.960]   He said, we're going to have a year.
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:09.760]   We're going to have all the businesses in Petaluma
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:12.280]   have decided not to pay power bills anymore.
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:12.780]   Yeah.
[00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:14.080]   Good luck with that.
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:15.080]   I paid $2,000.
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:17.880]   So a lot of workers unionize, right?
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:18.400]   That's different.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:20.280]   So please have the union, nurses have the union,
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:22.800]   and that's how they deal with government funding
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:24.400]   and what they deal with that, right?
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:25.720]   No, and it works.
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:26.760]   Apple it would work.
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:27.680]   I'm in the union.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:29.200]   They're not in the government.
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.720]   I'm in the Screen Actors Guild, the American Federation
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:33.880]   of Television and Radio Artists.
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.600]   I'm the Screen Actors Guild, too, my friend.
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:37.320]   We're SAG-AFTER brothers.
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:37.800]   You're not--
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:39.320]   Give it to me, brother.
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:39.820]   Mm.
[00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:40.320]   Yeah.
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:41.120]   Actually, what are you drinking?
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.960]   Hard lemonade, what is that?
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:45.440]   I'm drinking--
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:47.320]   is it Italian, maybe?
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:50.480]   Spangardelagranger.
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:52.240]   San Pellegrino.
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.920]   Oh, limonata.
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:55.080]   That's really good.
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.000]   That's the best.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:56.760]   That's good stuff.
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:59.080]   I didn't want to butcher it like you did.
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:01.880]   San Pellegrino.
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:02.800]   That's good stuff.
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.960]   I wish I had-- now I want some San Pellegrino.
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:05.600]   That's right.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:06.440]   Treat yourself.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.080]   Treat yourself.
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:10.040]   Um, let's see.
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:10.560]   What else?
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.400]   Well, I don't think Apple will say anything about that
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:14.080]   on the stage tomorrow.
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:14.920]   Probably not.
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:16.680]   They probably will say, though, something
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:18.520]   that they put out in a press release.
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:21.760]   A new study says the App Store facilitated--
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:28.920]   this is in 2019-- $519 billion in commerce.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:32.080]   That's why nobody's taking a boycott on the Apple Store.
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:34.600]   That's a big number.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:36.520]   More than half a trillion.
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:39.600]   I think they got me for my average spend
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:42.480]   in a year is $300.
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:42.960]   Yeah.
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:43.400]   For--
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:44.680]   I wonder what the average is.
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:45.640]   They haven't published that.
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:46.840]   That would be interesting.
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:47.400]   No, it was--
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:48.320]   I really would--
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:50.640]   Somebody hit me with a thing or a yearly subscription.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:53.280]   And I was super mad because I'm like, what did I just spend $50 on?
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:54.440]   I'm like, oh, yeah, I still use that.
[00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:54.760]   It's cool.
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:55.440]   It's cool.
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:55.880]   I forgot.
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:57.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:52:59.640]   So now when I looked at how much money I'd be spending,
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:01.600]   just to check because I had to cut some fat.
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:02.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.280]   I can't cut my own fat, but I'm not--
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:07.120]   Heaven for Fend.
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:09.200]   I really wish that they'd break down those numbers.
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:11.400]   Like on what category of apps?
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:11.760]   Right.
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:15.840]   Also by a number of employees at the company
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:18.240]   publishing this particular piece of software.
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:22.520]   Because if they did that, it turns out that, OK, but we handed out
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:25.960]   all but $30 of that to game developers.
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:28.680]   And that was almost all with in-app game purchases.
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.120]   Because if they really want-- if they
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:34.720]   want to claim to be a job making juggernaut,
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:38.040]   I think that they're opening themselves up to questions of, OK,
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:40.840]   how many jobs are you actually creating?
[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:44.240]   Or are you essentially creating a more effective siphon of dollars
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:47.000]   from children's parents' pockets?
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.400]   Apple Arcade is a nice thing, but still anybody who's
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:53.560]   tried to make it to anyone who's played like a phone-based Marvel
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:56.440]   game and tried to get anywhere without buying special crystals
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:54:00.880]   or new fractals or whatever might want to say, yeah, please don't
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:03.240]   break about my lack of will.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:04.360]   That's all the games, though.
[00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:06.280]   Like I play 2K.
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:09.680]   I play-- I don't play Fortnite, but my friends kids play Fortnite.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:10.840]   Call of Duty.
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:12.240]   You need $20,000 coins.
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:13.800]   That's what-- OK, that's $15.
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:14.760]   You need a new gun.
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:16.440]   OK, that's $100.
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:19.320]   That's all my PlayStation and Xbox MPC.
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:22.280]   So the whole world is in that loop.
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:25.880]   Now, mind you that they're not getting that 30% tax,
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:28.560]   but at the same time, it's mobile.
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:31.640]   That's how-- I mean, like I said, they got a piece--
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:33.000]   I'm still--
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.560]   I'm not saying that pay-to-play is original,
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:36.600]   but I am saying that if they really
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:40.000]   want to boast about how much-- how many jobs they're making
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.320]   and how many dollars are putting the hands of developers,
[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:45.400]   they really should break that out and say, here's how many people
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:46.960]   who are able to pay their phone bill,
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:49.520]   here's how many people who are able to even afford
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:51.960]   to keep developing this app versus here's
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:55.400]   all the people that are simply able to keep their jobs
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:57.320]   in an existing gaming company.
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:01.560]   Because it's not-- the profits aren't coming solely
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:04.400]   from individual apps being made, but by in-game content.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:05.440]   It's being sold.
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:06.960]   I think that's a valid question.
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:07.960]   Yeah, it's probably--
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:10.080]   Because you know it's going to be--
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:11.720]   when you do the math, it's going to end up
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:13.680]   being that so many more are barely
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:17.680]   having to have three other extra jobs,
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:20.640]   be able to continue to develop their application,
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:22.920]   because it's not making enough money.
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:25.680]   Most people don't make much money on the app store.
[00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:26.800]   You should also mention--
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:27.280]   It's just too big.
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:33.160]   That on Friday, the EU announced two investigations
[00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:34.400]   into Apple.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.000]   Now, it's the EU.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.760]   I don't want to be too dismissive,
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:40.160]   but they are a little bit more aggressive in consumer
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:43.520]   protection actions.
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:45.920]   One of the things they're worried about
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.520]   is the commission.
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:50.040]   The first investigation prompted by complaints
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:54.360]   from Spotify and Rakuten will determine whether Apple has
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:57.040]   used its digital marketplaces to stifle competition
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:59.560]   from rivals in the digital services space.
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:02.880]   Spotify, for instance, says, we can't possibly compete
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:03.840]   against Apple music.
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:06.360]   It's installed on all the phones.
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:09.400]   Apple has an incredible advantage.
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:13.600]   And the maker, by the way, speaking of Apple tags,
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:18.280]   the maker of the tile tag has also testified to Congress,
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:21.440]   we can't compete against a built-in Apple app.
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:23.960]   And she's worried-- she says, we can't compete against lost
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:27.640]   my or find my, but that's not even mentioning tags,
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:30.240]   which I think that that's her greatest fear, of course.
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:35.120]   And then so that's one issue is the anti-competitive nature
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:35.800]   of it.
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:37.480]   They're worried that it would distort the market,
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:39.400]   giving Apple's own products an unfair advantage
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:41.280]   over the competition.
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:46.480]   And then I think the other is Apple Pay,
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:49.960]   because Apple Pay is the only mobile payments tool that
[00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:53.480]   can use the NFC built into the iPhone.
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:57.720]   And the EU says, well, you should let other companies use
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:00.520]   that NFC chip for their payment services.
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:02.680]   I think in both cases, Apple can make a strong case.
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:03.800]   It's better for the consumer.
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:05.280]   What we do make sense of the consumer,
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:07.400]   and that's why we do it.
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:08.400]   Yeah.
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:09.920]   Also, they can also-- they can always
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:12.240]   hide behind the fact that, hey, look, we're not Android.
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:13.920]   We're not Windows.
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:15.560]   We're not Facebook, and we're not Twitter.
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:16.440]   We're not Google.
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:20.040]   We don't have a dominant market share worldwide in anything.
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:24.040]   So it depends on whether the jurisdiction they're
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:28.040]   going through looks at anti-competitive practices as something
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:31.520]   that affects consumers or something that affects markets.
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:33.720]   Because they could make-- they could certainly
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:36.400]   have a problem defending themselves against the idea that,
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:38.600]   hey, look, you're allowing yourself--
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:40.320]   you're allowing your own products to have access
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:43.480]   to a special, blessed sandbox access
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:46.440]   to certain really, really important features of your hardware,
[00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:48.560]   but you're not letting us, your competitors, have it.
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:49.520]   That would be a problem.
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:51.120]   But then if they have to say, well,
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:54.440]   show me how users are actually paying the price for this.
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:56.960]   How does this drive up the prices of your product?
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:00.320]   And how does that mean that it's going to be a harder thing
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:01.120]   for them to do?
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:02.880]   I think in principle--
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:04.240]   I don't know.
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:07.680]   It depends on how much caffeine, sugar, or sleep
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:10.000]   I've had, the kamokka on the end of the day,
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   whether I'm angry at Apple or I'm angry at their accusers.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   Because the thing is, Apple could not
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.720]   have created something as cool as the Apple ecosystem.
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:20.920]   If they had not simply said--
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:23.920]   if not for them exploiting the advantage that they have,
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:25.760]   that look, we create the hardware.
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:27.400]   We create the operating system.
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:29.280]   We create the software people are using.
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:31.120]   We create the services that they're using.
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:32.600]   We also have created--
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:35.480]   apply that towards the desktop that you're using,
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:37.520]   the phone you're using, and the tablet you're using.
[00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:42.360]   That allows us to create solutions that work so well to say
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:46.280]   nothing of also controlling the API and what software can
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:48.640]   be installed on your machine and not.
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:50.240]   That we are creating--
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:52.720]   you can't deny that there is an advantage
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:57.080]   to using our ecosystem than a mishmash of other ecosystems.
[00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:59.600]   On the other hand, then, again, if I've had more sleep,
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:02.880]   or less sugar, or whatever, then I'm like, well, damn it.
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:04.000]   I mean, this is my phone.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.400]   If I want to install a new bootloader,
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:07.320]   I should be able to do that.
[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:10.320]   And if this company can't create a really good tracker
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:13.800]   because you're not letting them have access to NFC,
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:15.560]   and you're just giving this bogus--
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:18.080]   and you're simply creating a dogmatic excuse
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:21.000]   to saying, we are now going to lock down all Mac apps
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.320]   so that you can't install any Mac apps that
[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:25.240]   haven't been approved by the App Store.
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:26.080]   Well, screw you.
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:27.800]   You're creating a horrible situation
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:29.320]   where this is not my computer.
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:30.520]   So again, it really depends.
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:33.720]   It really depends on those three things.
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:34.760]   I agree.
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:36.080]   I could go either way.
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:36.600]   Other words.
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:37.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:38.280]   I could go either way.
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:38.760]   I agree.
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:40.320]   It's hard to know.
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:41.200]   Because we-- you know what?
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:44.760]   There's a definite benefit to Apple's approach.
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:48.960]   And of course, it both benefits Apple and consumers for Apple
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:50.440]   to say we're a gated community.
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:54.760]   And you can only enter if we allow you to enter.
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:56.400]   That's a good thing for Apple's business,
[00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:57.960]   but it's also a good thing for consumers.
[00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:00.760]   So it's a difficult one.
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:05.360]   If Apple were a monopoly, it would not be a problem.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:07.160]   Then we would know that this is an issue
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.040]   and we've got to fix it.
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:09.960]   But Apple is no-- as you said, Georgia,
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.200]   nowhere near a monopoly.
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.200]   So there is a choice.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:16.440]   But arguably, when the reason why Google was able to become
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.480]   Google was because the government said, hey, look,
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:22.480]   you told Microsoft you have the number one desktop platform
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:23.840]   in the entire world.
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:26.640]   And now you're about to-- because you're bundling your own web
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.320]   browser in with every single installation of Windows,
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:32.560]   you are not allowing other web browsers to possibly live,
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.160]   drive, and survive.
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.000]   So you've got to break that stuff up
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.520]   or give us an agreement before we force you to break up.
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:39.640]   So yeah.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:42.840]   I have to say that every WWDC, my biggest fear--
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.040]   and with every new edition of Mac OS,
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.400]   my biggest fear is that the sandbox is going to get
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:50.440]   on the tighter and tighter until we do.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.520]   And honestly, the moment that Apple says
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:55.040]   that you can no longer install any piece of software that
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.760]   does not come through the App Store on a Mac,
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:59.680]   that's going to be--
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:01.760]   it won't be the reason why I switched to Windows.
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:05.000]   But it will be the final 10 points we need.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.840]   And you don't never switch to Windows.
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.040]   Don't do that to yourself.
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:08.920]   You need to switch to Windows.
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.640]   And I'll tell you about my thread, River.
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:13.960]   I tell you about my Linux baby.
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:16.040]   You can run Linux on Threadripper 2.
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.440]   And they've got IGP lights all over the inside.
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.560]   So it's like frickin' Gluck stegas.
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:23.000]   I'm like, oh.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.120]   I know the sex appeal of opening up brand new Apple product.
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:28.600]   I know it is always good.
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:32.120]   You can understand the full thrill of a man.
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.560]   It's like getting a grill.
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:35.480]   Put this thing together myself.
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:36.400]   It's just like getting a--
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.040]   I just put two steaks on this piece.
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:39.640]   I got brisket on this sofa.
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:42.160]   And then pop it in this piece of flour.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.200]   You got to feel this power.
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.840]   Actually, I know I feel--
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:46.640]   because guess what?
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.400]   I got a grill this week.
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:51.920]   I got my Father's Day 4th of July grill.
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.280]   I got a nice Traeger smoker.
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.080]   Yet you're not using it.
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:56.320]   Oh, I ordered a smoker.
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:57.880]   You have fast food coming home.
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.960]   I know, but that's because his father's there.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:01.720]   Oh, it's--
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:02.840]   I ordered my local father's day, too.
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:03.680]   I got a smoker coming.
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:04.240]   It's so exciting.
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.240]   Yeah, I'm so excited.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.040]   Lori Gill told me to get this one.
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:09.360]   It uses pellets.
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:10.680]   I got a Uncle Leo.
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:11.600]   We could pellet brothers.
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.200]   Let's be pellet brothers.
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.120]   I got a pellet.
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:14.760]   You got to share.
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:16.800]   You have to share now smoker secrets.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:17.880]   I got--
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:20.200]   I got the wind with 24 Wi-Fi.
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:20.520]   So my--
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:21.680]   Yes, me too.
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:23.880]   I got the Wi-- they call it Wi-Fi.
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:25.440]   You probably have the same one.
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:27.440]   And I have a sidekick burner on it,
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:30.160]   which comes with a griddle top, a grill top.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:30.680]   Oh.
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.480]   It's an oven top because you know I'm a baller.
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.120]   Now I am a little jealous.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:34.880]   I confess.
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.800]   You should return yours and get mine.
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:39.880]   You have-- but mine has a little chimney.
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.440]   Mine's got a little chimney on the side.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:43.440]   Look at that, that little chimney.
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.360]   You have a side griller.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.160]   You have a little griddle?
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:47.560]   Hold on.
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:48.480]   I'm about to--
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:49.160]   Oh, man.
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.560]   I'm jealous now.
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:53.200]   I was coming on Wednesday, but I got a picture of my baby.
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.560]   I mean, I look at every night where I go to sleep.
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.000]   I check to track him.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:57.640]   I'm over here just--
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:58.480]   Do you want me?
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:00.920]   Well, while you're looking that up,
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:03.480]   I don't have a grill, but I have a house that's
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:06.280]   one mile from the place where folks come in with fresh plants.
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:07.760]   Ooh.
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.280]   Yours looks fancy.
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.240]   There you go.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.040]   Again, and the talking's off griddle.
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:15.120]   You could put a grill top on it and a pizza oven top.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.080]   So you could cook pizza.
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:17.680]   I would be cooking with that.
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:19.640]   I've been shown up.
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:20.880]   That looks really beautiful.
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:21.400]   My hand.
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:22.480]   I have a little chimney.
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:25.960]   Mine has a six inch digital screen on it too, Uncle Leo.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.160]   Oh, man.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:27.840]   Did George--
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:32.360]   Do you have anything for a man whose manhood has shriveled?
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:33.880]   Do you have anything you could--
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:35.040]   We can talk afterwards.
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.040]   We can talk afterwards.
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:39.480]   Again, you're going to be having some delicious smoked
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.840]   whatever any point be.
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.320]   And you're going to love it.
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:43.320]   But I don't have a pizza top.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:44.320]   It won't matter that it's not as pretty.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.760]   I don't have a six inch screen.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.400]   You have a cute little chimney.
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:49.200]   A little chimney.
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.560]   That's all I got.
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.920]   All right, I have.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.240]   I figure I would do with your life, Uncle Leo.
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:54.960]   I'm going to--
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:55.400]   I got a gym.
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:55.600]   I got a--
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:55.600]   I got a--
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.560]   I got a run of bias.
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:57.520]   And I mean, you got to run stuff.
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:58.640]   By the way, I took a picture of this
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:01.520]   because this is the last time I'll ever look that clean.
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:03.440]   You know, it's always good to take a picture of the grill
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:04.440]   before you use it.
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.320]   It already didn't look nothing like that.
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:08.000]   It has not been fired at anger yet.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:08.560]   That's sad.
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:09.440]   There's no anger.
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:11.240]   That's a sad looking grill.
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:17.800]   I got a half inch thick sheet of plate steel in my oven.
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:18.560]   That's how I--
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:19.600]   If there is enough--
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:19.960]   If there is enough--
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.480]   What do you do with that?
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:23.520]   Oh, it's for pizza.
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.440]   And oh, my God, does it do a great job on pizza.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:26.080]   But any--
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:27.080]   You have a pizza stone.
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:28.080]   You have a pizza stone.
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:29.080]   You have a stone, too.
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.520]   I never heard of steel for that.
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:32.520]   Yeah.
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:36.000]   It takes the entire--
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.640]   It's the exact same width as like one of the wire racks
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:39.360]   in the stove.
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:41.000]   So it takes the place of one of the racks.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.440]   So whenever I want like really good breads,
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:44.160]   I cook it on that.
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.240]   And it's amazing.
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:49.480]   But also when I'm cooking like cakes and pastries,
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:50.880]   it balances out the--
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:54.560]   It acts as a capacitor for heat and balances everything out.
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:58.160]   And also, if ever I wanted to run into sort of a die hard
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:00.960]   situation inside the house, that thing will repel bullets.
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:02.760]   I'm not sure if the pizza oven on your grill
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:03.880]   is going to repel bullets.
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:04.840]   This thing will definitely repel bullets.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:06.480]   I think just picking up the pizza stone
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:07.880]   would be too heavy for me to--
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:09.400]   I wouldn't be able to move from then.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:09.840]   So--
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:12.240]   We just bought a new pizza stone and already it's--
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:14.000]   It's literally 12 pounds.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.080]   So I mean, I could have a little bit of an--
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.280]   You have a pizza stone attachment for your grill?
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:18.880]   That's what's it.
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.840]   Side grill has a pizza stone attachment,
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:24.560]   a griddle attachment, and a grill attachment
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:27.280]   with a closing lid so I can sear my steaks on it,
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:29.280]   or I can make a pizza while I'm smoking.
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:30.240]   Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:32.240]   I want to be fat boy in all day.
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:34.440]   I'm going to make pancakes and bacon,
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:37.400]   why the steaks are over there sizzling for eight hours?
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.760]   They had a ribs on the top rack,
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.720]   and then I'm going to come back later on, and then--
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:41.920]   Oh, man, it's going to be great.
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:42.840]   Make a pizza for me.
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:44.080]   It does sound great.
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:45.760]   Now I'm hungry, though.
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:46.480]   You should be.
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:49.400]   There's somebody in the chat room that says the sear box
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:51.120]   really is the difference maker.
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:51.960]   It is.
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:53.680]   Because I'm a girl making Uncle Leo.
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:55.560]   Can't stop me in these streets.
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:58.760]   Bought it for myself, because I deserve it.
[01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:00.360]   I mean, you might deserve it.
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.000]   But I know I deserve it.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.320]   You've ruined my father's day.
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:04.520]   I hope you're happy.
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.480]   Think in the chat room, people ask.
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:07.760]   No, I want to be real, too.
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:09.280]   No, I want to spread ripper, too.
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:10.280]   I'm really good.
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:11.240]   That's right.
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:13.720]   I'm telling you, you just spread ripper.
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:14.480]   You need some oil.
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:18.880]   You are well-equipped, Mr. Owen JJ Stone, I must say.
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:19.720]   That's what she said.
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:21.360]   I mean, I'm not--
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.200]   Oh, stop it.
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:25.200]   Oh, yours has a little, tiny chimney as well.
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.400]   Of course he has a chimney.
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.400]   I'll say it does.
[01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:28.000]   I don't know.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.160]   But chimney and a smoker--
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:30.200]   I'm just like--
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.000]   Yeah, I'm using cute ones, too.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.360]   I'm sending you the picture.
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:35.960]   So you got the camp, Chef.
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:37.640]   I got the Traeger.
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:39.400]   I think you won.
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:39.920]   Great.
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:40.280]   I know I won't.
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:41.760]   Yours cost the same as mine.
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.760]   That's what really pisses me off.
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:44.680]   What?
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.680]   For the same amount of money.
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:49.880]   I could have had the Woodwind Wi-Fi 24.
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:53.520]   Can you make 32 burgers and two racks of rib on yours?
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:54.400]   Oh, yeah, no problem.
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:55.360]   Because I was having--
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:56.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:07:01.160]   --that I could grow on the side and in the middle if I wanted to.
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:02.080]   But I mean, that's just me.
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:03.080]   I'm just a grown man.
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:04.080]   I'm just doing the best I can.
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:04.440]   You're a grown man.
[01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:06.080]   Why did I call you before?
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:08.680]   I went with Laurie Grill's suggestion, Laurie Grill.
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:10.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:12.320]   Write the cookbook, Laurie.
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:13.320]   Laurie Grill.
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:14.160]   That's my girl.
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.560]   Laurie Grill's suggestion for you.
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:20.280]   She's named after it, but I should have gone with O&JJ--
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:21.280]   Stupethstone.
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:21.720]   --heats his stone.
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:24.640]   Because he knew the right answer.
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:25.160]   Two things.
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:26.000]   Let me tell you a couple of them.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.640]   First thing, I'm the one with your picture favorite in my phone.
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:30.680]   That's true.
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:32.280]   It was favorite.
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:33.480]   I'm the one that knows you.
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:36.400]   Secondly, I don't know if you've heard of this thing called
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.040]   ExpressVPN, but I think that you--
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.040]   I better do an ExpressVPN commercial
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:44.720]   to pay for my new Woodwind Wi-Fi 24 with psychic.
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:46.440]   I don't think Lisa let me have two, though.
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:47.480]   That's ridiculous.
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.560]   You've got three drones.
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.120]   You could get three smokers.
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:51.560]   You're a grown man, Uncle Leo.
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:53.120]   We do the best we can what we got.
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:55.320]   How big of a party do you throw?
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:56.520]   I need two.
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:59.640]   Also, Leo, you're going to need to have one separate.
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:01.640]   If you're going to be cooking kosher food for your friends--
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:02.840]   Oh, yeah, you have a separate.
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:03.960]   That's the kosher grill.
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:06.600]   People with peanut allergies, you can say this has never
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:09.360]   been used with any sort of nut-based product.
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:10.680]   You're just thinking about your friends.
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:11.960]   That's all.
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:15.240]   You donate the trigger to the LastPass studios
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:17.280]   for your adorn employees.
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:17.960]   That's true.
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:19.560]   To reward them for the hard work--
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:22.680]   Oh, so that in between the shows, you can have delicious snacks.
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:24.520]   We can all dive carbon monies over.
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.120]   You can have a smirk at it.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:26.480]   Yeah.
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:28.080]   What you do?
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.040]   I do have the best VPN, though.
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:31.280]   I have to say.
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:34.600]   And I will brook no contest on this.
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:39.680]   This is ExpressVPN.
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:42.240]   I want to talk a little bit about privacy.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:45.800]   You know that a VPN is all about security, of course.
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:50.000]   But it's also about privacy.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.160]   It says in the ad, I should talk about a time I searched
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:53.000]   for something online.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.600]   I wouldn't want others to know about.
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:57.320]   Pretty much all the time.
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:59.880]   Pretty much every day.
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:03.280]   But the point is, your internet service provider,
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:06.120]   your carrier, they know where you go.
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:08.520]   I don't care if you're in like incognito mode.
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:09.600]   That doesn't hide it from them.
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:12.720]   It hides it from Google, sort of.
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:16.720]   Incognito mode is not a protection for privacy.
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:18.720]   No matter what mode you use or how many times
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.840]   you clear your browsing history, your ISP
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:22.760]   knows every single website you've ever visited.
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:25.400]   That's why even when I'm at home, I never
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:29.480]   go online without using ExpressVPN.
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:30.440]   It's a sad thing.
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:32.320]   But ISPs in the United States can legally
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:34.520]   sell your information to ad companies.
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:37.920]   Furthermore, we just pass the reauthorization
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:41.040]   of the Patriot Act, the House about to pass it.
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.360]   That's going to let the FBI look at your search history
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:45.080]   without a warrant, just whatever they want.
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:47.960]   They say, hey, Comcast, what's Leo been up to?
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:50.160]   And they know, and they show.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:52.160]   Not if you use an ExpressVPN.
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.000]   It's a simple app.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.880]   You put it on your iPhone, your Android device,
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:56.160]   you put it on your Mac, your PC.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:57.760]   You can even run it on Linux.
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.520]   You can run it on smart TVs.
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:03.680]   It reroutes all of your internet through their secure servers.
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:06.560]   The ISP can't see where you're going.
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:08.520]   All of your data is 100% encrypted.
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:12.280]   You don't have to use anything like DNS over a HTTPS
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:13.120]   or anything like that.
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:14.560]   It's all protected.
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:16.040]   100% of your data with the best
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:19.320]   encryption you can get, military grade.
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:21.560]   And it's so fast, you won't even know
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:22.720]   you're using ExpressVPN.
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:24.800]   That's another nice benefit, by the way.
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:26.840]   If they're in 94 countries, you can go
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:28.320]   to any one of those countries.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:30.080]   You merge to the internet from that country.
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:32.400]   That's where you look like you're coming from.
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:34.880]   Let's say you want to watch Doctor Who.
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.760]   You've used up all your Netflix at home.
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:38.720]   You want to watch Doctor Who on Netflix UK?
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:41.960]   No problem. You say, please put me in London.
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:44.040]   ExpressVPN's got their server there.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.080]   You emerge under the internet from London.
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:48.280]   You refresh Netflix suddenly.
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:50.680]   Hi-ho, there's my Doctor Who.
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.800]   Or Japan for anime and on and on and on.
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:55.720]   It is so fast you can watch HD video.
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:58.040]   In fact, I've been doing an experiment.
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:03.040]   I left ExpressVPN on my iPad, I think since last week.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:06.320]   And I forget, no difference.
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:08.040]   I keep forgetting it's on.
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:13.080]   It's like, it's just as fast, but I'm secure and I'm private.
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:15.760]   All your devices, you gotta get ExpressVPN.
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:19.120]   CNET rated them number one, wired rated them number one.
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.960]   I rate them number one and I've checked the privacy policy.
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:23.280]   So have independent third parties.
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:24.720]   They've audited the privacy policy
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.880]   and their unique trusted server technology.
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:30.280]   And they say, yes, your privacy is protected.
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:32.320]   Protect your online activity today.
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:33.680]   If you want an extra three months free,
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:36.120]   go to expressvpn.com/twit.
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:38.760]   ExpressVPN.com/twit.
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:41.760]   And you'll get a three months free on a one year package.
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:45.760]   ExpressVPN.com/twit.
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:47.760]   We thank you so much for their support
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:48.920]   of this week in tech.
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:50.440]   And maybe if I do a few more of those ads,
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:53.840]   I can buy myself a woodwind Wi-Fi 24 with sidekick.
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:56.840]   I think you should.
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:57.920]   Can't you return the other one?
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.240]   Is it Andre and her turnpiles?
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.520]   I used it!
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:01.360]   I used it!
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:02.520]   It's America.
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:04.560]   It broke on you and you don't want it anymore
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:06.320]   and you're gonna send it back for that.
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:08.720]   I used it, Pella, Bretta.
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:10.680]   You haven't got yours yet though, right?
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:11.520]   Comes on Wednesday.
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.280]   Ooh, watching the track and every night, right?
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:14.120]   Go to bed.
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:14.960]   It's funny.
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:15.800]   Just like it's Christmas.
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:16.640]   Isn't it funny?
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:18.160]   You're not gonna track her, you know what I'm saying?
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:19.160]   Nowadays with quarantine,
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:21.160]   there's still little look forward to.
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.720]   It's like, oh, I got a new pencil.
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:24.560]   Look at that.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.720]   The original is fresh.
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.680]   It's like it's so sad.
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:29.840]   Those take much.
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:31.320]   They don't take much.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.560]   Not that it's this weak and grills,
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:36.040]   but my friend who has a smoker,
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:39.200]   he smoked me and my daughter, Ribs.
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:41.600]   And the Ribs are so...
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.200]   My daughter was talking about these Ribs
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:45.360]   three and four days after we had the Ribs.
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:48.440]   She went over and gave him a present and thanked him.
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:50.120]   And I said, I'm your father.
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:52.320]   Why are you thanking another man for some Ribs?
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:55.360]   So I figured I got to get my smoker to be a mother.
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:58.040]   I'm not a thank other man for your Ribs.
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.560]   There's a motto, folks.
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:01.040]   There's a member unfothered.
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:01.880]   Shook her.
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:04.140]   (laughing)
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:06.180]   Well, this is good.
[01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:07.000]   This is good.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.080]   Now, did you have you already ordered your meat?
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:11.960]   Man, look.
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:13.760]   I go to the Amish market.
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:14.600]   You know what I mean?
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.120]   I got some Delmonico steaks on deck.
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:17.760]   I got a brisket, pre-ready.
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.040]   I got a pork shoulder.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.520]   I'm telling you, I got some squamps.
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:21.360]   Got some asparagus.
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.200]   I got some corn.
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.040]   You got some squamps?
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:23.880]   What's a squamps?
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:24.720]   - Squamps.
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:25.560]   - Squamps.
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.480]   - That's my grandma used to call them squamps.
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:29.640]   - I've got one of the squamps from now on.
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:31.760]   - Oh, I love squamps.
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:35.520]   - Oh, you know, if you take all those tops off of the side,
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.840]   it's just a burner and I could put a pot of water
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:40.440]   over there, bowls and corn or whatever else I'd like to do.
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:41.960]   3,200 BTUs pumping.
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:42.800]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:44.080]   It's a great attachment.
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:45.640]   I'm just saying that.
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:46.960]   - You know, Owen's gonna be sending you
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:48.240]   all kinds of pictures.
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:49.880]   - Oh, oh, you got all the gram.
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:51.160]   I'm gonna start texting.
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:52.000]   I got it.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.080]   (laughing)
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:53.920]   That's really fun.
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:54.760]   - You're up here.
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:55.600]   We haven't called you crying.
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:56.440]   Face bomb.
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:57.920]   - You can actually make your corn in the cob
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:00.880]   and bake your bread or your,
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.720]   what would, let's see, oh, I know.
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:04.640]   I wanna make pulled pork.
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:05.600]   I'm gonna take that pork shoulder,
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:06.840]   make some pulled pork,
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:09.600]   maybe bake some buns to go on the pulled pork
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:10.800]   to hold the pulled pork.
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:15.800]   Maybe some soft, delicious potatoes
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:17.480]   and foil on the top right.
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:18.320]   - Little foil.
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.640]   - I make salt, bacon potatoes.
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:22.440]   You crust them and salt, they're so good.
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:23.280]   - I got it.
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:25.800]   - Meanwhile, back to tech, briefly.
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:28.040]   (laughing)
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:29.120]   - That, you should just take out
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:30.600]   and do a little food service now.
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:32.600]   We have like this week in food.
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:35.400]   - I think we could just have a Pellet Brothers show.
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:36.240]   - Oh, that's gross.
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:37.520]   - It's really good.
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.080]   - I don't want to get in on this.
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:39.920]   (laughing)
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:40.760]   - Yes, we do.
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:43.960]   - And it says it's scrimps, not squims.
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:44.800]   Let's get it right.
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:45.720]   (laughing)
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.720]   - I don't know, that's what my grandmothers say.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:49.360]   I mean, don't spute me, boy.
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.800]   Don't spute me, aunt.
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:51.960]   I'm gonna tell you why my grandmothers say.
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:52.800]   - Oh Lord.
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:54.600]   (laughing)
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.360]   - Are you using voice tweets yet?
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:58.600]   Oh, and you'd be a perfect guy to use a voice tweet.
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.840]   You could do a rant, 120, 200.
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:02.280]   How many seconds you got, 120 seconds?
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:03.120]   - 140 seconds.
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:03.960]   - 140 seconds.
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:07.240]   - How long for the mega-280 seconds?
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:08.080]   (laughing)
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:09.120]   - If you keep on talking,
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:11.160]   they just simply extend it to another tweet.
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:12.000]   Oh, joy.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.160]   (laughing)
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.680]   - I haven't got it yet, I'm bummed.
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:16.800]   - It's hot right now.
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.600]   I mean, everyone I've listened to,
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.240]   it's really loud.
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:21.440]   - Too loud.
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:24.440]   - Yes, they gotta fix that.
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:25.920]   But I'm excited for it.
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:29.200]   I'm excited for people to hear the plethora of things
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:32.000]   that I could complain about in 140 seconds.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:32.840]   And audience-
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:35.880]   - Why would people use this instead of just writing it down?
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:38.760]   - The same reason people listen to podcasts
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:40.080]   more than they watch podcasts.
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:41.480]   People love to hear.
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:42.680]   People don't like to read.
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:43.840]   And people don't like to write
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:46.400]   because most of us like myself type way too fast
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.480]   and I don't spell check myself and I send out tweets.
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:50.000]   Oh wait, that might be the president.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:50.840]   It might be me.
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:51.680]   Same thing.
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:55.040]   But if you get to say it out loud,
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.360]   then people love to talk.
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:00.680]   So I think it'll be overly used in the beginning,
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:02.680]   but then it'll be great for certain instances
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:05.480]   where you really just need to hear the expression
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:07.480]   and passion about certain topics.
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.400]   Where just reading it in text
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.120]   gets you in so much trouble sometimes.
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:12.760]   You make a comment on something
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:13.920]   and people think that you're mad
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:15.440]   and you really just have sarcasm
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:16.720]   and you're in your heart.
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:19.440]   - Yeah, so it was much better for intonation.
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:21.120]   You can understand what someone's saying,
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:24.840]   much better from their voice than from reading it on a tweet.
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:26.920]   I just don't think that I'll ever care enough
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:30.000]   to click on something to be able to hear.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.320]   Like maybe, maybe it would.
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:32.160]   Maybe it would make it-
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:33.680]   - Here I'm on Cardi B's account.
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:35.360]   I am Cardi B.
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:37.760]   Here is her first voice tweet.
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:39.600]   There's a little profanity, just a little.
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:40.840]   - Hey, Bardi Gang.
[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:43.360]   So I wanted to do something really special for you guys
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:46.520]   since today is Bardi Gang anniversary.
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:51.560]   So I really wanted to give you a snippet of my next single.
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:53.480]   I'm really nervous, but I'm really excited
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:54.720]   and I hope you guys enjoy it.
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:55.780]   So here it goes.
[01:16:55.780 --> 01:17:00.080]   - Okay, we're gonna stop right there.
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:02.160]   (laughing)
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:04.560]   Why are so many rich internet-
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:08.040]   - Why are so many rich people that are athletes and stars
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.560]   have the worst audio and-
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:12.240]   - They don't, they're doing it in their phone.
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:13.320]   - Wait a minute, here's another one.
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:15.000]   This is the one, this is the one I was expecting.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.000]   This is what I thought I was running.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.360]   - Halleously.
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.200]   - This is yours.
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.640]   - You know me, halleously, but you hate on me.
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:24.920]   But all that hate and all that envy,
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:28.800]   I know that I be sleeping in your brain tonight.
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.360]   - You could have clicked in warrants.
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:31.520]   - That's this, that's two.
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:32.360]   - That made me-
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:33.200]   - That's two.
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:34.040]   - Twice.
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:37.720]   Just gonna make a video voice thing you could have played
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:39.720]   at least, but a problem with joint my heart.
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:42.240]   - Who should I listen to?
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:43.240]   Just in a war made one.
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:44.200]   - She did one.
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.000]   - See, I don't have it yet, otherwise-
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.720]   - I would be, I would be doing all of my-
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:49.960]   - Oh yeah.
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:50.800]   - Yeah.
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:51.800]   - I should just-
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.560]   - We're at a super exciting point.
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:56.440]   It's like the very beginning of Instagram.
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:57.760]   We're like celebrities,
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:59.600]   which is to, "Hey look, I've got this on my phone.
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:02.440]   "I'm gonna take a selfie without any good lighting,
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:05.080]   "without any makeup, without any photo shopping."
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.360]   And now we're gonna say, "Hi, I'm really excited
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:10.040]   "for you to hear my new hit single that drops next week.
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:11.800]   "Here's a little listen for it."
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:16.160]   ♪ And then when we get together ♪
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:18.760]   ♪ Oh baby ♪
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:21.440]   - Well, it's, when we first got laser printers and Macs,
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:23.960]   what did our desktop publishing look like?
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:24.800]   Not so good.
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:25.640]   - I'm making fun, solid ones.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:26.840]   - Ransom notes, that's what we did.
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:27.880]   We did ransom notes.
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:29.800]   Let me see, I'm trying to find Kristina's.
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:32.040]   I'm gonna tweet a count,
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:34.640]   and she tweets so damn much.
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:35.960]   - She does.
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:37.840]   - It's, I'm only, wait a minute, is this--
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:39.640]   - What are you looking for?
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:42.920]   To what Georgia said, but my reaction was exactly the same.
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:45.320]   Like, okay, well, now you're trying to really blur
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.720]   what a tweet actually is.
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:47.560]   - Yeah.
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:48.560]   - I wonder what people are gonna use this for.
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:51.000]   But then that was pretty much everyone's reaction
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.240]   to Twitter to begin with.
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:56.240]   And then it found a way to be actually important.
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:57.800]   So maybe a couple of years from now,
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.520]   we'll be wondering why we ever thought
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:00.680]   this was such a bad idea.
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:01.840]   - Or excuse me, at all.
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:04.960]   - And for accessibility and for songs,
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:09.320]   or there are some things that hearing a crowd cheer,
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:12.120]   or my cat made this strange sound,
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:13.560]   you can't really type me,
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:17.640]   like it doesn't bring the same extent.
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:19.400]   - But that is another issue.
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:22.640]   Like, are they going to have auto captioned turned on
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:25.280]   for these things so the people who can't hear
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:26.480]   or have a problem with their rank
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.720]   and also enjoy some accessibility issue?
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:29.880]   - Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:31.880]   - Yeah, that was really,
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:33.680]   that was one of the interesting things that came out of this.
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:36.000]   Someone who worked at Twitter responded to some
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.400]   of these comments by saying that,
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:38.800]   oh, well, we're all working on it.
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:40.880]   And indicating that they don't,
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.040]   I don't know if this is true or not,
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:44.440]   I'm just going from this tweet that this person posted,
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:47.120]   that there isn't like a really established
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:50.040]   official accessibility team within Twitter.
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:52.120]   It's just something that people who work on
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:55.120]   whatever product will also try to embed
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:57.400]   and try to consider accessibility as they're doing it.
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:19:58.720]   As opposed to other companies where,
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:01.240]   no, there is an accessibility team whose entire job
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:05.480]   it is to focus on all of the paramount needs
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:06.480]   of people with disabilities
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:08.440]   and how to make sure that all their products accepted.
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:11.000]   And if that's true, that would have really surprised me
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.240]   for an operation in the size of Twitter.
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:17.160]   - You don't use Facebook, Georgia, you don't use Facebook.
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:19.200]   - Nope, I'll never, never have.
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:20.520]   Like, I don't even have. - Never have.
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:23.440]   - Never had an account, ever, ever, ever had an account.
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:24.280]   - How about you all?
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:26.800]   And I can't remember, you're on Facebook, don't you?
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:28.560]   - I am definitely on Facebook.
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:29.520]   - Yeah.
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:31.520]   - I love Facebook. - Yeah.
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:33.760]   - Oh, I love it. - As we get to argue with people,
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:36.680]   is where I get to filter out the people that are racist,
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:38.280]   that it no racist.
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:39.760]   Facebook is very useful.
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:42.560]   Without Facebook, I would dare be snakes in my grass.
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:44.240]   Facebook is my lawnmower, okay?
[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:46.120]   Having Facebook allows me to cut the grass,
[01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:47.680]   but oh, you're a snake, oh, gotcha.
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:49.120]   - That's good.
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:51.360]   - I love Facebook, I appreciate your Facebook.
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:55.920]   - After the horrible George Floyd murder,
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:58.520]   you were saying, I am gonna block anybody
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.560]   who talks more, what did you say,
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:04.360]   more about the looting than about the protests, right?
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.080]   - Like that's a filter.
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:09.720]   - If you complain about looting,
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:11.600]   the first thing I do is go to your page.
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.360]   And if you haven't said one thing
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:15.800]   about a man being executed,
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:18.240]   about law enforcement,
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:20.520]   then I know what your problem is.
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:22.080]   - It's like, yeah. - And it's like,
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:22.920]   how many people, it's person.
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:25.920]   - It's very, it's, so you're upset about a building
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:29.400]   that's insured, property, that's not yours,
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:32.680]   and the people that did it were peacefully protesting
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:34.280]   and you know that there's anarchists out there
[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:35.520]   to do certain things.
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:37.920]   But you're worried about those things
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:40.560]   before you're worried about loss of life.
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:42.960]   And again, I don't wanna get on the thing about politics
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:45.920]   and ran into a real thing, but I will say this,
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:47.400]   there are criminals in this world
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:49.280]   and those criminals get punished.
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:52.040]   When people in law enforcement do something blatantly wrong
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:54.680]   and they get to go home or go to another job
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:57.920]   and don't receive justice, that is the problem.
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:21:59.960]   So, great way to filter people.
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:01.040]   Love Facebook, thank you,
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:02.040]   you should be answering the question.
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:03.440]   - But if you're not on Facebook,
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:05.040]   you don't have to filter them in the first time.
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:06.040]   - You don't need a lawn mower
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:07.480]   'cause you don't have no grass.
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:10.840]   - I don't have exactly, like I have a very small amount
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:13.840]   of, I know what they want, I don't have to worry,
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:14.680]   I already know.
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:15.680]   - You have real friends though,
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:18.440]   and that's the difference between you and me, Georgia.
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:22.360]   I like Uncle Leo, but a very smaller portion of Uncle Leo.
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:24.440]   I like Uncle Leo, have a lot of fans.
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:27.880]   And I have to give these fans a platform to come and see me
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:29.120]   and listen to me.
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:31.960]   And then I either get to educate them or destroy them.
[01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:32.960]   It's Uncle Leo.
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:33.960]   (laughing)
[01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:37.160]   It ignores them, but I snipe them and strike them.
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:38.320]   - Oh yeah, see I ignore.
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:39.160]   - I ignore, yeah.
[01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:41.080]   - And then my favorite thing is when they complain and say,
[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:43.080]   I can't believe Leo has you on Twitter
[01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:44.000]   and you're talking like that.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.360]   I'm like, you just threatened my life
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.440]   and now you're gonna go cry to Uncle Leo
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:49.080]   'cause I made you feel bad.
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:50.400]   I don't think he's going to work.
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:51.240]   - I don't think he's going to work.
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:52.560]   - It's not good for your health, Owen.
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:54.200]   It's just not good for your health.
[01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:58.000]   - I get the fans part and it's nice that they have access
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.200]   and they can talk to him and interact.
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:04.680]   - Owen just got a grill with a pizza stone.
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:06.520]   He's not worried about his health.
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:07.920]   There's no--
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:09.960]   - There's no wind in the internet arguments.
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:12.400]   I'm sorry, there's no wind, there's no sniping,
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:15.200]   there's no nothing, there's no people don't.
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:18.720]   If people are already open-minded to listen to you
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:20.160]   and actually have a debate,
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:21.520]   and that you can actually have a debate
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:23.440]   'cause they should still have debates these days,
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:25.720]   then these are not the people that you need to be speaking to
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:27.440]   in the first place and the people that are already
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:29.000]   closed-minded and don't care.
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.800]   They're not gonna change.
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.440]   So-- - I'm gonna give you a great analogy.
[01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:33.440]   I'm gonna give you a great analogy.
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:35.840]   You're Jiu Jitsu, Maven, right?
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:39.000]   - Yep. - You've trained, right?
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.240]   - Yes, I have.
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:42.960]   - Going against opponents that were tougher than you, right?
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:44.160]   - I have.
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:46.040]   - Okay, so I'm a black man in America.
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:47.960]   I have to go against the world every day.
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:50.000]   All these punks on Twitter and on Facebook
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.320]   are training for me to deal with the oppression
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:54.000]   and the problems I have to deal with in life, okay?
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.280]   I'm sparring day to day, coast to coast,
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:00.120]   key let's do Galargo to stay sharp and razor focused, okay?
[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:00.960]   - Fair. - You know about it.
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:01.800]   - Fair. - Fair.
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:03.600]   - This is my arena.
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:04.920]   So come on Facebook, come on.
[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:08.280]   - That's taking no justice, no peace to a whole nother level.
[01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:09.560]   It's like-- - I want you to spend
[01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:12.920]   some time to retire and enjoy just because all of that--
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:14.320]   - I get that word. - I get that word.
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:15.480]   - I get that. - I get that.
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:17.680]   - I get that though, in a way being,
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:20.160]   in a way what he's saying, now correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:23.720]   is that not being on Facebook is a form of privilege.
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:27.000]   That's a privilege. - I don't wanna say
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000]   but-- - I have a be on Facebook
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.920]   is a privilege.
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:34.440]   - My favorite thing, or again, people that are usually
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:37.640]   Caucasian get to say this this week,
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:39.880]   I'm taking a break from social media.
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:42.440]   - Right. - Social media is,
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:44.600]   I just need to take a break for a month.
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:49.440]   And I'm like, wow, you can't stand in racism, oppression,
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:52.080]   progression, protest for 30 days.
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:54.080]   People talking about things that you're only watching,
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:55.960]   nobody's in your face doing it-- - Make them very uncomfortable,
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:57.440]   isn't it? - But you can't,
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:59.880]   I can't take off the internet of blackness,
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:02.040]   I can't take off this uniform, not be a cop,
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:04.560]   when I go home, I have to deal this everywhere I go,
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:06.720]   I don't get to take a break, I live it.
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:09.280]   But it's good that if you need to take a break,
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:10.680]   that's the privilege that you get to have.
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:12.520]   - You're saying okay, Karen, you're mine, right?
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:14.000]   - You can make change in the world
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.720]   without being on social media, right?
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:16.880]   Like you can be proactive, I don't know--
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.440]   - I think Georgia, you live that.
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:20.360]   - You live that, Georgia, yes.
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:22.320]   - Yeah, and I think that there's other people that do too,
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:25.120]   but I don't think that Owen's saying this, so like,
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:28.400]   you can make change without it being through social media,
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:30.560]   right? Be proactive, be on the streets.
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:32.640]   - In fact, it might be more effective.
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:34.120]   - Elected officials, you know.
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:36.040]   - It might be more effective to go down the street
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:38.240]   and talk to real people about these issues.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:39.880]   - It's whatever way you wanna do it,
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:40.880]   but you should do something,
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:42.320]   and I think that that's what Owen's saying.
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:44.880]   And you're right, it is a privilege to be able to--
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:47.080]   You can't just turn it off, yeah.
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:49.320]   And I'm not bashing people that aren't on social media
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:51.880]   'cause I fully understand why I have a lot of friends
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:54.800]   that are married men and they just don't touch the internet.
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:55.960]   They're like, look, that's my wife's thing,
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:58.440]   I'm not going on there, I don't wanna deal with it
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:00.840]   'cause they don't, the drama, they don't wanna deal with it.
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:02.160]   So I fully understand there's some people
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:04.560]   just don't wanna be online, and that's fine too.
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:07.160]   I'm just saying to people that need the break
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:10.680]   from stressed situations, like I'm stressed out too,
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:13.440]   I gotta deal with it, and I deal with it by eating my feelings
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:15.520]   and looking back over at this dominated rate.
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:16.600]   (laughing)
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.600]   - Right, and revolution takes breaks in the mix.
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:19.440]   - And revolution takes breaks in the mix.
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:21.760]   - And making some briskets sometimes.
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:25.960]   - Andy, I can't remember, you're on Facebook, aren't you, Andy?
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:28.240]   - I have a nominal presence on Facebook,
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:30.680]   mainly because after years and years and years
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:32.440]   of trying to get my family to say,
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:35.000]   oh look, here's, I've created a private group on Flickr
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.480]   and look, I've created this entire server for you.
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:41.240]   And if I want to know, I will know when my nieces
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:43.480]   and nephews graduate and when there's parties
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:45.840]   and stuff like that, I will not get to see the pictures
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:48.440]   of somebody's skateboarding.
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:51.040]   So for that reason, I've never ever, ever installed
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:54.680]   the Facebook app on anything, 'cause that's cracked.
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:58.480]   That is not even once, not because,
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:01.960]   you'll get addicted to it because as soon as you install it,
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:03.840]   that's, that you've lost.
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:08.200]   - Yeah, so the reason I ask all three of you is,
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:10.280]   I wanna know your opinion, first I wanna understand
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:12.240]   your relationship to Facebook before I ask you
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:15.360]   your opinion on this, 'cause Facebook and Instagram
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:19.720]   have decided to let Facebook users turn off political ads
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:21.640]   for the 2020 election.
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:23.640]   There's been a big debate whether they should take money
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:25.380]   for political ads at all.
[01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:29.040]   And I, for one have said, no, you probably shouldn't.
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:30.480]   Jeff Jarvis has defended it saying,
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:33.520]   look, it's not just the people you don't like who buy ads,
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:36.200]   it's the chance for the underdog candidate
[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:37.840]   to efficiently reach voters.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:40.520]   It's a valuable tool for people.
[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:43.360]   And so not taking political ads would be bad.
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:47.080]   I think though, maybe, I don't know, what do you think?
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:50.160]   Turning, it seems to me it's a good half measure to say,
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:51.800]   if you don't like the political ads,
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:53.680]   you can just turn them off, you won't see them.
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:55.920]   And Facebook at that time will not make money off you
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:57.120]   on political ads.
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:59.320]   Let's start with Georgia, is that a good idea?
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:02.080]   - I don't know, I feel kind of neutral towards it.
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:05.160]   I think Facebook, I don't like Facebook in the least of the,
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:06.840]   in the best of times, I don't like Facebook.
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:08.760]   I think that it, you know, anyways,
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:10.200]   I think it's insidious in certain ways.
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:11.040]   - So it doesn't matter. - I don't know
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:14.520]   if the ads themselves are the worst part of Facebook.
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:16.680]   I think that it's nice that you can choose to turn it off
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:17.600]   or not turn it off.
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.160]   And I think that, you know, in the end,
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:21.160]   it's like really being educated about media
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:26.000]   and how to add, you know, persuade, manipulate, control you.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.680]   I think that that should be an education
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:29.040]   that goes through the school system
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:32.000]   so that you can deal with having all of these advertisements
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.760]   constantly kind of trying to change your opinion
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:36.160]   and tell you that you're not beautiful enough,
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:38.160]   you're not smart enough, this is why you're powerless,
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:39.800]   this is why you should be scared
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:42.840]   and give up all of your control and give it to us.
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:45.240]   But I think that them, you know,
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:47.400]   the ads are gonna be there anyway, somewhere.
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:51.200]   So I like that you can choose to or not choose to, so.
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:52.880]   - I also should point out that Facebook
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:57.880]   is gonna start a special section on for voters.
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:00.640]   That'll be a voter information section
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:02.960]   and a voter registration section.
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:07.960]   They wanna register 4 million new people to vote in November.
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:11.440]   So that is an opportunity to use Facebook's platform
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:12.600]   to give people information
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:14.440]   about where they're polling places,
[01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:16.800]   what the issues are, who the candidates are,
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:19.760]   in a, they say, nonpartisan way.
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:21.160]   So let's add that into the mix.
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:22.600]   They're trying to do both something good
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:25.360]   and kind of help people who have over overwhelmed
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:26.200]   by political ads.
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:28.120]   Owen, what do you think?
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:30.200]   - Steve, for the record first and foremost
[01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:32.600]   that politicians shouldn't be allowed to raise money.
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:33.760]   There should be a dollar amount
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:35.280]   stiping given to each candidate
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:36.360]   in each level.
[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:37.200]   - Yeah.
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:38.720]   - A million dollar presidency, a hundred thousand dollars
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:39.960]   in an error, so on and so forth.
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:42.000]   - Yeah, a trillion dollar campaign
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.040]   for presidency is unacceptable.
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:48.160]   - So that should be capped
[01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:49.400]   and there should be no fundraising.
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:52.560]   Secondly, if they allow you to turn it off, that's great.
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:53.560]   But no matter what they do,
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:54.400]   no matter what you do,
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:56.880]   it's the same thing as everything else.
[01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:58.840]   You can turn off ads all you want to.
[01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:01.200]   The biggest salesman in your life
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:03.320]   is the person right across from you.
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:05.000]   I'm sitting there looking at Leo LaPorte
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.520]   who bought his own pellet grill
[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:10.080]   and I made him feel like less than 30 seconds.
[01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:12.920]   By showing him the power of my own personal choice.
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:15.240]   So, you could block that's all you want to.
[01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:17.520]   If you have a friend that has a good compelling argument
[01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:20.000]   such as myself, they can sway you and change you.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.240]   So Facebook has still got that going for itself.
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:24.680]   I also do appreciate them having the voters
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:25.800]   and all that kind of stuff set up
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:26.960]   where people can find out where they're voting
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:28.320]   and register because that is something
[01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:30.280]   that's desperately in a digital platform
[01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:32.480]   because in America, we are so far behind
[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:35.320]   in the voting technological process.
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:36.160]   - Yeah.
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:38.880]   I actually, that's really the real thing is
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:40.800]   let's get money out of politics to best week.
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:41.640]   Yes.
[01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:43.320]   - I agree with you 100% on that.
[01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:45.760]   On the other hand, it is in politics
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:47.480]   and it's gonna be for the foreseeable future
[01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:48.320]   because guess what?
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:50.240]   The people who got elected by that money are the ones
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:52.640]   who decide whether they're gonna be able to take money.
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:54.840]   But America.
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:56.960]   But I don't know.
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:00.960]   I like the two pronged approach that Facebook's taken.
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:03.320]   How about you, Andy? What do you think?
[01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:07.200]   - I think it's a positive thing that Facebook has indicated
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:09.280]   that they have some responsibility for anything
[01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:11.160]   that happens on their system,
[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:12.840]   which is a positive thing for me.
[01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:15.680]   But it's, and it's good to give people a little bit more
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:17.760]   control over what's appearing in their news feeds.
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:18.840]   That's also a good thing.
[01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:21.080]   However, it really doesn't attack the problem.
[01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:23.840]   It goes, it solves a problem for people that are annoyed
[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:27.400]   by political ads or annoyed by ads in general.
[01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:32.400]   But the real problem is the absolute find to the,
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:35.120]   to a 100th of a percent,
[01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:38.240]   this percentage point with which modern advertising tools
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:41.080]   and targeting tools allow you to recraft an argument
[01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:43.760]   to make sure that it will appeal specifically
[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:46.680]   to the group of people that this ad is going to be,
[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:48.000]   is going to be shown to.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.560]   There was a study, I think that was released last month
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:53.000]   that was talking about some of these specific problems
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:58.000]   of a COVID-19 vaccine and indicating that this is,
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:05.640]   one of those few things that spreads across multiple categories
[01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:09.320]   of paranoia, where you have people who think that,
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:11.400]   oh, well, all vaccines are bad,
[01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:16.040]   but how, then you get to targeting people who are saying
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:18.520]   that I don't want to get a vaccine because this is big pharma,
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:20.000]   but we don't, I don't need this.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.800]   This is a huge corporation that once again
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:22.960]   is trying to control us.
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:24.040]   Or you have someone who's saying,
[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:26.120]   well, the government says that we should all have this,
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:27.160]   and the government is saying,
[01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:29.200]   I can't send my kid to school until I have this.
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:32.680]   This is big governments getting out coming after me,
[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:34.440]   just the way the big government always does.
[01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:36.440]   And then even you have the hippie crunchy people
[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:38.600]   who are like, oh my God, we don't want to put another,
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:42.600]   artificial chemical into our st. temples of our bodies.
[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:44.520]   And this is the, when you multiply that
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:48.480]   towards a spectrum of a thousand different categories,
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:51.440]   and you have someone who, as has been said,
[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:54.200]   has a trillion dollars to spend on the campaign
[01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:57.480]   to make sure that, look, it's really important
[01:32:57.480 --> 01:32:58.600]   that we get this state,
[01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:01.600]   and we've decided, we've determined that winning this state
[01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:06.080]   means turning only 30,000 to 300,000 undecided voters.
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:09.600]   That's when you decide that I'm going to unleash 12,000
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:12.760]   specific campaigns to make sure we'll get 300 people there,
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:15.360]   800 people there, 700 people there,
[01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:18.280]   to make sure that we can turn this state to our advantage.
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:23.280]   So this is, I really think that in an idealized sort of world,
[01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:25.400]   Facebook will just, will not,
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:27.480]   will have a standard user interface,
[01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:30.120]   but there will be third party apps that can,
[01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:32.000]   I can interface through it instead.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000]   That could be a little bit smarter in deciding
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.320]   that, well, why am I seeing this particular ad?
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:40.080]   That, a way that I can use Facebook without Facebook
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:42.440]   and having any details about who I am
[01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:45.120]   and what it thinks that I stand for.
[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:49.760]   That's the only way to protect our collective brains
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:52.200]   against this kind of, this kind of infection.
[01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:54.480]   And it's gonna get worse before,
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:58.880]   if we don't take any steps to make sure that there are controls
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:01.600]   over how people can try to manipulate people
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:02.680]   through social media.
[01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:06.000]   - Speaking of social media manipulation,
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.880]   and actually, I'm not sure I feel about this.
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:13.880]   I feel like the president was trolled by K-pop TikTok,
[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:18.880]   Facebook and Instagram, teenagers all over the country,
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:23.880]   apparently, signed up for tickets to the president's rally
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:26.520]   in Tulsa last night.
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:30.040]   That's why his campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted,
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:34.200]   "A million tickets, give it away."
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:36.640]   He also, by the way, and Brad, just a tip,
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:38.720]   you're not supposed to tell people this part.
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:40.200]   I can't wait, you know, he tweeted,
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:43.600]   "The data is, the data trove is amazing!"
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:46.960]   Except that he now has apparently a good number
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:48.800]   of phone numbers of teenagers,
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:51.720]   'cause they didn't have an age check on there.
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:54.000]   They didn't have, they did verify the phone numbers,
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.760]   it would send you a pin, so they have real phone numbers,
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:59.160]   although it's not, I would imagine these TikTok
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:01.360]   and Instagram users probably know how to create
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:05.760]   a temporary phone phone number on places like Google Voice.
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:08.200]   It's one of the reasons, though,
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:12.560]   that they had an overflow area ready for a thousand people
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:13.920]   and the president and the vice president
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:16.160]   were supposed to speak to that.
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:21.160]   No one showed up there, and in fact, the 19,000 seat arena,
[01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:22.960]   according to the Tulsa Fire Marshal,
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:27.280]   was filled with a mere 6,200 people.
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:31.480]   They were trolled, that's trolling, right?
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:36.040]   They didn't do a lot to prevent that, but wow.
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:38.920]   Steve Schmidt is a Republican strategist,
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:42.480]   you might see him on the MSNBC regularly tweeted
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:47.480]   that his daughter had herself had hundreds of tickets
[01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:52.000]   to the rally and so did her friends.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.160]   My 16 year old daughter and her friends in Park City,
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:56.200]   Utah have hundreds of tickets.
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:58.680]   You've been rolled by America's teams.
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:01.720]   Teens, Steve Schmidt tweeted this morning.
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:05.400]   100,000 likes, many responses from people said,
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:10.240]   this is the AP reporting, say they or their kids did the same.
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:11.520]   Wow.
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:13.840]   BTS has just been formally declared a terrorist group.
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:15.280]   Wow.
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:16.640]   Wow.
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:18.600]   What is it about K-pop fans?
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:21.600]   Why are they, that's interesting.
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:25.680]   It doesn't, I think they're young and they see
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:27.040]   the next 20 years of their lives.
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:28.960]   Yeah, maybe, maybe it's all.
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:29.760]   I think one thing about it.
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:33.360]   Yeah, it was started apparently by a 51 year old
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:35.800]   grandmother from Fort Dodge, Iowa,
[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:40.800]   Mary Jo Lapp, who posted on June 11th on TikTok,
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:43.040]   suggesting people book free tickets to make sure
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:44.800]   there are empty seats.
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:47.280]   It had that single TikTok.
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:49.360]   This is the power of TikTok, by the way.
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:54.360]   From a 51 year old grandma had 700,000 likes
[01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:58.760]   and spread like wildfire throughout TikTok.
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:00.280]   That's the power of social media.
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:02.400]   That is mind boggling.
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:05.640]   And that's what we call hacktivism in these streets.
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:08.440]   Meanwhile, Pascal tweets, it's the biggest data haul
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:12.120]   and rally sign up of all time by a factor of 10.
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:12.960]   Whoops.
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:15.720]   First of all, you're not supposed to admit
[01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:18.120]   that you're gathering the most important part
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:21.200]   of this is gathering data, but okay Brad, whatever.
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:24.280]   I'm surprised it was a Gen X
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:25.360]   where they got all this together
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:26.560]   because normally we're the people
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:28.000]   who are just like watching the world burn.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.080]   Why do you take TikTok?
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:29.920]   Why is that?
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:31.760]   Not as a point of pride, I'm saying.
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:32.600]   I think it's great.
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:34.560]   I think it's really easier to do nothing.
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:36.920]   Is that wild or what?
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:41.920]   R's Technica is reporting that more than 70% of Americans say,
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:45.440]   we're not gonna use contact tracing apps.
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:47.960]   That's actually a decline.
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:51.600]   You were on Georgia Dow some episodes ago
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:54.320]   when we were talking about the Google Apple API
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:56.840]   and said, no way, I'm putting that on my phone.
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:58.400]   We were both together and we both said--
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:00.040]   Oh, both of you said that.
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:03.600]   Well, you're now joined by 70% of Americans.
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:04.800]   This is a sur--
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:06.800]   Wow, a survey by opinion matters
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:09.200]   on behalf of a security company, Avira,
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:11.640]   when asked if they planned to download a contact tracing app
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:15.280]   and overwhelming majority, 71% said, no.
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:18.920]   Part of the problem with the Apple,
[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:20.800]   as it turns out with the Apple Google API,
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:23.120]   is it's too privacy forward.
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:26.680]   That none of the information health experts want,
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:30.120]   things like your name in actual location,
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:31.720]   are available to them.
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:35.600]   So only four states say they're gonna use the API.
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:36.800]   More countries are using it.
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:37.960]   Switzerland's trying it out.
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:40.280]   Germany's finally gotten, said they're gonna do it.
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:41.120]   Lafayette's doing it.
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:43.920]   Even the UK has said, we're gonna use the API.
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:46.600]   But my guess is that worldwide,
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:48.120]   the reaction is pretty much the same.
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:51.960]   We know in Singapore, where they put out an app early on,
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:55.160]   only 25% of residents installed it.
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:58.640]   Now Singapore's considering handing out a Bluetooth token,
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:01.320]   a kind of like an Apple tag that you'd carry in your pocket
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:03.480]   that would record your location at all times.
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:05.720]   Which people will be just sticking on their dog.
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:07.160]   (laughing)
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:08.200]   Don't you wanna help?
[01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:10.040]   You wanna be locked up forever.
[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:12.640]   No, think that that doesn't help.
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:14.520]   That's just one small piece of it.
[01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:16.320]   If you're not gonna be testing everyone,
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:17.720]   then what does it matter?
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:19.560]   If you're only gonna test you when you're really sick,
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:22.720]   you've already, you've had 14 days to infect, right?
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:24.280]   Like how many people, right?
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:26.240]   A thousand, perhaps.
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:27.080]   So, and--
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:29.160]   Yeah, well, it's, it's,
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:33.320]   'cause I just think it basically states that
[01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:35.880]   seven out of 10 people don't trust authority
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:37.480]   in the government that they live in.
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:40.640]   Seven out of 10 people in the world would rather risk dying
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:42.320]   and have someone next to them dying
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:44.200]   than trust the power of--
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:45.040]   That's bad.
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:47.520]   Or if they already have one, you, anything.
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:48.360]   That's right.
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:50.080]   That's really what it comes down to.
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:52.800]   As few as 50% of Americans and other surveys
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:54.520]   say they would do the vaccine.
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:58.400]   So this could last a while.
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:00.160]   Yeah, I think a part of it,
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:02.760]   a big part of it is just gonna simply be
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:07.240]   once we have a binary yes, no pass, fail sort of system
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:11.520]   in place that has numbers and signs behind it,
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:14.480]   the ability to say, okay, well, if you do want to,
[01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:16.280]   if you do want to go to this restaurant tonight,
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:19.120]   you're gonna have to show that you have a valid pass fail card.
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:21.960]   If you want to attend this concert,
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:25.640]   you're gonna have to have a pass fail card scan.
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:30.000]   That's gonna either cause either riots,
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.360]   I'm sorry, that's a bad word,
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:36.000]   a cause, enough kickback that the organizations
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.720]   proposing this will back down,
[01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:39.880]   or that's going to lead to widespread adoption.
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:42.480]   It depends on how,
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:45.520]   it depends on how much attention people are paying
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:47.360]   to the numbers week by week by week.
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:48.800]   People are still dying.
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:51.200]   And we can still see areas in which the numbers
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:52.880]   are going up and not down.
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:55.760]   And it's very, very disappointing to me that
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:57.520]   I'm seeing people, even when I'm going,
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:59.440]   when I went grocery shopping the other day,
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:02.760]   that I'm wearing my mask course,
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:03.880]   not just because I'm outside,
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:05.360]   but because specifically, hey,
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:07.120]   you're inside this enclosed space,
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:08.760]   there's a sign saying you have to wear a mask.
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:10.520]   And the number of times where I pass someone by
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:12.480]   who's wearing their mask around their necks,
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:13.560]   and then they see me with the mask
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:15.080]   and they like sheepishly pull it up.
[01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:16.440]   - See that all the time.
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:19.680]   - Do you not understand that we are still in a crisis here?
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:21.640]   Something is gonna have to give.
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:24.920]   And one possibility, I have to say,
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:27.920]   is that society, either through ignorance
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:31.720]   or through acceptance decides that we are okay
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:34.480]   with losing X tens of thousands of people
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:36.680]   that would have lived over the past 20,
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:40.320]   past two or three, over a period of two or three years,
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:45.280]   over all the damage that's being done to social situations,
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:48.640]   to school, to businesses, that's a possibility,
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:50.440]   but it would be a very, very sad one.
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:53.560]   If I'm opted into this by virtue of the fact
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:56.120]   that I have to go shopping with people
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:59.280]   who are going out while they're sick and not wearing masks.
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:00.960]   - And Andy, that doesn't even work though.
[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:03.280]   There's not ever going to be a pass fail card
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:04.440]   to come into the store.
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:07.000]   Because my favorite thing is when I walk by someone,
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.080]   they're like, "Oh, I got tested for COVID.
[01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:09.960]   "I don't have it."
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:12.400]   Yeah, you didn't have it last week when you got tested.
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:13.880]   You would walk around now without a mask
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:15.920]   and you just got it from your sister's brother's cousin
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:17.800]   at the barbecue and boom, you got it,
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:19.400]   but you won't know for another two weeks.
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:22.240]   So that little token wouldn't even work because
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:24.080]   you're clear today and you went out
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:25.440]   and did all that willy-nilly stuff
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:26.280]   and now you got it tomorrow.
[01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:27.800]   So I mean, not that--
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:29.560]   - No, the way the token works, people say--
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:31.080]   - To be fair, the way the token works,
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:33.080]   everybody carries it, it's all the time.
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:35.720]   As soon as you test positive, you give them your token.
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:38.160]   It has in it everywhere you've been
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:40.120]   and everyone you've come into contact with,
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:42.040]   much like the Apple Google API,
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:43.480]   that then the health authorities can use
[01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:44.560]   to do contact tracing.
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:47.480]   The difference is it has names, addresses, and phone ups.
[01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:49.600]   In effect, it has the actual people
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:51.240]   so that they can call them and say,
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:54.920]   you were exposed, you need to quarantine as well.
[01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:58.840]   But nobody's going to do it, especially in the United States.
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:00.720]   If they're not doing it in Singapore,
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:03.560]   I can't imagine they're going to do it in the United States.
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:07.440]   - South Korea did have a lot of good results
[01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:09.800]   with contact tracing, but a lot of that earlier on,
[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:12.200]   a couple of months ago, there were some reports on it,
[01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:14.240]   but that was largely because the government
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:16.160]   was doing this very, very actively.
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:17.480]   People didn't have a choice about it.
[01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:18.320]   - No, they had to.
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:20.120]   - 'Cause people won't say no, they say no,
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:21.120]   I'm not going to tell you.
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:22.640]   No, you have to tell me.
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:25.640]   - We have a situation where Lo's Theater train is saying,
[01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:27.880]   oh, we're not going to force people to wear masks
[01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:29.120]   'cause we don't want to get in the middle
[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:30.320]   of a big political debate.
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:31.600]   - It's not political.
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:33.320]   We got some work to do.
[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:34.160]   - Yeah.
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:35.840]   - Okay.
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:38.480]   - Some people had as much passion about wearing masks
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:41.280]   and not wearing masks as they did about racial injustice
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:43.200]   and keeping people safe.
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:45.080]   We've been a better place.
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:47.560]   - Honestly, I think it's pretty clear at this point.
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:49.760]   And I just see it walking around Petaluma.
[01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:52.600]   There's only one way through this.
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:55.080]   That's just we're going to all get it.
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:56.920]   And good luck to you.
[01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:57.760]   Good luck.
[01:43:57.760 --> 01:43:59.080]   I hope you serve up.
[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:00.480]   You've heard people saying that, oh, well,
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:03.080]   I had it a few months ago, I'm pretty sure.
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:05.080]   That means I have antibodies and I can't get in.
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:06.520]   - You can hear that all the time.
[01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:08.320]   - Number one, no, that doesn't mean that.
[01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:09.760]   And number two, it still means that you could
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:10.680]   infect other people.
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:12.280]   So, okay.
[01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:13.120]   Good for you.
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:14.680]   - That's the thing is that you don't know
[01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:16.080]   if you can get it again.
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:17.520]   And they've been tested that some people
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:20.240]   that tested positive and had antibodies,
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:21.560]   no, no, no, I have the antibodies.
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:24.600]   So there's just so many things that are unknown.
[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:27.880]   And I think that the World Health Organization
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:29.600]   did a real disservice by first saying
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:31.160]   that masks did not help you.
[01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:32.960]   And they were doing it to protect the healthcare workers
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:35.120]   so that they could get enough masks for themselves.
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:37.520]   - They could have said homemade masks are okay.
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:38.920]   They really could have said that.
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:39.760]   They could have said that.
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:41.760]   In fact, in some countries, they did it
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:42.920]   and the Czech Republic they did.
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:47.320]   And there was a vast effort to make homemade masks
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:48.560]   and hand them out to everybody.
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:49.560]   And it was very effective.
[01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:51.400]   So it's possible.
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:55.480]   But it's a confluence of a variety of different things.
[01:44:55.480 --> 01:44:58.960]   And it doesn't look good.
[01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:00.280]   This is not a technology subject.
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:01.960]   It's hard not to think about it.
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:04.040]   - No, no, well, there's a technology subject in a way
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:06.200]   that this is a mistake that collectively
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:07.640]   we keep making over and over again
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:12.560]   to think that, oh, well, here is an academic idea
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:15.280]   in which we can use technology to solve this huge problem.
[01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:17.640]   And we're gonna have faith in the technology
[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:20.560]   as opposed to seeing how that's gonna play out
[01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:21.400]   in a real world.
[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:26.400]   I just bought an eBay at one of those one laptop per child
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:28.680]   laptops 'cause it's still a cool piece of design.
[01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:30.440]   - Oh, yeah, I have one, yeah.
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:31.640]   - Yeah, Nick, Nick, Never Ponti was saying,
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:33.920]   oh, well, here's how we solve education worldwide.
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:36.400]   We make really cheap $100 laptops
[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:38.600]   and governments will buy like a million of them
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:41.400]   and give a child their own laptop.
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:44.080]   And that was without actually checking
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:46.160]   with each of these individual regions saying,
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:47.680]   well, what is your biggest problem?
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:49.320]   And if they're telling them, well, our biggest problem
[01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:51.800]   is that we don't have enough trained teachers.
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:53.520]   Doesn't matter how many laptops you give out.
[01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:55.280]   If you don't have a teacher, you're gonna need that.
[01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:56.120]   - Good point.
[01:45:56.120 --> 01:45:57.080]   - And time and time again.
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:45:59.840]   So that's, academically, I think that's a great idea.
[01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:02.040]   Let's find a way so that when someone gets sick,
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:04.040]   we can find out who they're in contact with
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:07.160]   so we can contain that little nodule of spread.
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:11.160]   But nonetheless, trying to convince people
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:15.840]   that this is not going to weaken your personal privacy
[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:19.600]   is something that you have a responsibility to do.
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:21.800]   That means that this person is simply well informed
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:24.800]   on the risks of carrying around a phone with them
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:25.640]   wherever they go.
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:27.520]   And it might be an unsolvable problem.
[01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:29.200]   - Yeah, actually Google Maps does a better job
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:30.840]   of tracking you, honestly.
[01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:32.440]   (laughing)
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:33.280]   - And he saps.
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:35.800]   And most of us have location tracking turned on.
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:37.120]   So they didn't--
[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:40.080]   - Like if they could, sorry.
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:43.600]   - A couple months ago, Google released this,
[01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:45.360]   actually a very, very powerful tool,
[01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:49.400]   which is a data tool for local governments to say,
[01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:53.320]   here is the statistics for the people in your community,
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:55.080]   how much time they're spending at
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:56.840]   in public transportation areas,
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:46:59.040]   how much time they're spending in grocery stores,
[01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:01.000]   how much time they're spending in recreational areas,
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.640]   which allows the community organizers to find out,
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:05.440]   okay, well, we've told people,
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:07.320]   please don't go to the beaches
[01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:10.080]   because that's where, and people are not following
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:12.440]   those things so we need to step up enforcement there.
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:14.000]   What they're not saying is,
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000]   please don't ask us how we know that
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.000]   8% more people are coming to this supermarket now.
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:19.840]   (laughing)
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:20.680]   - What, that before Corona came?
[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:21.800]   - Oh, by the way, we do know that.
[01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:24.440]   - Well, you're gonna say Georgia, go ahead.
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:26.920]   - Oh, my thing is just that I wish that they would,
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:29.800]   we used our tech to be able to increase the amount
[01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:30.880]   of people that were tested,
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:32.520]   because if we could do mass testing,
[01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:34.960]   and we knew everyone that at the moment has it,
[01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:36.680]   then we could deal with really isolating
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:38.520]   instead of dealing with something that's two weeks,
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:39.520]   too late.
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:40.360]   - True.
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:42.160]   - And so we're always playing catch up,
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:45.040]   and it is costly, but I think that it's something
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:46.480]   that would end the end save us,
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:49.040]   and I think that people are more important
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:51.800]   than the government making as much profit as they can.
[01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:52.640]   - Well, it was so fun.
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:53.480]   - It was so fun.
[01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:54.480]   - It was some blame to the scientific community,
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:57.920]   because there's been such a rush to publish
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:00.720]   that there's been a lot of conflicting information
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:03.120]   flowing out of the epidemiological
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:04.960]   and scientific and health communities,
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:07.640]   and that's confusing to us,
[01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:09.360]   because we hear a variety of things.
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:13.320]   I thought a wonderful paper
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:16.400]   in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:19.440]   published, it looked like it was peer reviewed,
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:20.640]   it said it was peer reviewed,
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:22.920]   published by a Nobel laureate,
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:27.920]   chemist, saying that not only is it pretty clear
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:32.160]   at this point that aerosolized COVID-19
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:34.840]   is the predominant way of infection,
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:36.200]   and in a particularly virulent form,
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:37.600]   because it goes right near lungs,
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:40.920]   but that masks above all other mitigations work,
[01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:43.760]   not that you shouldn't social distance and wash your hands,
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:45.400]   but everybody should wear a mask,
[01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:47.080]   and if everybody did it would work.
[01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:49.200]   And I thought this was so good, I blogged about it,
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:50.840]   I thought this is a great paper.
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:52.520]   Today in the New York Times,
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:55.760]   it turns out a bunch of scientists are asking the NAS
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:58.200]   to retract the article,
[01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:00.160]   because yes, it's peer reviewed,
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:03.400]   but it was peer reviewed in a fashion that isn't very good.
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:06.880]   The peer reviewers were selected by the studies authors,
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:09.280]   and a number of scientists now saying,
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:13.760]   the assertions in this article are over the top
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:16.080]   and not supported by science.
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:18.040]   And when that happens,
[01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:21.400]   and I think I'm fairly literate
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:24.040]   in consuming scientific literature,
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:26.880]   that really undermines the whole damn thing.
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:30.000]   It's like, okay, if you're gonna publish that NAS
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.360]   and you're very respected and you say it's peer reviewed,
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:34.480]   and the guy who wrote it's a Nobel laureate,
[01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:37.040]   and now it's not true,
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:40.880]   oi, so, and the other problem is now it goes the other direction,
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:43.560]   people are gonna say, see that mask thing, it's not true,
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:45.400]   which is not true either.
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:46.960]   So this is part of the problem where--
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:47.800]   - But that's the cool thing with science, right?
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:48.640]   - Why agree?
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:51.720]   - It is, but it has to be replicated,
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:52.720]   and we consider it-- - It takes the time,
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:54.080]   it takes time actually. - Yes.
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:55.400]   - But we ask that question of,
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:57.880]   listen, this doesn't deal with the scientific rigor.
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:00.000]   Someone else comes out and says,
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.640]   pull this, it doesn't stand up to scientific rigor.
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:04.520]   - Yes, we're watching the process play out.
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:09.200]   - The responsibility versus just this diatribe
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:12.200]   that anyone with a computer can send out
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:15.560]   a false peer review that seemed looks really good,
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:16.560]   and it is-- - Well, there's also
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:18.160]   been a problem with a lot of papers published
[01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:21.360]   without peer review preprints, they call them.
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:24.080]   And so I thought I was being smart.
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:25.600]   I was saying, well, this is not a preprint,
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:28.360]   this is peer reviewed from a prestigious journal,
[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:31.400]   and even then, apparently, I was fooled.
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:34.280]   So I don't know.
[01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:35.760]   I think that's part of the problem, too,
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:38.840]   is scientific method does not work in the way
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:42.600]   that helps us be certain about what we need to do.
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:44.360]   That's where leadership makes a difference.
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:47.360]   That's where, unfortunately, a gutted CDC
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:50.200]   is no help at all, because we don't have
[01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:53.840]   the kind of leadership that can assess all this material
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:56.760]   and then give us clear instructions one way or the other.
[01:50:56.760 --> 01:50:58.240]   It's all just a mess.
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:01.920]   And that's too bad, because it's just going to make a sicker.
[01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:04.640]   Let's take a little bit of a break on that light
[01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:05.760]   and happy note.
[01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:10.080]   What are you going to cook, brisket, shoulder, or pork?
[01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:10.920]   A little pulled pork.
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:11.760]   How do you pull the pork?
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:15.680]   You take a pork shoulder, you smoke it for a long, long time.
[01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:19.680]   - Yeah, then what? - And you put it in a cooler,
[01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:21.080]   you let it rest for an hour.
[01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:22.600]   - Okay. - You take it out.
[01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:24.200]   You have some nice rubber gloves,
[01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:26.800]   and you just dig into that thing that bursts open
[01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:29.880]   and it juices some flavor, it just ignites your life.
[01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:31.080]   It's an exciting thing.
[01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:33.960]   - So you're not saying, I don't have to pull that hard,
[01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:35.360]   is what you're saying.
[01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:37.120]   - You ain't, let me tell you something.
[01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:37.960]   You nudge it.
[01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:41.320]   - And at first, it's no, nudge the pork is what it really is.
[01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:43.600]   - We're going to have a Twitter after dark smoke off,
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:45.280]   brother, I'm just saying. - I think so.
[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:47.200]   And I understand there is somebody in the chat room
[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:49.840]   and Mr. A. - The modern man.
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:51.200]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:53.040]   (laughing)
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:56.600]   - It prues as in that bone just slides out, it's beautiful.
[01:51:56.880 --> 01:51:58.800]   - Oh yeah.
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:00.200]   - I'm so excited.
[01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:01.800]   It's all right.
[01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:03.760]   - Our show today, bro.
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:05.320]   Would you like a little wasabi with that?
[01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:07.240]   Our show today brought to you by wasabi,
[01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:11.880]   not the hot sauce, wasabi, hot cloud storage.
[01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:15.320]   If you're collecting data in your enterprise,
[01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:17.040]   you're probably collecting it so fast,
[01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:19.640]   you're buying more storage all the time,
[01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:21.760]   more on-prem storage all the time.
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:23.640]   I was talking to wasabi CEO David Friend,
[01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:25.480]   good friend, I've known for a long time.
[01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:27.600]   David was telling me about a Boston high rise
[01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:30.880]   that bought security cameras, this is some months ago,
[01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:33.840]   and didn't really think about the fact
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:36.600]   that these security cameras are recording megabytes
[01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:38.160]   of content every minute,
[01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:41.240]   that they would be buying new hard drives every month,
[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:43.560]   and it was starting to really add up.
[01:52:43.560 --> 01:52:46.240]   And David said, you should store it in the cloud.
[01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:51.200]   It's a, frankly, it's a no-brainer for most people.
[01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:53.040]   And of course, I'll tell you what some of the objections are.
[01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:54.200]   Oh, it's not secure.
[01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:57.640]   In most cases, wasabi on a hot cloud storage
[01:52:57.640 --> 01:53:01.480]   is more secure than your on-prem storage.
[01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:03.280]   Oh, well, it's more expensive.
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:06.960]   No, in fact, in most cases, it's so inexpensive,
[01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:09.960]   at least wasabi is, you're thinking to those other guys,
[01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:12.360]   wasabi's 80% cheaper than Amazon S3.
[01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:15.120]   It's so inexpensive, you can typically store data
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:19.320]   in wasabi's cloud for less than just the maintenance fees,
[01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:22.600]   the maintenance fees on the on-prem storage.
[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:25.600]   We're not even the storage, just the maintenance fees.
[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:29.720]   Wasabi is really remarkable, and it's going to solve,
[01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:34.720]   it's going to solve your problem with needing more storage.
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:37.000]   Wasabi is brilliant.
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:40.800]   They've devised a way to make enterprise-grade cloud storage
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:43.120]   a fifth price of Amazon S3,
[01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:47.440]   as much as six times faster,
[01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:50.440]   and more durable, 11 nines of durability.
[01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:54.560]   On average, you'd lose one file every 649,000 years.
[01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:57.800]   That compared to that, can you say that about your San? No.
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:54:00.600]   It's hosted in premier tier four data center facilities
[01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:03.000]   that are not only highly secure, but fully redundant,
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.800]   and they do active integrity checking.
[01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:09.240]   Every object stored in wasabi is checked every 90 days.
[01:54:09.240 --> 01:54:10.920]   So if there's ever an issue,
[01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:12.520]   they've got a copy somewhere else,
[01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:14.680]   and another tier four center, they can copy it over.
[01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:17.520]   That's why your data is absolutely safe,
[01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:20.120]   and secure all data stored in the cloud
[01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:22.160]   that wasabi is always encrypted at rest,
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:24.520]   even if you don't specify encryption.
[01:54:24.520 --> 01:54:28.280]   They follow all the best models of security and design.
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:30.240]   There's things like access control mechanisms,
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:34.200]   like bucket policies, access control lists.
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:36.640]   So you, and by the way, the best part, I love this,
[01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:40.280]   you can select your data, some data are all to be immutable.
[01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:42.440]   Means it cannot be erased or altered.
[01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:44.560]   It cannot be erased or altered.
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:47.400]   Malware can't get to it, hackers can't get to it.
[01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:51.720]   Your fumble-fingered nephew in accounting can't get to it.
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:52.640]   That's awesome.
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:56.280]   Hippo compliant, CJIS compliant, and so affordable.
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:58.120]   Now there's two ways to pay.
[01:54:58.120 --> 01:54:59.960]   You could pay as you go, very simple,
[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:02.440]   a very affordable price, but if you know,
[01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:03.880]   if you're like that high rise,
[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:05.360]   and you know exactly how much storage
[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:07.280]   you're gonna need every week, month, and year,
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:08.760]   you can reserve capacity.
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:13.680]   Wasabi's reserve capacity storage means you buy ahead.
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:15.400]   For one, three, or five years,
[01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:17.480]   you get greater discounts, the longer the term,
[01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:21.080]   the greater the capacity, you're gonna save even more.
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:23.480]   I just think this is a no-brainer.
[01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:26.640]   The only problem is the name wasabi.
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:31.040]   Everybody's heard of S3, an Azure, and Google Cloud.
[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:31.960]   Nobody's heard of wasabi.
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:33.520]   That's why I wanna tell you about it.
[01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:35.640]   Why I'm a big believer in wasabi.
[01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:38.520]   It's highly secure disruptive technology
[01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:40.860]   that's turning the industry on its ear.
[01:55:40.860 --> 01:55:44.920]   80% cheaper, up to six times faster than the industry leader.
[01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:47.400]   When you go to the boss and you say,
[01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:49.440]   "Look, we gotta do this.
[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:51.520]   "Let's stop the insanity.
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:53.600]   "Let's stop buying on-prem storage.
[01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:56.840]   "Let's move to the cloud, and I've got the best way to do it."
[01:55:56.840 --> 01:55:59.120]   You wanna try it, go to wasabi.com.
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:00.640]   Click the free trial link out of the code,
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:05.640]   "TwitWASABI.COM."
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:09.840]   On the front page, there's a picture of Nate,
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:13.320]   director of IT being squished by on-prem storage.
[01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:18.920]   You gotta, for many of you, the time to move the cloud has come.
[01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:23.000]   And next generation cloud storage is here, wasabi.
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.920]   Try it free for a full month wasabi.com,
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:28.360]   use the offer code, "Twit."
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:30.600]   And it's good idea to try it because you can try,
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:33.040]   for instance, they support the Amazon API
[01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:34.800]   so you can try your Amazon S3 tools.
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:36.720]   They all work, and unlike Amazon,
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:38.360]   they don't charge for egress,
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:40.400]   and they don't charge for API access.
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:42.200]   So that's another one.
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:44.640]   I have to say, you know, you,
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:46.360]   "Oh, S3, that's great, I'm gonna put everything up there."
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:48.600]   And then you find out you have to pay to get it back,
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:52.440]   not with wasabi, no fee for egress, no fee for API access.
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:54.920]   It's really a good deal, wasabi.com.
[01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:56.520]   Use the offer code, "TwitWASABI.COM."
[01:56:56.520 --> 01:56:57.880]   Twit, if you would.
[01:56:57.880 --> 01:57:00.360]   Okay, we can, let's see,
[01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:05.360]   let's wrap this up with a few great, quick, fast hits.
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:08.600]   Oh, this is nice.
[01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:12.920]   I fix it as posted repair manuals for ventilators.
[01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:17.240]   And last week, we received a letter saying,
[01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:18.920]   "Copy right infringement.
[01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:23.920]   "You cannot tell people how to fix our ventilators.
[01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:28.760]   "Stairs Corporation," which makes sterilization
[01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:31.200]   and other medical equipment, is "Come to my attention.
[01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:33.040]   "You have been reproducing certain installation
[01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:35.200]   "and maintenance manuals relating to our products.
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:38.240]   "Documentation which is protected by copyright law.
[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:41.960]   "You may not let those people have this information."
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:47.960]   You know, there comes a time when the right to repair movement
[01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:50.960]   becomes about more than just hitting your iPhone fixed.
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:53.960]   It comes, it's about saving lives.
[01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:57.960]   And it's kind of shocking that a company that claims to be,
[01:57:57.960 --> 01:58:00.960]   you know, saving lives of their medical devices
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:05.960]   would be putting DRM, which they do on their ventilators.
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:13.960]   Kyle Wien's fighting the good fight on that one.
[01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:14.960]   Okay, you guys have nothing to say,
[01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:17.960]   except I know that means you're agreeing with me.
[01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:20.960]   Oh, they're muted.
[01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:21.960]   What the hell?
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:24.960]   Actually, let's just do the rest of the show that way.
[01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:26.960]   That works so well.
[01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:28.960]   Story number two.
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:31.960]   You did make a perfect case that absolutely nobody could
[01:58:31.960 --> 01:58:34.960]   possibly have contributed to much less as a great mess.
[01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:36.960]   Sir.
[01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:39.960]   Let him let them actually go ahead with this.
[01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:42.960]   Like who didn't say like, you know what, maybe now is not the time.
[01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:43.960]   Unbelievable.
[01:58:43.960 --> 01:58:45.960]   Well, they're clearly tone deaf.
[01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:46.960]   You know, you did a later if you want to.
[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:50.960]   Like, yeah, just, you have to think that whoever's, you know,
[01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:52.960]   some people need handlers.
[01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:53.960]   That's okay.
[01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:54.960]   Yeah, they're clearly tone deaf.
[01:58:54.960 --> 01:58:59.960]   And the reason I mention this, I hope that this is a black mark
[01:58:59.960 --> 01:59:01.960]   on this company, Starris.
[01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:04.960]   Kyle Wien says, "We explained to them that what we did is lawful
[01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:07.960]   and in protective fear use under the Copyright Act.
[01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:11.960]   No manufacturer should be stopping hospitals from repairing
[01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:12.960]   their equipment.
[01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:15.960]   The best way to ensure patient safety, says Kyle Wien's,
[01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:18.960]   "Love you, Kyle," is to make sure equipment is being maintained
[01:59:18.960 --> 01:59:21.960]   regularly using the manufacturer's recommended procedures.
[01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:25.960]   The only way to do that is if hospitals have up-to-date manuals.
[01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:30.960]   By the way, I fix it, has not removed any material from its website.
[01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:31.960]   Yeah.
[01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:32.960]   Awesome.
[01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:35.960]   They've also collected and distributed, what was the number,
[01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:38.960]   thousands of different repair, technical manuals and repair manuals
[01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:39.960]   for medical information?
[01:59:39.960 --> 01:59:40.960]   Yeah.
[01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:41.960]   Yeah.
[01:59:41.960 --> 01:59:45.960]   This is a, it gets, it gets beyond these industries being just
[01:59:45.960 --> 01:59:49.960]   horrible people, corporate people, and into actual danger.
[01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:52.960]   It was bad enough when they're saying that no farmers who
[01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:56.960]   for hundreds and hundreds of years, just as a, as a cult, have a culture
[01:59:56.960 --> 01:59:59.960]   of whatever's broken, will fix it on site because we can't afford to
[01:59:59.960 --> 02:00:02.960]   have our machine and read down for single day.
[02:00:02.960 --> 02:00:04.960]   When the equipment manufacturers are saying, no, we're not going to
[02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:06.960]   let you fix your own engines.
[02:00:06.960 --> 02:00:08.960]   We're not going to allow you to create a cable to hook up one part
[02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:11.960]   to another because those cables are copyrighted.
[02:00:11.960 --> 02:00:15.960]   That is a situation that's way out of hand and is, almost requires
[02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:17.960]   an emotional disruption.
[02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:18.960]   Yeah.
[02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:22.960]   I don't know, what do you think about this, Laurie, at Laurie?
[02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:23.960]   Keep calling you Laurie.
[02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:24.960]   Georgia.
[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:25.960]   I know you're Georgia.
[02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:27.960]   Not Laurie Grill.
[02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:29.960]   [laughter]
[02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:30.960]   Not Owen.
[02:00:30.960 --> 02:00:31.960]   I don't have a cool pink hair.
[02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:33.960]   Not Owen Pizza Stone.
[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:34.960]   You're Georgia.
[02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:38.960]   I got to come up with a quick, with a grilling name for you.
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:40.960]   You're Georgia.
[02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:42.960]   Georgia sizzle down.
[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:44.960]   Georgia sizzle down.
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:52.960]   The FDA just approved the first prescription video game for kids
[02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:53.960]   with ADHD.
[02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:55.960]   Did you know about this?
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:57.960]   I didn't know about this.
[02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:00.960]   Georgia, you work with ADHD kids, right?
[02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:01.960]   I do.
[02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:08.960]   It's called Endeavor-Rx from a Keeley Interactive, formerly
[02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:10.960]   Project Evo.
[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:14.960]   It's prescribed as medicine for the kids between the ages of 8 and
[02:01:14.960 --> 02:01:15.960]   12 with ADHD.
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:17.960]   It's an iPhone or iPad game.
[02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:23.960]   Seven years of clinical trials, 600 kids figuring out whether
[02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:26.960]   this game could actually make a difference.
[02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:27.960]   The answer is yes.
[02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:30.960]   One-thirds of kids treated with this game no longer had a
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:34.960]   measurable attention deficit on at least one measure of objective
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:38.960]   attention after playing the game for 25 minutes a day, five days
[02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:40.960]   a week for four weeks.
[02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:45.960]   The only thing I have to ask is that kids with ADHD usually are
[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:48.960]   very good and have a lot of good attention when they play the
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:49.960]   video games.
[02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:50.960]   They're focused.
[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:51.960]   They're interested in something.
[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:53.960]   They also have a good amount of focus.
[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:54.960]   They can actually be hyper-focused.
[02:01:54.960 --> 02:01:55.960]   That's what I did.
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:01:56.960]   Yes.
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:00.960]   I just don't -- and again, I'm intrigued by it and I think that
[02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:04.960]   that would be wonderful if it could help them on a separate area.
[02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:07.960]   But I wonder if it is and if it's that area.
[02:02:07.960 --> 02:02:11.960]   If it's that area, I don't know if it would be as usable to being
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:12.960]   bored.
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:14.960]   Our school system has to be overhauled.
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:17.960]   It hasn't really changed in a very long time.
[02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:18.960]   It's dull.
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:21.960]   To be able to sit there and just listen to someone maybe perhaps
[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:25.960]   praddling on about something which sometimes can happen or they're
[02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:27.960]   not being able to move around.
[02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:29.960]   I don't know if that would be as helpful.
[02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:31.960]   But I'm going to look it up and see.
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:32.960]   Yeah.
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:35.960]   I mean, and there's also the issue of if it takes six years to
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:39.960]   approve it, by then the technology is antiquated.
[02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:40.960]   Yeah.
[02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:44.960]   I mean, I'm a little surprised because the FDA does have a fast
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:48.960]   track system acknowledging that technology can move faster than
[02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:49.960]   the approvals process.
[02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:52.960]   On the other hand, I'm glad to see that this is getting actual
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:58.960]   scrutiny as opposed to other solutions for ADHD and other
[02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:02.960]   syndromes that simply say, well, this sounds like it makes good
[02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:03.960]   sense.
[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:07.960]   There was a very, very popular set of fonts that are supposedly
[02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:08.960]   good for people.
[02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:10.960]   I think it was for dyslexia.
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:11.960]   Dyslexia.
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:15.960]   But then if I recall correctly, subsequent follow-up studies
[02:03:15.960 --> 02:03:20.960]   didn't show any real improvement beyond dyslexia as well.
[02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:25.960]   If it's bottom heavy fonts, and so I am a little bit dyslexic,
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:27.960]   mostly with numbers and names of things.
[02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:30.960]   If you ask me a name of something, I won't know.
[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:32.960]   But I don't flip my letters.
[02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:34.960]   I can't really spell.
[02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:38.960]   So I, and I don't know if this was self-prescribing, but when I
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:42.960]   was a teenager and I definitely was ADD, maybe ADHD, but mostly
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:47.960]   ADD, I started playing chess and I had that hyper focus, which
[02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:50.960]   allowed me to sit and stare at a chessboard for four and five
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:52.960]   hours for long tournament games.
[02:03:52.960 --> 02:03:54.960]   And it was quite successful.
[02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:55.960]   I think it helped me a lot.
[02:03:55.960 --> 02:03:59.960]   But chess would be, I think that would be very effective because
[02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:00.960]   you have to be calm.
[02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:02.960]   You have to be paying attention.
[02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:04.960]   You have to pay attention to the other person.
[02:04:04.960 --> 02:04:08.960]   I, and I know that neurofeedback, so they do neurofeedback
[02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:10.960]   where they, they, you're not kind of hooked up to electrodes.
[02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:13.960]   And when you're working on being calm, you know, there's a
[02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:14.960]   plane.
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:16.960]   It's a video game and there's a plane that's kind of, there's
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:19.960]   a plane that you try to move up and down depending on your
[02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:22.960]   brainwaves and you're working on becoming focused, becoming
[02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:25.960]   relaxed, being able to calm your mind down in when it does the
[02:04:25.960 --> 02:04:27.960]   plane fly straight.
[02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:29.960]   And so that helps build up that part of your brain.
[02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:33.960]   Doing anything that's kind of slower paced can also help that.
[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:36.960]   And so maybe they're working on something that is similar to
[02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:37.960]   that.
[02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:40.960]   It looks like a traditional switch game, to be honest with you.
[02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:41.960]   I like the thing.
[02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:42.960]   Drug-related.
[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:43.960]   Yeah, I agree.
[02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:44.960]   Let's not drug them.
[02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:47.960]   I mean, it's something to try and we'll see what's going on.
[02:04:47.960 --> 02:04:49.960]   I mean, we're talking about the scrutiny.
[02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:51.960]   I feel like they just fast-track pills to pop in people's
[02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:55.960]   mouths like it's nobody's business and things like this will
[02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:56.960]   get more scrutiny on it.
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:58.960]   But I mean, again, I'm just having an effort.
[02:04:58.960 --> 02:05:02.960]   If it works out great, if it doesn't, no harm, no fail.
[02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:03.960]   I don't know.
[02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:04.960]   That's not thinking up chess.
[02:05:04.960 --> 02:05:05.960]   It's a great chess.
[02:05:05.960 --> 02:05:07.960]   And the thing is, it wasn't playing speed chess.
[02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:10.960]   I was playing tournament chess, which meant literally it's two
[02:05:10.960 --> 02:05:12.960]   and a half hours per person per game.
[02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:13.960]   So it's a long time.
[02:05:13.960 --> 02:05:16.960]   And the other thing it taught me is impulse control because you're
[02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:20.960]   going to lose real fast if you can't sit on your hands and make
[02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:22.960]   sure that that's the right move.
[02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:25.960]   Is that where you got the essence with that picture that I showed
[02:05:25.960 --> 02:05:26.960]   for your basis?
[02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:27.960]   That's me playing chess right there.
[02:05:27.960 --> 02:05:28.960]   You look very zen.
[02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:30.960]   You just look really zen though, the picture.
[02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:33.960]   I'm playing chess right there, as a matter of fact.
[02:05:33.960 --> 02:05:36.960]   You practice for Twit and three-hour episodes as a child.
[02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:37.960]   Yeah, these long episodes.
[02:05:37.960 --> 02:05:39.960]   These are short for me.
[02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:45.960]   When I work with kids that are ADD or ADHD, I often do focusing
[02:05:45.960 --> 02:05:48.960]   exercises where you have to sit still like a statute.
[02:05:48.960 --> 02:05:49.960]   It's good for everyone, actually.
[02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:50.960]   It increases everyone's focus.
[02:05:50.960 --> 02:05:52.960]   And you have to do your breathing and you can't breathe,
[02:05:52.960 --> 02:05:53.960]   but you have to stay still.
[02:05:53.960 --> 02:05:56.960]   And we just work on staying still while I try to make funny
[02:05:56.960 --> 02:05:57.960]   noises or poke them.
[02:05:57.960 --> 02:05:58.960]   Oh, that's fun.
[02:05:58.960 --> 02:06:01.960]   That they have to be able to be controlled.
[02:06:01.960 --> 02:06:04.960]   And then we play another game that I call Ninja.
[02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:06.960]   And I know Owen, as we spoke about, ninjas are awesome.
[02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:09.960]   Play game Ninja where you have to move very slowly to be able to
[02:06:09.960 --> 02:06:12.960]   grab the treasure and you can't make any noise.
[02:06:12.960 --> 02:06:14.960]   And if you noise, I am the samurai novel coming around and I will
[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:15.960]   see you.
[02:06:15.960 --> 02:06:17.960]   And then we send you back to the beginning.
[02:06:17.960 --> 02:06:19.960]   And so it works on that self-control.
[02:06:19.960 --> 02:06:22.960]   And so those kind of things are very helpful if you have a
[02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:26.960]   child or you yourself are dealing with ADHD to be able to
[02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:30.960]   increase that ability to stretch out your concentration when
[02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:34.960]   you're not really as interested in what you're dealing with.
[02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:36.960]   That sounds like a good treatment.
[02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:39.960]   The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences will help me
[02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:43.960]   with my impulse control about watching the Oscars.
[02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:45.960]   They're delaying it two months.
[02:06:45.960 --> 02:06:47.960]   I'll have to sit on my hands.
[02:06:47.960 --> 02:06:49.960]   It normally comes in what January or February?
[02:06:49.960 --> 02:06:52.960]   February or yeah, it's not going to be to April or May.
[02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:55.960]   In fact, they don't know how they're going to do it, but they
[02:06:55.960 --> 02:07:00.960]   just figure, well, let's instead of February 28th, how about April 25th?
[02:07:00.960 --> 02:07:04.960]   Part of that is also to extend to the eligibility time, right?
[02:07:04.960 --> 02:07:07.960]   Because I don't think anybody's going back to the theaters anytime
[02:07:07.960 --> 02:07:08.960]   soon.
[02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:10.960]   Yeah, they open up.
[02:07:10.960 --> 02:07:11.960]   So I don't know what that's about.
[02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:13.960]   Yeah, Andy was saying Lowe's is opening up.
[02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:16.960]   So that's, you know, I don't know, like half capacity.
[02:07:16.960 --> 02:07:17.960]   I don't know.
[02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:18.960]   Movie theater.
[02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:19.960]   Are you crazy?
[02:07:19.960 --> 02:07:23.960]   Yeah, that's what they've also softened up the eligibility
[02:07:23.960 --> 02:07:26.960]   requirements so that you no longer have to have a run and
[02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:29.960]   approve theaters in New York, Los Angeles.
[02:07:29.960 --> 02:07:34.960]   Now streaming first titles are going to be where that was a fun
[02:07:34.960 --> 02:07:37.960]   moment though, a couple months ago when we were realizing that,
[02:07:37.960 --> 02:07:40.960]   well, now the only movies that technically will have qualified
[02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:44.960]   for Oscar consideration this year are stuff that opened before
[02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:47.960]   like March 8th, which is usually the dumping ground.
[02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:48.960]   That's the worst movie.
[02:07:48.960 --> 02:07:49.960]   Yeah.
[02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:52.960]   Wouldn't it be great if the Harley Quinn movie was suddenly like
[02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:54.960]   up for Best Picture?
[02:07:54.960 --> 02:07:57.960]   We have to go through all the movies that came out in the
[02:07:57.960 --> 02:08:02.960]   first three months and put our list, our nominations together.
[02:08:02.960 --> 02:08:05.960]   Suddenly lifetime movies are.
[02:08:05.960 --> 02:08:06.960]   Wow.
[02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:10.960]   And for Best Actress Meredith Baxter Bernie in My Child, My
[02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:13.960]   Child, What Have You Done With My Child on the Internet?
[02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:16.960]   And if you were thinking you were going to use the Disney Plus
[02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:20.960]   free trial to watch Hamilton when it comes out July 3rd, no, you
[02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:22.960]   got to pay to be in that room where it happens.
[02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:25.960]   They are now just continuing their free trials knowing perfectly
[02:08:25.960 --> 02:08:30.960]   well that you Hamilton fans would do anything to see it for free.
[02:08:30.960 --> 02:08:34.960]   So you might, or just weeks away, I'm excited July 3rd.
[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:36.960]   I'm going to lock myself in.
[02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:38.960]   I'm going to watch it for the 50th time.
[02:08:38.960 --> 02:08:41.960]   I'm excited about it.
[02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:42.960]   Are you a Hamilton fan?
[02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:43.960]   I'm not.
[02:08:43.960 --> 02:08:44.960]   We discussed this before.
[02:08:44.960 --> 02:08:46.960]   I remember this.
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:47.960]   That's what I thought.
[02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:48.960]   Yeah.
[02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:49.960]   You hate it.
[02:08:49.960 --> 02:08:51.960]   I didn't hate it.
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:53.960]   I just have no opinion.
[02:08:53.960 --> 02:08:56.960]   He was very quiet when we played over and over again.
[02:08:56.960 --> 02:08:57.960]   I know.
[02:08:57.960 --> 02:08:58.960]   He's like so bored.
[02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:00.960]   I bet I know what he wants.
[02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:07.960]   I bet you I could trade you your fine new grill for the Boston
[02:09:07.960 --> 02:09:14.960]   Dynamics Spot Robot now available for $74,500.
[02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:15.960]   Would you like?
[02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:17.960]   You probably would, but that would be because he would be selling
[02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:19.960]   it to get a whole better grill.
[02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:22.960]   You get 10 good grills for that.
[02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:24.960]   Isn't that called the Leo Dog?
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:25.960]   The Leo Dog.
[02:09:25.960 --> 02:09:26.960]   The Leo Dog.
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:27.960]   High precision motor control.
[02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:28.960]   I actually have one in my--
[02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:30.960]   Is that money not controlling your yard?
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:32.960]   It's so scary.
[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:34.960]   This is the robot that climbs stairs.
[02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:35.960]   It dances.
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:39.960]   You can kick it and it won't kick you back until later.
[02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:43.960]   And notice it will also sleep on your office floor.
[02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:45.960]   No one would break into your house.
[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:46.960]   Oh man.
[02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:48.960]   I noticed I have one in my shopping cart right now.
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:50.960]   What's the tip?
[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:51.960]   Yeah.
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:52.960]   How much?
[02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:53.960]   From Tuesday.
[02:09:53.960 --> 02:09:54.960]   $75,000.
[02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:58.960]   I only have to give him $1,000 now.
[02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:02.960]   Leo, can we split it and then do a time share with the dog?
[02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:05.960]   I'll tell you what.
[02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:08.960]   I don't want to jinx anything, but I sent an email asking for a
[02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:09.960]   30-day press loner.
[02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:10.960]   Oh.
[02:10:10.960 --> 02:10:14.960]   And if I do get one, and you can get yourself out here to New
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:15.960]   England.
[02:10:15.960 --> 02:10:16.960]   Can I ride it?
[02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:18.960]   I'll let you play with my spot.
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:20.960]   I've got-- there's no cows in the road.
[02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:22.960]   I'll be up there in two hours.
[02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:25.960]   [laughter]
[02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:26.960]   We will--
[02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:28.960]   The funny part is it doesn't do anything really, right?
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:31.960]   It's just for like patrolling or entertainment.
[02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:32.960]   Although it's a platform.
[02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:33.960]   It's a platform.
[02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:34.960]   It's a platform.
[02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:35.960]   It's like Lego.
[02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:36.960]   It is what you want it to be.
[02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:39.960]   If you want it to be a devil dog that kills upon your
[02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:42.960]   mirror's whim or just brings you a beer, it's all up to you
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:43.960]   in your sense of morality.
[02:10:43.960 --> 02:10:44.960]   Good luck to everybody.
[02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:47.960]   Georgia-- Georgia, I call Georgia my "Twitway."
[02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:49.960]   You just sound like a wife just now.
[02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:51.960]   Don't tell me what it doesn't do that I don't need it.
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:52.960]   Just support my drink.
[02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:54.960]   [laughter]
[02:10:54.960 --> 02:10:58.960]   I'd use my knees and I need this dog to protect his house.
[02:10:58.960 --> 02:10:59.960]   That's why our family doesn't--
[02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:00.960]   Oh, what are you going to do with that?
[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:02.960]   You know it doesn't do anything.
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:03.960]   What would you do with that?
[02:11:03.960 --> 02:11:06.960]   It's just another one of those things going to end up in the
[02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:09.960]   garage and I'm going to have to clean it up later.
[02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:11.960]   Wouldn't you go walking with it just next to you?
[02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:12.960]   Like that would be--
[02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:13.960]   Oh, yeah.
[02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:16.960]   I would take a run with this just for like--
[02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:19.960]   Rocky, I always wanted to have a robot friend, right?
[02:11:19.960 --> 02:11:20.960]   Put the dog back on the screen.
[02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:21.960]   Come here.
[02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:22.960]   You want to see the dog?
[02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:23.960]   All right, wait a minute, hold on.
[02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:24.960]   Put the dog back.
[02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:25.960]   I'm looking at Flash right now.
[02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:26.960]   Here, Boston.
[02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:27.960]   See, Dynamics.
[02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:29.960]   Ooh, that's a good name for it.
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:30.960]   Flash.
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:31.960]   Flash.
[02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:32.960]   If you want Flash--
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:33.960]   Flash.
[02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:34.960]   The robot dog.
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:36.960]   You want to see the robot dog?
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:37.960]   Here it is in the rain.
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:39.960]   So, it's waterproof.
[02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:40.960]   You see a movie.
[02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:41.960]   Watch it move.
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:42.960]   It's so good.
[02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:43.960]   It's so scary.
[02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:44.960]   Look at that.
[02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:45.960]   Oh, that's a--
[02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:46.960]   Wait a minute, let me turn on the sound.
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:48.960]   You got to hear the sound too.
[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:49.960]   This thing--
[02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:50.960]   What does it do?
[02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:51.960]   Oh, they're not--
[02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:52.960]   They're not letting--
[02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:53.960]   It puts--
[02:11:53.960 --> 02:11:54.960]   It starts--
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:55.960]   90 minutes on a charge.
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:11:56.960]   Look at that.
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:11:57.960]   It opens doors too.
[02:11:57.960 --> 02:11:59.960]   It could do anything.
[02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:01.960]   Place jazz music.
[02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:02.960]   What is that?
[02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:03.960]   Dance it.
[02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:04.960]   It does dance.
[02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:05.960]   Look at that.
[02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:07.960]   That's unnecessary.
[02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:09.960]   Where do you have to go?
[02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:10.960]   Oh!
[02:12:10.960 --> 02:12:12.960]   Unnestary, I already have a dog.
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:13.960]   Is he?
[02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:15.960]   No, but this dog doesn't poop.
[02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:17.960]   Yeah, you don't have to clean up after this dog.
[02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:18.960]   But you have to plug it in.
[02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:20.960]   This one, you have to plug in.
[02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:21.960]   Look at this.
[02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:22.960]   What about that, Alia?
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:23.960]   Oh, terrifying.
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:25.960]   Well, you can train a dog to open a door too.
[02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:26.960]   But I don't hear that.
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:27.960]   I don't want to hear any kind of--
[02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:29.960]   I don't want to hear comments such as freezing.
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:30.960]   I want this dog.
[02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:31.960]   I want it too.
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:36.960]   It's not like we're going to give a little four to send the kid to college at 18 years anyway.
[02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:38.960]   It's got to be like 80 million dollars.
[02:12:38.960 --> 02:12:43.960]   When she learned a lot more by learning how to outrun this dog.
[02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:45.960]   All right, last story of the week.
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:46.960]   I teased it.
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:50.960]   Flash finally dies December 31st, 2020.
[02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:52.960]   I don't mean they're not going to ship it.
[02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:54.960]   I don't mean you can't download it.
[02:12:54.960 --> 02:13:02.960]   I mean, flash content will not run after December 31st, period.
[02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:04.960]   I'm super sad about this.
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:05.960]   What?
[02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:12.960]   Back in my form of years when I first started out on the internet, I used to make a killing,
[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:17.960]   making little squibbly lines dance on websites and charging people on a reserve and an amount of money.
[02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:22.960]   I have an affinity and a heart place for that flash and the money that I got to charge, people.
[02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:24.960]   A little tear goes out of my heart.
[02:13:24.960 --> 02:13:25.960]   It's like Intel.
[02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:28.960]   I'm buried in the back with them Intel chips.
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:30.960]   But flash was good to be back in the days.
[02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:31.960]   I appreciate you, Flash.
[02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:33.960]   And I thank you for your service.
[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:34.960]   I thank you for your service.
[02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:35.960]   Thank you for your service.
[02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:40.960]   All I can say is that now that all the HomeStar Runner cartoons are on YouTube, I'm good.
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:44.960]   That's the only reason I wanted Flash to keep on going.
[02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:54.960]   Let's see if I can hear the best flash sites ever from creativeblock.com, the Nike Air,
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:56.960]   Mono Crafts.
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:14:02.960]   These are all animated, beautifully animated, NRG.BE.
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:04.960]   They all launched in the 90s.
[02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:08.960]   Do you remember it's Comcastic?
[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:10.960]   2005.
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:13.960]   PDK launched in 2004.
[02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:16.960]   Philips BodyGroom.
[02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:21.960]   Domain name, shave everywhere.com.
[02:14:21.960 --> 02:14:22.960]   Launched in 2006.
[02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:24.960]   That gives Flash a whole new meaning.
[02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:25.960]   Doesn't it?
[02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:26.960]   Red Universe.
[02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:28.960]   Tokyo Plastic.
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:31.960]   Leo Burnett, the ad agency.
[02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:34.960]   NR8, NeoStream.
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:35.960]   They'll all be gone.
[02:14:35.960 --> 02:14:36.960]   None of them work.
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:37.960]   Let's see.
[02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:40.960]   The number one Flash site.
[02:14:40.960 --> 02:14:43.960]   Vodafone Future Vision.
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:45.960]   Oh, that went somewhere.
[02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:47.960]   The best Flash site ever.
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:48.960]   I wish I could see it.
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:49.960]   That does something though.
[02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:51.960]   That being the best Flash site says something.
[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:52.960]   Let me click the link.
[02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:53.960]   Oops.
[02:14:53.960 --> 02:14:57.960]   The page you were trying to reach does not exist.
[02:14:57.960 --> 02:14:58.960]   Oh.
[02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:00.960]   Bye bye Flash.
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:02.960]   We hardly knew you.
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:05.960]   It was a long time ago, so I might be misremembering.
[02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:08.960]   But don't we have Flash to thank for monkey punching,
[02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:09.960]   advertising technology?
[02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:12.960]   I was telling you about that this morning.
[02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:14.960]   Oh, yes.
[02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:16.960]   Punch the monkey to win a prize.
[02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:18.960]   It was going back and forth like ten.
[02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:22.960]   You're going to punch it.
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:24.960]   Folks, you are the best Twit panel ever.
[02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:25.960]   Everybody is in agreement.
[02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:27.960]   It's so nice to have you on.
[02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:29.960]   This is so much fun.
[02:15:29.960 --> 02:15:30.960]   Andy, you fit right in.
[02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:33.960]   Because honestly, Georgia and Owen have a thing going.
[02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:35.960]   It's been going on for some time.
[02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:38.960]   And I was worried you might be the fifth wheel here,
[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:40.960]   but you just fit right in, didn't he?
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:41.960]   He was just...
[02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:42.960]   He's pretty good.
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:44.960]   I'm like the designated driver for our arguments.
[02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:47.960]   Throughout the whole episode, his giggles.
[02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:50.960]   When you go back and listen to her, or I'll par right behind Georgia,
[02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:51.960]   Dowsgiggles.
[02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:56.960]   Well, because, see, you kind of did yourself in because every time
[02:15:56.960 --> 02:15:59.960]   you said something, I'd be too busy salivating over.
[02:15:59.960 --> 02:16:00.960]   Ooh, brisket.
[02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:02.960]   The kind when you drop it in the aluminum pan,
[02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:05.960]   it just disintegrates into little chunks of bork.
[02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:09.960]   And it really was beyond the ability for rational reaction.
[02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:11.960]   By the way, a number of people in the chat were saying,
[02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:12.960]   "No, no, no.
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:15.960]   The best flashlight ever was zombo.com."
[02:16:15.960 --> 02:16:16.960]   But here's the good news.
[02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:18.960]   It's HTML5 now.
[02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:21.960]   So you can go to HTML5zombo.com.
[02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:22.960]   You still...
[02:16:22.960 --> 02:16:23.960]   You've got to change the survival.
[02:16:23.960 --> 02:16:24.960]   You've got to change the time.
[02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:26.960]   You've got to keep up with the times.
[02:16:26.960 --> 02:16:27.960]   That's after time.
[02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:29.960]   You can still get zombo.com.
[02:16:29.960 --> 02:16:31.960]   I'm Priya, going to learn a lot from zombo.com.
[02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:33.960]   Better management, better leadership.
[02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:35.960]   That's Andy and I go.
[02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:37.960]   You catch him on Mac Break Weekly this Tuesday.
[02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:44.960]   And on WGBH in Boston most weeks, he's at IHNATKO.com.
[02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:45.960]   It's great to have you.
[02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:46.960]   Great to be here.
[02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:47.960]   Thanks, guys.
[02:16:47.960 --> 02:16:49.960]   Thank you, Owen, JJ Stone.
[02:16:49.960 --> 02:16:50.960]   Oh, doctor.
[02:16:50.960 --> 02:16:52.960]   Go to Georgia and come back to me.
[02:16:52.960 --> 02:16:54.960]   Everyone wants to do a final farewell.
[02:16:54.960 --> 02:16:58.960]   And we've got to tell everybody that IHQMZ.com/thesystem
[02:16:58.960 --> 02:17:02.960]   is the absolute place to go to get a little education.
[02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:08.960]   Georgia Dow, she's got her own site, anxiety-videos.com.
[02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:11.960]   There's no flash there, just a lot of great videos to help you sleep better,
[02:17:11.960 --> 02:17:15.960]   be a better parent, reduce the anxiety in your life.
[02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:18.960]   If you are feeling stress and strain at this time,
[02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:24.960]   Georgia is kindly offered to take your emails at Georgia@WestMountTherapy.com.
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:27.960]   And you stopped doing the electroshock therapy.
[02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:28.960]   You don't do that anymore, right?
[02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:29.960]   Nope, don't do that.
[02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:30.960]   No, no.
[02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:31.960]   No, no, no.
[02:17:31.960 --> 02:17:32.960]   No, no, no, no.
[02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:35.960]   No brains, no sensors on the temples, nothing.
[02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:37.960]   Thank you, Georgia.
[02:17:37.960 --> 02:17:38.960]   Thank you.
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:44.960]   And now, as always, we'd love to end the show with a little homily
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:50.960]   from the right Reverend Owen, J.J. Stone, Reverend Dr. Stone.
[02:17:50.960 --> 02:17:52.960]   So first and foremost, Tonka Leo, thank you.
[02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:54.960]   Thank you for buying it.
[02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:57.960]   And for sharing it and stuff.
[02:17:57.960 --> 02:18:01.960]   So, my daughter, not the Dominator Computer,
[02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:07.960]   has today broken a $1,000 sales on her hygiene queen.
[02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:10.960]   That was her goal to make $1,000 before she turned 13.
[02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:12.960]   And a couple of weeks, she's going to be a 13-year-old,
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:14.960]   so she met her main goal.
[02:18:14.960 --> 02:18:16.960]   And I wanted to tell you that's so great.
[02:18:16.960 --> 02:18:18.960]   That's so great.
[02:18:18.960 --> 02:18:19.960]   I love her.
[02:18:19.960 --> 02:18:21.960]   She is before the computer.
[02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:25.960]   I did make it sound like it's Leah, the computer, the smoker.
[02:18:25.960 --> 02:18:26.960]   I'm listening in here.
[02:18:26.960 --> 02:18:27.960]   The smoker, everything.
[02:18:27.960 --> 02:18:29.960]   Everything else in its father's day.
[02:18:29.960 --> 02:18:31.960]   She was supposed to be talking about...
[02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:33.960]   Look, I got the smoker for you.
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:35.960]   Wait a minute, I don't think that's what father's day means.
[02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:38.960]   I got the smoker for you.
[02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:41.960]   Wait a minute, I don't think that's what father's day means.
[02:18:41.960 --> 02:18:42.960]   I love you so much.
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:44.960]   Now, go away when I talk to you about something.
[02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:47.960]   L-E-I-Y-A-H dot com, the hygiene queen.
[02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:49.960]   She's got beard oil.
[02:18:49.960 --> 02:18:50.960]   She's got moisturizer.
[02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:51.960]   She's got soap.
[02:18:51.960 --> 02:18:53.960]   Look at the barber father's set.
[02:18:53.960 --> 02:18:55.960]   Get out there.
[02:18:55.960 --> 02:18:56.960]   Buy that.
[02:18:56.960 --> 02:18:58.960]   Support Leah.
[02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:01.960]   The King James II, AKA the barber.
[02:19:01.960 --> 02:19:02.960]   Look at this.
[02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:03.960]   That's one selling soap right there.
[02:19:03.960 --> 02:19:05.960]   King James is one of James the night.
[02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:06.960]   What does that smell like?
[02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:08.960]   It smells like...
[02:19:08.960 --> 02:19:10.960]   Honestly, it smells like a high school guy
[02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:12.960]   wearing a car that had auto-maiden.
[02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:13.960]   That's exactly...
[02:19:13.960 --> 02:19:16.960]   First, in your high school to have cologne oil,
[02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:18.960]   that's exactly what it smells like.
[02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:20.960]   And everybody loves it and they adore it.
[02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:23.960]   There's the ruler, AKA, crunchberry.
[02:19:23.960 --> 02:19:24.960]   There's...
[02:19:24.960 --> 02:19:26.960]   Like, after crunch, I'm just saying, if you want to wake up...
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:28.960]   There's no actual cereal in that, though.
[02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:31.960]   There's the ruler that smells like coffee,
[02:19:31.960 --> 02:19:34.960]   Panda clean, the Morocco moisturizer.
[02:19:34.960 --> 02:19:35.960]   Does that have...
[02:19:35.960 --> 02:19:37.960]   Does that have argan oil in it?
[02:19:37.960 --> 02:19:38.960]   Because I love that stuff.
[02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:39.960]   I can't get enough of that stuff.
[02:19:39.960 --> 02:19:41.960]   Do that with the organ oil.
[02:19:41.960 --> 02:19:42.960]   So, talk about the king.
[02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:44.960]   Let me tell these people the importance
[02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:45.960]   so we can add in this episode.
[02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:47.960]   People yell, "I always make it too long."
[02:19:47.960 --> 02:19:48.960]   Yes.
[02:19:48.960 --> 02:19:51.960]   So, the world is a crazy, terrible, horrible,
[02:19:51.960 --> 02:19:53.960]   beautiful, amazing place.
[02:19:53.960 --> 02:19:54.960]   Okay?
[02:19:54.960 --> 02:19:55.960]   Even though it's a dumpster fire,
[02:19:55.960 --> 02:19:57.960]   it smells like lavender petals.
[02:19:57.960 --> 02:19:58.960]   All right?
[02:19:58.960 --> 02:19:59.960]   So, let me just say that.
[02:19:59.960 --> 02:20:02.960]   At iQMC.com, which you never hear me promote
[02:20:02.960 --> 02:20:04.960]   or tell anybody to follow me or do anything.
[02:20:04.960 --> 02:20:05.960]   Uncle Leo does it.
[02:20:05.960 --> 02:20:06.960]   I don't ever promote myself.
[02:20:06.960 --> 02:20:08.960]   But at iQMC.com/thesystem,
[02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:11.960]   you can find videos about a study that would definitely explain
[02:20:11.960 --> 02:20:14.960]   to anyone who's a child or an adult about how racism works.
[02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:17.960]   It'll give you a history lesson in 15 minutes
[02:20:17.960 --> 02:20:18.960]   by my friend, Ronnie Malco,
[02:20:18.960 --> 02:20:20.960]   that will tell you about the system of oppression.
[02:20:20.960 --> 02:20:22.960]   It'll remind people that in 1985,
[02:20:22.960 --> 02:20:24.960]   there was a bombing by the police department
[02:20:24.960 --> 02:20:26.960]   in Philadelphia where they destroyed
[02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:27.960]   an entire city block,
[02:20:27.960 --> 02:20:29.960]   killed 12 people, five children,
[02:20:29.960 --> 02:20:31.960]   and no one was prosecuted for that.
[02:20:31.960 --> 02:20:33.960]   The Tulsa bombing in massacre,
[02:20:33.960 --> 02:20:34.960]   it'll tell you about that.
[02:20:34.960 --> 02:20:36.960]   It'll tell you why people protest
[02:20:36.960 --> 02:20:38.960]   and why people are so angry.
[02:20:38.960 --> 02:20:40.960]   And you can watch videos about it.
[02:20:40.960 --> 02:20:41.960]   You don't have to read.
[02:20:41.960 --> 02:20:43.960]   You can just go ahead and watch them.
[02:20:43.960 --> 02:20:45.960]   And it'll give you some things that you could do personally
[02:20:45.960 --> 02:20:46.960]   because people ask me all the time
[02:20:46.960 --> 02:20:48.960]   what they can do or how they can get more information.
[02:20:48.960 --> 02:20:51.960]   So, I put it all in one little section for you to go look at
[02:20:51.960 --> 02:20:52.960]   and read if you want to do it,
[02:20:52.960 --> 02:20:53.960]   if you want to share with someone else
[02:20:53.960 --> 02:20:54.960]   who's a little bit hard-headed,
[02:20:54.960 --> 02:20:55.960]   but you know they have the right heart
[02:20:55.960 --> 02:20:57.960]   and you just want to nudge them.
[02:20:57.960 --> 02:20:59.960]   I think that this will help you nudge them
[02:20:59.960 --> 02:21:00.960]   and I will leave that on my site
[02:21:00.960 --> 02:21:02.960]   until we fix everything in the world.
[02:21:02.960 --> 02:21:03.960]   So, that's probably indefinite.
[02:21:03.960 --> 02:21:04.960]   But go there.
[02:21:04.960 --> 02:21:05.960]   Check that out for me.
[02:21:05.960 --> 02:21:07.960]   ikims.com/assystem.
[02:21:07.960 --> 02:21:10.960]   And I'd also like to remind you that I know for a fact,
[02:21:10.960 --> 02:21:12.960]   100% of protesting works.
[02:21:12.960 --> 02:21:15.960]   Because when I complained about not being on this episode
[02:21:15.960 --> 02:21:16.960]   with my Twitter,
[02:21:16.960 --> 02:21:20.960]   it now comes to two episodes in a row that I've been here.
[02:21:20.960 --> 02:21:22.960]   So, don't you ever stop protesting.
[02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:23.960]   Don't you ever stop getting the needle?
[02:21:23.960 --> 02:21:24.960]   You're always giving me on.
[02:21:24.960 --> 02:21:28.960]   Because I did it and Uncle Leo gave you what I've disturbed.
[02:21:28.960 --> 02:21:30.960]   By the way, you have them.
[02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:31.960]   You have them.
[02:21:31.960 --> 02:21:34.960]   I'm going to, I haven't seen and I am going to absolutely
[02:21:34.960 --> 02:21:37.960]   watch Romani Milko's video.
[02:21:37.960 --> 02:21:39.960]   But you also have something I have seen,
[02:21:39.960 --> 02:21:45.960]   the Kimberly Jones video, which I saw on this week tonight
[02:21:45.960 --> 02:21:49.960]   and blew me away and was so right on.
[02:21:49.960 --> 02:21:51.960]   And actually, I've been looking for it ever since.
[02:21:51.960 --> 02:21:53.960]   So, thank you for putting that up there.
[02:21:53.960 --> 02:21:55.960]   How can we win?
[02:21:55.960 --> 02:21:59.960]   And it is challenging to watch as a white person,
[02:21:59.960 --> 02:22:02.960]   but it's very important information.
[02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:04.960]   All of this is good stuff.
[02:22:04.960 --> 02:22:06.960]   Thank you on for making this page.
[02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:07.960]   Thanks for having me.
[02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:08.960]   I appreciate you.
[02:22:08.960 --> 02:22:09.960]   God bless.
[02:22:09.960 --> 02:22:11.960]   Stay safe.
[02:22:11.960 --> 02:22:13.960]   We love you Owen.
[02:22:13.960 --> 02:22:14.960]   We love you all.
[02:22:14.960 --> 02:22:17.960]   I've been stopped 87 times in three years and I'm still here.
[02:22:17.960 --> 02:22:19.960]   I know how to maneuver in these streets.
[02:22:19.960 --> 02:22:22.960]   Stop not by, not by Owen J. J.
[02:22:22.960 --> 02:22:25.960]   Jones, J. J. Stone fans I might add.
[02:22:25.960 --> 02:22:27.960]   But by the men in blue.
[02:22:27.960 --> 02:22:30.960]   Yeah, well, please take care of yourself, okay?
[02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:31.960]   Doing good.
[02:22:31.960 --> 02:22:32.960]   Love you guys.
[02:22:32.960 --> 02:22:33.960]   Love you too.
[02:22:33.960 --> 02:22:36.960]   You'd be nice out there to Owen because he's a good man.
[02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:37.960]   He's a good man.
[02:22:37.960 --> 02:22:38.960]   Y'all are.
[02:22:38.960 --> 02:22:39.960]   Happy Father's Day, everybody.
[02:22:39.960 --> 02:22:40.960]   We love you.
[02:22:40.960 --> 02:22:41.960]   We're glad you were here.
[02:22:41.960 --> 02:22:42.960]   Thank you, Georgia.
[02:22:42.960 --> 02:22:43.960]   Thank you, Andy.
[02:22:43.960 --> 02:22:44.960]   Thank you, Owen.
[02:22:44.960 --> 02:22:45.960]   Thanks to you for listening.
[02:22:45.960 --> 02:22:47.960]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon.
[02:22:47.960 --> 02:22:49.960]   It's becoming a love fest because I've just decided
[02:22:49.960 --> 02:22:51.960]   I'm only having the people I love the most on.
[02:22:51.960 --> 02:22:52.960]   And you know what?
[02:22:52.960 --> 02:22:53.960]   That's fun.
[02:22:53.960 --> 02:22:54.960]   That's the way to do it.
[02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:55.960]   What was I thinking?
[02:22:55.960 --> 02:22:56.960]   We love you too, Leo.
[02:22:56.960 --> 02:22:57.960]   Having all those people I hate on.
[02:22:57.960 --> 02:22:58.960]   That's no good.
[02:22:58.960 --> 02:22:59.960]   I'm only going to have people I love off.
[02:22:59.960 --> 02:23:00.960]   Not supporting you.
[02:23:00.960 --> 02:23:03.960]   Most of the thing about the love on Kaleo is?
[02:23:03.960 --> 02:23:04.960]   What's that?
[02:23:04.960 --> 02:23:09.960]   It means that another twit is in a can.
[02:23:09.960 --> 02:23:10.960]   Oh!
[02:23:10.960 --> 02:23:12.960]   He's got it in!
[02:23:12.960 --> 02:23:15.960]   Do it the twit.
[02:23:15.960 --> 02:23:16.960]   All right.
[02:23:16.960 --> 02:23:18.960]   Do it the twit, baby.
[02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:20.960]   Do it the twit.
[02:23:20.960 --> 02:23:21.960]   All right.
[02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:22.960]   Do it the twit.
[02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:24.960]   I already have a big green egg.
[02:23:24.960 --> 02:23:25.960]   I'm not getting rid of that.
[02:23:25.960 --> 02:23:26.960]   Now I got the Traeger.
[02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:29.960]   Can I talk my wife into the big two?
[02:23:29.960 --> 02:23:30.960]   What is it called?
[02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:31.960]   The woodwind?
[02:23:31.960 --> 02:23:32.960]   I'll text her.
[02:23:32.960 --> 02:23:34.960]   I'll take care of her for you.
[02:23:34.960 --> 02:23:35.960]   I got you.
[02:23:35.960 --> 02:23:36.960]   She loves me.
[02:23:36.960 --> 02:23:39.960]   Here, Leo, write this down.
[02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:44.960]   I'm just concerned about our friend Andy, who only has
[02:23:44.960 --> 02:23:47.960]   a little hibachi for grilling.
[02:23:47.960 --> 02:23:52.960]   That's why I sent him our big green egg, and now we have
[02:23:52.960 --> 02:23:53.960]   nothing.
[02:23:53.960 --> 02:23:56.200]   (laughing)
