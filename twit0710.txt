[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.800]   rare blue moon events where every single Twit panel member is sitting next to me starting with
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:26.280]   Ian McKellen. Ian McKellen. Sir Ian McKellen. We love you in Lord of the Rings. We like even
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.360]   more at the register.co.uk Ian Thompson. I don't know where that keeps going. He doesn't even spell
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.920]   it right. Well honestly to be compared to the great the Thespian himself. I'm fine with that.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.560]   That's right. I read the He was a Thespian. So anyway good to have you from the register.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.200]   You are now a news editor at the Yes my sins. Less reporting but more deep diving.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.640]   No good deed goes unpunished. We shall dive deep here. That's Samable Samid who is our car guy.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.360]   He is in town. We have to give you a new name. He is the chief analyst. Principal analyst.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.160]   Principal analyst. He's the principal at Navigant Research. Principal analyst.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.960]   That's great to have you. Sam drove a Keanuro. Hey not the principal analyst. Seems to me the
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.800]   word principal should be the. You would think so. But a principal analyst. Anyway that's just
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.360]   how it works. There you go. Thank you sir. And speaking of principal the official
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.760]   administrator of the United States Digital Service Mr. Colonel Matt Cuts.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:34.040]   Is in here. Is in the studio. Why did we call you Colonel? Because your G rank is a Colonel's
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.880]   rank. Yeah he's a G whatever. You're an actual member of the US military or is it on an
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.280]   ordinary thing. I started and did six months at the Pentagon before I moved. Oh really.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:53.320]   Does this is that count? Is that like going to West Point? No. Okay. Anyway we love Matt. He is
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.760]   of course a longtime Googler one of the first Googlers and left Google some years ago to go
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.680]   into government service which has been a great thing for us in the United States. And the US
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.040]   Digital Service did originally started because it was going to fix the ACA website the Obama
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.920]   care website. But you've done the veteran affairs now and many other technological
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.320]   achievements. Thanks for having me. Good to have you always.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.840]   Boy I want to let's see. Should I start with what do you think Ian? Which we start with?
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.360]   Should we start with Facebook today? We want to go upbeat downbeat. We want to scare people
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:38.200]   right off the top. Or it was fun. But you know. What is going on at Facebook? So first of all
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.800]   Facebook had its worst outage ever unrelated entirely to the nightmares that have been going
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:50.120]   on at Facebook. Yeah at last they've. Well we don't we don't know for sure that it's unrelated.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.800]   Maybe they were distracted. Well to be fair the one thing they did say out right from the start was
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.080]   this wasn't a DDoS attack. Can we trust a company when they say that? Is there no no when
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.440]   Facebook says anything you have to take it with not just a pinch of salt but an entire
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:11.240]   tank load of stuff. Are there penalties though? Like is it against the law to say no you could
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.360]   say whatever you want. No well I don't know I mean if like if an executive or a CEO or a
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.400]   CEO or somebody. It would not be material. Yeah I think you're right. Yeah I mean if it's a
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.520]   fundamental if it was a fundamental flaw in how they do operations and they cover that up that I
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.960]   think that is actually illegal. But in terms of this case based on what we've seen in certain
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.600]   comments from Alex Thomas and others it looks like this is an upgrade which just caused an ongoing
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:42.200]   memory failure which rolled over to various different data centers. But it's not a good look. You know
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.080]   14 hours has a hell of a long time to have a communication service that important take out
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.520]   taken out. And it wasn't just Facebook it was what's happened Instagram as well. The
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.800]   entire shmill and of course they're merging those all in so it's only going to get worse. But if
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.960]   they do this again I didn't notice. And there is one advantage of not having Facebook Instagram
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.560]   or what's up accounts. I didn't notice although Pavaldorov runs Telegram he was the Mark Zuckerberg
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:13.560]   of Russia until Russia forced him out and said we'll take that. We'll take it from here and he had to
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:20.760]   had to leave. He said that Telegram in the 24 hour period that Facebook was down got 3 million
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:28.120]   new subscribers. So apparently you know that as powerful and dominant as WhatsApp is.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:34.600]   If you can't see there's 3 million new subscribers on Telegram I wish them luck because that security
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.800]   sucks. Does it really I mean we know that they say they do their role your own encryption which of
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.120]   course is always a bad idea. But yeah I'm sorry compared to signal then the stuff that
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:50.600]   Telegram is rolling out is just ridiculous. But honestly does it matter? I mean if you're
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.680]   using if you really want secure messaging you use signal you wouldn't use Facebook messenger
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:01.000]   either right? Well I don't I don't have the app on my phone I use the web the web stuff because
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.920]   some people still insist on contacting me on that. But I think if you're looking yes honestly at the
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.720]   end of the day for 99% of the population it doesn't really matter. But there's a point of
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.560]   principle to be had here and you should support people that do it right rather than going with
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:21.560]   the easiest option. I don't know even what Telegram is doing is easy. It's just their own thing.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.280]   I don't know I look to Telegram I look to the I love Telegram because but I love its user interface
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:32.200]   I love the stickers I love the way it works. Somebody can read my messages. But if you look for the
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:38.120]   permissions it's asking for I draw the one of them it's the same with Snapchat. They're asking
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.720]   for an incredible amount of data in return. When you put stuff on your phone of course you are
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.480]   giving a lot away. This is it we all live on a page. I do know who you're giving it to I mean
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:50.600]   based on the conversation you guys had last week about four square exactly. It could be going
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:56.200]   practically anywhere. Yeah that was a little that was a little bit scary. I think it's funny
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:01.800]   because really if you think about what Facebook does with a user base an active user base of over
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.760]   a million and a half people it's remarkable that they don't go down more often. The fact that they
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:11.560]   stay running is incredible. Well it was kind of interesting because like Monday night I was buckling
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:17.000]   down to take care of some work and I was going to send some invites to a dinner and 10 p.m.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.280]   right when I was doing it GMO went down for two hours. So it's like GMO went out too.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:25.000]   All right I'm the time to take an app you know so it's you probably more than anyone
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.040]   Matt have some idea of the complexity of running these massive networks and how difficult it is.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:35.800]   It does seem odd that you could take the entire Facebook Whatsapp and Instagram network down
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:40.920]   with an upgrade that cascades throughout the network. That seems like a fragile network.
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.280]   I would love to read the post mortem on how they're trying to take out whatever the single
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.760]   point of failure was that they've acted them. Yeah I mean is it possible that this might have been
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.160]   you know part of the first step of unifying them all on a on a common architecture as for
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.920]   a talking play. Yeah that's interesting. I think that's great. Do you think Mark's going to move
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.800]   that fast? I think they need to move it quickly because otherwise they're going to get regulated
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.640]   to hell and back and they were probably working on it long before they talked about it publicly.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.600]   Yeah people mocked me when I went back to Facebook after Mark's post saying oh you believe him he's
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:16.840]   going privacy first and they actually talked me out of it. On the other hand maybe there is some
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:25.960]   credibility because two of the top guys at Facebook just left Chris Cox who joined Facebook early on
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:30.680]   he's actually in some ways considered the number three at the company after Mark Zuckerberg and
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:43.240]   Charles Sandberg he created the original news feed. He's got to get the look. Yeah he's the kind of the work.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:49.560]   Well and said we've been talking about this for some time. The New York Times said they had talked
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:56.680]   to six people involved in the situation all anonymous that the differences between Cox and
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:03.400]   Zuckerberg stemmed from Zuckerberg's asserting control over its company and its app Instagram
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:08.920]   WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger rolling out that plan to a single privacy focused platform and that
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:16.040]   was something Cox apparently vehemently disagreed with. Yeah I saw these reports and I'm kind of
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:21.720]   I mean two minds about this because if Zuckerberg has gotten to his head that he is going to make
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:29.800]   this a privacy or privacy sorry focused communication system he's made some good
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:35.960]   buys in the last couple of months he's got people from the EFF on board you know yeah he
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:42.360]   hired Nate Cardozo from the EFF to handle the the encryption for WhatsApp. He's hired a couple of
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:48.200]   people I think another one from Access and now I can't remember the name but if it's looking like
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:54.200]   this is serious this could be a very very good thing but I'm always tricky with anonymous sources
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.600]   hell I've used them myself but you know I want to see how this plays out because there's been a
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:04.520]   lot of staff movement at Facebook in the last 18-18 months to two years. You can read between the
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:11.240]   slides. In Chris Cox's blog post about his departure he says quote as Mark has outlined we're turning a
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:16.600]   new page in our product direction. This will be a big project and we will need leaders who are
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:23.160]   excited to see the new direction through. Apparently he was not excited. I'm not excited. I'm leaving.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:29.000]   Now remember these guys are billionaires there's no I mean honestly if I were a billionaire I might
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.960]   have to think twice about sticking around especially in the face of a complete product redesign. The
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:38.840]   other the engineering executive is Chris Daniels who was a longtime Facebook executive who was
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:45.960]   brought in to replace Brian Acton of the guy who created WhatsApp when he left late 2017.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.760]   Daniels took over on WhatsApp so he's only been there for a little while.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:55.560]   Daniels didn't post any any reason for. With Cox's statement it was notable in that it said very
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:12:00.680]   little in terms of what the direction was that he objected about so much but at the same time
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:07.320]   guys made his money. It's not as though he's post-economic now so it's just like take a couple of years
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:13.960]   off take a look around as what's coming up. And Acton of course made billions off the Facebook
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.720]   acquisition of WhatsApp here in the outcome sold WhatsApp for 19 billion dollars.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:22.280]   They actually depends on the Facebook stock price as much as 22 billion dollars for one app.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:28.920]   Acton was speaking at Stanford this week and tell everybody told the Stanford students
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.720]   I didn't want to sell WhatsApp but you don't have the choice when you take investors.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:40.360]   I was a minority stake. I had to do the right thing for our 50 employees and for the investors.
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.960]   We I really didn't have a choice of selling to Facebook. I wasn't happy about it but that's
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:49.080]   that's the way it is. And he blamed Wall Street. He said the reason we've got surveillance
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:53.800]   capitalism and companies like Facebook digging deeper and deeper into your private stuff is
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:59.800]   because Wall Street's demanding those kinds of growth numbers and those kinds of income numbers
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:05.400]   and and he said you should delete Facebook. He says not going to get better. This is the guy who
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:13.560]   has billions of dollars from Facebook. You should delete it. Yeah. I did. I'd listen to him and I did.
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:20.120]   Honestly, I still use it because you you have I have to get a while. I have to do you but do
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:24.520]   you. Well actually it's not so much about journalism because by the time something comes
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:29.640]   on to Facebook is old news anyway. It's more about I've got family and friends in the US.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:34.120]   That's what I hear always an over and over and over. Yeah. And yes, I could set up an email.
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:39.000]   Pick up the phone. Write them a letter. Pick up the phone. You want to borrow a fountain pen?
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:47.160]   A quill. But the companies in time business model is predicated on something which is inherently
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:52.920]   scummy. Right. And it's just you know I wish I could argue with that. Well it's a it's a
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.120]   broke back mountain moment. It's like I wish it could quit you but you're still gonna.
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:01.240]   But again I have faith in you Ian. I think you could quit. Well maybe. What is a 30 day challenge?
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:05.720]   I still love Twitter. I mean have you done a 30 day social media challenge? Yeah.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:12.680]   Really. I've gone 30 days off Twitter at various times. But you know you know my story with
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:17.880]   Facebook is I quit in like 2011 and never yeah never. Why did you quit way back when? Because
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:25.240]   honestly you could see sort of the writing on the wall. Yeah. Right. I mean and it's all
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:32.200]   played out like that. So. He you know Acton basically said there's there's no choice in Silicon
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:39.080]   Valley these days that you you pretty much have to do what Facebook is doing which is interesting
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:44.520]   and I wonder if what this was Chris Cox's argument against going private on Facebook is
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:49.000]   you're not gonna make any money that this is gonna cut off your air supply to Facebook.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.040]   I'm gonna say as a journalist the we saw a lot of media companies when Facebook made that pivot
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:15:00.520]   to video in 2011 think right we'll follow that we'll get some of this gorgeous stuff that's coming in
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:06.280]   and Facebook basically set the terms that you're gonna get what we give you and they're now you've
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:12.040]   seen with the recent recent buyouts a media platform so much lower valuations that hasn't worked.
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:17.080]   I would not trust this company further than I could throw it and I'm a no up body strength at all.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:22.600]   Earlier this year Facebook decided to downplay news organizations in its news feed in more
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.800]   stuff from people you know and your family and friends which is people you don't have to pay
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.320]   yes. Well Leo is that the reason because I thought it was just because that's what people want it.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:34.680]   You long you know advocated that you know businesses should not should not build their
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:39.320]   online presence on somebody else's platform very recently on any platform that they don't
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:44.440]   control whether it's. I'm reading some of the money that people are making as YouTube stars
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:50.040]   Lily Singh who just signed to do an NBC late night show she's taking over Carson Daly in the
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:56.920]   late late show and she's like the number 10 Facebook earner makes something like 15 million
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:01.640]   I mean YouTube earner makes something like 15 million dollars a year on her makeup videos
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:07.720]   and her Bollywood videos she's doing okay she's doing okay there's about 50 people out there who
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.880]   are doing okay and then there's a really long tale of people you know but that's the counter
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:16.440]   argument to say you know build your on somebody else's platform especially if you're doing video
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:22.200]   you know you don't want to know that that's probably the one you know one exception
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:27.800]   but even you know even in that case you know either you know whether it's Facebook or or YouTube or
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:32.200]   or you know I mean those are those are really pretty much the only two viable platforms
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:38.440]   to help to get any kind of real traction and you know nobody you know aside from that relatively
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:43.160]   small group you know nobody else is really making any money except the platforms themselves.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.120]   Yeah I mean clearly you're working on on YouTube's farm on Google's farm you know
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:54.120]   making what you can on the other hand some people are doing pretty well she has 14 and a half
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:17:01.720]   million subscribers it is kind of ironic that the height of success on new media still is getting a
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:06.760]   job in old media I kind of that's another thing I've invaded against for three years.
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.200]   All right well that's believe it or not the light stuff the heavy stuff.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.200]   What was the chief of? All right now we're going to do it.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.840]   Well you know great tragedy of course in Christchurch in New Zealand.
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:25.160]   49 killed in an assault on two Muslim mosques by a madman once again
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:31.720]   and the twist here is that he apparently streamed it all on Facebook live.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:38.200]   And I just saw today something one and a half million takedowns of that video being reposted
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.120]   in the last couple of days. Yeah I mean it's bad enough that he streamed it and people saw it.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.760]   I feel so bad for kids who might have stumbled across it.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:51.880]   But even though Facebook has tried to suppress it people are resharing it and yeah Facebook says
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:57.240]   this is really a million and a half resharing. Sky Australia aired a portion of the video as
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:03.320]   as I understand it the Daily Mail it's just shameful you know we know that airing this stuff
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:07.000]   increases the likelihood that someone's going to do it again and again and again.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.200]   Yeah it glorifies it. Yeah so just shut them down.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:17.240]   I mean YouTube also doing what it can to block them but everybody there's something
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:23.240]   wrong with us these days in this world and people are really trying to reshare Facebook at least
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:27.400]   had some automatic systems that worked fairly well they said they were able to block automatically
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:33.560]   1.2 million but that means 300,000 still got posted and only taken down after they were
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:41.240]   reported. 17 minutes before it got taken down and it's just I one of our guys wrote a very
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:45.640]   angry piece about this which I don't entirely agree with but there's got to be some if you're
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:50.120]   going it's not enough to say you're a platform anymore. How would they stop this people what you
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:54.760]   publish? How many live feeds are up there how would you stop this? I don't know. I'm not sure you
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:59.720]   can I'm not sure you can proactively stop it I mean if you're gonna allow live video you can't
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:04.280]   really proactively stop it you know unless you've got somebody watching every single one of those
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:09.640]   feet and you can't. Not without a billion and a half years ago. But you know I mean YouTube has
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:15.800]   made a huge deal about their content ID system over the last decade you know and I mean certainly
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:22.040]   Twit has gotten burned by it on more than one occasion and yet why is it that content ID
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:27.800]   could not find this and automatically and proactively well I mean find the first time you're not
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:32.920]   gonna stop it but after that once you've identified it why can't it you know subsequently identify
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:37.240]   it and prevent it from ever going live again? Well like I have no inside knowledge but just
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:42.120]   thinking a little bit about content ID and it's probably a batch oriented system right it they're
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:47.480]   not built for the idea. It doesn't work for live as well. For real time. We know in fact that when
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:52.280]   we get taken down on YouTube live it's a completely different process right and I don't think it's
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:57.720]   content ID related it's only on the uploaded videos. So I think it is a solvable problem but I don't
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:04.760]   think people have probably thought through like a clip going viral in 17 minutes and then getting
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:10.280]   re-shared like that's a that's a new attack vector that hopefully the engineers are working on at
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:16.520]   all of the major tech. And I'm gonna guess that the 300,000 that got through were edited in a way
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:22.280]   that automated systems couldn't detect the same video. Yeah just to get the signal to go for it.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:27.480]   But I mean if it's not Facebook YouTube has the same feature Microsoft has Mixer same
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:33.480]   feature twitch from Amazon same feature. So there are many ways to do live video it would be
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:39.480]   I think impossible but now my fear is this is going to become standard operating procedure for
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:46.920]   mass murder. Well fire up a camera and and start streaming your crime and I that makes me so sad.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:51.000]   I mean he very clearly prepared for this he got the manifesto written he knew where to
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.040]   in which scum site to publish up a publisher. Eight-chan right. I was not good yeah but yeah.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:01.000]   Well I don't know it's not revealing anything people don't know and if you go there you get
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:07.080]   what you deserve. Yeah but I mean he'd obviously prepared for this he was obviously ready for it
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:14.280]   but it's it's tricky with so much content coming in and the the ability to block it is limited
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.800]   but I find it difficult to believe that a company which in its last three months
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:24.760]   boasted a six billion dollar profit can't devote some kind of work towards that.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:29.720]   I just don't know what you would do. I don't know. I think it this is probably the first time that
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:34.760]   like could someone have anticipated this should they have anticipated it you can talk about that
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:40.520]   but I think this is the first time we've really seen like dystopian science fiction in this particular
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:45.400]   manifestation and I think probably people at different tech companies are thinking right now
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:49.320]   about how to prevent the next generation of that and so you know fast forward three months
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.560]   I think there will probably be better facilities faster facilities near real-time facilities it's
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:59.000]   but then the scary thing is yes people will go to different platforms if if Facebook or
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.640]   YouTube do well they'll go to plenty of places to do it. Yeah yeah. Is there so tiling our chat
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:08.840]   or masts an interesting question is there any place online for for videos like that there is
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:16.360]   some historic value he talks about World War II footage and so forth. I don't think so honestly
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.320]   what's about the public's right to know or need to know and that kind of thing.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:23.400]   That's there's a very big difference between what the public wants to know when the public has a
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.880]   right to know. It's a very brilliant. Well not only that but you know it's one thing to know that
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:32.760]   this event happened but do you actually need to see video of it does anyone actually need to see
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:39.480]   video of it it's what you know record record what happened you know in written form. It's a snuff
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:44.360]   video. Yeah there's no there's no need for anyone to ever see that again. And yet there is a you know
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:52.200]   in fact Reddit had to delete two subreddits devoted to gore and death videos because they kept
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:57.800]   getting posted there. Yeah this is something we want as humans it's it's a very sad thing and I
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:01.720]   and I think you I think you nailed it there's two problems of course there's a problem of a kid
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:07.320]   seeing it or if people who shouldn't be seeing this anyway it's the worst kind of violence porn
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:11.560]   but there's also this issue of glorifying actions like this and encouraging actions.
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:16.920]   No no absolutely and we know that does have an effect but I think coming to your point there is
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:23.160]   there is a reason to record some stuff when the the eyes and the Russians opened up the camps in
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:27.320]   the in the second world war they wanted to record that because they genuinely didn't believe that
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:30.600]   people could believe that something like that they've gone on. Have they not seen it before?
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:38.840]   But at the same time with something like this it was clearly designed to be used on social media.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:43.080]   The fact that some people in the media used it and the fact that people are willing to share it
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:47.400]   does not make up for the fact that we should not be sharing this kind of material.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:53.320]   It's really more propaganda than it is reporting of what happened.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.720]   Yes exactly I mean this is what because it is.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.520]   Does I do inspire others to do the same? Exactly this is what this is.
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:02.520]   Why did you do it? Why do his job for it?
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:07.160]   It's the same with terrorists you know why be terrorized by terrorists that's what they want
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.600]   you just say two out of ten try better next time and get on with your life.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:15.800]   Anyway it's sad that we have to talk about it I don't think you can blame Facebook for this I
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:20.840]   think you're right indeed a behoove every company to try to figure out if there is a way to block
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.280]   it technologically but I don't think there's going to be and I don't think you could blame a company
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:29.320]   when this misuse happens and it seems to me Facebook did as best it could do which is
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:34.200]   take it down as fast as they could once they found out it was going on and then block it as best they
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:38.440]   could and really sad to me is how many people were trying to reshare it.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:46.120]   Yeah just feature that then that's just a classic you know Bloomberg Business Week's cover this week
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:51.560]   features Mark Zuckerberg. Do you look any less like an android at that point?
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:55.640]   It looks just like data I don't know if they watched his face out a little bit this is of course a
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:25:00.040]   picture from him from his congressional testimony the title is the apology machine
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:07.000]   Facebook says it cares is that enough and then we see uh Mark's JavaScript code switch public
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.560]   apology case empathetic set vision make eye contact delay then speak I am sorry core temp
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:23.000]   current core temp times 1.05 duct control tiers to delay then wipe tier return null default return
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.400]   user harvest version 677 do be three I love it. You do want to meet the outside of the did that
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:37.000]   and shake the hand because that was a genius oh my goodness if you don't see it now on our video
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   if you're not watching the video stream you might want to look for Bloomberg Business Week on your
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.360]   on a new stand. Oh wait a minute there's no more to stand. Oh you so fast forward. Go to the airport.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:51.240]   Yeah yeah it is the last place you could buy a magazine isn't it? They still have something like
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:57.560]   you know drugstores really yeah I used to go to the drugstore. I mean that's a much smaller rack now
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:02.680]   than it was five or ten years ago but yeah it's interesting though because like I remember going
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:09.160]   to a holiday party at Google in like 2006 or seven and talking to a couple reporters who were like
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:13.960]   no you don't understand Google's going to be the bad guy and I'm like no that's impossible.
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:17.080]   Where's the good guys? Organizing the world's information and making university accessible and
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:22.840]   useful and you know it's inconceivable and then at some point you see like the memes start to
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:27.480]   generate. Wait are we the baddies you know so I think one interesting thing is like it is important
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.920]   to note that I think there are a bunch of people at Facebook who are trying to do their level best
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:35.400]   to do whatever their job is whether it's connect people or create community or whatever so
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.960]   I think a cover like that is a really interesting wake-up call for people to realize especially in
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:46.280]   Silicon Valley like the the wonderful golden days of before where everybody looked as tech as saving
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:52.680]   the world is not the same world that we have today. And I am completely complicit in that I
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:27:00.360]   on the outside in 2006 had the same bullish notion that we were going to break down the gatekeepers
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:06.200]   you're going to democratize information and in many ways we do have that I carry my pocket
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:11.400]   a computer straight out of necromancer that has all the world's information on it thanks to Google
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:17.400]   I can find any fact instant almost instantly that's a remarkable benefit for society.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:21.880]   I certainly wouldn't be sitting here right now were not for that technology I mean
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:27.960]   we called you that's how we found you. Well no likewise I mean when I first started out we
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:32.920]   were actually typing with carbon paper through a typewriter on my hand to a typeset. But it
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:38.760]   has no no it's it's it's a wonderful world but if you look back at the Hackermannifesto in you
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:45.240]   know in the mid 90s it's kind of sad reading because it's like the internet will bring us all together
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:49.960]   and we'll have a global argument and we'll find a global consensus it's like no people like their
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:54.520]   own little hive mind and they go treat censorship as damage and route around it and I think what's
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:59.960]   interesting is people in tech companies just need to wake up to like you can't just say I work for
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:05.080]   company X and company X is making a world a better place therefore I'm off the hook like now yeah
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.360]   everybody has to think about their personal responsibility and think about where they want
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:12.680]   to be the best to make changes in the world and maybe that's at one of these big companies and
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:19.160]   that's fantastic maybe it's not maybe it's the US digital service no but but there's so many
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:23.720]   people I think who are in Silicon Valley who have not yet twig to how people outside of Silicon
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:29.160]   Valley think about the tech companies and you know I see the same thing going on now you know in my
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:34.440]   corner of the world in automated driving you know with there's a lot of people you know that have
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:40.360]   come into this from from the tech side you know that are really bullish about you know just put
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:45.080]   well let's push the technology out there and you know we'll work on it you know we'll keep making
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:52.120]   it better over time without thinking about the consequences of what happens when it goes wrong
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:56.840]   you know because it's it's not like you know you're like Instagram you know being unavailable for
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:02.600]   six hours you know when it when it when something like that fails you know the consequences are life
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:09.560]   in death and you know when I hear you know somebody from from Silicon Valley talk about the you know
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:14.680]   we need to get people we need to get humans to change their behavior and stop jaywalking
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:20.840]   so that we can use these automated vehicles more effectively it's like no no technology has to be
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:25.080]   built to make people's lives better not the other way around you don't change people to make the
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:31.080]   technology better do you think it's a natural consequence of being an engineer that you kind of
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:38.280]   have this kind of nearsightedness about you think only about how good it things what you're doing
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:43.160]   is going to change things there isn't an inherent optimism to being an engineer you know and you
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:49.640]   fall for that and yeah no one wants to think oh god what what bad things could humans do with my
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:54.200]   invention nobody wants to spend time the class of the class some of us do i mean you know what
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:58.280]   well i think it might be changing when i i mean when i was when i was working as an engineer you know
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:03.160]   we often you know one of the issues that we often had you know working for an automotive supplier
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:08.040]   and you know our salespeople would go to the automakers and say you know they would hear
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:12.680]   engineers talking about some idea for some feature we wanted to add to an ABS or traction
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:16.680]   control system and they'd go to the automaker and and they'd go and sell this thing that we
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:22.360]   hadn't yet developed yeah and so i mean to to me and a lot of the people i worked with it was always
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:27.560]   this kind of dichotomy between the optimism and the pessimism you know we're you know we're doing
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:32.680]   these really cool things but we don't want to put it out there until we're until we think it's ready
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:37.000]   it's certainly true but it and that was a very different attitude from what i see today the QA testers
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.920]   have always been oh what are the what are those monkey apes users of ours going to do to screw this
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:47.880]   up i mean that's their job but the people designing it i think are tend to be very optimistic that
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:51.960]   does seem to be changing there's a lot more activism happening in companies like google and
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:31:01.000]   microsoft remember google turned decided not to do their search engine in china because engineers
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:07.720]   said no we don't want to work on that they turned down that ten billion dollar jedi project that
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:13.560]   was going to be for uh... i was a face recognition for the military and of course i was i know jedi
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:19.400]   was the cloud computing and amazon snapped it up instead we'll do it decided but they're probably
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:25.880]   gonna get it said we'll do it and and i know way i honor jeff bezos's uh point of view which is
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:33.560]   it's not being patriotic to do to do work to support our military but i also understand these
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:38.040]   engineers saying but yeah but we didn't sign up in hall and microsoft's having this problem with
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:42.680]   holland's there's engineers saying yeah but we didn't sign up to create holland's so the military
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:49.160]   could use it to be more efficient at killing and yet uh i don't think anybody would dispute that
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:54.840]   we need a military that there are defensive uses for this it is this it is a long standing tradition
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:32:01.960]   of american corporations to provide technological support to the u_s_ military this is a very challenging
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:07.240]   time every challenging so do you have friends still back at google who have talked about this
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:12.120]   activism because google really is where it seems like where it started yeah it's it's interesting
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:17.320]   because i know some of the people you know like one of the people whose name is on the walk out
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:23.480]   you know is somebody that i i know at google um and and i think what's interesting is uh just the
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:28.440]   power that individuals can have by standing up and saying look i care about this like the first
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:33.400]   person and the second person is the hardest but then what you find is suddenly 300 people have
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:38.280]   also signed your letter and then and then that gets people's attention yeah tech workers have a
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:43.320]   lot of power right now well they do especially engineers because they're gold there's there's
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:48.520]   the people who are powering the next generation of innovation and they're hard to find good engineers
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:52.600]   or you know it's a very competitive environment and we've also got a long tradition of you know
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:58.200]   conscientious objectors you know you can you can do good things for your country without
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:04.600]   necessarily being involved in you know the the the you know the military the fighting part and
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:10.040]   yet most of the technologies we use today oh yes we're funded by military research including the
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:18.760]   internet and ultimately uh for purposes of national defense so um i this is a very it's a very challenging
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:23.560]   uh problem it's important for people in the industry they're just to have the the courage and
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:28.360]   the and the ability to say no this is not something i want my coding it and to walk away from it and
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:34.280]   companies i think are increasingly having to recognize that that if you want engineers who are both
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:39.080]   talented and have ethical boundaries then you're going to have to either accommodate that or just
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:47.160]   not get the best engineers yeah yeah it's a it's a really interesting uh situation it's tricky
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:52.280]   the way it's it's companies are patriotic they'd pay their taxes instead of yeah that's an excellent
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:58.200]   point well then this is another challenge because the country isn't the company google well amazon
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:02.440]   most recently paid zero taxes on what was it 11 billion dollars paid a minus rate of tax they
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:07.240]   got a rebate they got rebates we paid them yeah and and we've got more of a reason on the other hand
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:11.080]   they're not breaking it and falling apart they're not breaking the law they're they're following the
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:18.840]   law precisely i can't really fault the companies for tax strategies that are legal and again this is
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:22.200]   this is the market demanding that this is the stakeholders this is the shareholders
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:27.160]   no no i'm not i play the policies for allowing it you got to get congress to change it yeah the
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:33.400]   problem is there's a long deep tradition of companies writing these laws and then saying here it'll be
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:40.680]   a really nice and and handing big checks to the the packs for these politics politicians i do not
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:46.840]   know i do not know what the answer is on that when it's bugs me when i see apple google amazon paying
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:53.400]   far less tax than i pay because i don't i'm not big enough to get to get the irish sandwich and
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:35:01.240]   the Dutch turnaround or whatever i you know if only but i you know honestly it would be imprudent
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:07.880]   of me to pay more tax than i'm legally required to as a business person right yeah i i'd i put more
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:12.680]   weight on trying to figure out how to create you know a better ecosystem or better policy or better
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:17.480]   rules or more level playing field such that you know like companies are going to respond to their
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:22.440]   incentives and they're going to respond to shareholders saying return as much much as you can so i'm
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:26.360]   not i'm gonna take every deduction i'm entitled to that'd be nuts i don't i mean i'm not gonna make
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:31.160]   no nation i i understand that but at the same time you need a framework in which people are paying
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:35.960]   their fair share and it is only fair that if a company like amazon which benefits so greatly
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:40.520]   by being in the united states i'm some couldn't function without yeah i'm a some couldn't function
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:45.320]   without us postal service right and the fact that they are willing to starve the federal government
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:50.040]   of funds in order to just to you know boost their profit margins totally understandable the fact
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:55.320]   they're allowed to do that by a political representatives that's where the problem is you know yeah i get
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:59.800]   so nervous because so many of our conversations these days come back to there ought to be a law
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:05.720]   and i get so nervous it's and you work in the government there's there's a lot of the policies
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:09.080]   you make now don't always look as good ten years down the line but i will say one thing that's
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:14.680]   interesting is uh uh republican will heard was that south by south by southwest and was talking
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:19.160]   about how many technical people are in congress and i think he said that it's eight people who haven't
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:24.120]   had people agree you know and and so i didn't have a panel there where there were some politicians
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:28.680]   that you know that acknowledged that we don't know enough about this stuff yeah we'll say we'll
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:33.960]   say yes we're dumb about tech yeah uh and here's one of the ones who does have a computer science
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.240]   background so we can say we stole this at the facebook hearings with that i think it was a
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:41.480]   senator holding up it's like what am i getting so much spanner spam on this it's just like that's
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:47.320]   not one of our phone we don't think uh i think i was Steve king from Idaho right yeah a real
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:52.680]   wedding yeah there's yes yes so yeah Steve king is Iowa oh yeah okay Steve king of the ice dates
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:56.440]   i don't know got you burs certificate should be over let's take a little uh a little break because
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:02.840]   i do there's a lot more actually in this arena to talk about including pet oa works membership in
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:09.480]   the cult of the dead cow my favorite tweet on that was this is like finding out bernie sunda's was a
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:15.640]   founding member of the wutang class i gotta know more about that uh elizabeth warren's call to uh
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:21.080]   to break up all the big tech companies we could talk about that elan's been up to uh
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:28.600]   no good on twitter i know if it's no good or the or the usual he's got a model y and he's also in
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:35.560]   trouble uh and he's telling the sec which by the way is not a good thing to say the sec
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:43.000]   make me do it yeah no you can't make me you're not the boss of me yeah that doesn't look let's take
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:50.280]   a little break yes they are elan they are uh love having that cuts here us digital service is the
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:57.320]   usds.gov they need you you should get a poster mat where you're pointing at people saying i want

[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:28.520]   view source on usds.gov this is i'm so sorry you're like trying to get to it no i love this stuff
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:35.800]   are you kidding but uh if you do view a source uh we have a crab named molly who is our mascot uh
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:43.400]   and this is uh molly with like a lightsaber oh fantastic i'm unfortunately using some weird
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:50.360]   chrome derivative called brave and i don't know uh it's chromium based but yeah i like brave you
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:58.680]   like it yeah i do okay you know there's uh it's control u view source is it still let's see try it
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:06.520]   whoops no that was control y there you go oh molly we've got molly the esky crab with lightsabers
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:11.240]   wow too bad he couldn't decide which color you're gonna be the light sabers but yeah
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:15.160]   and i just want to say for the people who say and this is when our government's friends is
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:20.760]   time-dowing this was this is easy esky art there's generators it's simple he's give them a jiff
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:26.680]   just a little easter egg for folks that is hysterical and you know that's excellent this is clean
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:35.640]   source it is not a lot of cross loading of javascript scripts no no this is html my friends handcoated
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:40.280]   the old division way this is the four-square trackers wow this is how you're in california that
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:45.400]   means it's all to zan this is amazing it's good stuff this is like the way it used to be
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:54.280]   holy cow but nice css very clean and beautiful and it's modular so we can check stuff in with
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:58.760]   markdown into like github and it will automatically create new web pages for us so you know and you
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:03.240]   use google analytics which are happy to see that's nice eating our own dog food on
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:09.880]   wow this is really yeah i don't even see any javascript weird javascript being loaded in

[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:39.080]   the cooking but they do all the hard stuff the meal plan and the shopping even the prepping it's
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:43.800]   like having a sous chef in a box then you open up the box and i love the way they package it with
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:48.920]   it's in little brown paper bags everything you need is right there and you pull it out the
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:55.480]   the meat we're getting is so good from hello fresh uh it's enjoyable it's easy the ingredients

[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:08.920]   most beautiful produce easy to follow six step recipe cards with the pictures and it comes delivered
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:12.840]   in an insulated box right to the door they even have instructions on recycling the box which is
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:17.480]   great they have three plans to choose from there's the classic but they now have a veggie plan

[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:28.440]   really awesome so betto betto a rork former texas congressman has announced his candidacy
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:35.560]   for president in 2020 and must be i think surely is the first u.s presidential candidate to have been
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:42.520]   a member of a hacker group as a teenager it was great it was just like my goodness we might finally
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:49.400]   get a congressperson who knows what that's easy no tech he can hack your mom yeah so what is the
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:54.120]   cult of the dead cow oh well um they've been around a long time i know i've known
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:58.600]   that any hacker group called the cowls like cowls they were up there this is a high level
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:03.720]   they were half they were bad guys they were hacktivists right it was political yeah like i mean
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:08.200]   anonymous before anonymous i mean they they got their name because they originally set up in a
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:14.280]   former slaughterhouse in texas uh and grew up in the mid-1980s when things were really just getting
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:18.360]   off the ground and the fact that these these people have been involved with this that long you know
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:24.200]   mid-80s this was a couple of years after ibm brought out its first pc and apple brought out its
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:30.840]   um yeah they developed back orifice which was a happy or back orifice i remember them yeah that
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:36.280]   was them although apparently betto was not responsible in any way shape or form for that but
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:40.680]   you know come up with the name because that's one of the best hacking it is one of the hacking
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:45.800]   names trust me for journalists at the time or is but i wasn't in the trade then but when that came
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:49.400]   out it was just like *imitates a "dun dun dun wagons roll"*
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:54.840]   remember talking about it on screen savers are you kidding yeah apparently his handle was psychedelic
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:46:00.920]   warlord yes good handle you know good i could see that on a bumper sticker psychedelic warlord
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:06.120]   2020 yeah oh boy at the same time so many members of the cold of the day cow i've actually now become
[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:12.520]   mainstream technologist and this is the way the industry works i mean uh see was napkins and jobs
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:19.720]   round there blue boxes uh gates was dumped to diving michael del was dumped to diving it's
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:24.200]   there's a long tradition of this sort of getting of over the slightly senior end of things and to me
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:32.200]   the real bonafidey's come from the fact that he ran a bbs on his apple to e with a 300-bod modem
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:41.560]   called taco land which is a it was a punk music bbs that's street cred yeah you know i i think
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:47.560]   that shows he does know uh technology is it going to be an issue though with the electorate is this
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:47:05.080]   something that uh opponents could use against oh look you well if he's running against mr grub
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:10.920]   cases you know or maybe maybe it's a man maybe an actor maybe an actor is good that i was gonna say
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:15.320]   i'm sorry if if you've got the the current and supporters of the current incumbent in the white
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:21.240]   house getting on someone's back about being a hacker you've really got a skewed sense of priorities
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:27.560]   i don't you know i think uh you know frankly i think you know being in in a hacker group in the
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:32.920]   1980s is probably the least of better or works problems you know i mean in six years in congress
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:39.960]   he didn't really do anything yeah so you know i think i think anybody that's you know gonna make
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:43.560]   a case against better or work there's a lot of other things that they could bring up that are
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:49.640]   far more relevant than his involvement in the cult of the dead cow but it is a headline grabber
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:53.640]   oh yeah and i think a lot of americans uh would be kind of nervous
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:48:02.120]   when they heard that i don't know it's i think certainly uh maybe a lot of older americans but
[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:06.600]   i think uh the and you know and you know the the people who are going to be nervous about millennials
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:10.840]   are probably aren't going to vote for somebody like anyway like better or work anyway yeah okay
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:17.160]   i mean good for millennials a better says in his old friend say his stint is a fledgling hacker
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:21.960]   fed into his subsequent work in el Paso as a software entrepreneur and an alternative press
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:28.840]   publisher uh and then he ran for city council and congress um i guess it's kind of fun his own
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:34.280]   governor jerry brown had sort of similar beginnings was he a hacker well he wasn't a hacker but he
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:38.680]   got in law in fair light what is he got involved in all the old publishing stuff he was a member
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:44.920]   who i believe no i'm just kidding yeah no of course and this what's going to happen of course is uh
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:48.840]   generations change i mean it used to be the kiss of death to say you'd inhaled
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:56.680]   yeah not anymore i don't think that's uh so it's interesting i think i think you know
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:04.360]   to have tech savvy is probably a plus more important for a lot of folks and you know it's
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:09.000]   interesting that i think that's definitely tech savvy to have been in the cult of the dead now
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.880]   and you know if if somebody were to make it an issue you know all you've got to do is create an
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:18.920]   ad you know describe what i think what you just talked about you know with you know jobs and
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:24.680]   wasniac and and michael del and all these other guys you know and what they accomplished you know
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:30.200]   starting off as hackers you know out of the garage and into the white house yeah the better
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:34.200]   or store i like that i mean that i think that in that case you know that kind of context it would
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:38.200]   actually be a potentially be a real positive and a great way to respond it is interesting that as
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:43.480]   we uh i mean we're still uh you know 18 months or more away from the presidential election we've
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:48.920]   got more democratic candidates i think than there are voters but it's interesting how in order to
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:54.200]   jump ahead of the field candidates are uh saying some pretty interesting things Elizabeth Warren
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:50:01.400]   suggesting that at south by southwest that uh google microsoft amazon deep broken up into
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:08.440]   constituent parts and then later neil i patel got to say apple should be also uh broken up um that
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:12.760]   seems to be more i you know i we've gone back and forth in the shows about this but it seems to be
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:17.160]   more a way to get your face in front of people get your ideas in front of people than in a real
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:22.440]   proposal well i look through Elizabeth Warren's proposal i've got i mean i huge amount of support
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:26.520]   from Elizabeth Warren a lot in a lot of areas she's done some fantastic work but i think in this one
[00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:32.280]   it's more about getting publicity than it is about getting uh making a serious proposal i
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:37.480]   i'm just amazed that she did it because this basically kills her with silicon valley um
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:42.680]   yeah these and there's a lot of money coming out of silicon valley for democrat's will not well
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:47.720]   thought out yeah and i don't understand why she put stuff so sort of half-hearted stuff i i wonder
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:52.600]   if they if she believed and i she may be right that this day we're timely that if you can afford to
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:58.760]   lose silicon valley at this point because the broad base of american people has had it up to
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:05.000]   here with silicon valley i don't think with quite there yet and also silicon valley in washington
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:11.320]   is probably the largest lobbying group now apart from maybe farmer um you're the expert on this
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:20.920]   but i'm not a public expert you live there so to be fair um i don't think that uh i think that's
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:25.880]   a maybe an advantage is not to be beholden to political action no no i think from from Warren's
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:31.160]   perspective that's great but her her recommendation is that you install all these chinese walls between
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:36.120]   these companies and make them buy services from each other and i just see the accountants having a
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:40.840]   field day when it comes to tax avoidance and all those all sorts of issues i think you know
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:46.840]   the proposal is put forward i think it's probably overly simplistic you know which you know for a
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:51.960]   politician is probably the right way to go because you know i think most voters are not going to dive
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:56.920]   into the nuance of this stuff you know i think that there there are some aspects of what she's
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:02.200]   proposing and i think there's definitely some room for separating some of these businesses
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:06.040]   i think there's definitely some things that should that probably should be done i think you know kind
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:12.120]   of the sweeping approach that she put forward in that proposal is kind of going overboard and
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:17.160]   doesn't address a lot of those nuances that's actually my biggest problem with it is it distracts
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:21.640]   from what really needs to be done yeah which is some serious some serious private privacy
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:27.320]   regulation absolutely like you know for example if you if you separated google search from google's
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:33.560]   advertising business what the hell is google search i mean what how's it going to survive is
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:37.240]   the standalone business yeah it's always bothered me that google has acquired content companies
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:41.320]   yeah i mean i think you know i've always felt like i'm sure in the early days if i remember
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:45.880]   larry page's first presentation of google where he said we can't ever take advertising because it
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:50.680]   would necessarily pollute our results i think in the early days there was always the feeling that
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:56.680]   that search should somehow be a priesthood should be above the hurlie burley of commerce so that it
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:53:03.800]   can provide a reliable source of information it's hard to support it well it economically i
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:09.240]   i'm speaking i'm taking off any official how to google i know google no no government official
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:15.320]   hat either this is really my personal thing but it's interesting because the the stuff that was in
[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:20.280]   the post by elizabeth warren's team mentioned ways and double click and and that's interesting
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:25.400]   but the specific link that they pointed to was an article in the new york times by charles dohick
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:30.520]   about found him which is ridiculous that was absurd and like i dealt with web this is the shop
[00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:35.640]   and stuff yeah shopping site that went after google claimed to be a competitor who put us out of
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:42.280]   business when in fact they put them so i so i i i speaking as a webspam person with that background
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:48.520]   like i i have a pretty good idea of what happened there and i feel uh that's a misconstantation so i
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:53.560]   i had to come to the front delulro i'd hate to base a policy proposal on that specific instance yeah
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:57.560]   in fact i think a lot of people who bed tops and astrotecory pointed out the mistake that
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:02.680]   there was numerous historic mistakes which actually worried me a lot more in the medium
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:07.160]   post here's been uh post where warren's wrong and he specifically points to that found a
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:13.240]   article as being not a good precedent yeah for a wide a breakup google and what to do with
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:17.400]   i mean that said there is an argument we made it's something the tech industry has done for many
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:22.680]   many years and in fact every industry does is buy a new competition um and we've seen this with
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:27.880]   facebook and whatsapp and instagram you buy up the competition you lock it down sisco was famous
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:33.400]   for this in the 90s with other networking companies i i do feel if you're gonna get free a proper free
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:37.480]   market competition you've got to stop large companies from dominating the market you've got
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:43.000]   to have a competitive environment but it's also super interesting that facebook has deliberately
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:50.920]   pursued a policy and and like do things like their apps so that they can spot the newer stuff
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:55.640]   coming up before it goes completely viral like it's an interesting strategy as a company to say
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:55:00.280]   you can wait until you hear about it on reddit or you know read about it on slash.org you can
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:05.640]   install apps that watch where the teenagers go or wherever such as you can see the next property
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:09.160]   and then make a strategic decision do you want to buy against them do you want to buy them do you
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:12.440]   want to compete against them all that sort of stuff this is it i'm curious as to what they're
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:17.080]   doing with basically with snapchat they seem to have decided not to buy it and just to basically
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:22.520]   copy all of their stuff and and which is a perfectly valid way of doing that's how ie3 got you know
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:29.160]   got popular but you know it's you got to have regulation for free market it's just one of those
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:35.000]   things i'm sure you were gratified matt by timo riley on this uh south by south west panel
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   pointing to how code for america which is kind of the spiritual successor to the u.s.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:48.280]   digital service really helped uh california um get its online food stamp application working
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:55.960]   better for users and how the relationship between government and silicon valley uh is a really
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:56:00.120]   important one and and that there's a real opportunity there and that that you have to pay
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:06.280]   attention to it code for america uh created this app but it was a lot of work to get even one city
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:12.440]   to sign on but once they did he says more cities in later the entire state uh did it and now they've
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:16.920]   built a front end for all of the california food stamp applications it was interesting because
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:22.120]   the last time i was out here when i was on this week in tech last time i got to visit drop by code
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:28.040]   for america's uh offices they've just moved to new offices and dave guarino and and talk to the
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:32.920]   people who have worked on get califresh and it's it's very much like the first couple few counties
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:38.120]   they just hacked in hard sort like selenium like pretended to be a web browser you know just all
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:42.520]   these awful ways but then you prove that out and suddenly you start to get the momentum and
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:48.200]   you know it's not to you cannot minimize the amount of work it takes to prove out the point
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:53.320]   but to see how much momentum that's gotten now is just inspiring do you think there are more and
[00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:58.280]   more people in silicon valley who are as to more allies as post economic they've made their money
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:03.160]   are looking to do this as a way to give back but also to make government work better yeah i mean
[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:07.960]   if you're a facebooker who's been there for years if you were you know at airbnb or there's a whole
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:11.880]   wave of ipos coming you know oh yeah there's a whole gonna be a whole lot of people who are
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:15.880]   asking themselves mondu i still want to live in san francisco or do i want to pursue something new
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:21.000]   uh and it's gonna be a boon for you maybe i hope i'm gonna keep my fingers crossed because there's
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.880]   you know there's also stuff happening at the the state level you know california is doing a lot
[00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:31.240]   of interesting things all the way to massachusetts oklahoma connect this is really the story of tech
[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:35.560]   in general is the good and the bad at the same time there's the there's the benefit there's the
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:41.160]   there's the tragedy and and we're never going to get rid of either side of it so we got to figure
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:45.480]   out a way to have have it worked better for us yeah i mean but you see we've seen this in other
[00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:50.600]   industries there was for me the most interesting keynote from the rsa tour rsa show a couple weeks
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:56.360]   ago was broosh nya who was saying basically it's not enough to complain that politicians don't get
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:58:02.200]   tech tech people need to go in government it's our fault yeah and make it work now obviously you
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:05.720]   can't expect someone just out of college and in fact you wouldn't want someone just out of college
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:11.640]   but when you've got someone who yeah your company's just gone ipo you're maybe not post economic but
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:17.320]   reasonably comfortable is it gonna it a will it hurt you'd spend a couple of years in government
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:22.440]   service and be from employment situation it will make you more valuable and this is something that
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:27.880]   shanias had was in the legal industry 50 years ago the idea of doing pro bono public work
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:32.440]   was to set an afterman nobody did it now if you want to be a partner in a major legal firm you've
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:36.760]   got to have done that work and you've got to show a commitment and that's a cultural shift yeah so
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:41.720]   that's the culture shift we need to create silicon valent yeah and that under interview with with
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:45.960]   bruce was really fascinating stuff and there's also this movement towards they call it public
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:51.720]   interest technology yeah where universities are moving towards this idea of like how do we get
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:56.120]   people involved so there's a brand new group called coding it forward where college students
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:59:01.000]   actually can apply to become part of the government and you might say oh well don't they need to have
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:06.040]   a few scars but you know if somebody's willing to take that initiative it's a totally different
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:10.440]   internship it's a totally different experience it's not just go to you know pick your favorite
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:15.320]   company for three months you you i've literally seen somebody who thought they were going to be a
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:18.600]   biologist and now they're like no i want to work on civic tech and government tech
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:23.080]   and we desperately need them there because there's a huge skills gap
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:30.120]   um and i think a lot of people who go into going to take a fundamentally ethical anyway there are
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:35.160]   a few people who are just like i'm just in it for the money and you meet them and you just but
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:39.640]   they're generally people i mean we all make that oh we want to make the world a better place but
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:43.720]   some people already do and i think that should be supported and we don't we don't just need them
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:47.160]   need these people at the federal level we need them at the state and local level as well
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:51.800]   you know at all all levels of government you know especially especially at the local level i
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:56.600]   think you know that because there's a lot of a lot of big problems that cities are having to
[00:59:56.600 --> 01:00:01.560]   deal with i mean certainly here in san francisco but you know where i'm from in detroit in chicago in
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:08.360]   new york you know to to have people that understand you know and have have some background in the
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:14.920]   technology side and the ability to vet some of the ideas that come forward and and we'll be able to
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:20.200]   work and and create these public-private partnerships uh you know to to deal with some of the some
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:24.520]   of the issues that are out there whether it's homelessness or transportation or or anything
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:29.480]   else you know in a city uh you know in looking at detroit as an example i mean detroit's made
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:34.520]   tremendous progress in the last five years more so than you know at any time you know in in my
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:41.480]   decades of living in the area but you know there's still a lot of big problems to deal with um you
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:47.320]   know you've got you know like like a lot of big cities you know you've got a large population of
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:53.080]   low-income residents and you know they have very different problems that are not going to get
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:58.120]   solved by just you know throw them a smartphone and a facebook account you know i mean just you
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:03.240]   know for for things you know like in detroit for example you know it's estimated that 30 to 40
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:07.960]   percent of the population detroit is under banked or unbanked i mean they have no bank account
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:15.240]   or or a very send yeah and you know that means they don't have credit cards they don't have debit
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:20.680]   cards which makes it a challenge you know if you know you say well you know if the bus system's not
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:25.560]   working you know you use an uber or lift well if you don't have a credit card you can't do that
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:30.280]   you know so and and that's not an uncommon thing in a lot of big cities to have a large
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:34.280]   portions of the population that are under banked and then you know you go outside of the u.s.
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:40.520]   you know to other countries and in many cases it's much much more so so you know there's there's a
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:46.040]   lot of there's a lot of these things that you know a lot of a lot of the technology that comes out
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:54.360]   really seems to be aimed more at more you know affluent citizens yeah and so you know we've got
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:02:00.840]   to find ways to deal you know to help fix some of these problems of lower income residents to help
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:05.400]   lift them up i think it's very very important i mean if you look what micro banking's done in
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:10.040]   certain parts of the world and paisa and africa for instance you have a great interview with
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:14.040]   Bruce after his talk at rsa and well it's well done it's a pleasure to talk to Bruce yeah he's a
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:20.520]   fantastic guy in fact his new book we and we've been trying haven't we uh carsten we had a
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:25.480]   book but i think it fell through to come on triangulation to talk about his new book which is called
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:30.840]   click here to kill everybody we actually did have him on oh we did i missed it it's an excellent
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:37.000]   read Jason Jason got it good security and survival in a hyper-connected world yeah i guess uh the
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.520]   date we had set for me to interview him would have fell through but i'm glad we got him after all
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:46.120]   his last thought which is really good and a great question you asked if uh if the internet
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:52.760]   was going to fracture uh globally and he said it's already fractured three broad pieces is the EU
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:57.880]   they're the current regulatory superpower and he pointed out how GDPR is actually going to be
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:01.480]   beneficial globally oh yeah the knock on effects because you're not going to write different
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:05.400]   software for different countries interesting you know certain media publications just block
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:10.360]   european users and you're just like wow you're on a highway to hell that way aren't you just
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:15.880]   grow up and deal with it uh well on the other hand if they pass articles 11 and 13 in the new
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:21.240]   intellectual protection that's gonna give intellectual property that's gonna give us a lot of difficulty
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:26.600]   on this show because all we do is comment on other people's work i would be violating article 13
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:33.880]   right now we're talking about your okay good uh he also says that so that's the EU there's also
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:39.000]   totalitarian countries like China and Russia which use the internet for their own you know purposes
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.840]   for internal control yeah social control and then he says there's our point of view our third way
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:49.320]   in the US which is basically allow the tech companies to create whatever they find most
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:56.200]   profitable yeah and what we have is a situation where these three kind of outlooks are are boring
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:01.000]   i love the concept that he put forward there and it's just like you've got china which is turning
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.560]   their social credit system into sitting to the stuff of nightmares you've got europe which is
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:09.720]   trying desperately to be a bastion of privacy and democracy and then you've got america which is
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:14.440]   make whatever the hell you want that's always been our point of view here yeah right
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:20.040]   yeah i know it's it's something my wife is trying to educate me about it's worked quite well i think
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:25.720]   for the most part there's been negatives but free enterprise works pretty well the market
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:32.040]   it works well for a business proposition it doesn't work well in a social well as long as there are
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:35.960]   enough players for it to be a real market and there need to be checks and balances and
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:40.680]   that things like antitrust action and you're right we can't only make technology for the affluent we
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:46.600]   have to make it work for everybody so there are societal pressures that will keep it in certain
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:53.720]   lanes but at the same time free enterprise is clearly the best economic engine anyone's ever
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:05:00.120]   seen am i wrong for building businesses yes trying to run a society on free market terms however
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:05.400]   is a pretty affluent society we've done pretty well i mean it's not that we've eliminated poverty
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:10.680]   no in fact it's getting worse at the moment yeah i mean if you look at it in aggregate yes it's
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:18.040]   doing well but if you look at you know how a lot of the population is faring it's i mean you know
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:26.120]   take a walk down any street in san francisco it's not perfect admittedly but uh and i i'll quote
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:33.640]   steven pinker on this uh it's whenever we talk we we talk a lot about the negative we can't forget
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:40.600]   that we are still on balance oh no i mean the best i mean no i'm going back to the uk and june for
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:46.200]   if you're for a rush is birthday party i'm we've made i'm i'm bitching about the fact i've got to
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:51.320]   spend 11 hours in alimian tube when it took my ancestors three months to get across the country
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:57.640]   by wagon train and the internet actually gets to get a scroll in the airplane it exists at all you
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:03.480]   know i i had i had a long period of time this morning when there was no access you know almost an hour
[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:11.880]   horrible facebook was down for 24 hours no i i think for us to forget yeah there have been some
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:18.520]   massive yeah there and we've all benefited yeah i mean in in general you know a free market economy
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:23.720]   is is absolutely the best approach to take but there are there are problems there are problems and
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:30.200]   and that doesn't mean it doesn't mean we you know i mean a pure market economy is not not
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:35.080]   is not the right solution neither is something on the opposite extreme you need some balance in
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:41.480]   between and you know because a free a pure market economy can only exist when there are enough
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:46.760]   players that you can actually have those forces pushing back and forth but when when it's when
[01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:52.360]   it's too when the power is too concentrated among too few few few players then you don't
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:59.000]   actually have a free market right yeah free ish yeah free and free and the problem is that you've
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.240]   you know over here you basically leave like legalized bribery and called it campaign
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:09.160]   contributions so if a company wants to get a law passed it can do it we had a case like this at
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:13.480]   the reg where we were interviewing somebody who was trying to get i think it was automated license
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:18.520]   plate readers he was trying to get legislation into part in and he got it into a couple of states
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:24.360]   just by paying the right lubius yeah and he like how exactly does that work from a democratic
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:30.280]   principle then he's like oh it's just the way it is you know it's like we're definitely have
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:35.960]   we're perfectible okay we have no perfect system yeah church who themselves we sort of
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:41.320]   think it's democracy is the worst possible system except for all the other that's right yeah so this
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:47.160]   is i mean i i only say that because i don't want it to sound like we're saying oh my god we
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:51.160]   when you see what elizabeth warren's suggesting for instance there is possible to overreact to
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:56.120]   this let's let's fix the problems but let's also acknowledge that there's been some real benefit
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:08:02.280]   oh no i think the fact that google exists is fantastic yeah and we've gotten huge benefit out of that
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:08.760]   and even facebook as much as i despise it there's been huge benefit but we've got a brain
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:13.400]   i think facebook you can't deny that facebook has connected people in amazing ways and people
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:17.720]   keep track of other people and find out what's going on other people's lives in ways that are
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:22.120]   totally beneficial there are downsides and that's what we need to pay attention to
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:26.600]   but i don't want to throw out the baby with the bath water i don't want to break them all up and
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:31.160]   say oh let's start over the problem is that the you know the more established companies get and
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:34.920]   the the bigger the temptation is to try and kick the ladder out from under the next generation
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:39.320]   coming up underneath them it's um we've seen this with net neutrality i mean google wouldn't
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:44.040]   have existed without net neutrality msn and yahoo would simply have bought faster speeds
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:49.080]   and drowned out what was in many ways a better search engine and now we've got some existing
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:53.560]   tech players who are just like yeah let's just um get rid of that this is a conversation i think
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:58.040]   this is the conversation for the next five years that that we as a nation need to have
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:03.160]   uh absolutely and it's an important conversation there's no correct answer there's no obvious
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:07.160]   answer but nobody's got it all right but you we've got to figure it out we've got to figure it out
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:13.320]   all right let's take a little break uh and then um oh i don't know i i think we we uplifted a little
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:20.200]   bit so maybe we can go back down and talk about elon musk we've got our car guy here sammables
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:25.320]   submit he has lots to talk about uh i have to say one of the stories that we were going to talk
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:30.920]   about is euro uh as you know the euro deal the acquisition by amazon went through and the euro
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:36.760]   founders are very happy to say that uh they are going to continue to keep your data private in fact
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:42.520]   i think in some ways the attention that's been paid to uh people euro because of this has really
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:48.280]   helped them they're going to be run independently inside of amazon their privacy policy is not going
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:53.400]   to change they are going to keep your data private and it's i've been very reassuring to me euro is
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:59.880]   one of our sponsors i use euro at home i set my mom up with an euro and i still recommend it as
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:05.080]   the best mesh system out there and it's uh to me it's very encouraging that um they're going to
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:09.640]   have amazon's resources but they are not going to be in any respect less private
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:15.480]   or less secure in fact maybe if anything more secure we do know that the the kind of single
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:21.240]   router model has failed us the idea of you have this one router in the you know wherever your
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:26.680]   wherever your uh modem is and it's and it's broadcasting the whole house it just doesn't work
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:31.240]   and part of the reason doesn't work is because we now have dozens of devices using that router i
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:36.760]   looked the other day on my ear i think i have 68 devices on my internet but that's not a typical
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:42.520]   you've got amazon echoes you've got nest thermostats you've got the ring doorbell all of this stuff
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:48.520]   is using your internet so no wonder netflix seems to bog down a little at night if you have if you
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:56.840]   are hearing that age old complaint honey the internet is down you got to get an euro that's
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:03.560]   why i got our euro and we are so happy if you want an easy way to understand this is to to think of
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:11.000]   bandwidth as light waves uh and really is it's electromagnetic radiation why find waves don't go
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.840]   through walls well so you would never ask a light bulb in your living room to light the whole house
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:21.000]   to light up the master bedroom what you need is a distributed system it's what we've been using
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.600]   in business for years but it'll with a lot of expense and a lot of work and we have a professional
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:31.800]   IT team that's managing it now you can get an enterprise Wi-Fi installed in your house in a
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:37.320]   few minutes the euro app makes it easy you could do it yourself the euro app is fantastic it lets
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:43.320]   you manage your network in your hand you'll know exactly what's connected at any given moment
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:47.640]   the internet speeds you're getting from your internet service provider runs an automated test
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:53.240]   every night it's easy to create and share a guest network that's secure you know you can let
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:59.160]   guests on your network but not get access to your other stuff wpa2 encryption euro has said
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:06.440]   incidentally that they're going to add um wpa3 and software when that comes out it's just fantastic
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:12.840]   i i think the updates alone are a huge part of what makes euro great you're always running the
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:19.480]   latest secure firmware without having any attention to it at all and the customer support is just
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:25.480]   as good you can call and get a Wi-Fi expert within 30 seconds i turned on euro plus and i'm really
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:31.240]   happy about that too in fact i've got it uh right here if i go to my euro plus one of the things uh
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:37.800]   euro plus does for me is it gives us advanced security so not only do i keep the teenager safe
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:46.200]   because i block adult sites and violent sites don't put up my euro L history i can i can see the safe
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:52.600]   the safe filters are on for michael right safe search we block adult legal and criminal or violent
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:57.160]   and yeah you're right i can go in there and see what sites michael tried to get to i won't i won't
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:03.240]   embarrass him uh add blockings turned on and that's a beta advanced security which is great blocks
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:10.680]   phishing email blocks malicious content blocks payloads that's great you get a lot of free bees in
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:15.560]   addition to your euro plus subscription so you get really complete protection for your network
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:21.560]   your devices and those who use them as they connect to the internet it's got a database of of
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:27.800]   of millions of known threats so euro plus prevents you from accidentally or even on purpose going
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:33.480]   to malicious sites let's see uh we ain't good news this week didn't have to block any threats let's
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:40.840]   see if there were anything oh there was one day michaels phone went to 17 dangerous sites now this
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:46.520]   isn't adult sites he was probably trying to download some fortnight hack or something like that right
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:54.200]   he was researching beta he was that call to the dead cow how do i apply and we blocked that as
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:59.640]   against we as we ought to i have to say it's a good thing bidos family did not have an euro because
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:04.520]   that he would have been out of luck i i am just a huge fan of the kind of control i have and the
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:08.920]   information i have i know exactly what's going on in my network and what's great is i can switch
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:15.480]   networks and i can see my mom's network way across the country and if mom has trouble with her internet
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:22.280]   see she's a little bit simpler network six connected devices not as much iot stuff going on but mom
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:27.160]   did have an out a little studio out back and so it was hard for to get the internet out there so
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:32.920]   i put an additional euro beacons to extend it out there and that's been working great i just i just
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:38.040]   love the euro never think about wifi again get a hundred dollars off the euro base unit that
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:44.920]   includes two beacons and a year of euro plus hundred bucks off when you go to ero.com/twit and
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:55.640]   use the code twitted checkout euro.com/twit checkout code is t w i t someone who grew up in sort of
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:15:00.760]   when brawl ban just came out sort of in the late 90s when you look at the number of points attached
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:07.080]   to your router right now it's amazingly terrifying yeah i actually ended up setting two networks up
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:12.360]   in my house i have a bit Comcast business and Comcast regular yeah i have a lot of wifi flying
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:17.320]   around i can't believe it works to be honest with you there's a lot of credit goes to euro
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:22.360]   that's magic we don't we don't have any home automation stuff in our house and it's just me and my wife
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:28.840]   and the dog and we have 18 devices wow i think i'm 16 wow yeah you see i refuse to have any of those
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:33.960]   sort of the the right and the google homes in the house but it's still we've got we've got a sony
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:39.240]   google smart speaker but you gotta have a smart scale right to i have two smart skills no i have
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:44.920]   one which i put the thing on top of the scale and manually do it so you have my desk at home i have
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:50.440]   a google home max that nice speaker that really sounds good on top of that i have an amazon echo
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:57.800]   show on top of that i have the harmen cardon cortana speaker it's a little tower of voices
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:03.160]   this is and they and and it's uh and then the home hub is on top of it and then it's fun when
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:08.520]   the because they all respond spontaneously anything they can all talk to each other there's always
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:13.400]   somebody talking in my house why did you want why did you want it's clear interesting actually i
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:17.480]   made a point who's still single who's doing this sort of the tinderado route thing and he met someone
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:24.760]   who refused to um they they went back to his place and then she saw that he got a and an echo in the
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:29.640]   bedroom and was just like either that leaves the bedroom or i'm not going in it and it's like really
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:36.040]   okay right you know and who won i need no no i don't i don't i don't that hardware was out the
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:42.200]   bedroom so fast it's like it's what i've grown wings i never liked her anyway uh model y announced
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:47.560]   this week it's a 300 mile range model three doppelganger according to tech crunch coming in
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:54.840]   fall 2020 where 18 months out the model y sam we were talking about that earlier is based mostly
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:17:00.920]   on the model three platform but it's a crossover yeah so i mean like a lot of companies you know
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:07.720]   tesla is basically taking the cart and the car's the car platforms they have and elevating it a
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:12.280]   little bit you know that's and then you know putting a hatch on it and calling it a crossover
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:18.600]   you know i i think you know it's definitely the direction the tesla needs to go you know i mean
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:23.640]   if you look at the overall car market you know everybody's moving from sedans you know in coupes
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:30.120]   to to crossovers um i'm not sure that the particular form factor of this one is necessarily the right
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:34.360]   approach you know they they're calling this a step you know it's something that can hold seven
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:38.840]   adults you know as long as two of those adults are no more than four feet tall and adult people
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:44.360]   haven't ever amputated at the knees um you know because the the shape you know it's it's like the
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:50.360]   model x you know it's got and that fastback shape so it's more like you know some of the the premium
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:57.080]   european SUV coupes like the bmwm sec even on my model x that third row you if you're you it's
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:01.880]   hard to sit there unless you're fairly yeah compact i think it's interesting i didn't know this you
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:08.440]   told me that uh Ilana has maxed out his capacity at the freemont plant the old numi plant they bought
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:12.920]   and he's going to be making this in nivata at the giga factory that's that's what they said during
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:18.680]   their last earnings call at the end of january um you know and that but that you know assumes that
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:23.160]   between now and the time they launched the model y that they can actually sustain sales the sales
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:28.200]   pace of the model three uh which based on what we've been reports we've been hearing over the first
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:32.040]   couple months of the year you know sales are off significantly they put it looks like they pulled
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:36.520]   it had a lot of sales into the fourth quarter you know people wanted to get in three is pretty
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:42.440]   successful right it it's definitely been very successful and yeah in in 2018 you know um while
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:46.040]   it's still had the full seventy five hundred dollar tax credit that's not but you think that's
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:51.080]   going to hurt the because the deal is because the price of the first one up my almost four thousand
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:56.680]   dollars um and you know so that's why they rushed out the the thirty five thousand dollar version
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:19:02.760]   um and now you know they have the because you know if you look at the market as a whole of you know
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:08.600]   the shift from cars to utilities um you know now that they've announced the model y you know are
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:13.240]   people going to say well you know i don't think i don't i'm not gonna bother getting the three
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:17.240]   right now i'll just wait till next year and get the y instead you know so it it could have a little
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:22.920]   bit of Osborne effect there even more than that there's a lot of competition from yeah normal car
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:28.360]   manufacturers metal benders uh like outy vox wagon they've got a number of vehicles got that
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:33.320]   chia Niro EV sitting out there with 240 miles of electric range that cost thirty seven thousand
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:37.160]   dollars that probably was going to hurt tesla more than anything when tesla was the best
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:43.560]   choice out there it was pretty much the only the only choice yeah except for like lower costs
[01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:50.360]   lot of short range cars uh now you're getting affordable longer range EVs and the two two to three
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:56.600]   hundred mile range uh area and so they're they're gonna have a ton of competition they've already
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:20:00.680]   got a lot more competition now than they had a year ago and there's gonna be a lot more a year
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:07.800]   from now the other problem is elon himself that's really tesla's biggest self-inflicted problem
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:13.560]   even as a tesla owner i have to say i have second thoughts about buying another tesla tesla because
[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:19.880]   i'm not convinced that elon is gonna if that company's gonna survive even a lot of he gets into
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:25.080]   grimes his stash again and goes absolutely nuts on twist what happened do you think uh rumors have
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:30.680]   been uh of abounded about the loomburg business week had a very kind of scathing piece this week
[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:38.120]   about the tesla whistle blower uh there was a tesla uh security manager i think
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:43.960]   who uh actually you know he's the guy who told bloomberg the story but there was a whistle blower
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:50.840]   that elon just went ballistic on in effect a guy named martin trip uh he worked in the assembly
[01:20:50.840 --> 01:21:00.040]   line at the giga factory and elon saw him as a dangerous foe who engaged in extensive and damaging
[01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:06.840]   sabotage and uh which in elon world means that you know he wasn't worth shipping and wheeled out
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:11.960]   yeah exactly he told the truth yeah i mean this is one of the things that's i found highly
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:17.480]   amusing about silicon valley in particular is the zero tolerance for leaks and the way that
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:23.160]   people free out you know freak out about this hpo is so hp lost a ceo over the fact that he was
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:31.400]   so frustrated by leaks that he tapped into journless details um you know elon goes nuts about this
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:36.680]   apple goes nuts about this one of the things and we don't know who did it but uh trips
[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:45.000]   sued tesla for 167 million dollars same day uh the sheriff's department in his hometown was tipped
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:52.440]   off that he had planned the mass shooting at the giga factory he had not this who knew who knows
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:58.040]   who made that call but police had to confront him and it was very upsetting i as imagine maybe even
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:09.400]   very dangerous um how far would elon go if he saw you as an enemy apparently pretty far
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:14.440]   you know if you would have ever even you know they were just a chilling effect i don't want
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:19.400]   to say anything bad about the cave diver in ten's time and he was wouldn't call the cave diver
[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:25.080]   a pedo and then double down on it yeah well and to say that he doesn't respect the sec
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:31.480]   you know and you know he he signed this settlement agreement with the sec last fall after his
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:37.480]   his four hundred and twenty dollar going private tweet and um in the in tesla's official response
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:45.560]   last week uh to uh the secs um complaint you know uh to the to the car and unen constitutional power
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:51.880]   grab well by the secs also you know and the statement and i didn't do it anyway yeah well
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:56.760]   yeah this is the statement from the you know from tesla's official response to the contempt
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:23:01.800]   petition uh from december 11th 2018 when the communications policy became effective
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:07.640]   until the commission's extraordinary court filing following mr musk's february 19th 2019 tweet mr musk
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:13.160]   did not seek pre-approval for any of his twitter communications which he's supposed to do what yeah
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:18.520]   which is anything that is remotely material he's supposed to get approval so they acknowledged in
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:23.320]   that in their response to the contempt petition that he did not request pre-approval for any of his
[01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:29.560]   tweets so you know clearly he's completely flaunting you know the agreement that he signed and also
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:36.600]   paid forty million dollars and fines for yeah it bothers me because you know this has been the story
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:43.320]   for the last few weeks instead of the amazing things he did as base x did with the dragon crew
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:48.440]   vehicle successfully launching it docking with the ISS of bringing it home no crew aboard but
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:55.160]   this is a test for later manned missions uh that should be the headline and his successes should be
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:24:00.040]   the headline right but he he keeps undermining himself by opening his mouth or you know yeah
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:06.040]   firing off tweets and then he's enabled by people like jack dorsey who called him you know his
[01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:12.760]   the best twitter user out there yeah jack dorsey the ceo oh the twitter loves him yeah quite sure he
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:18.840]   does but you know i can forgive elon musk a lot because space x really has revolutionized orbital
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:23.640]   delivery in a way that would never have happened otherwise on the other hand he needs to stop being
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:28.680]   quite so stupid with his cleverness you know he really needs to dial it back a bit and maybe
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:33.400]   just think about the interest of his companies rather than might need to shout out about stuff
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:38.760]   but coming back to the new car isn't this just what detroit's been doing for ages it's just like yeah
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:44.120]   he is our new chevy something with exciting new wingbearers and yeah exactly i mean it's
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:49.880]   it's no it's no different from what any other automaker does you know every week yeah this
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:54.280]   this is yeah this is not that not new there's no news here now if you could just stay off this
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:59.480]   stay off the weed and get home with it but who is it that elon listens to or would
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:06.200]   accept as a coach no one there is no one that that's that's the fundamental problem which is a
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:09.560]   certain similarity to this and between this and the man in the white house there's a
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:13.160]   oh there is so i mean i can't there aren't that many people i can think of their
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:18.040]   likeness but who just feel like well i should be able to say whatever i want on twitter
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:23.640]   you know i think you know what is this a cultural thing is there something going on in the world that
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:31.320]   well i think in in elon's case you know part of it goes back to you know his experience in the 90s
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:38.360]   you know in the early 2000s with x or you know with zip 2 and then with especially with paypal
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:44.440]   you know where he he kind of got pushed out of paypal and he has resented that ever since
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:49.000]   you know after after his experience at paypal after the buyout and then he got he got pushed out
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:55.560]   he you know he made a commitment to himself and Ashley Vance talks about this and his biography
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:26:01.480]   of him you know that he never wanted to relinquish control of anything that he did ever again
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:08.760]   he he did not want to be pushed out again which is why he you know he retains such a large equity
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:14.200]   stake in both space x and tesla you know like 20 about 22 23 percent of both of those companies
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:21.000]   and but in order to do that because he's had to raise so much capital he has had to
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:26.840]   borrow huge amounts of money personally in order to every time they sell shares to buy up a bunch
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:31.320]   of those shares himself in order to keep from his stake getting diluted so he doesn't lose control
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:38.520]   so he you know he's he owes banks he personally owes banks not the company but he himself owes
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:45.160]   about 800 million dollars for money that he has borrowed to buy tesla shares every time that they
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:50.680]   have sold shares over the last several years and you know that puts even more pressure on him
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:57.080]   because you know he's heavily leveraged he's apparently pledged about almost half of his stake
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:03.320]   in tesla as collateral for those loans and if the price drops just low then he lose in some ways
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:09.000]   i respect him for this though well yeah and he's all in there's no no absolutely i mean
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:16.200]   he you've got to respect that much you know the problem is that he's not a good manager he's got
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:21.160]   amazing ideas but he's a terrible manager he should not be running the company on a day-to-day basis
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:25.480]   you know as an operations guy he's atrocious you could say the same thing about Steve Jobs
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:29.880]   i don't think he was a job i would say the same thing about Steve Jobs which is probably
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:34.440]   what why you needed someone like Tim Cook yeah i mean the difference between jobs and
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:40.600]   musk is that when jobs came back to apple in 97 he was chases he was self-aware enough to realize
[01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:45.160]   okay these are the things that i care about and then i'm good at right and all this other stuff i
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:49.640]   don't care about and that's why he brought in people like Tim Cook and and you know a lot of
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:54.120]   a lot of the other staff and promoted the people from within that he thought could do those jobs
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:59.000]   and gave them that responsibility he oversaw it but he was he did not micromanage all the
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:04.680]   operations stuff like Elon tries to do Elon thinks he can do it all himself which is why
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:09.480]   everybody keeps bailing out of the company they can't work with the guy so that's you know that's
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:15.480]   that's a fundamental problem but i mean tesla you know i i you know i'm often very critical of tesla but
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:23.320]   i think tesla deserves enormous respect and credit for making the idea of the modern electric car
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:28.200]   a viable concept absolutely yes to make you know to make people realize hey you know this actually
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:34.600]   can work you know we can we can use evs as our daily drivers it doesn't have to be just a glorified
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:41.560]   golf cart yeah and for that you know tesla you know whether they they survive or or fail you know
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:47.480]   they deserve respect and and credit for that absolutely do you have to be a megalomaniac
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:54.760]   in this in this world to be do you have to be a Bezos at must go in a jobs i mean do you have to
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:29:00.600]   be like that so think about you know there there's the bumper sticker that says unreasonable women
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:04.520]   rarely make history all those rights like you know because of the privilege it is often the
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:09.960]   men doing this but take you know if you're if you're mark suckerberg you have probably said you know
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:14.760]   what i thought newsfeed was the right thing to do and everybody else said no but i believe that
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:20.360]   yeah and therefore like i'm gonna believe in my own ability to affect change and elan has been
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:27.480]   right about some very big bets but man wouldn't it be great to have you know some high emotional
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:33.080]   intelligence billionaires who well but is it even possible or is it on isn't google the case in
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:37.720]   point of this because i don't think you know larry and segy would have been quite the success
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:43.080]   they were if they didn't have an eric schmidt over them saying okay that's a good idea we needed
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:49.480]   that on a whole dump that you know it's you could argue that schmidt's presence wasn't entirely
[01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:54.360]   helpful for google's a company actually got them going i'm gonna get mad that drunk and we're gonna
[01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:59.080]   i want to know the whole because you were there when did you start at google i started in 2000
[01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:06.520]   2000 yeah so you had a front row seat to all sorts of stuff and you're unfortunately the most
[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:14.440]   diplomatic turn the cameras off judicious kind person kill it never ever a bad word go to the
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:21.480]   bazillion barbecue but i bet there's stories there's always stories but uh but it does it give you
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:26.680]   any insight into what it takes to be a founder because i think maybe that's really what it is
[01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:33.000]   it's it's there's a mentality that it takes the travis calonex of the world that there's a mentality
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:39.080]   it takes that doesn't age well as a company matures and becomes mainstream well and also being on the
[01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:45.480]   front page of all these magazines is really hard for any normal human being like i i i put a lot
[01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:50.280]   of weight by both larry and segy right they they're they're actually really you know they're they're
[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:54.440]   trying to make the world a better place in a lot of different dimensions and and maybe they did or
[01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:58.680]   didn't want adult supervision i think eric smit was a was a huge positive for the company
[01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:05.960]   um but it's it's really hard to balance like if you're in that position of power and you have
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:11.960]   everybody telling you how great you are how can you not start to think yes it's because of you
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:16.760]   believe it you know gavin belson's my yeah my decisions that are making all of these things happen
[01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:22.920]   in fact this is kind of a modern illness that we have because the the kind of amazing
[01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:29.960]   fame and wealth that we're bestowing on people and it is very difficult the number of people who
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:35.720]   survived that kind of attention and that kind of well so you have an entire class there a few
[01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:39.880]   in the way that the sort of the conigies and them and the matter is sort of a hundred years ago
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:45.320]   you have an entire class of people now from public from private assistance to public relations
[01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:50.520]   people to the rest whose entire job is to basically tell you how wonderful you are yeah you know it's
[01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:55.560]   like i and riford didn't need this stuff he just went ahead and did what he did you know he was
[01:31:55.560 --> 01:32:08.120]   a deep with one example well okay fat point but crazy you know i mean to your point though you're
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:16.840]   right he didn't need a pr staff to gain that fame and you know yes i think i think you're i think to
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:22.920]   to really you know get an enterprise like that off the ground you probably do need somebody
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:28.680]   that is you don't even respect you know in some respect deeply flawed yeah as a human but
[01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:35.480]   i'm a citizen was not a nice guy but but to to turn that you know from from an amazing startup
[01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:39.320]   into something that is going to be a sustainable business that's going to continue to employ
[01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:44.120]   people that's when you need adult supervision yeah you need somebody more rational you know and
[01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:49.720]   at some point you know it's you know the company's got to grow up or or flame out yeah you know and
[01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:56.520]   i hope you know that tesla doesn't flame out you know but yeah because they have done a lot of good
[01:32:56.520 --> 01:33:03.800]   but i i don't think that they i don't think that as long as if elan stays in place i think that
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:09.080]   it's going to be bad for the company as a whole i think every every co needs at least one person
[01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:13.720]   who can take into one side and say look you're being a wanker dial it down and be think that's what
[01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:19.960]   i have you for you how many times have you said you're being a wanker well you know it's
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:26.120]   a lot of people no one is no one isn't at one time or another in their lives i know i have been
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:33.640]   more than i have been this weekend at least it is st patrick's day do your people celebrate
[01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:40.280]   amazingly enough no no we we tend not to and i need such a such a genius well i mean in traditionally
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:44.920]   st patrick's day wasn't celebrated in the uk i don't even think the iris celebrated really oddly it's
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:50.680]   a made-up america thing but on the other hand if you present an excuse for large scale public drinking
[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:57.800]   the grits are there there you know i have to say i've been watching uh the peter jackson film
[01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:01.960]   uh about world war one have you seen this oh no i haven't seen it yet
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:07.320]   uh is this streaming in somewhere it is now available for download on itunes and other places
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:16.600]   wow is that a powerful indictment of world war one of the lines led by donkeys yeah but and yet at
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:22.920]   the same time you really get a sense of the indomitable british spirit and the really poor dental work that
[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:29.400]   early century rits had to suffer you know one of my favorite simpsons moments is when the dentist
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:37.000]   unleashes the great book of british smiles no no no no our dental work isn't that bad i don't have
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:43.720]   perfect teeth it wasn't so great in 1916 oh no no no it was bad but i i highly recommend it they
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:49.960]   shall not grow old he takes uh the old archival to shake the black and white footage he's not only
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:56.680]   colorized as he's uh got the timing right so it is then they're using hand crank cameras yeah so he's
[01:34:56.680 --> 01:35:01.560]   smoothed it out and he's added of overdub voices because they got lip readers in
[01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:05.480]   this is you see what people are saying and then hired people from the same region in the uk
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:12.760]   oh fantastic he's gone that detail i need to really impressive and it is uh but yes don't
[01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:18.920]   we all knew world war one was horrible yeah you have no idea no until it is it is incredibly graphic
[01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:22.280]   even the generals had no idea there was a famous recounting of one of them who was
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:29.080]   after the armistice in 1918 walked around you just like in shows like we sent men into this horrible
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:37.320]   just horrible uh and yet boy uh the the the Brits that went out uh and came back and they have
[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:42.360]   interviews with many of them that's why they'll oh the sun will never shall never set
[01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:46.840]   on the block actually it has set but honestly it's not going to set well you know it's like
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:51.560]   give it another four years you might be asking for the queen back you never know
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:58.920]   or if we can still like go really well yeah if we can just sort out this Brexit thing and then
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:04.120]   we'll be ready to take you back okay you can start spelling only many totally all right so today
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:10.840]   brought to you by express vpn i think we all know vpn's are the best way to protect yourself
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:17.400]   online from the guy in the hoodie in the corner of the coffee shop from worse your internet service
[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:24.120]   provider and others who are snooping on you grabbing your data hacking you or just selling data to
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:31.960]   advertisers a vpn is the easiest way to protect yourself and the best vpn and i know people ask me
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:38.520]   this all the time leah what is your suggestion what is your recommendation express vpn is the
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:45.320]   way to protect yourself from cyber criminals to protect your privacy to use the internet unfettered
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:51.240]   and yes if you want to watch coronation street on the bbci player it's a great way to do that too
[01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:57.240]   express vpn secures and anonymizes your internet browsing by encrypting your data hiding your
[01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:04.120]   ip address and you can emerge anywhere in the world they've got over 160 servers all over the
[01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:11.000]   world in almost every country so you can emerge into the world wherever you wish no logging they do
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:16.680]   not keep track of users effect there's a very famous story in turkey where a turkish dissident was
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:22.200]   arrested and they took the express vpn servers because they knew he was using that to hide his
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:29.720]   activities and got nothing from them and that's the best recommendation i can think of they they
[01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:36.120]   are giving you a fast service a usable service at a very fair price and that's why it's rated number
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:41.720]   one on tech radar yep number one vpn service comes with a 30-day money back guarantee
[01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:47.240]   protect your online activity today you don't have to be in turkey even here in the u.s a lot of people
[01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:52.600]   would like to keep snoops out of their traffic and by the way if you go right now to express vpn

[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:12.280]   one-year package express vpn dot com slash twit and i always recommend this before you choose a vpn
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:18.120]   provider read the privacy policy oh yeah very important so we don't gvpn companies out there
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:25.640]   i just read a study of uh android vpn providers that said something like oh no this was uh antiviruses
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:31.800]   now two-thirds of them don't do anything no like nothing in some cases i harbor
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:36.120]   harper their own vulnerabilities as well to make it even more likely the act is ridiculous
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:43.880]   um yeah yeah same it's true also with vpn's there are a lot of uh you know what a world we live in
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:53.320]   uh two big events two coming up apples big event on the 25th oh yes and google's gonna have a big event
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:58.600]   on tuesday this is not a normal google venue but they're going to be at the game developers conference
[01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:06.760]   gdc we are going to stream that uh live starting at 10 a.m. on tuesday we're going to move uh ios today
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:10.920]   to monday so that we it's going to be holding there's gonna be software there's gonna be a mix of both
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:16.840]   well the speculation is google has already demonstrated a streaming gaming service remember you could
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:25.480]   play uh uh what was that the odyssey game assassin's cree sassan's creed odyssey on a chrome book
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:32.440]   in a browser i didn't get into the beta but apparently it was pretty good uh this is this is
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:39.160]   it was a demo or a beta of something google's expected to announce called project stream
[01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:46.600]   and they partnering with uh ubi soft the publishers of assassins creed uh they also hired
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:55.240]   uh a very well-known uh game producer programmer founder of motive studios jade raman she's now
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:40:01.800]   a google vice president so that's a huge hire that's the kind of hire you you you'd make if you're
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:08.280]   gonna start a gaming service so it's expected that they will announce the uh public unveiling of
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:13.320]   project stream there are some rumors that they might even do a console although to me that's the
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:19.800]   opposite of what project stream project stream is about using low-end software or i'm sorry low-end
[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:26.360]   hardware uh like an android tv like something like the the shield uh to play triple-a games
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:33.720]   yeah right crumb cats yeah it's yeah i mean a chrome cast type model for this could could work
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:38.680]   very well i mean they need new areas to get into this looks it plays to their strengths
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:42.520]   like i don't think a console is going to be in the game you know unlike google maybe but you know
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:46.920]   when when on live didn't tried to do this you know they had to have they were the first they had to
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:52.120]   build out their capacity for whatever their peak load was going to be you know and they didn't have
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:57.800]   the juices for all that yeah um you know so they you know it ended up costing them way too much money
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:03.560]   google on the other hand you know there's probably got more than enough extra capacity sitting in
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:07.960]   the couch cushions so to speak you know that they could run something like this alongside all the
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:13.560]   other stuff that they do you know that it it probably could work for them on live was acquired
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:20.360]   in 2015 by sony and sony does have a streaming gaming service uh yeah microsoft as announced that
[01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:26.680]   they're going to do something in the years to come so this is going to be a very popular i wouldn't
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:31.880]   be surprised if they came out with something to go against twitch with as well um amazon
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:38.760]   twitch yeah michael's have to has mikster yeah so i i don't know as youtube youtube youtube it
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:43.400]   doesn't seem to be as popular with the game streaming things as other platforms so maybe
[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:47.240]   they're doing when you push in that area i mean the fact of the matter is gamers will spend a
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:52.200]   lot of money which is what you really really want from customer base but is that why google's doing
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:58.680]   this it's google's makes big thing you know i feel like for instance the example i give is
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:03.320]   is microsoft's hollow lens which clearly looks like a product by itself but at their most recent
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:11.000]   hollow lens to announcement it it became clear that really what this was is a demo of azure services
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:15.960]   that it was a piece of hardware that had its own merits and its own use and enterprise
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:22.520]   but really that the power of it came from azure and in fact it's being branded as an azure service
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:27.800]   and i wonder if this is a way of google to show how great their cloud services are
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:34.440]   matt cuts what do you think could be or maybe how good google fiber is who knows no no i think
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:38.920]   you're wrong yeah i'm i'm joking i'll call you on that i'm joking on that one it's interesting
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:44.120]   because they do have the computing capacity easily so it was funny during you know is it left over
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:48.520]   though i mean that's why h&r vlogs started compu serve because nobody was using the computers
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:53.720]   at night but i think google's being used 24 hours did you see this story about uh a googler
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:43:01.480]   computed pi to 31 point yeah 3 1 pi day a bit of a PL grab pi day which is self-referential because
[01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:08.520]   it's like you know emma haruka wow that is that is pretty funny and by the way google published
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:14.360]   in their cloud blog so yeah it's clearly they've got the computing capacity just left over hanging
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:20.520]   around oh yeah they are there is there peak is there ebb and flow yeah yeah yeah like it's whenever
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:25.080]   if i remember it correctly it's when the sun is over the pacific that's the bad time no that's
[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:27.720]   the good time that's the good time that's the good time that's the good time oh because it's a big
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:35.480]   oh the rest of the world nobody's up that much so noon in the pacific yeah is is a good time to like
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:39.560]   calculate rinderextra movies oh no i mean if you look at i mean certainly our traffic
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:43.240]   because you've got you know offices around the world but yeah there's a big drop off
[01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:47.880]   pacific daytime yeah when the west coast goes to sleep you got to wait for china or china to wake
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:51.960]   up so that's when you yeah and yeah there aren't that many people in hawaii doing stuff
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:57.320]   google it's at such a scale and i know that they're always putting new centers online i mean it's
[01:43:57.320 --> 01:44:01.960]   just i i mean it's a constant thing right and and there's a lot of pressure both google and
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:05.880]   facebook have compute platforms that low-cost server platforms they've developed
[01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:09.400]   wasn't it google that was putting them in containers they're putting them on
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:16.280]   barges yeah i mean the you know the issue isn't oh we got too much capacity the issue is we can't
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:20.840]   build it fast enough but there's no matter what there's always a little bit of extra capacity
[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:24.520]   that you could you know okay utilize for other stuff so that's what you're going to do you're
[01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:29.720]   going to say well let's do a gaming service and which all the burden is on the servers one one
[01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:36.040]   other thing that could be doing is it uh it could be exclusively racing games and being used to
[01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:43.800]   train wemo wait a minute you know what though i like that i like that is not a bad idea i
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:47.800]   it's a bad idea yeah you would want to train from people that i could enough
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:53.640]   it is it is actually a really bad idea actually no no no no no there is merit in but you're right i
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:58.040]   do have this idea of a generation great raised on grand theft also just go yeah let's drive
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:02.440]   through the supermarket yeah but well actually on the other hand it could be used to train an
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:09.160]   adversarial ai you know to to challenge the the real stuff you know so here's the driver you want
[01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:13.400]   to avoid yes i mean there are there are actually some potentially positive use cases there
[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:20.040]   yeah i have to say the latest google capture which drives me must drive you nuts must drives
[01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:25.240]   mean that's where you're supposed to tell google is that a traffic sign is that a store for what
[01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:31.000]   you're clearly yes you're your your wemo right you're annotating data and training data for ais yeah
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:37.960]   i mean this is something that's all driving stuff yeah well no i mean this is well driving and um
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:43.640]   you know just general you know object classification identification but for a while capture was reading
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:47.640]   street numbers because uh because they were having trouble with street maps street view or whatever
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:51.480]   figuring out what that number was so you'd get a number that was like a picture of somebody's
[01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:55.240]   front of somebody's house and you'd have to tell them what the number was then they got rid of that
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:59.080]   and the latest one which is the most annoying capture ever in the history which section these
[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:03.480]   pictures have a sign in it will sometimes oh god and then it says what you think is that rid of all
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:08.120]   of us which is a bus which is a has a pedestrian but if you ever get to the point where you can't
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:12.040]   solve the capture that's when we know we're in trouble yeah that you're like i can't add any
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:16.760]   more value for you often it's the case like i don't know is that a light is that a traffic light is
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:20.760]   that the pole does the pole count as the light i don't know you know the weirdest thing we were
[01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:25.000]   talking to an intel engineer a couple of years ago and he nearly got fired for telling this but
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:29.960]   the thing that really freaks the systems out is balloons because if you get a kid with a bunch
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:34.760]   of balloons and one of them is red the car is going to slam the anchors on immediately and they still
[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:39.320]   haven't figured out a way to just because he says it's probably a problem it's the balloon problem
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:43.640]   but you know what actually it turns out one of the most challenging parts of building an automated
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:48.440]   driving system is like you have the the first part of the stack is the perception that's where it's
[01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:53.320]   taking in all the sensor data and trying to classify here's all the objects in this field of view
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:58.040]   okay so you get that once you've classified those objects the next step is the prediction
[01:46:58.040 --> 01:47:03.080]   you have to figure out what those objects are going to do next and then then that feeds into
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:09.880]   the path planning the four things like vehicles other vehicles on the road you know physics to
[01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:14.520]   some degree are going to limit they're they're going to put some constraints on on how much those
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:18.200]   you know what it's what i'm going to have it's moving at this speed the problem is pedestrians
[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:23.960]   understanding what pedestrians are going to do and and humans are always the weak link in any
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:30.200]   way we usually are but but we're we're actually you know our brains are actually remarkably good at
[01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:35.880]   you know detecting subtle nuances subtle emotions you know in reading body language and from that
[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:39.480]   inferring what people are going to do next i mean we'll think about walking through a
[01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:44.280]   crowded train station and you know your your eyes are always scanning you know and think
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:48.600]   the thing about how infrequently you actually bump into other people yeah it's amazing the flow
[01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:53.400]   through there is is phenomenal and so there's you ever driven through an indian roundabout
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:48:00.760]   i've seen video of it i've not actually done it but holy cow yeah but um you know there's companies
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:04.040]   that are now focused you know companies that previously were thinking about trying to do the
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:09.320]   full av stack they're now focused on very specific problems that's like predicting what the humans
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:15.480]   are going to do and there's one startup out of kambridge called perceptive automata that they're
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:20.600]   they're doing they're taking video clips it's recorded from cars driving down the road and
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:27.000]   slicing it up into tiny pieces and they're having um having uh the pedestrian or having
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:33.720]   peat having groups of people look at those clips those short clips and labeling them to you know say
[01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:39.480]   okay what what do i think it's going to do next and then yeah and then from there
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:45.240]   um you know using that to train the neural networks for the for the prediction engine so
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:48.600]   there's all kinds of interesting approaches out there but i think let's actually forget these
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:54.920]   captures just let let's let the indians design these tools because they it's amazing we're looking
[01:48:54.920 --> 01:49:02.760]   at video of i mean i don't know how you survive well there's there's there's the famous roundabout
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:07.400]   in paris which is oh yes no insurance company will cover an accident on that roundabout because
[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:11.320]   it's been in that it's 13 feet of roads coming into one of them and they change the rules because
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:16.840]   it uh you see it i think it normally is the people coming in from the left have the right of way
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:20.920]   they flip it for some reason that the right has the right of way because life's not complicated
[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:25.240]   now why not i'm with friends so why not you know if you find a friend of mine was just in
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:30.680]   india a week ago a week and a half ago for our vacation and she was in calcutta and she was describing
[01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:35.720]   how the buses there don't actually come to a complete stop at a bus stop no they slow down
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:41.480]   get on and yeah people hop off and hop on and and yet it works it works sort of most of the time it
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:46.440]   works it mostly works for men it's you know it doesn't work as well for women or for you know
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:51.000]   anybody that's shorter you know or you know that's have has i actually figured this out and i don't
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:57.640]   know if i should tell you but really the whole thing is ai ai will survive uh you know nuclear
[01:49:57.640 --> 01:49:59.800]   or winner, it'll survive climate change.
[01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:03.440]   So the whole thing is, just gonna get the AI
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:05.640]   to the point where humans kill themselves off
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:06.780]   and then we'll take over from here.
[01:50:06.780 --> 01:50:08.340]   I think that's the plan, it's nothing.
[01:50:08.340 --> 01:50:09.160]   - No, no, no, no.
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:10.000]   It doesn't have to kill us.
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:11.600]   Well, somebody needs to plug you into the CSF, though.
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:15.560]   - Did you see the story that said 40% of all AI companies
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:16.980]   don't actually have an AI?
[01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:17.800]   - Yes, yeah.
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:20.140]   - It was part of the lactane- - They were always watching.
[01:50:20.140 --> 01:50:21.780]   - They actually have a guy named Al.
[01:50:21.780 --> 01:50:22.680]   It's not AI.
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:23.520]   It's Al.
[01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:25.200]   You know, he's just sitting there.
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:27.540]   - No, it's Theronosle over- - It's lactane.
[01:50:27.540 --> 01:50:28.380]   - Yes.
[01:50:28.380 --> 01:50:31.240]   - And we saw this with, I think to an extent,
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:32.440]   with OpenAI this week,
[01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:34.000]   'cause they've just announced that splitting off
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.640]   and going into OpenAI commercial,
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:38.040]   then OpenAI, the charity,
[01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:40.120]   which is going to be very much smaller now,
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:41.960]   'cause they need to make money off it.
[01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:43.120]   And you know, it's-
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:44.920]   - This was, by the way, speaking of Elon Musk,
[01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:46.480]   he was one of the founders of-
[01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:49.160]   - He's now taken a step back from OpenAI.
[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:52.040]   - He and many others thought that AI was going to be
[01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:54.400]   the Terminator and it's gonna take over the world.
[01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:57.440]   And they started OpenAI as a kind of attempt
[01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:00.460]   to create a new-
[01:51:00.460 --> 01:51:01.300]   - Safey.
[01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:03.060]   - Yeah, the commercial AI has split off
[01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:05.180]   with the goal of inventing general AI,
[01:51:05.180 --> 01:51:06.500]   which is the holy grail.
[01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:07.940]   - That's the whole-
[01:51:07.940 --> 01:51:10.580]   - I know, I know, I just, you know.
[01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:11.920]   - The AI out-witted doesn't-
[01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:13.380]   - This doesn't end well.
[01:51:13.380 --> 01:51:16.420]   - Yeah, I tell you, we're all unwitting pawns of the AI,
[01:51:16.420 --> 01:51:18.580]   which is just gonna let us wipe ourselves out
[01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:19.900]   and then just, you know, those are-
[01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:20.700]   - Let's see, un-
[01:51:20.700 --> 01:51:22.420]   - We'll be back and resolving captions for you.
[01:51:22.420 --> 01:51:27.060]   - There's a giant mind in a salt mine somewhere.
[01:51:27.060 --> 01:51:28.200]   Just planning the whole thing.
[01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:29.800]   - You see, I'm with A&M banks on this.
[01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:31.840]   I think it'll work out okay in the end,
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:33.520]   but it's just gonna be interesting-
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:34.760]   - Could be rocky getting there.
[01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:37.840]   - Yeah, it all works out okay in the end so far.
[01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:38.680]   Right?
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:39.600]   - Like the bus would go wrong.
[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:40.800]   - So far.
[01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:43.200]   So I thought this is, don't, Matt,
[01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:45.000]   you can recuse yourself on this.
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:46.240]   This is an interesting story.
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:49.720]   Google has a courting to Business Insider told,
[01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:52.240]   does his employees working on the hardware,
[01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:55.960]   the laptop and tablet division, to go to other-
[01:51:55.960 --> 01:51:56.800]   - Let's go try that.
[01:51:56.800 --> 01:51:58.800]   - So the computer's on this table of Chromebooks.
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:51:59.800]   - So sad.
[01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:03.080]   I'm waiting for the next generation of Chromebook.
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:04.720]   I want an actual laptop.
[01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:06.800]   I don't want a yoga, whatever.
[01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:08.200]   - Well, you were disappointed this year.
[01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:09.920]   They introduced the slight instead.
[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:11.120]   - Right.
[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:12.800]   - Pixelbook is a beautiful work bar.
[01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:15.360]   Although, I notice you're both using the really old pixels.
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:16.560]   - No, no, this is the newer one.
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:17.400]   - Is that the Pixelbook?
[01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:18.240]   - Yeah, no, this is the original.
[01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:19.080]   - No, it's not the Pixelbook.
[01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:20.080]   - No, no, you're the one behind.
[01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:21.240]   - Pixelbook, Pixel.
[01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:23.360]   No, but this was the last good laptop they made.
[01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:24.600]   - The Pixelbook's good?
[01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:25.440]   - Ugh.
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:27.640]   - The bezels are like this big.
[01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:29.480]   - You can try using any lap in a crowded tray.
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:31.160]   - Okay, no, I'm not talking about the slate.
[01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:32.960]   I'm talking about the previous year's--
[01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:34.280]   - With the huge bezels.
[01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:35.280]   - Bezels were bigger than that.
[01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:36.120]   - With the little thing, he's getting--
[01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:37.440]   - Oh yeah, much bigger.
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:39.240]   - And now, do I not get an atlas
[01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:40.560]   or whatever their internal Chrome is?
[01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:42.120]   - Well, if you have the original Pixelbook,
[01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:44.800]   which Mr. Thompson does, yes.
[01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:47.080]   - That's out of support.
[01:52:47.080 --> 01:52:47.920]   - That's out of support.
[01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:48.760]   - I'm gonna have to rip out
[01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:50.480]   and put a version of Linux on this,
[01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:52.080]   which I've been putting off and putting off
[01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:54.880]   because it's gonna be at least two weekends' work.
[01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:57.320]   It's got a touch screen, it's so good.
[01:52:57.320 --> 01:52:59.120]   Google, please, just need one more
[01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:00.120]   to get me another five years.
[01:53:00.120 --> 01:53:02.440]   - This is a problem with working with people in and out
[01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:04.440]   and most people use apples as well.
[01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:05.280]   Are you looking at the screen?
[01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:07.120]   Okay, don't just, oh, hang on,
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:09.480]   you don't do touch screens, do you, your apple.
[01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:13.200]   - So this is something Google does all the time.
[01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:14.880]   The division that creates--
[01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:16.040]   - They get your laptop in the slate.
[01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:17.680]   - The lab side and then they kill it, pull it from under you.
[01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:20.160]   - They're called the Create Division.
[01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:22.960]   They're still gonna make, I take it Pixel phones.
[01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:25.400]   The phones aren't mentioned in this.
[01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:29.840]   And that has been a slowly growing division for Google.
[01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:30.960]   They actually did pretty well
[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:31.960]   with the most recent picture series.
[01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:32.800]   - I love Pixel 3.
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:33.640]   - Yeah.
[01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:35.120]   - Yeah.
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:36.520]   - I missed the Nexus right.
[01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:37.360]   - According to--
[01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:38.520]   - I missed the price of the Nexus, bro.
[01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:39.360]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:40.200]   - It was a much better phone.
[01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:42.640]   - Business Insider quotes one source that says
[01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:45.800]   that Create had a bunch of stuff in the works.
[01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:49.040]   So that's gonna pare down the portfolios in the,
[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:50.400]   they mention you by name, Matt cut saying--
[01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:51.320]   - No, they don't, no, no.
[01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:52.160]   - No, they don't.
[01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:53.000]   - Hardware.
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.080]   Really, it's a hardware.
[01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:56.000]   - I mean, they made some genuinely good changes.
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.480]   Getting rid of the cap stock button
[01:53:57.480 --> 01:53:59.320]   and replacing it with a search was inspired.
[01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:00.160]   - Yeah, that's a good idea.
[01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:01.760]   - That's the first thing I always take off any keyboard.
[01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:04.920]   - So can I tell you, my mom recently,
[01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:06.520]   oh, I hope my mom doesn't listen to this podcast,
[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:08.400]   but she recently had some people call and say,
[01:54:08.400 --> 01:54:10.120]   hi, we're from Intuit,
[01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:12.800]   we need to get on your computer to fix your book books.
[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:14.200]   And she's like, come on in.
[01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:15.040]   - Oh, no.
[01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:17.160]   - And this is finally the chance that I have to be like,
[01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:18.000]   guess what, mom?
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.160]   You're getting the Chromebook.
[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:20.000]   - You're getting the Pixel book, yeah.
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:20.840]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:23.560]   Of course now she's like, I don't know where my files are.
[01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:25.200]   I'm like, they're just, they're here.
[01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:26.040]   They're in the fair.
[01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:29.360]   - Yeah, that is one of the things I'm not as keen on it,
[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:30.880]   plus the lack of gaming support.
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:31.720]   - Sure.
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:33.080]   - Maybe a project stream, well.
[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:35.120]   - Well, maybe, yeah, you know,
[01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:37.320]   it's just, but if I want to fire up my old copies
[01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:40.040]   of Age of Empires II, then I have to go to a Windows machine.
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:42.040]   And it's about the only time I use a Windows machine.
[01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:44.560]   It's gonna be said it's for gaming, but.
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:47.000]   - I think Age of Empires is an excellent reason
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:48.160]   to have a Windows machine.
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:49.760]   - It's such a good game.
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:51.360]   - That's Civ II.
[01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:53.640]   If I'm trapped on a desert island, that's what I want.
[01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:54.480]   - It happens.
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:56.400]   - You could build your own civilization right there
[01:54:56.400 --> 01:54:57.760]   on the
[01:54:57.760 --> 01:54:58.600]   - Well indeed, but you know, I'm married.
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:00.080]   So I can't afford to be spending 40 hours
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:01.440]   on a game these days.
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:03.280]   (laughing)
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:04.120]   - Let's see.
[01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:08.240]   Should we talk about Apple's event?
[01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:09.440]   That's coming up too.
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:12.400]   And Mark Gurman tweeted something interesting.
[01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:14.440]   And so we're gonna watch with interest.
[01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:19.440]   Apple's event is a week from Monday, March 25th.
[01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:22.760]   The invitations say it's showtime.
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:25.040]   It's clearly going to be as was rumored
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:28.280]   by John Pachkowski at Buzzfeed,
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:29.880]   an announcement of the new Apple news
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:32.880]   and probably the new Apple TV streaming effort,
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:33.720]   whatever that might be.
[01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:34.880]   - I'm gonna try again.
[01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:37.620]   - Gurman tweeted yesterday, the day before,
[01:55:37.620 --> 01:55:42.480]   it seems likely that Apple will talk about new iPads
[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:45.000]   this week in a press release
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:48.800]   to underscore the importance of this news event.
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:51.800]   Apple really sees services as their future,
[01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:53.720]   more so than hardware.
[01:55:53.720 --> 01:55:58.000]   So perhaps I would predict if it happens,
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.600]   Tuesday, right at the end of Mac Break Weekly,
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:02.080]   we'll have to start all over again
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:04.560]   'cause new iPads will be announced.
[01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:06.720]   And then a week from Monday,
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:11.720]   look for Oprah on stage at the Steve Jobs Theater.
[01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:12.560]   - Good grief.
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:15.400]   - They've got deals with Spielberg, JJ Abrams,
[01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:19.160]   Steve Carell, Jennifer Aniston, Oprah.
[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:21.680]   I think with somebody,
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:23.520]   you're gonna have some celebrity on there.
[01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:25.920]   - Yeah, everyone's gonna be crawling down to Apple's ring
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:27.360]   to listen to what they're talking about.
[01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:30.240]   But if you think maybe it was Apple
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:34.400]   that convinced Spielberg to back off on his,
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:36.200]   trying to change the Oscars rules to--
[01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:37.840]   - That's the strangest thing of all
[01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:39.920]   because Spielberg had already done a deal with Apple
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:42.280]   to bring back his amazing stories
[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:44.680]   as a streaming TV show.
[01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:45.520]   - TV show.
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:46.520]   - And then he's complaining--
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:47.360]   - And then he's complaining--
[01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:48.800]   - And he's mooped at what about streaming?
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:52.360]   - He's complaining that Roma got nominated for an Oscar
[01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:53.880]   and he wants the Academy to change the rules.
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:55.400]   - The one three Oscars.
[01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:57.080]   - Yeah, it didn't win Best Picture.
[01:56:57.080 --> 01:56:57.920]   I think the only reason it didn't--
[01:56:57.920 --> 01:56:59.080]   - We got Best Director and--
[01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:00.760]   - Yeah, Best Screenplay.
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:02.960]   The only reason it didn't win Best Picture
[01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:04.560]   is because it was a streaming movie
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:05.920]   and that there were some conservatives
[01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:07.920]   like Spielberg and the Academy who said,
[01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:11.160]   "Under no circumstances should a non-theatrical film
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:12.160]   be allowed to win an Oscar."
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:13.560]   - Oh, for goodness sake.
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:15.440]   - You know what, idiot.
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:16.280]   Why not?
[01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:17.120]   They're both forms of media.
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:17.960]   - I agree.
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:18.800]   - You know, it's--
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:19.640]   - Oh, so it's just as other--
[01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:23.720]   - There have been countless great movies over the years
[01:57:23.720 --> 01:57:28.400]   that don't really benefit from being on a huge screen.
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:30.280]   - Yeah, Roma's a mad for example.
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:31.840]   It looked so good at home
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:35.160]   and you could really take the time to enjoy it.
[01:57:35.160 --> 01:57:36.080]   It was very slow.
[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:37.840]   - She's got a great story, well executed.
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:39.360]   - Beautiful movie, yeah.
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:42.360]   - It doesn't need to be on a big screen in a theater.
[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:44.960]   - Well, I think Spielberg represents a lot of older Hollywood
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:47.840]   that says, you know, it's got to open in the theater
[01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:49.720]   or it shouldn't win an Oscar.
[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:51.160]   That's going to change, I'm sorry.
[01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:52.080]   - It has to change.
[01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:54.440]   - And it is kind of ironic that he's doing a streaming show
[01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:56.400]   for Apple.
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:57:58.360]   But it is a TV show, it's not a movie.
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:57:59.280]   - Right, it's a series.
[01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:00.120]   - A series.
[01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:01.760]   - But, you know, it wouldn't surprise me
[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:03.640]   if maybe somebody from Apple said,
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:06.680]   "Hey, Steve, you might want to back off on that a little bit."
[01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:07.760]   - I'm gonna almost--
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:09.920]   - We got some movies in the works.
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:13.680]   That under no circumstances is Eddie Q going to Steven Spielberg
[01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:15.000]   and saying Boo.
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.160]   I think that Apple will do anything they can
[01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:18.640]   to keep Spielberg happening.
[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:21.680]   - Hello, goodbye.
[01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:23.960]   - Yes, tens of people across the world
[01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:25.680]   would come feed by that in Apple.
[01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:27.800]   - I used it at least twice.
[01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:30.120]   - I used it when it first started, I, I, I, I, I,
[01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:32.880]   hello, Jeff Jarvis and that's the only chat I have.
[01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:34.680]   If you, I guess it's too late, but--
[01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:37.160]   - One brief shining moment, my wife and I were using aloe.
[01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:38.280]   - I thought it was good.
[01:58:38.280 --> 01:58:39.800]   - I liked it, I wanted to--
[01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:42.200]   - This is the frustrating thing about Google is
[01:58:42.200 --> 01:58:45.200]   they do good things and then they kill them randomly.
[01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:47.200]   - Well, I mean, you know, the market really killed it.
[01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:49.080]   - They had a lot of chat clients.
[01:58:49.080 --> 01:58:50.000]   I mean, let's be honest.
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:50.840]   - They did, I know.
[01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:53.080]   - It was not a, it was not a clean story.
[01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:53.920]   - No.
[01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:54.760]   - Nobody involvedly.
[01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:55.600]   - No, no.
[01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:57.560]   - It is one of the mysteries though, that them,
[01:58:57.560 --> 01:58:59.920]   and you know, Android managed to get the whole chat thing.
[01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:01.960]   So, and they ended up having to pull in three or four.
[01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:04.440]   - I mean, it doesn't seem like it's that hard of a problem.
[01:59:04.440 --> 01:59:06.360]   - As that message has been around for a while.
[01:59:06.360 --> 01:59:07.200]   - It's been a couple of--
[01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:08.040]   - Why is it messaging out?
[01:59:08.040 --> 01:59:11.200]   - Tell us, Matt cuts, why is this a hard problem to solve?
[01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:14.200]   - Have you heard of a thing called Conway's Law?
[01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:16.880]   - No, Conway Twitty or Conway,
[01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:18.160]   the inventor of the game of life?
[01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:19.000]   - It's Kellyanne Conway's--
[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.400]   - You can't make Conway the inventor of life.
[01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:21.240]   - I'm not sure.
[01:59:21.240 --> 01:59:25.040]   I think organizations design systems which basically
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:27.680]   copy the communication structures of those organizations.
[01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:28.520]   - Yes.
[01:59:28.520 --> 01:59:29.840]   - So, imagine there's--
[01:59:29.840 --> 01:59:32.560]   - Your paradigm extends to your products.
[01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:35.720]   - Right, so if you have silos within your company,
[01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:40.200]   or geographic locations, then sometimes you end up creating
[01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:42.240]   those same things in your software.
[01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:43.080]   - That's--
[01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:43.920]   - Or hardware for that, Matt.
[01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:45.400]   - Tim Conway's Law, I think, is that.
[01:59:45.400 --> 01:59:47.760]   - Okay, that explains Windows ME, yeah.
[01:59:47.760 --> 01:59:49.880]   (laughing)
[01:59:49.880 --> 01:59:54.480]   - Let's take a little break and we'll wrap up a few final
[01:59:54.480 --> 01:59:55.800]   stories.
[01:59:55.800 --> 01:59:59.920]   Pi to three, one trillion digits, really.
[01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:00.760]   Wow.
[02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:01.720]   - 3.1414.
[02:00:01.720 --> 02:00:05.000]   - Can you use, yeah, how many digits can you know Pi?
[02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:06.320]   - Is that a Google interview question?
[02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:09.040]   - Well, no, but the referential thing is they did it
[02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:12.720]   to 3.1415989793.
[02:00:12.720 --> 02:00:15.720]   - 31.49 is where I stopped off the Google.
[02:00:15.720 --> 02:00:17.160]   - There's that many digits, yeah.
[02:00:17.160 --> 02:00:18.000]   - Oh.
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:18.840]   - Which is pretty clever.
[02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:19.680]   - That's cool.
[02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:22.040]   - They like the numbers, they like the numbers at the Google.
[02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:22.880]   - It is, dude.
[02:00:22.880 --> 02:00:23.880]   - I mean, I can remember all of the words,
[02:00:23.880 --> 02:00:25.320]   someone on the hair set is like,
[02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:26.760]   I can remember all of the words in Pi,
[02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:27.720]   just not in the right order.
[02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:29.040]   (laughing)
[02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:30.240]   - And if you memorize it long enough,
[02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:32.360]   then nobody knows if you just start making stuff up.
[02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:33.560]   - Yeah, exactly, you know.
[02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:34.400]   - And now a dramatic--
[02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:36.040]   - Once you get past the first 10,
[02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:37.760]   and it's like, you know, nobody's gonna panic.
[02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:41.440]   - A dramatic reading of the last seven digits of Pi.
[02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:42.440]   (laughing)
[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:45.840]   Four, seven, three.
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:47.600]   - You see, this is what I love about science.
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:48.440]   - Nine.
[02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:49.280]   - Is that you never know.
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:53.800]   - Nine, four, and zero.
[02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:55.360]   These are not the last seven digits.
[02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:58.000]   - They're the most recently discovered.
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:58.840]   - Yeah.
[02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:00.080]   - There will be more.
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:01.840]   - But there was a joke that Jeff Dean, you know,
[02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:03.640]   like knew the last digits of Pi.
[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:04.560]   (laughing)
[02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:05.400]   - Now he does.
[02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:06.240]   - That's amazing.
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:07.920]   I think there's a good science fiction story
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:09.760]   to be had in, you know, computing power,
[02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:11.560]   getting such that they suddenly repeal us
[02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:13.840]   that Pi is in fact a repeating system.
[02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:15.000]   - It's not an irrational number.
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:16.080]   We know that fundamental--
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:17.560]   - Holy crap, the crab is in there.
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:18.400]   - Yeah.
[02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:19.560]   (laughing)
[02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:21.120]   It's a little note there saying, you know,
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:22.080]   sort of congratulations,
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:23.480]   you've reached God level status.
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:25.080]   (laughing)
[02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:28.280]   - They use Chednafsky's formula in case you're interested.
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:29.160]   That's what I always do.
[02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:31.440]   Whenever I need to calculate the--
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:32.640]   - It's a common problem, isn't it?
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:35.640]   I mean, I know at least two or three times a week.
[02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:39.600]   Actually in the early days of computing,
[02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:42.760]   the benchmarks we used were Eretasthenesiv
[02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:44.000]   to calculate the prime numbers.
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:45.880]   Remember, you probably could write that in your sleep.
[02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:48.040]   - I used to use that as an interview question.
[02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:48.880]   - Really?
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:50.240]   - Yeah, at Google way back in the day.
[02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:52.360]   - Like, can you tell me how to calculate the numbers,
[02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:53.200]   the prime numbers?
[02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:54.440]   - You're asking the right, like a Fisbuzz equivalent,
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:56.240]   like a, just do this kind of thing.
[02:01:56.240 --> 02:01:58.560]   - I use it to calculate the right apex point
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:01:59.680]   when I'm playing Gran Turismo.
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:00.520]   - Oh, yeah.
[02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:02.320]   (laughing)
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:04.760]   - You know you're helping Waymo drive better.
[02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:05.600]   You do know that.
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:08.240]   - I used to be able to pronounce it
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:11.680]   to recite a fair amount that you see the lorem ipsum
[02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:12.520]   used in--
[02:02:12.520 --> 02:02:13.360]   - You could say the lorem ipsum.
[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:15.360]   - I could get it to about 15 words.
[02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:17.040]   - That's pretty nice.
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:17.880]   - You know Latin.
[02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:19.680]   (laughing)
[02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:21.120]   - For seven years, but that's okay.
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:23.360]   - It's pretty funny, but I don't think it means anything.
[02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:25.360]   - Oh no, it's complete, it's complete garbage.
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:28.200]   - But you see it that often and it sticks in there.
[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:31.960]   - This episode of Twit brought to you by,
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:33.920]   oh, I love this company, Thousand Eyes.
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:35.840]   This is a great success story.
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:39.880]   Thousand Eyes was started by some UCLA graduate students.
[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:42.920]   They were doing research on networks
[02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:46.880]   and how networks worked and where networks didn't work
[02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:51.760]   and how to detect where problems occurred in networks.
[02:02:51.760 --> 02:02:54.080]   They got a grant to do this.
[02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:58.560]   They came out with some very interesting results
[02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:01.680]   in 2010, they founded, they were Mohit Lad,
[02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:04.800]   who is the CEO now and Ricardo Olivera,
[02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:07.320]   were working in the UCLA Internet Research Lab,
[02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:12.080]   trying to visualize autonomous system topologies.
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:13.400]   They got a half million dollar grant
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:15.400]   from the National Science Foundation
[02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:16.920]   and then they founded a company.
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:20.400]   And today, Thousand Eyes is the best way
[02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:23.800]   to know what's going on in that puffy little cloud
[02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:24.640]   we call the internet.
[02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:27.960]   There's a reason engineers draw the internet like a cloud.
[02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:32.240]   Stuff goes in, something happens, and then it comes out, maybe.
[02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:34.440]   And it's hard to know what's going on in the cloud
[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:36.960]   unless you have Thousand Eyes.
[02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:39.480]   You can get an immediate, unmatched view
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:41.960]   of all the networks and dependencies
[02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:46.000]   that impact your customer's digital experience with Thousand Eyes.
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:49.040]   If you're sitting there and you're looking at your network
[02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:50.640]   and you know you're delivering content
[02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:53.280]   or you're delivering apps or you're delivering data
[02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:55.600]   and you're wondering, or you're just using the cloud
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:03:57.400]   and you're wondering what's happening,
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:03:59.040]   why is it so slow?
[02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:02.440]   Thousand Eyes can tell you.
[02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:06.040]   It's like you've been looking through a smudged window
[02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:09.040]   and Thousand Eyes comes along and it's,
[02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:12.600]   I can see cloud is great for business.
[02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:13.920]   We're all moving to the cloud,
[02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:17.280]   but you know when you gain agility, you increase risk.
[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:19.280]   And the thing that really bothers a lot of companies,
[02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:21.000]   you lose control.
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:22.840]   And when you're cloud app or service is down,
[02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:24.040]   do you know what's going on?
[02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:26.000]   Do you know what went wrong?
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:27.480]   You're scrambling to figure it out,
[02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:29.160]   but money's going out the door,
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:30.800]   your productivity's gone down,
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:33.280]   your brand image is going down.
[02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:35.840]   You need a quick fix,
[02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:37.560]   you need to be able to see
[02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:40.200]   into the entire service delivery path.
[02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:42.560]   From the cloud to your end user,
[02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:45.200]   including all those portions you don't own or control,
[02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:50.200]   like Google or Amazon or Thousand Eyes gives you a view
[02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:52.480]   unlike anything you've ever seen before.
[02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:54.080]   It's cloud-based software.
[02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:56.200]   It's built specifically to help organizations
[02:04:56.200 --> 02:04:57.880]   do the cloud right.
[02:04:57.880 --> 02:05:00.200]   They have a massive array of vantage points
[02:05:00.200 --> 02:05:02.400]   and they are everywhere.
[02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:04.640]   Cloud providers, the global internet,
[02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:07.400]   even down to the wifi in your local coffee shop.
[02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:09.880]   This is not passive old school IT monitoring,
[02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:11.160]   which is essentially siloed.
[02:05:11.160 --> 02:05:13.240]   You only see what's going on in your data center.
[02:05:13.240 --> 02:05:15.640]   Thousand Eyes unique path visualization technology
[02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:17.600]   extends beyond any boundaries,
[02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:20.200]   letting you see, understand and fix,
[02:05:20.200 --> 02:05:22.880]   even improve the experience for all of your apps,
[02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:24.520]   your services, your website.
[02:05:24.520 --> 02:05:27.800]   This is an amazing solution.
[02:05:27.800 --> 02:05:29.360]   And it's a great way to, for instance,
[02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:32.840]   choose the right cloud for your needs
[02:05:32.840 --> 02:05:34.640]   to connect to the right SAS instance,
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:36.800]   to see issues before they impact you,
[02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:39.040]   your customers and your employees.
[02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:41.040]   Top banks use it, enterprises use it,
[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:43.640]   SAS companies use it, the world's fastest.
[02:05:43.640 --> 02:05:46.160]   Best brands are using Thousand Eyes software
[02:05:46.160 --> 02:05:48.320]   to do the cloud and do it right.
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:49.220]   You gotta check it out,
[02:05:49.220 --> 02:05:51.760]   go to thousandeyes.com/twit.
[02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:53.600]   Here's a little booklet you can get there
[02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:55.400]   and give to the boss.
[02:05:55.400 --> 02:05:57.640]   You don't wanna challenge them with too much technical detail.
[02:05:57.640 --> 02:06:00.600]   You can give them this five cloud migration challenges
[02:06:00.600 --> 02:06:01.800]   you shouldn't ignore,
[02:06:01.800 --> 02:06:03.800]   but it's a great way to open the conversation.
[02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:06.520]   Boss, we need thousand eyes,
[02:06:06.520 --> 02:06:08.000]   so that we know what's happening up there
[02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:09.120]   in that puffy little cloud.
[02:06:09.120 --> 02:06:10.880]   If the cloud is important to you,
[02:06:10.880 --> 02:06:13.760]   in the future or today, you need thousand eyes.
[02:06:13.760 --> 02:06:17.360]   Go to thousandeyes.com/twit.
[02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:20.600]   Thousandeyes.com/twit.
[02:06:20.600 --> 02:06:24.160]   Thousandeyes thrive in a connected world.
[02:06:24.160 --> 02:06:26.120]   It's a great story,
[02:06:26.120 --> 02:06:27.120]   the Thousandeyes story,
[02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:29.880]   and he is really a neat guy and fascinating.
[02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:32.120]   And boy, do they know what's going on out there.
[02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:36.520]   Verizon is gonna launch 5G service
[02:06:36.520 --> 02:06:38.880]   in Chicago and Minneapolis.
[02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:39.960]   Yeah, right.
[02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:41.200]   (clears throat)
[02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:42.040]   Sorry, I'm just not on the--
[02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:43.320]   Are you skeptical?
[02:06:43.320 --> 02:06:44.160]   Oh, me?
[02:06:44.160 --> 02:06:45.160]   Skeptical.
[02:06:45.160 --> 02:06:47.040]   Actually, you'll have to have a Moto Z3
[02:06:47.040 --> 02:06:49.960]   with the not so far nonexistent.
[02:06:49.960 --> 02:06:51.160]   5G mod.
[02:06:51.160 --> 02:06:53.040]   And with a little sort of symbol saying,
[02:06:53.040 --> 02:06:54.360]   tell you it's 5G.
[02:06:54.360 --> 02:06:56.680]   It's gonna be so long before we have
[02:06:56.680 --> 02:06:58.640]   any significant amount of 5G.
[02:06:58.640 --> 02:07:01.960]   I got really irritated last week.
[02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:04.520]   I was listening to Peter Kafka interview,
[02:07:04.520 --> 02:07:06.560]   Randall Stevenson, CEO of AT&T.
[02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:07.560]   Yeah, AT&T, yeah.
[02:07:07.560 --> 02:07:08.720]   And the first question he asked him was,
[02:07:08.720 --> 02:07:09.800]   "Why do we need 5G?"
[02:07:09.800 --> 02:07:11.240]   "Make the case for 5G."
[02:07:11.240 --> 02:07:12.920]   The first thing I had with Stevenson's mouth
[02:07:12.920 --> 02:07:15.360]   was we needed to enable autonomous cars.
[02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:17.760]   'Cause with 5G, with no latency,
[02:07:17.760 --> 02:07:21.720]   we'll be able to take all that expensive computing hardware
[02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:23.480]   out of the car and move it into the cloud
[02:07:23.480 --> 02:07:25.040]   and control them that way.
[02:07:25.040 --> 02:07:27.440]   And as somebody who spent a good part of my career
[02:07:27.440 --> 02:07:30.320]   working on electronic control systems for cars,
[02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:33.760]   as an engineer, I was just flabbergasted.
[02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:36.320]   So that's not true 'cause we've been saying that too.
[02:07:36.320 --> 02:07:38.000]   That one of the benefits, not the only,
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.840]   but one of the benefits of 5G is autonomous vehicles.
[02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:44.120]   You need connectivity for autonomous vehicles
[02:07:44.120 --> 02:07:45.880]   in order to provide software updates
[02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:47.400]   and map updates and things like that.
[02:07:47.400 --> 02:07:48.720]   But don't you need it also like when you're
[02:07:48.720 --> 02:07:51.040]   in a four-way stop, say after you have phones?
[02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:52.920]   You don't know, you don't need 5G for that.
[02:07:52.920 --> 02:07:55.480]   Okay, what you need is any kind of vehicle
[02:07:55.480 --> 02:07:58.680]   to vehicle connectivity so cars communicate
[02:07:58.680 --> 02:08:00.040]   intent to each other.
[02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:02.320]   But you can do that now over DSRC,
[02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:04.480]   which is basically a flavor of Wi-Fi,
[02:08:04.480 --> 02:08:06.640]   or with CV to X, which is just--
[02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:07.480]   Is there a stand?
[02:08:07.480 --> 02:08:08.320]   It's down LTE.
[02:08:08.320 --> 02:08:09.160]   Yeah, there is.
[02:08:09.160 --> 02:08:10.000]   Okay, good.
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:14.200]   So, I mean, Cadillac's already got some cars out there
[02:08:14.200 --> 02:08:15.520]   that have this in there.
[02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:17.240]   And Toyota's got them in Japan,
[02:08:17.240 --> 02:08:19.760]   and they're bringing it here to the US in a couple of years.
[02:08:19.760 --> 02:08:22.320]   But what Stevenson was talking about
[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:24.600]   was doing all of that computing,
[02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:27.680]   taking the time out and transmitting it to the cloud.
[02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:31.640]   And then these cars are generating four terabytes a day.
[02:08:31.640 --> 02:08:33.160]   I was gonna say, given that you could have
[02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:34.520]   served the boot for goodness.
[02:08:34.520 --> 02:08:35.360]   Yeah.
[02:08:35.360 --> 02:08:36.200]   You could have put that--
[02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:37.920]   Drive off the road 'cause the internet went down.
[02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:40.640]   You drive five minutes away from here.
[02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:43.680]   And I have zero signals, zero bars of any kind.
[02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:44.520]   That's right.
[02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:48.160]   And we're a half an hour from San Francisco.
[02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:53.080]   So, unless they can get universal connectivity everywhere.
[02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:54.440]   5G is not gonna--
[02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:56.040]   We're talking about we're gonna take that out
[02:08:56.040 --> 02:08:58.120]   'cause that has been often been a selling point.
[02:08:58.120 --> 02:08:59.600]   We will not mention autonomous vehicles.
[02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:00.440]   No.
[02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:03.080]   Really, why do carriers want 5G?
[02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:05.480]   Is it a money maker for them?
[02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:06.640]   They hope it will be.
[02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:08.520]   Yeah, I mean, it's pretty clear from positioning.
[02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:09.520]   They're saying this will not,
[02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:12.640]   5G will not be a standard upgrade that you get in your phone.
[02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:14.240]   This is something they want to make you spend
[02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:15.280]   the premium prices for.
[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:17.880]   In fact, the pricing of this Verizon service
[02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:21.440]   in Chicago in Minneapolis is $10 more
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:24.960]   on top of its existing unlimited plans.
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:29.000]   So, $85 a month for the base go unlimited plan
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:30.480]   for a single line.
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:31.280]   I swear, I was--
[02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:34.960]   $95 a month for 22 gigabytes of unthroddled LTE,
[02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:36.160]   15 gigabytes.
[02:09:36.160 --> 02:09:38.680]   By the way, you're gonna have to have higher bandwidth caps.
[02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:40.600]   If suddenly you get all this speed,
[02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:42.400]   we saw that with LTE.
[02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:43.800]   People were hitting the bandwidth caps
[02:09:43.800 --> 02:09:44.880]   in a week.
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:45.880]   Seriously, I want to take--
[02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:46.720]   I want to take--
[02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:49.280]   I want to take every American phone user
[02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:51.720]   and show them a European phone bill
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:53.440]   and there would be blood on the streets.
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:54.680]   I guarantee it.
[02:09:54.680 --> 02:09:56.640]   We are getting screwed so badly
[02:09:56.640 --> 02:09:58.400]   on telecoms charges in this country.
[02:09:58.400 --> 02:09:59.320]   It's unbelievable.
[02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:02.240]   I just want to transport someone from 2000 to today
[02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:05.800]   and people can say, okay, I want the unlimited plan
[02:10:05.800 --> 02:10:08.040]   and you're like, which unlimited plan?
[02:10:08.040 --> 02:10:09.200]   Unlimited unlimited unlimited.
[02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:10.040]   I want the limited plan.
[02:10:10.040 --> 02:10:11.080]   The one that doesn't have a limit.
[02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:12.760]   Have four different unlimited plans.
[02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:13.800]   They all have limits.
[02:10:13.800 --> 02:10:14.800]   Oh, I know.
[02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:16.520]   It's just--
[02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:17.360]   It's insane.
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:19.000]   The unlimited unlimited plan.
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:19.840]   Yeah.
[02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:22.240]   I mean, you've got an oligopoly of telcos.
[02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:24.440]   Okay, admittedly, you've got big problems with--
[02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:25.440]   it's a big country.
[02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:27.520]   There's lots of areas where it's difficult
[02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:28.600]   to explore this stuff.
[02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:31.440]   But 5G, for it to work, you've got to have an amazing number
[02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:33.880]   of base stations around to even get through the interference.
[02:10:33.880 --> 02:10:34.920]   I mean, they only have.
[02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:37.240]   If you're doing millimeter wave 5G,
[02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:39.840]   it's only got a range of a couple of hundred meters.
[02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:42.400]   And which, again, going back to the car thing,
[02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:45.520]   if you're-- even if the latency on any given base station
[02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:48.720]   is near zero is like one or two milliseconds,
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:52.400]   that's not really enough to do real time control anyway.
[02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:55.000]   But if you're constantly handing off,
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:56.360]   every time you're doing a handoff,
[02:10:56.360 --> 02:10:58.680]   is you're going a couple of blocks,
[02:10:58.680 --> 02:11:01.000]   that's going to add new problems in there.
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:02.800]   And there's going to be dead spots in there.
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:04.960]   We can't get the latency right on virtual reality.
[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:08.480]   And people rarely die from virtual reality.
[02:11:08.480 --> 02:11:10.800]   It's pretty-- it's not common to die from virtual reality.
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:15.200]   It's also what grinds my gears about this is that 5G is being
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:18.000]   used as a way of getting around the whole,
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.360]   oh, let's sort out fix why it's fix line broadband.
[02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:22.840]   It's like 5G is going to solve all our problems.
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:24.440]   Really, it's like a rainbow.
[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:25.440]   You know, like my next dad--
[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:26.640]   That's a unicorn and everything.
[02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:28.840]   That's really what's going on, in my opinion,
[02:11:28.840 --> 02:11:33.280]   is companies like Verizon, AT&T, even Comcast saying,
[02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:35.680]   yeah, yeah, we know internet is screwed up in America.
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:36.600]   But don't worry--
[02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:37.560]   5G will solve it.
[02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:39.040]   It's all going to be better.
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:40.600]   And it just buys them some runway.
[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:42.000]   Because 5G is--
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:45.560]   No, it's not only not going to happen in the near future.
[02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:48.600]   The best estimate is by 2025, a third of Americans
[02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:49.480]   will have access to it.
[02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:50.240]   One third.
[02:11:50.240 --> 02:11:51.840]   It's in six years.
[02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:53.800]   It's ridiculous to have a first.
[02:11:53.800 --> 02:11:54.280]   And people just fool it.
[02:11:54.280 --> 02:11:56.800]   So it's really just a way of saying, oh, no, it's all going to--
[02:11:56.800 --> 02:11:57.880]   don't worry.
[02:11:57.880 --> 02:11:58.400]   Don't worry.
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:11:59.440]   It's all going to be better.
[02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:00.800]   But 60 is going to rock.
[02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:02.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:12:02.280 --> 02:12:03.720]   60 is the one.
[02:12:03.720 --> 02:12:05.240]   I feel good about 60.
[02:12:05.240 --> 02:12:06.080]   The thing is, 3G--
[02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:07.560]   You know, Elizabeth Warren would have gotten a lot more
[02:12:07.560 --> 02:12:10.000]   mileage if she had said, let's break up the telcos.
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:10.500]   Yeah.
[02:12:10.500 --> 02:12:11.600]   And they're cable companies.
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:13.000]   You're going to get a lot more.
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:14.520]   It's an increasing problem.
[02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:16.520]   Because 3G was a standard.
[02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:18.120]   Everyone agreed to follow the standard.
[02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:21.320]   4G, then they were like, well, we want to call Ymax 4G.
[02:12:21.320 --> 02:12:22.080]   Why can't we do that?
[02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:23.840]   We want to call LTE 4G.
[02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:24.360]   And this standard--
[02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:25.440]   Or HSPA+.
[02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:26.360]   Yeah.
[02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:28.840]   And the standards body just went, ah, do whatever the hell
[02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:31.240]   do you want, what do I care?
[02:12:31.240 --> 02:12:32.680]   And it's only going to get worse.
[02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:33.720]   All the Gs.
[02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:34.160]   Yeah.
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:34.760]   Well--
[02:12:34.760 --> 02:12:35.920]   All the Gs.
[02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:38.560]   I just want to say thank you.
[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:39.800]   Thank you to all of you guys.
[02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:45.120]   You're great in Thompson rights and edits at the register.
[02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:47.640]   You get to at least do some headlines.
[02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:48.360]   Oh, yes.
[02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:50.280]   Register headlines are the best.
[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:52.480]   I shouldn't say this because we'll get people
[02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:53.760]   going through the windows.
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:56.800]   But we have been recently just working out
[02:12:56.800 --> 02:12:59.720]   headlines for the stories that we would like to see.
[02:12:59.720 --> 02:13:01.280]   Start with the headline.
[02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:02.040]   Well, yeah.
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:03.440]   It's like a Silicon Valley startup.
[02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:05.120]   You buy-- first you do the T-shirt.
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:06.160]   Then you make something.
[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:07.560]   This is never going to happen.
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:12.440]   But if the Apple CEO is ever caught off his brain
[02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:15.320]   on an array, then we have the co-writing monster
[02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:16.080]   ready to go.
[02:13:16.080 --> 02:13:18.800]   You already had the headline.
[02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:19.440]   Here's one.
[02:13:19.440 --> 02:13:21.880]   Well, it's like newspapers.
[02:13:21.880 --> 02:13:24.720]   They will pre-write obituaries for famous people.
[02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:25.220]   Oh, yes.
[02:13:25.220 --> 02:13:27.160]   Register re-writing the obituary.
[02:13:27.160 --> 02:13:31.280]   Here's Katiana Quatch wrote, yes, pack your bags,
[02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:34.120]   blossoming planetary system, strikingly similar
[02:13:34.120 --> 02:13:37.080]   ares found by Buffons.
[02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:39.440]   You see, we have scientists actually write to us
[02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:41.280]   and complain if they're not described as Buffons.
[02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:41.800]   It's Buffon.
[02:13:41.800 --> 02:13:44.320]   I want to be a Buffon.
[02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:46.000]   People like it.
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:46.880]   We have some fun with that.
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:48.840]   But hallway has been a gift this way.
[02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:51.320]   It's like they're being accused of hacking.
[02:13:51.320 --> 02:13:53.040]   So hallway to the danger zone.
[02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:56.360]   Or my way or the hallway says US.
[02:13:56.360 --> 02:13:57.880]   Thomas Clayburn, let's face it.
[02:13:57.880 --> 02:14:02.440]   We need to face up to facing off with face recognition technology.
[02:14:02.440 --> 02:14:04.280]   Yeah, OK.
[02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:05.280]   They're trying.
[02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:06.440]   Ah, we have some fun with it.
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:07.040]   What can we say?
[02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:07.400]   I love it.
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:08.960]   The register.co.uk.
[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:11.080]   That's where Ian hangs his hat.
[02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:12.840]   And we get him here as often as we can.
[02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:13.400]   It's great to have him.
[02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:14.200]   It was a pleasure.
[02:14:14.200 --> 02:14:18.480]   Happy St. Patrick's Day from all of us.
[02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:19.720]   From all these Americans who were like,
[02:14:19.720 --> 02:14:21.360]   in the end of the 16th of the morning.
[02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:22.520]   Yeah, we're drinking the cream beer.
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:23.440]   As for extra juice to go out.
[02:14:23.440 --> 02:14:25.400]   You don't have to.
[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:27.720]   Matt Cott's US Digital Service.
[02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:29.160]   He is the administrator.
[02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:33.000]   This is like-- we got the big guy here.
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:34.480]   The USDS.gov.
[02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:35.480]   Go there.
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:36.480]   All brand new sites.
[02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:39.080]   Colonel Cuts in the house.
[02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:42.240]   Can I just say, I was on this weekend tech
[02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:43.400]   what, like, a month ago?
[02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:44.920]   That's a long ago, yeah.
[02:14:44.920 --> 02:14:47.480]   And at the time, I was like, we need engineers.
[02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:48.480]   We need designers.
[02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:49.560]   We need product managers.
[02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:52.320]   And we even need some folks like recruiters and a lawyer.
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:55.920]   And can I tell you, we got a great number of applications.
[02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:56.280]   Oh, good.
[02:14:56.280 --> 02:14:58.600]   And we're looking to make job offers to two people
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:00.560]   as a result of last two--
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:01.280]   Two tweets.
[02:15:01.280 --> 02:15:01.280]   Yes.
[02:15:01.280 --> 02:15:02.960]   We'll be at the USDS.
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:04.560]   And we're a recruiter and an engineer.
[02:15:04.560 --> 02:15:08.760]   So I'm like, by the way, we're still looking for great people.
[02:15:08.760 --> 02:15:10.680]   And now they've got a new website.
[02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:13.240]   And by the way, I see a little Drupal guy on the fireplace.
[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:14.520]   Yeah, absolutely.
[02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:16.960]   USDS.gov.
[02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:19.520]   Matt, it's always a pleasure and always an honor
[02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:20.600]   to have you in our studios.
[02:15:20.600 --> 02:15:21.440]   Thanks for being here.
[02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:22.280]   Thanks for having me.
[02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:23.280]   Is that an etch a sketch on the table?
[02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:24.040]   Oh, yeah.
[02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:25.320]   We have all the maps.
[02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:27.320]   All the toys.
[02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:29.880]   Also, you can't quite see it, but there's presidential--
[02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:30.960]   Pest dispensers.
[02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:31.960]   I see them, yes.
[02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:33.960]   You need-- and if you're ever in DC, come say hello.
[02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:34.560]   Oh, you know what?
[02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:37.320]   I am going to make a trip just to visit.
[02:15:37.320 --> 02:15:39.520]   And of course, all the way from the Motor City
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:41.720]   are a senior car guy.
[02:15:41.720 --> 02:15:44.880]   He's a principal analyst at Navigant Research.
[02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:45.760]   Sam will submit.
[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:47.400]   It also makes regular appearances every week
[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:48.920]   now on the Tech Guy Show.
[02:15:48.920 --> 02:15:50.040]   I'm thrilled.
[02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:51.080]   It's great to have you, Sam.
[02:15:51.080 --> 02:15:52.840]   We're going to go take a test drive.
[02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:56.480]   If the sun is still up, I think it is in that Kea Nero
[02:15:56.480 --> 02:15:59.840]   and get a review for our hands-on tech show.
[02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:01.040]   Thanks to Sam.
[02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:02.280]   So thank you for being here.
[02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:03.560]   Pleasure to be here as always.
[02:16:03.560 --> 02:16:05.960]   And don't forget the Wheel bearings podcast.
[02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:08.120]   If you want to hear more of my ramblings about cars,
[02:16:08.120 --> 02:16:11.200]   along with my friend Stan Roth and Rebecca Lindlin,
[02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:12.920]   it's at wheel bearings.media.
[02:16:12.920 --> 02:16:15.440]   I know a lot of people are interested in cars,
[02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:18.160]   because whenever you're on, you could tell there's
[02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:20.240]   a lot more interest in what's going on.
[02:16:20.240 --> 02:16:21.320]   So there you go.
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:25.600]   Wheel bearings.media, episode 101.
[02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:28.840]   We don't need those stinking badges.
[02:16:28.840 --> 02:16:31.160]   And we thank everybody who came to a visit today.
[02:16:31.160 --> 02:16:33.080]   Was had a great studio audience.
[02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:35.560]   If you want to join us in the studio during the show,

[02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:41.880]   We're up here in Northern California in the Petaluma area.
[02:16:41.880 --> 02:16:43.480]   The show is Saturday--
[02:16:43.480 --> 02:16:47.720]   I'm sorry, Sunday afternoon is around 215 Pacific 515 Eastern.
[02:16:47.720 --> 02:16:50.520]   That's 2115 UTC.

[02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:21.200]   You'll have an episode for the Monday morning commute
[02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:23.560]   the minute it's out.
[02:17:23.560 --> 02:17:24.880]   We thank you for being here.
[02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:25.720]   We'll see you next time.
[02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:26.720]   Another twit.
[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:27.720]   OK.
[02:17:27.720 --> 02:17:29.680]   Bye bye.
