[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.000]   We've got a great one this week Ben Thompson who was gonna be here last week slept through the show
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.480]   But we're thrilled to have you back I
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.680]   Hey, you're in my you know, I defense there was a miscommunication
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.680]   I was actually not even in town
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.960]   I was traveling with my family. So well, I apologize, but I'm glad we could get you here now and
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:54.220]   Ben writes at stratecory.com. He is a great analyst who offers both free and paid

[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.320]   What's going on the tech community and you're in Taipei where it's early, right?
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.280]   It is it is 6 a.m. So that's why I assumed you slept. I would not be up at this hour
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.840]   I assume you know I have I have never slept through one so I
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.160]   Know I was I was in Singapore actually last week
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.680]   So I I did indeed wake up to a bunch of misquets calls, but I actually had no idea
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.320]   So there was a our fault, but I
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.080]   Might have been my fault. I'm not sure whose fault it was, but I apologize for
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.380]   The confusion and whatever rule I may have played but no, I'm happy to be happy to be here this week
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.380]   It worked out great. We had a great show last week and we're gonna have a great show this week also with us
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.580]   Good buddy Nathan all of our s jobs from the Wall Street Journal always a pleasure always a pleasure
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.060]   Can't really explain the LA Dodgers hat to your left. I'm sure it's not yours. I can explain it to you guys. Oh
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.320]   Baseball team. Yeah, are you from LA? I was born in LA moved to Phoenix when I was little
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:05.660]   But I grew up a Dodgers fad you're not a Cardinal fan. You mean Arizona Cardinals? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I am
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.660]   Oh, yeah, it's well also
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.540]   I was a Raiders fan and then the Raiders moved to Oakland and Bo Jackson stopped playing and you know
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.800]   Raiders moved to Oakland LA didn't have a team anymore. So I'm a had to become a Cardinals fan. No other choice
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.780]   Yeah, and then the down you got the bearish men of riches. You got the Rams now you got the Dodgers. You're great
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.920]   There's some internal conflict there. I'm excited that I'm excited that LA has a football team again
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.540]   But they play in the same division as the Cardinals. So I'd like to see the Rams do well
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.200]   But my favorite team is a Cardinals. Oh, and you know like the Dimebacks came out when I was in high school
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.840]   I'm in back. So I'm - I don't really care for them too much myself
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.280]   I mean, you know, well
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.440]   Congratulations as much as I hate to say it
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.740]   I actually was rooting for the Dodgers to win because I would thought it would be great to have a Dodgers Giants
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.440]   That's what I wanted to play off and LCS that would have been great
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.480]   But you know the Cubs it's exciting to see them too. You know, they have once since 1908
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.640]   You know the Dodgers won last in 1988 you guys won in 2014
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.020]   Yeah, that's why we see more every other year that we should it's our year
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.040]   Something wrong there. We got something did talk to the people upstairs, but the Dodgers got their butt kick last night
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:19.280]   So it was a there was that grand slam in the eighth inning. I think it was or seventh inning
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.080]   so
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:27.720]   They're playing right now actually are they yeah, that's how dead kid I am. That's how much I like you know
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.200]   Let's get a little monitor up for Nathan
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.260]   So he can at least kind of keep up on what's going on. I hear the internet where you can do something. Yeah, I'll get alerts and stuff
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.280]   There you go. Hey look who else is here really thrilled to get Mike Elkin back in studio. I
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.880]   Call him the parapetetic Mike Elkin just because I like saying parapetetic. It's a great word
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.980]   Yeah, and then I too was born in Los Angeles as we're both my sons and I'm a huge fan of not caring about sports
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:57.960]   No hat well if I know Nathan was gonna wear his hat I'd wear my hat
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.920]   Anyway, great to have you you you're back home for a little bit
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.480]   But I know you're gonna because there's a certain grandchild on the way
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:11.200]   Yes, and Nadia or Kevin's here Nadia is lying on her back the Algens are reproducing
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.720]   They're reproducing there's more of them. So congratulations. Thank you. That's great. It's really lovely to have all of you
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.980]   Thank you, and as always whenever I get you guys in
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.880]   I'm just I'm champing at the bit because there's so much to talk about between
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.640]   Yahoo and Twitter
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.120]   Guess we should we should update you on the note 7 that's been kind of the lead story for the last month
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.320]   Hot story and well and now I thought is the word
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.520]   There's a coda to it. I think the whole thing is over now because it's Samsung
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:46.000]   According to the journal is permanently discontinuing the note 7 there will be no more note 7s. They gave up on that phone
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.560]   Which I think was the right call ultimately and they probably should have done it a little bit earlier
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.800]   But but yeah that that phone is discontinued. They made two and a half million in the initial
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.720]   Versions of the phone then they recalled those and they brought out some new ones
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.880]   I'm not exactly sure how many they brought in the second wave, but they started burning exactly and now
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.240]   So all of them have been recalled and they're not making them anymore
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.680]   So if you have a note 7 don't take it back. Take it back to wherever you bought it from
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:23.240]   Every carrier is taking it back, you know target Amazon Samsung's offering some blandish mints
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.840]   I think a hundred bucks if you buy another Samsung phone trying to keep twenty five dollars if you buy something else, right?
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.640]   So they want you to stay with Samsung which makes sense for them
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.560]   What is your sense? Do you think people are gonna abandon Samsung?
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.480]   I think a lot of people are gonna abandon sense Samsung especially since you got sure the Apple phone coming out
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:46.480]   Yeah, right after this and you've got the pixel coming out in a couple of weeks. Yeah, yeah, it sucks because
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:52.280]   you know, I've been reviewing Android phones for for maybe seven years now and
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:59.720]   The phones from Samsung haven't been any better than they are right now. They're actually really great hardware. They have fantastic cameras
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:05.560]   I still have troubles with a lot of Samsung software changes to Android
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:13.120]   But you know they're at the top of their game and the if you want to stick with Samsung the Galaxy S7 is
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:19.280]   great and there are no reports of of batteries starting on fire or exploding or having any of these issues
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.440]   but
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.480]   You know the note seven has these problems and you know you got to hear clear of that. So I
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.840]   Don't blame a lot of people for giving up on Samsung right now
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:37.520]   I think for us we're in this mode of they have to kind of win back our trust and and and we're not necessarily recommending people stick with Samsung
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.560]   But we're not necessarily telling people to flee them either. It's gonna be a personal choice
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.560]   But whatever you do
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.080]   Don't play around with that note seven because you're literally putting yourself and the people around you at risk
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.520]   We don't say that lightly
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:57.440]   But there's never been a re-recall of a smartphone. You recall. Yeah, there's never been anything like this and and you know
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:03.200]   As we know, you know, they're not allowed on US flights anymore as of Saturday yesterday noon
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:10.560]   The transportation administration has banned. Yeah, not even if it's off. You cannot bring it on they'll confiscate it
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Actually, I like the punishment. They also said
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.440]   You're not gonna be able to put it in the seat back or or above you have to keep in your pocket. Yeah
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:21.920]   Because we want to know when it catches on
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:28.360]   Screaming it's better you saying that you're not telling people to to get away from Samsung. I am
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.880]   partly because of the
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.440]   There was the famous
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:37.880]   misdirected email where they intended to communicate internally when a customer complained and
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.960]   Accidentally copied the customer and there was a lot of there's a there's an intent. This is shady
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:50.740]   The replacement phone that caught on fire on Southwest Airlines. Yeah, that's right. They sent a an email accident or a text
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:55.760]   He accidentally to the customer saying what do you want us to do about this? Should we sit on it? Yeah?
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:02.000]   Yeah, really shady and this is based on the history and and Ben can chime in because a lot of this was from
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.920]   Taiwan, but
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:10.520]   You know they were fined more than a quarter million dollars by Taiwan's equivalent of the FTC a few years ago
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:15.560]   Three years ago for astroturfing online forums paying fake users to go in there and talk up Samsung
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:21.360]   They were fine for lying in Taiwan for lying in ads about smartphone features
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:26.520]   They were caught cheating on benchmark tests multiple times and caught lying about the cheating
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:34.280]   So this is a company of questionable integrity and I think that I think it's a good idea for people to vote against
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.040]   Shady business by not buying Samsung phones. That's my own personal opinion
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.000]   I love the New York Times take on this Brian X Chen writing in the New York Times
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.920]   Interviewed a number of people including a battery expert Parkchill one former director of the Center for Advanced batteries of the Korea
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:54.760]   Electronics technology Institute. He said he didn't think it was the battery
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:11:01.280]   He said Samsung was too quick to blame the batteries. I think there was nothing wrong with them or that they were not the main problem
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:07.680]   He said and I think that this is the great way to end this article from the New York Times the problem seems to be far more complex
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:13.600]   The note seven had more features and was more complex than any other phone
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.480]   Manufactured in a race to surpass iPhone
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.760]   Samsung seems to have packed it with so much innovation. It became uncontrollable
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.880]   Even they didn't know how it worked. I am too close to the Sun. I
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:31.880]   It's such a ridiculous argument to me. I mean, you know, we are we are pushing these phones
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:36.440]   You know further than they've been before we're asking more of the batteries in the processors than ever before
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:42.800]   But Samsung could not replicate the problem and they released a phone with the same problem thinking it was safe
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:47.680]   Exactly and I think part of the issue was and I spoke to some battery experts and some stories I wrote myself
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:54.680]   Was that the phone start on fire and they destroy a lot of the evidence they would look to to figure out what the problem is
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.720]   So it can literally be the chemistry of the device
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.960]   It could be
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.960]   Basically, there's there's two electrodes
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.240]   Inside of each of these batteries
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.200]   There's a separator between the two because of these two electrodes touch they will catch fire
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:15.040]   The batteries themselves could be contaminated in the manufacturing process and there are electronics that control how the battery works
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:19.160]   Outside of the battery and and then you know there could be other issues that
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:26.720]   Prevent the battery from stopping taking a charge and overheating. I mean there's there's there's literally dozens of reasons why this could be the case
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.120]   but
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.120]   To say that there's too much innovation
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:37.840]   Just it's like you know, it's a big phone with a stylus. It's not that different
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:45.140]   Which is functionally a very similar phone. It's damn near the same thing is not bursting in this is true
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:52.660]   I mean if you look at the the iPhone what is it called the iPhone touch disease problem where some iPhone 6s and 6 pluses
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.660]   We it's not that there's too much innovation
[00:12:55.660 --> 00:13:02.900]   I think that everybody's pushing so hard that is true that everything's turned up to 11 and they're trying to be thin and small and maximum
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:07.380]   Battery life and maximum and so I think we're gonna see a lot more of this kind of thing
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.980]   But what's the consequence to Samsung as a company?
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.140]   Well, I was just just just real quick on the on the battery point
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:21.820]   I think the one important thing to note is that the Samsung the iPhone 7 plus the battery capacity is is
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.620]   2,900
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:25.980]   Mih what is it? Mih
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.180]   That's million million dollars. Thank you
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:34.260]   The iPhone or the Samsung note 6 was 3,000 so just just a hundred more
[00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:41.060]   Whereas the note 7 was 3,500 and that given battery technology is largely a function of size
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:46.420]   And so basically they were putting in a larger battery a significantly larger
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:55.340]   you know 17% or so larger into this phone and and this is this is really the I think the to me I'm surprised they haven't
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:14:00.700]   Said definitively what it is because when they replace the first one the
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:06.980]   The the Samsung SDI batteries where they basically threw their corporate brother under the bus
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:11.020]   It was super interesting when that happened because Samsung SDI is also an Apple supplier
[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:16.060]   Oh as he is a as is a TL and Apple at the time had this really snarky statement saying
[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:22.860]   We're very confident in in the design of our phones and something to that effect and that that's not gonna be a problem here and
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.460]   basically the
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:32.300]   This consumer protection agency said something the effect that the phone the battery was too big for the phone and
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:39.340]   Well, no that that actually makes perfect sense because to to to go further on the point of how these batteries are made
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.340]   They're actually very very thin layers
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:48.340]   of the of the two gankos with a porous layer in between and what happens is when they are in so there's
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:55.980]   Multiple multiple multiple thin layers and if they are squeezed that is 100% a way to to start a fire
[00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:01.000]   with this battery and so it it seems I'm not a battery expert but
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.340]   the given the the comments by the
[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:11.140]   Director of the Consumer Protection Agency that he felt the battery was or that Samsung I believe I told him the battery was too big
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:17.380]   It would certainly make sense that the replacement battery, which is presumably the same capacity
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.460]   Might also have a similar problem again
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:23.500]   We don't know for sure but to me if when you talk about packing innovation to me
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:29.780]   That sounds like literally packing in a battery. That's too big to to make the phone competitive from from a battery standpoint again
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:34.340]   We don't know for sure what what it is. I'm not about like none of us are battery experts
[00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:39.940]   But that just from a very quantitative at quantity of aspect that massive jump in capacity
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:45.180]   without a similarly massive jump in the size of the phone itself and
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:49.060]   You know unfortunately with battery technology. We don't have that level of breakthrough
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:54.020]   that certainly seems like a possibility as to as to what's happened and
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.740]   really I think
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.980]   makes this much worse for Samsung than it would have been because
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:05.500]   Initially I was never on the like this will be good for Samsung the long run
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:10.740]   Paces that was what was the logic there? Yeah, how would this be good for seven heard that?
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:15.680]   No, there were little as they responded quick and I was saying that right exactly they're showing that there are there trust really
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.660]   Etc. Etc. They've been on every step of the way. They haven't explained what happened to us date
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.780]   They've had really terrible communication with their customers, you know, you're pretty the choir
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:31.180]   You're pretty the part I don't think that was if it had stopped with replacements in other words if they had been able to fix it and replace it
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:36.580]   I think it might have possibly redounded well to Samsung's reputation now
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:41.580]   Legally and they did the right thing and everything's good, but then to put out phones that continue to burn
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:46.540]   That's it. It's over but it but even then it would be clear that was never it's never a good thing
[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:51.460]   It's never ever good in an explainable. So but yeah, my my whole point is that that entire island all for example
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:56.620]   Was revived its recall if it wasn't time on us forward survive the pinto right
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:03.660]   So I survived a few lap-hop batteries situation will Samsung survive. I mean why would yeah, I think Samsung will survive but
[00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:07.380]   But they've got this reputation that seeping into the popular culture
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:11.580]   I was at a coffee shop a couple of days ago and there was this family had a couple of kids
[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:16.780]   They asked me to take their picture and they handed me a phone and it was a it was an iPhone
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:20.900]   And before I took took possession of it. I'm like, oh is that an iPhone 7?
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.980]   Yeah, and he said it's the one that doesn't burn
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:31.620]   That's probably the level of understanding of normal. Yeah, they're gonna be a punch line for a very long time
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:35.700]   The one that I wasn't burned. Yeah, yeah, I think so
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.460]   I think just to just to continue my point the
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:43.500]   I think long-term damages is significant
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:49.540]   I like my whole point for me was to say that it this was never a good thing and anyone who said so was being silly to
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:57.020]   Just to be just to be clear. But you're right. There happened brands that have survived recalls like it does it does happen, but
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:04.020]   So you don't recall what we call batteries. This is not unheard of well. There's a few interesting things on that point
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:10.540]   I mean like so one the initial recall was was was bad and anyone who says it wasn't is is right confusing themselves
[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.860]   but the double recall is
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:17.780]   Really, I think it's really significant and obviously the short-term
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:24.380]   Financial impact is going to be massive as you would expect, but the long-term. I think there's a really
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:27.700]   There's a really
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.420]   Big problem with brand perception and I think it's going to be
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:35.820]   It's gonna be pretty significant to be percent good not just in the US but also in in other countries
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.940]   I think one area where Samsung really hurt themselves was in was in China where
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:45.740]   They launched the phone in China the same day the recall was announced in in the US
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:50.340]   and and they said that it's fine because they use a different battery and
[00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:55.100]   That in me of course the same day in China and the China
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:59.980]   You know internet is extremely active and extremely fast and diffusing information true or not
[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:04.900]   There are merely account reports that there were phones exploding. Were there were there fires in China?
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:09.820]   There were and and the reason why this was so damaging was they were I
[00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:15.480]   Think in retrospect pretty arrogant about saying don't worry about it. It's a different phone
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:19.300]   It's gonna be fine and dismissing them outright and really I think
[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:24.200]   Causing arguably even more damage. I mean it's bad enough in the US if you get on every airplane
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:29.260]   They say do you have a Samsung turn it off? I mean that's that's brand publicity. You can't pay money for unfortunately
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:30.580]   It's going in the wrong direction
[00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:36.560]   But I think the sort of arrogant attitude they took in China in particular is going to be very
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:44.420]   Damaging and have long-term repercussions for their brand particularly in China where the big advantage they have in the in the Western countries is
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:47.320]   There's not a queer alternative to pre-mup premium Android
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:52.720]   Obviously in the long run Google is a huge threat to them and we could certainly talk about that more
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:57.560]   But in China the Huawei phones in particular are doing very well at the high end
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:05.560]   It's the market with the strongest alternative to a Samsung phone and I think there that's gonna be a massive problem for them
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:11.480]   Yeah, where there's competition where there's a choice. I think consumers probably will just especially Android phones
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:16.580]   Which seem like a commoditized product. Oh, yeah, the note seven was unique because it had a stylus
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:19.780]   It was a big phone with a small body. I mean a big screen
[00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:23.920]   The small there's a difference in a short short term. They're gonna be hammered no question
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:29.440]   And they're gonna feel this for for for a while the real damage is the potential long-term
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.980]   impact on their brand and their reputation and
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.660]   Like stuff like this can be hard to recover from I mean yes
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:41.060]   I get the point those people were driving at that that we were making fun of that is not gonna be a big deal
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:45.280]   Is that yes if you handle it well you can establish a certain level of?
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.520]   People will give you a chance and you can establish some level of trust
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:57.120]   But they've not only obliterated that opportunity. They've made it 100 times worse by by blowing and I still won't eat it Jack in the box
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.700]   Yeah, so I mean there are there are brands Chipotle still, you know
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:07.240]   Scans as well. Yeah, and and and what you always said the Google's timing with the pixel could not have been
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:12.740]   Or apple both apple and Google came out with premium phones and I'm sure Samsung was well aware that this was about to happen
[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.780]   That all provided an alternative at exactly the same price
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:21.320]   We're I do want to talk about the Google phone at some point because the pixel as attractive as it is
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:25.980]   Cost as much as a note seven. It's awfully expensive. I think it's a bit too expensive
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.600]   I think it's too expensive. I think this may hurt them. Yeah, and if you drop it in the toilet, that's it
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:35.280]   Yeah, it's not water-proof resistant. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, they were bothering me. I don't drop a lot of funds in the toilet, but
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:40.840]   Try it. It's a lot though. The Huawei is at the honor eight is that the one that's the one you can get in the US now
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:48.800]   Is that the phone that's doing so well in China Ben? Yeah, well, all I has has had a very hard time in the United States in particular
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:52.760]   They kind of pin their hopes on the Nexus 6p. I think there was a
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:22:00.840]   Miscommunication about Google's goals with the Nexus it wasn't which it wasn't it widely treated as a Huawei phone, right?
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.520]   Yeah, right well
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.520]   it actually Google asked Huawei to
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:10.960]   To make the the pixel as well, but they were not down with the no branding or some
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:17.200]   Oh, I didn't know that. Oh, that's interesting. So HTC won the contract. Oh, that's it. I mean because HTC is yeah
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.960]   Is is their toast and so they'll do anything
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.040]   Yeah, and I think there's a
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:28.160]   The difference between the next and we can get into this but the difference between the Nexus and the pixel I think are
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:33.680]   significantly greater than just a name change. Yeah, let's let's save that cuz I think that's an interesting conversation definitely
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:39.520]   And but I do know that Huawei earlier. Yeah, I do know that Huawei and ZTE
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:44.880]   Both Chinese manufacturers have pretty compelling Android devices which they are for the first time selling into the US
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:50.080]   The honor eight and the the axon seven which are really pretty nice
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:57.240]   Devices and I'm just wondering if that maybe is another reason why Samsung should be a feared
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:02.160]   Well, this could be there also half the price of the Samsung phone. Yeah, this could be an opportunity for you know
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:08.040]   The Motorola's the the even Sony a lot of those companies if they can deliver the right products at the right time
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:13.680]   I think what we've seen that I'm really interested in is this kind of mid-range of Android phones that are maybe like
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.400]   $300, $400 significantly cheaper
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:21.840]   Right, yeah, they offer high-end like one plus three one plus three even even the next bit Robin
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.840]   I really liked a lot as well
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.080]   Motorola's been playing at space and the Nexus line used to play in that space as well
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.520]   But Google's never really I'm gonna marketing effort behind I'm gonna offer a counter argument
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.200]   I think this could be the end for not just Samsung but for Android
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:41.000]   Because it comes on the heels of a lot of Android malware a lot of security concerns
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.320]   Google's fighting a you know kind of a rear guard action
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:51.400]   With security because most only Google phones really are guaranteed to have the monthly security updates
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:58.280]   There is gonna be always gonna be a market for Android at the low end cheap phones
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.440]   You don't have a choice, right?
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.240]   But at the high end in the flagship market
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.960]   I'm wondering this if this doesn't give Apple a chance to eat the entire market
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:11.320]   You might be right, but it seems as though a lot of people don't associate
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:15.200]   Galaxy phones with Android. I mean you talk to a lot of different brand and
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:20.560]   People like I have a galaxy like do you have an Android and they don't even know what you're talking about yeah
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:24.920]   I've maybe like half the time I feel like and you know this is anecdotal even when I'm talking to folks
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.000]   I don't know what you guys think but Samsung would like you to think that I
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.280]   It's absolutely true
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:35.640]   I mean Samsung has highly differentiated or satisfaction or liability scores than any of the rivals
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:39.680]   I mean and this is why this is so damaging because Samsung was a
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:46.080]   Again, I think your point is is very well made that that we tend to think of it as as
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:54.000]   iOS versus Android but the way that the campus competition actually manifests itself and the way that most consumers think about it is Apple
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.680]   Versus Samsung that's even better for Apple
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:03.080]   All of Android just Samsung and Samsung's on the ropes and it could be better for an Android
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.760]   manufacturer if they make the right kind of device at the right and you know
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.960]   We don't know what this looks like you know
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.760]   But if there I think this could be a small opportunity
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.160]   Well, let's take a break and then I want to talk about if this is the pixels opportunity
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.480]   To leap into the fray. I sure that's what Google's hoping
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:26.160]   Mike Elgin is here. It's great to have you being becoming Nomad becoming Nomad calm and Elgin calm and Elgin calm
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.720]   How about that Google Plus?
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:34.200]   Still doing that? Yeah, I'm doing it. There's still a bit of the community that once exit
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:38.920]   There's always a really awesome minority community used to be the well remember the well and
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:43.680]   And these people won't leave for a few years. I hope everybody else will leave right exactly
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.400]   But it's it's getting tough out there Leo. Yeah, Google Plus is still there
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.360]   I'm still using it, but it's not what it used to be well
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.360]   We'll get to it when we talk about Twitter. Yeah
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:58.080]   And also from the Wall Street Journal. He covers gadgets. I hate to say gadgets. Yes, it's part of what it is

[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:03.840]   Yeah, I've had a podcast for several years. So exponent dot FM love it. We are yeah, we have a
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:11.280]   exclusive sponsorship with with Mailchimp. So the serial model eyes that were I like Mailchimp to man
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:16.400]   That was serial made them put them on the map with a little girl who couldn't pronounce it. Yeah, mail cramp or
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:22.720]   I never thought of that. Yeah, you should have done that should have done that never thought of that
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:29.360]   Podcast you know podcast is actually podcasting been in the news quite a bit lately
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:35.920]   Just they're just completed a foot was a five part series on podcast from
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:40.720]   Who was it the new house folks? Who was it that did that?
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.520]   Point point anyway
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:46.320]   Fascinating was a point pointer was a pointer might have been pointer
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:51.200]   And what it scared me and the very first article I said here comes the ad tech
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:55.840]   And I thought oh that that really worked well for the web. Why would anyone want to take a nice
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:02.720]   pristine thing like a podcast and start doing things like monitoring users and yeah and
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.360]   Intrusive advertising and all of that
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:13.040]   Well, I mean the challenge is that I mean you notice it's not an accident that score space is successful because the nature of their business is
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:19.120]   They have massive they have two things one they they have a way to track conversions
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:23.920]   Which is that code which is why you you have the the battle of the affiliate codes, but two
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:29.280]   They have significant lifetime value. So you see a lot of these purchases are our square space
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.920]   The lifetime value of a customer is pretty significant
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:36.240]   So the spend the spend is worth it and the um and you have things like Casper mattresses for example
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:41.120]   Is a common advertiser that's a relatively high price item and you don't see a lot of
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.600]   relatively lower price
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:48.720]   Items that that don't have a easy means of of tracking. I mean
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.040]   Well, they because they want to be on an 80 million
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:56.400]   You know if you were they want to be on television, right where there's a lot of uh reach
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:00.960]   And we don't offer massive numbers. We offer quality numbers
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:06.560]   But if you're trying to sell a million pencils, it's not going to be very useful. That's right quality isn't what you're getting on
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:10.800]   Right, but there that means there's a bit of a chasm in in which
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.960]   Without evidence that there is there is a benefit
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:19.120]   It's not worth the the effort of doing it and I think that you know that
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.800]   Certainly no one wants advertising tech like like the web, but I think it's
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:28.720]   It's not it's easy for people who are established in town cast and say everything's great
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.640]   Let's leave it the way it is for forever
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:35.040]   But the the reality is is the medium is not going to reach its full potential
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:41.120]   And with the current model like it's going to be it's going to be ultimately, you know, crimped
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:46.320]   And I think that would be unfortunate. So hopefully there can be some sort of middle ground where there is
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.760]   a
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:53.200]   A model that works for more advertisers than a very distinct set that advertises now
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:57.680]   And there's a whole world of advertisers that is massively larger and has a lot more money
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.680]   That doesn't right now and that's just because
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:06.080]   Without any sort of measurement. It's not worth the it's not worth the ever maybe there's also a big category of the brain
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:14.240]   Advertiser, that's the ones you see on football and baseball and playoffs that the they don't have I mean afford advertisers on a
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:20.000]   You know buys 18 million impressions on a football game. They can't really say well
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Let's see how the car sales do tomorrow, but they do a lot of research bay
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.400]   And they've they've bought podcasts and some brands have I think that's going to be where you're going to see it
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.880]   Their ad tech isn't going to help them either
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:34.640]   It's it's just a kind of a fate an act of faith that
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:39.680]   You can get build a brand on a podcast and they haven't come to that conclusion yet
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:43.600]   There's actually a couple things in the podcasting world that i'm really interested in
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.280]   That I think might be able to address some of the issues we're talking about
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:52.880]   They aren't coming from an advertising centric place yet, but there's an app called 60 db
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:58.000]   That I actually was looking at at the other day an early version of it and twits on there
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.080]   But
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:05.680]   It's basically some former npr folks some former facebook folks and some former netflix folks
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:11.200]   people who worked on the news feed and also the recommendation engine for
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:19.680]   For netflix and they're all about basically delivering you short form podcasts based on your interest
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:26.080]   So they are massing some data they want to be the netflix of podcast exactly and then this american life just came out with
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:31.040]   Something for their podcast where you can share a short like 30 second clip and they're trying to make
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:34.240]   I think the headline was trying to make it as shareable as the gift
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:41.600]   Shareable would be great. I'm not excited about anything that commoditizes. Yeah our premium product. So yeah, so so
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.800]   60 db is not something i'd be looking for but it might help others
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:50.800]   I just feel like anything that commoditizes the product isn't going to be a long run solution for anybody who's making the content
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:56.000]   It'll be interesting. I mean, that's what's happened in newspapers. They become commoditized. Nobody goes to the york times.com
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:00.240]   Yeah, but one of the problems that you see is that you see a lot of podcasters
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:04.080]   Who are doing trying to you know, they're supposed to be doing the kind of ads that you do
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:09.760]   But you can tell that they don't care. They don't know about the products really they're pretending to they don't sell it
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:13.360]   They don't believe in it. They don't they haven't vetted the advertisers
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.480]   And so they're just like radio another
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:21.680]   They're simply employees doing what they were told and and it you can you can't fake it
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:26.080]   Yeah, and that's the difference. So sometimes on this network it works great
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:33.520]   And on other networks the exact same general idea completely fails. That's a good point. I I I will always
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:36.240]   fall in favor of
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:39.440]   not even thinking about advertising but thinking about the community
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:44.000]   And and building the community's loyalty because I think in the long run
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:50.160]   Advertising works on podcast because the people who listen to those podcasts care about the podcast and want to support them
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.680]   And instead of asking you to give us money directly we say well
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:57.680]   Here's some products you might be interested in and if we pick the products wisely
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:02.640]   And that's a big part of it. Yeah, um then the audience can show its loyalty by
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:10.640]   By buying those products. That's a very handmade process. Yes, that's not something that's ever going to translate to mass media
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:14.480]   Right, which is fine with me. I work in mass media. I know about mass media, right?
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.040]   Sucks it is
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.040]   Not mass media and I'm happy about it
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:25.520]   Um, all right, let's talk. Let's see. Where should we go from here? Should we talk about yahoo? I'd love to talk about yahoo
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:32.080]   Wow, this is a sad we should get to the uh the the pixel uh phone. Oh, all right. Maybe we'll do the pixel then we'll do yahoo next
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.080]   That could be a natural transition point. Yeah
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:36.320]   Um, so google had october 4th
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.560]   We've had time now two weeks to adjust
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:44.320]   They're a big product announcement. That's a lot of products not just two new pixel phones replacing the nexus phones
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:47.600]   But also a google router system very much like the euro
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:51.440]   Google vr visor very much like the sam san gear vr
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:54.720]   Uh and google um home
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:38:01.280]   I don't know what you call that category very much like the amazon echo voice controlled speakers ai speakers i'm like, I don't know
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:05.120]   Why does that really say what the category is virtual assistant appliance? How about that? Yeah?
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:11.440]   Maybe i think no what what must i category what might just that is is spot on
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:15.200]   Because I think our inclination is to
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:20.640]   You just listed all the hardware products, but that's not how google presented it and I think that's very important to note
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:24.560]   Uh, it's an ecosystem. It's an ecosystem of intelligence
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:27.440]   Well soon to advertise
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:33.280]   He started by kind of recounting the the history of technology as he as he characterized it
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:38.800]   Which was which was the you know the pc then the internet then mobile and then he said the next epoch is going to be
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:44.640]   AI uh, I would quibble with the the i definition a little bit which you can get to in a second
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:52.880]   But the the that was the context was google assistant and they spent 20 minutes going over google assistant before they got to any hardware
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:39:00.160]   And that is the context in which the hardware was being introduced. I think that's that's really important to understand because
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:05.920]   You talk about the pixel phone it being expensive and and stuff like that. Well, I guess the
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:12.000]   The question is what why is pixel different? Why is that new name? Why is it not clum mexis?
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.520]   Why do they have a deal with horizon? They never had a deal with horizon before. Why are they spending a lot of marketing?
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:22.640]   I was watching uh, what was I watching? I was watching the the the Wisconsin batteries. You know, I'm having a rough look all week
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:30.400]   And they had those terrible pixel ads. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, right but they spent they spent what was it a huge amount of money in 24 hours?
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:34.480]   Several million dollars. They're 3.2 million dollars in two days
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:43.520]   But that's money that they've never spent they've never spent previously and so I to me my reaction to that is is to
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:48.480]   Figure out why is this such a completely different approach?
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:52.160]   And then you back up you think about the assistant and you know, we
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:57.040]   I expect the google assistant to be excellent. I've ordered a pixel phone before to trying it
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:05.280]   Uh, and you think about it. Why wouldn't it be? That's what google is good at and google's technology is very very well placed for a
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:08.240]   Quote-unquote ai future, but this is a very different
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:15.760]   Play by google because they're putting for the first time ever a feature in their phone that other android handstand manufacturers don't yet have access
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:21.280]   Exactly exactly because what's the problem? The problem is that the future is terrible for google's business model
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:27.280]   Google's business model is about providing users a selection and they pick one
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:33.840]   And they put their advertisers in the competition against each other and the user selects the winner of that competition
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:36.880]   That doesn't work at all in an assistant world
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:42.160]   They don't have a business model for the assistant world and so you look at what they're doing boy
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.800]   Well, what's what does apple do apple?
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:49.920]   You don't buy an apple because you want an iphone per se although that is a significant
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:52.720]   Advanced apple has that's definitely the case in many markets
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:55.360]   Again, particularly in china. I think it's a great example of this
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:59.280]   But you buy it because it's the only way you can get ios if you prefer ios
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:03.520]   You only have one option apple effectively has a monopoly on ios and you buy an iphone
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:06.160]   You give apple a huge margin to do so
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:11.600]   Well, if google assistant ends up being the best assistant to buy a long shot
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:15.920]   And if assistance end up being a viable way that people interact with the world
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:20.080]   What is a very what is a proven way to make money on a highly differentiated feature?
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:26.720]   To sell a very high margin piece of hardware that's the only way to get it and given that context and what they're doing
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:32.400]   I think at a minimum google is at least exploring a pretty significant shift in their business model
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:35.760]   And all the evidence of spending lots of money to promote it
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.800]   Having it only on their one device all these things
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:44.320]   At least suggest that they're they're experimenting with the world beyond sort of ad sense and to me
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:49.840]   That's why this was one of the most interesting announcements that that we've seen in a very long time in in tech generally
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:53.840]   I completely ring that sounds really compelling but uh at the google event
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:57.280]   I was there and in speaking with a couple executives
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:01.040]   And the head of the search team and the head of the home team
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:03.440]   Um, that's not what they're doing
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:06.640]   They told me that they're going to make the assistant available
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:09.680]   Uh to be built into as many devices as possible
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:14.800]   And in fact, they said to expect that ces that there would be a wave of assistant speakers
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:18.080]   Uh made by other manufacturers at lower price points
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:23.120]   Um, so that sounds good adding assistant is a simple thing to do to it's a very simple thing
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:29.120]   And they all hacked on google approved and they also spoke about at the event that they're going to open up an sdk
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:36.160]   Next year to allow other people to create other assistant commands. So you might be right and then here's the here's the thing is is is with google
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:41.200]   You can never really tell what the hell they're doing because they will change their mind
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:46.720]   Six months later down the road. Yeah, so I think you know what they're intentional on the
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.480]   Yeah, it is it is
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.720]   It's up against the wall. They're letting it start winning it
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:57.600]   What they're telling me versus what what ben is saying could be the future are two totally different things and they might be flirting with both
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:00.400]   And to see where they gain traction first might be the direction
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:06.800]   Is this inconsistent ben with your analysis? I mean, uh, it doesn't have to be only on google hardware to succeed
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:13.360]   Well, well to be it's a very and I've also heard well the big question to me is is the phone oem's so
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:21.520]   One i've heard rumors as well that google is is making it available in some what form in man or two phone oem's
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:25.760]   What i'm curious about is two things one. It's not a part of android. It is a separate thing
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:28.480]   So are they going to be charging the oem's for it?
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:33.680]   That would be an interesting revenue stream for this and you add on that the fact that sam san
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:39.920]   acquired viv the personal assistant and it seems uh, that's a
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.920]   Assertly sam san knew this move was coming. I think i think
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:48.880]   They should point out was created by the sera the folks who created seria and sold it to apple
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:54.560]   And importantly, it's the thing out there that's closest to assistant in terms of ai with multi-agency
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:58.880]   Um roberts cobalt published in a very interesting post on facebook
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:03.600]   He said the reason viv viv did not want to sell the sam san that was the last thing they wanted to do
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:06.320]   but they saw the writing on the wall with
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.160]   apple
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:13.920]   And they saw that's that where seria was going would would would basically make them useless so they sold fast right
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:19.040]   Is that possible right and so i was a question i mean so to me that suggests that
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:26.320]   Assistant if it is available to non google phones. I'm very curious as to what the terms of that are
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:29.280]   in the condition chrome they give chrome to everybody
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.080]   Knowing that it's going to generate revenue for google
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:37.040]   In the same way that an assistant even if it's given away will generate revenue to google
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:41.760]   Wouldn't you want if you're once you create this and get it working properly wouldn't you want it to be everywhere?
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:48.560]   Absolutely because i want everybody to imagine a future that's like star trek so maybe five years out 10 years out
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:55.200]   You just talked president obama says it could be more than that okay. Well, you know he is that he is exactly a technology columnist
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.200]   Did you read his amazing article is admired? Yeah, it was great. It was great
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.920]   My general observation is obama is that it has been
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.480]   Ai's been seeping to our lives in all sorts of ways
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:10.320]   We just don't notice a part of the reason is because the way we think about ai is colored by popular culture sci-fi
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.400]   Yep, there's a distinction
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:18.320]   Between generalized ai and specialized ai all you hear about in sci-fi is generalized ai the kind of thing
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.920]   You're talking about
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:24.960]   Uh, but that's hard to do it's not he says my impression based on talking to my top science advisors
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:29.840]   Who are obviously probably pretty good is there were a reasonably long way away from that
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:35.760]   It's the specialized ai that we're going to see in our scene every aspect of our lives from medicine to transportation
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:38.320]   to the grid
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:45.200]   I thought that was very individual each individual will have what is essentially a personal artificial intelligence
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:51.840]   Agent that is always available. It can be it could be like her. I hope it doesn't it sounds like scar
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:58.720]   Yeah, but essentially it will do three things and there are three and and these three things are essentially all the things
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:03.600]   So first of all it does everything that the public the thing that obama's talking about the public
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:08.960]   Ai the google search type of things the generic things a B it will do
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:13.440]   It'll know all your personal data in the case of assistant. It will know everything every gmail
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:17.440]   Message everything you do it will monitor your search results
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:22.240]   It'll do all that kind of stuff and purse and also pay attention to what you do and how you interact with it
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:28.880]   And give you a personal google and then the third thing is to control every object every smart object in your world
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:32.720]   All three of those things simply by having a conversation with this
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:38.240]   Ai so you just say I want this I want that and what ai enables you to do which
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:41.440]   Alexa does not
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.440]   Is it will choose the third party service?
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:48.080]   Right because right now with with Alexa you have to you have to install it you have to find it
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:53.600]   You have to memorize your media area between you and that's the financial opportunity secondary to
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:57.120]   The one that you will want to get in between every transaction exactly
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:00.720]   That's why they want to have their ai front center and and everywhere
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:05.280]   But the scary thing is for all of these companies is you're going to pick one and you're going to want to have one
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:10.320]   Following you throughout all your day. You're not going to want to switch between Siri and this and no
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:14.480]   But you're going to pick the one that works the best exactly and it's a race and it works the best
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:16.880]   If it has the best ai if it's the most ubiquitous
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:21.680]   And if it's the most personalization and google wins on all three of those well mossberg wrote in
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:25.840]   I agree on the business model perspective the
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:28.400]   It's not queer
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:35.280]   To me one that there is a business model there as an intermediary and two even if there is
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:39.360]   You know if there are some categories where they can charge some sort of like affiliate feed to get back to our
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:41.840]   Sort of podcasting
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:47.840]   Example here. It's it's an affiliate feed model is going to be a significant
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:52.880]   Top line reduction for google's business right now google's search business generates in parts
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:48:01.440]   That's high revenues because there is a lifetime value calculation that goes into a lot of these advertisements where these customers are looking to acquire a user for
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:02.720]   a
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:08.400]   ongoing relationship not just a one-time relationship a relationship where google is the intermediary for everything
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:15.360]   Sounds good in theory, but if you actually look at the way they make money in the in the margins of in the rates that they can
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:17.040]   Get on a purchase
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:20.160]   It's it's going to be a a cut in revenue now
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:26.640]   Maybe they make up in volume because there's so many things but the number of categories where they can actually earn an affiliate fee
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:29.600]   And to make up what what they have now i'm
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:33.200]   It remains to be seen how that's going to work and I don't and again
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:38.320]   I'm not saying that it's going to be a pixel sell at a profit model in their future
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.640]   But it certainly seems like they are
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:46.400]   At least experimenting with some new sort of business models that they haven't done before and I think that's if you
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.360]   I think that's appropriate given their long-term challenges in that regard
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:54.000]   I think experimenting is exactly right and any of all of these could pan out, but it also
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.080]   Uh, you also have to realize that they don't have to make up all the current revenue
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:03.760]   They still will have video advertising. They'll still who knows what the opportunities are going to be in VR
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:08.240]   There are lots and lots of things coming you can put billboards inside of self-driving cars
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.400]   You know, there are lots of revenue models that are coming
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:18.160]   But the the biggest problem I think is that they realize that both apps and search are going to be replaced to a very large extent by just people talking to
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:21.600]   Their AI assistant. Yeah, and that's what I think we all agree on that
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:24.240]   The google is saying we got to figure out what the future is going to look like
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:29.520]   Definitely, uh, and I think AI seems like a sensible place to look. Yep. I think part of the thing
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:31.760]   I worry about is
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:36.960]   You and I we know what we want we want her. Yes, we want this generalized intelligence
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:38.960]   That can act as a true assistant. It's so funny
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:43.760]   Endearing fireball john groobers rebuttal to uh, walt mossberg
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:46.960]   Says assistant is the right term for this class of software
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:52.560]   But I can't imagine how stupid an actual human assistant would have to be not to understand a request like
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:57.200]   Find out when the next debate is and put it on my calendar. Yeah, none of these can do it
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.840]   Right, uh, he's pointing out how stupid they are right now
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:02.880]   And i'm wondering very stupid. I'm also wondering if
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:10.720]   Uh, even though we want a particular kind of AI if from a purely financial business point of view
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:12.640]   If that's not the kind of AI
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:15.520]   Google or anybody else would want to give us they may want to say
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:18.880]   Look what we'll do is we'll have a bidding more between Yelp and open table
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:20.960]   And whoever pays us the most amount of money
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.600]   That's who you'll be calling on when you ask for a reservation
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:29.120]   And that isn't the world you and I want we want we want an assistant that is working for us not working for google
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:33.600]   Yeah, and I think google probably wants to the opposite and I think of all the ones
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:38.560]   You know that are competing in space of all the companies are competing space apple's the one that's going to most deliver that
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:44.640]   Well, but not an android look at walt mossberg because he says why does syri seem so dumb
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:48.560]   And if it doesn't get better soon, what does that mean for apple?
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:51.040]   And i'm going to paraphrase
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:57.280]   But I think it's fair to say that apple has chosen a path that ultimately is a dead end in terms of artificial intelligence
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:59.920]   Well syria is not syria is not ai
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:04.640]   Cortana is not google now is very very and so that this is the thing that i'm fascinated
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:10.880]   About with with with the assistant which is that you know google as we know two years ago about deep mind which is
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:15.600]   Just top shelf artificial intelligence. This is the the the system that beat
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:21.200]   humans and go and and atari breakout and stuff like this is really really good ai
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:24.480]   And so I have the feeling that assistant is like
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:32.480]   How when it was singing daisy and they they've replaced something that was a pretty sophisticated non artificial intelligent
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:35.120]   virtual assistant with a baby
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:41.280]   Virtual assistant which will now go through preschool and learn and they took a step back so they could take a step
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:46.640]   Exactly that it's and they're using machine learning and all the this kind of powerful stuff wouldn't be a bad idea
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:52.240]   Yeah, and so I think wonder though. Yeah, well, it seems like I agree with you google's got the
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:56.240]   Upper hand and of course everybody's trying this including facebook
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:59.760]   Including facebook we used to vall they're the furthest behind
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:04.640]   Yeah, except for mark stuccherburg is trying to build his assistant in his home named javis
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:08.640]   There's that and I you have to think that's more than marks, you know 20 percent project
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:11.440]   I think so but if you look at what they have out there in the public
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:15.040]   And of course you don't have to be first to win this apples rarely first
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:18.880]   They went a lot of things but if you look at the chatbots their trash
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:23.200]   I mean they're they're they're tehre i agree facebook. We took a wrong turn with or at least
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:26.720]   From the outside. Yeah, it looks like took a wrong term chat box
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:30.000]   I'm really intrigued by what you're saying mike with the assistant
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:37.280]   I think to a certain extent there's a part of that. I think what we're also seeing a lot of here is a bit of a
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:40.800]   Real like marketing smokescreen from google
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:47.760]   Yeah, uh to a certain extent um a lot of what they're doing with assistant as it's built into android and as it's built into aloe
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:49.760]   which you text with
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:54.720]   Is built on uh what they had with voice search and what they had with google now before
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:55.360]   That's right
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:56.400]   So to a certain extent
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:53:01.440]   They're taking these pre-existing products and they're just giving it a new name and they're representing it in a new way
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:05.920]   And they're telling you it's something new what it's it's it's it's an evolution of something that already existed
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:10.640]   Thanks in large part to like you said the stuff they have from deep mind to take it another level up
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:14.480]   but they're still very far away from where they need to be and and
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:21.280]   I just want to bring this up because I think there's an echo chamber inside of tech journalism right now that is saying assistant is new
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:23.520]   and it's better than
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:27.520]   Siri it's better than cortana. It's better than elixir and assistant is not that new
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:33.280]   It's mostly a rebranding and there's some is it the same as they showed two years ago at io where they yeah
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:37.360]   They you know they actually showed contextual. Yes, but you know, it's built on that
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:41.040]   Yeah, but I have the feeling that the intelligence is in the input not the output
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:46.000]   So right now the output is kind of like oh, it's just I basically just did a google search then right?
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:51.280]   Yes, but but what happens when you tell it you don't like that or you know, I
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:57.600]   Starts to wire. I think it does and and there are a couple of things about it that are impressive little things like I was
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:02.320]   Uh texting with my brother-in-law and we're I was saying, you know, hey check out this picture of this pizza
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:06.160]   We're just trying out aloe. It was like first or second day that it was out. I think aloe is pretty fun
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:09.920]   Yeah, and then it intervened in our conversation jumped in a bunnitsky
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:14.720]   Yeah, I just jumped in and said hey you guys like a time I can help you with a pizza. Yeah, here's here's a restaurant nearby
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:16.800]   Yeah, it's not what you want
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:21.840]   It depends sometimes you do and sometimes you don't it's not that smart. It's not even looking for trigger words
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:27.440]   Yes, what it's looking for. It's looking for little signals. It's goo is smart. Daisy. Daisy apple. Siri is
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:35.120]   Exactly. It's the one the dying one, but who's gonna get to hell 9,000 first where it's i'm sorry, dave. Yeah
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:42.240]   There's there's there's there's all these these two of those three companies they they have
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:45.360]   all different challenges apple has
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:52.080]   The business model that works and I think it's fair to question their technology not not because apple's dumb
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:58.640]   But just because the sort of thinking and approach that goes into building fantastic products is not necessarily thinking approach that goes into building inter
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:04.080]   What don't they also have a problem because they've they've espoused privacy and and they've said it's all going to happen on device
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:07.280]   And we don't want to share your data. Isn't that an issue also?
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:10.320]   I mean, yes, I guess the question is
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:16.400]   To what extent is the privacy a cause and to which extent is it a
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:24.000]   A making women's out of lemonade right question and to what extent those become fused? I think that that's that's something that I think
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:28.400]   I decided that that's their marketing advantage. Yep. They're gonna choose that but I think it's
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:31.600]   Very hard if you're trying well apple
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:35.600]   Maybe you have to yeah, well apple has I think apple has designs on
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:42.960]   Pretty significant business in health in general and so I think that that will that will be their benefit by the way micro subs and google both
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:51.760]   Very interested in those categories. This is true. Yeah, well and also we have pretty significant failed initiatives. Yes both both have health initiatives have failed, you're right?
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:54.080]   Yeah, that's am some for google. Yeah
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:58.560]   The big problem for google is they have what I've called a go-to-market problem
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:05.600]   Like they have great technology and the question is how are they actually get it so that people can use it and it might make this point about about
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:08.080]   Siri being available on apple before
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:16.240]   Yes, they have android but that is only a part of the market and it's not the most valuable part of the market because because apple has them
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:20.080]   Faith so apple has the business model. We're not sure what the tech google has the tech
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:26.240]   We're not sure about the access in the business model facebook has the attention and right there. That's something that's very valuable
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:29.920]   And I think that that's I guess it's my quibble about the future being AI
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:37.680]   Like to me the the I it's not just about the technologies but how you access that technology and facebook has
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:41.860]   Multiple avenues to garner attention and they garner significant
[00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:46.400]   All the data that google has plus right? Yeah, they do but they are behind
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:50.880]   I mean what the the it was really funny last year when marx lekkerberg did a post about google's
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:55.600]   AI being able to play go and then literally like 12 hours later
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:59.520]   Even people and both that they had one yeah, they
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:07.040]   Go yeah, but every avenue that facebook has is a is a fraction or a subset of what google has facebook doesn't have a browser
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:10.080]   They don't have a line of phones. Yeah, they don't have a google home type product
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:15.040]   There's a lot of browser if you live in your browser on facebook. Yeah, I mean ultimately in a way
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:19.280]   They do right you open your browser you open facebook and facebook launches you to every other
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:23.920]   Love they are never really are pretty meaningless in the future at this point
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.480]   I mean, they're not really used on the phones. Yes, we browse the web a lot
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:31.360]   but mostly in the context of a feed and
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:36.720]   Facebook has some of the best feeds in the industry right and in the future of an assistant
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:39.600]   We're showing that gonna be on a browser in in an assistant world
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:44.880]   I mean, this is this is google's conundrum in a nutshell their business model everything what their business is that's in a browser
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:46.480]   What if google?
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:49.200]   This is I don't know if this would work, but what if google
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:52.400]   stepped forward and said look this is what we we want to make
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:58.160]   Her we want to make how yeah, that minus the podbait door thing pearl pearl
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:01.520]   I mean they've this one and we need your help to do this
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:08.560]   We need you to be early adopters and we understand that what we're making is far from that at this point
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:15.040]   But with your help with your data your interaction you're gonna teach our but our little ai how to become
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:18.880]   The assistant you truly want they don't have to say that they're already doing
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:25.600]   That's it's coming from the message of the company. They don't want to explain because consumers might not buy that message
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:32.080]   But we geeks I would go for I would say yeah, I'll help you. Yeah. Well, I think they've always that's always been the trade off with google is
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:34.080]   Give us more of your information right?
[00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:37.200]   You know make it more explicit is what i'm saying
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:42.640]   They could be more clear about it for sure, but I mean that that's exactly and that's the thing is like right now
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:48.400]   They're not quite doing that i'm offering this as an antidote to bens appropriate go-to-market conundrum
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:54.080]   Yeah, what if you go to the market and say okay, we understand we're you know, this is daisy daisy
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:59:00.320]   We'd like to get to open the pod bay doors and your help is needed. How would you how would you like to help us?
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:03.200]   It would be interesting because to a certain extent they've taken that data
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:07.440]   Without fully explaining it to the public and I think a lot of people don't realize how much they're giving up
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:13.280]   Right and i'm saying take that new yeah turn out that head i think yeah, yeah, we're taking your data
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:17.200]   But this is why yeah, we want to make something that's I mean, that's what google now was right?
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:22.160]   That's it wasn't explicit. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's not what's holding google back
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:26.720]   I mean if it were so easy just to ask people to help you out
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:33.200]   Then there'd be a lot more successful businesses because anyone anyone could do that like there's a reason why so i'm spending
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:39.360]   Well, no, but that's a great point because that's our podcast thing you you talked about creating a community and all the
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:42.240]   Excellent things that you've done with twit and that's been successful for you
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:45.760]   You I mean not to not to
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:51.520]   Saying anything bad about your business. It's bigger than mine, but it's uh, you're a lot closer to me than you are to google
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:53.520]   Oh hell yeah
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:56.640]   And there's a reason that kind of approach would not scale
[00:59:56.640 --> 01:00:02.320]   It doesn't scale at all and there's a reason why samson spends 350 million to $40 million a year
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.640]   on marketing their phones
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:10.800]   And there's a reason why you had all those ads whether you think they're good or bad about pixel if you are serious about
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.200]   getting in front of consumers and
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:19.840]   Getting meaningful market share meaningful attention share that that's they're going to have to invest and spend their way into it
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:22.880]   And actually to me that's my biggest root of skepticism
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:26.400]   I mean I put this nice theoretical thing about a new business model for them
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:32.160]   The reality is they've never demonstrated either the capability or frankly the stomach to
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:37.680]   To build a business beyond their their business fell in their lap
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:41.760]   They they had a brilliant technological product that people like
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:47.600]   Google is the exception that proves the rule google won by having the best tech and people used it because it was better
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:50.560]   That is very rarely why products win
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:54.400]   Well, I think to a certain extent now we're getting to a point where
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.880]   Uh, a lot of people choose google products
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:02.720]   Uh, because they don't like apple and it's like an alternative to apple and it's like the only other place to go
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:08.160]   Um, uh, really? I think two people are voting against apple by choosing google
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:14.720]   People are either voting for apple or voting against apple but apple is the that's what apple is what everyone that's the universe
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:19.280]   Yeah, I I well, I mean I talk to only use myself as an example
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:24.320]   But I choose andra because it's more flexible more powerful. I can do more of what I want to do
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.840]   I get a lot of the vote against it
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:31.440]   But i'm carrying an iphone right now because i'm waiting for the pixel. Yeah, but that's not a vote against apple
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:36.080]   Really? I think a lot of people a lot of consumers make that just shows how dominant apple is then. Yes
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:39.840]   I mean, you know why and and I loved it
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:46.000]   I loved to maybe hear what everyone has to say about how amazon and elixir fits into this how microsoft and cortana fits into this
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.040]   Uh, let's talk more. I want to take a break. Well, let's talk more
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:54.880]   Uh, show today brought to you by my mattress. We were talking about casper mattresses. This is a perfect example
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:58.880]   uh online retailer premium mattresses made in the us
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:06.320]   And uh, you know, I'm not sure why they advertise on our show except that I think they think you guys need better night's sleep
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:12.240]   They'll be my guests right that is a good guess your audience is exhausted there you guys are exhausted
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:15.760]   Uh, you know what it is more and more the evidence is
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:19.760]   Uh, the best thing you could do for your health is to sleep properly the sleep well
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:25.040]   And it starts with a great mattress. They combine springy latex foam that's on top
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:30.160]   But then they give you support with the memory foam and so you're getting underneath so you're getting
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:34.000]   It's hard to describe you got to try it kind of this combination of
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:40.640]   Comfort and support. It's just what I want because I always slept on firm mattresses, but they were too firm. My hips had hurt
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:45.600]   This is perfect. It's a 2016 business intelligence group innovation award winner
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:49.920]   Just the right sink just the right bounce and lasts a long time
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:52.960]   They also are cool. I can tell you from this hot hot summer
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:55.760]   The casper was great
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:00.640]   Because it breathes so you're never sleeping hot your temperature is very comfortable
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:06.960]   All the time and now the best part is you can try it in your home and not in some shop with
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:11.440]   For five minutes under bright lights with a salesperson looking at you funny
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:17.600]   But you and and your loved ones can all get on that mattress and really give it a workout for the next hundred days
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:22.720]   And if at any time in the first hundred days you say that's not right they they understand, you know
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:26.560]   We're not gonna let them try it. So we've got to make it easy to return you call them up
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:28.560]   They will take it back courier will come get it
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:32.400]   You don't have to put it back in the box people say, how am I gonna get back in that box?
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:36.480]   Right. No, you don't have to you can throw the box out. They'll just come and get it
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:39.840]   I think they donated is what they do. I don't think they even resell it
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:45.120]   They just donate it to local charity, but you get every penny back. So there's no risk at all
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:48.080]   Free shipping and returns to the us and canada
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:52.400]   They are made in the us and to the highest environmental production
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:56.240]   Standards, you know, I was a little concerned when I got in the box. It's all sealed up
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:59.760]   I thought am I gonna open this up? I don't have to let it breathe for a while before no, mm-hmm
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:05.040]   It smells great. It's cool. It's it's a very refreshing night's sleep
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:06.720]   You'll love it and it's very affordable

[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.760]   in college because
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:29.440]   I didn't poor guy didn't really wasn't thrilled about sleeping on the dorm mattress
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.840]   And I don't blame him. God knows what's been going on there
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:38.160]   And uh, that's right a passage. It is. I know I did you did they're not comfortable. They're terrible
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:41.360]   They're stained. I always worry. I wonder about those stains. Is that blood?
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:43.440]   And then
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.480]   And then uh, so I I was nice. I was a nice father
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:51.280]   I said look look for a box and because it comes in that box. He was just slept it upstairs. What's cool?
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:53.600]   And I also said
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:57.920]   Graduate leave your mattress. It's okay because it wasn't expensive. You could you know, it's
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:00.720]   You can leave the next guy's gonna be very happy
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:03.280]   What happened that video of you?
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:10.320]   Why don't we show me uh diving into my mattress anymore? I guess they figured you've seen it Ben Thompson is here stratecaree
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:13.600]   S T R A T E C H E R Y a great site
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:18.400]   He does free articles every week, but also a paid newsletter, which I subscribe to
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:24.400]   With some of the best analysis of what's going on the tech industry and what's always a thrill to have you on from Taipei
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:28.080]   And so so the worst lighting at this new office lighting is so irrelevant
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:33.840]   But you got a few dude. I love that. Yeah, is that of Taipei? What is that? Uh, yeah, it is
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:35.600]   Nice
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.040]   Very pretty
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:39.040]   You you you've lived there for how long now
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:46.400]   Uh, this is my second stint. I've been here three years this time. Okay, and I was here uh, six years previously. So nine total
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:48.800]   Oh, you got how's your Chinese?
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:54.800]   Uh, it's decent good. Yeah, the way I put it is if you can't speak Chinese, you will think it's phenomenal
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:59.360]   Oh, you speak mark succuburg level Chinese then right
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:01.200]   Uh
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.720]   Little bit of the mark
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:06.080]   Mark's secretary. Well, he has an incredible vocabulary frankly
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:13.120]   Uh, but he speaks Chinese like someone who's spent a lot of time by himself studying Chinese and and not a lot of time speaking with people
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:18.000]   Right is he there's tones and his tones are kind of uh, all over the place
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.520]   But he's vocabulary is really good. I think it's a vocabulary probably better than mine is uh, so it is I mean make no mistake
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:30.800]   It's super duper impressive. It is incredibly difficult language to learn. Yeah, I don't think I don't think his approach to China is very impressive
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:35.840]   But his what is his approach to what is what is Facebook's he doesn't try to join us China
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:38.640]   well, I
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.080]   it's
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:45.600]   I think it's is extremely differential to say the least I think it's um, you know, it's such a massive market
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:50.400]   It's very understandable from that perspective why they want in I I'm not sure he
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:52.800]   uh
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:54.560]   I think he's a little
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:56.560]   optimistic about the
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:03.520]   What would happen if Facebook was actually allowed in China and the impact the corrosive impact frankly that would have on him and on
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:08.400]   Facebook the company because he would have to adhere obey the laws of china
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:12.160]   Well, it would well it would almost certainly have to be a separate Facebook
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:16.000]   That would be different from my girl Facebook who would be have to be hosted in china
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.640]   There would have to be tracking and and censorship and all the sorts of things that are expected of that
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:25.440]   And it's not just that but it's not just you responding to requests like responding to a takeout request
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:29.360]   There's an expectation that a company that's doing this is proactive in doing this
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:35.520]   And so you see what happens a lot in these networks in china is stuff gets censored without the government having to do it because
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:40.560]   There's it we just know there's an over response. Yeah, and an expectation of it. Yeah, and
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:43.840]   I don't and
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:46.640]   When and if they become even remotely successful
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:51.680]   Uh that any time the government can can pull the plug on them. I don't think it's yeah
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:58.880]   Yeah, I mean the it's currently blocked by the great firewall. Yeah. Yeah as it is and it always will be at the current version
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:02.240]   I just I think the return is not nearly
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:06.080]   What uh, he thinks it will be and I think there's a little bit of a
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:11.120]   Um, we will be different sort of right attitude about it that I don't think is justified
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:15.200]   And frankly, I hope that it's never allowed in because I like I said, I think it's bad
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:18.480]   I think it'd be bad for the company. I think it'd be bad for their culture to
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:21.600]   To be a part of that and I don't think it'd be profitable to boot
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:26.240]   I could just see I feel like it's almost like kill where I could see american companies looking over the wall
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:32.080]   Yeah saying a billion customers a billion customers. How do we get in there a billion customers?
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:36.720]   Uh, googles had problems. Uh yahoo's had problems where we talk about even apples had problems
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:42.480]   Anything that involves free speech if you enable free speech you they will never let you succeed in china. Yeah, yeah
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:45.840]   Uh, even beyond that. I mean just it also
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:50.720]   It's questionable. They're gonna ever really let a a foreign company
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:53.760]   You know it's succeed. I mean the reason why apple has an apple
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:58.160]   I've used this phrase before but is the sort of exception that proves the rule in this case
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:04.240]   Is because there is this model because they're selling hardware. That's differentia by software software will be pirated or copied
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:09.520]   Web services will be blocked the one way that companies have always made money in china is making hardware
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:17.760]   Of course most of them were making ultimately stuff with windows or that could be easily commoditized because apple products are not easily commoditized yet are still hardware
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:20.400]   That's the reason they've been the one company to succeed
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:27.920]   But notice as apple has pushed into more into services and it's getting harder and china's messing with them
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:34.000]   but significantly more than they were before specifically around communication because they they were accused by
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.560]   Chinese owned media of
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:41.200]   Harvesting data about the chinese people and where they are as part of this big plot
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:49.840]   I mean, this is the big concern the china the chinese government does not want american companies coming in and enabling chinese citizens to talk to each other without monitoring or control
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:53.200]   Interestingly, you might associate this to an authoritarian communist
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:56.480]   Post-mal government, but it is it it's historically
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:00.400]   Going back to the box or rebellion. This is china has always
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:05.840]   Hated the influence of the west and is well not always but almost always and often fought it off
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:10.400]   Uh violently. So this is this is almost a cultural thing as much as it is political
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:13.920]   There are two the two big china hot buttons are at play here one is
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:19.520]   domination by foreign powers and the second one is you know china historically has just had one
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:23.040]   big massive dynasty change through through either
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:25.120]   you know that
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:30.000]   Through conquering or whatever or also, you know, they're concerned about losing control of the population
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.880]   They're concerned about the big country. They they it's interesting both china and russia massive
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:40.080]   Land masses difficult to control. Yes have this tendency to authoritarianism
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:46.640]   Maybe the only way you can control it and now here in the united states we're moving in that direction as well big land massy hard to control
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:51.840]   Um, ben. I'm sorry. We shouldn't be analyzing china with a guy who's sitting in type. Hey right now, but
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:56.720]   If we're completely off base just pretend we know
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.720]   Yeah, um
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:00.720]   Things are great
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:03.120]   Yeah, I'm just just breaking deep
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:05.680]   Can you say wallway?
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:14.640]   Uh actually facebook launched. It's at work product product this week to the public's been out for a long time and beta. Yeah
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:18.160]   This is an interesting play because facebook very
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:21.840]   Uh, it's an intranet. We should point out this is not a linkedin competitor
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:29.120]   This is not a business focused social network kind of a slack competitor. Yeah, but slack is so much smaller in capability
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:34.400]   I mean it competes with not just slack but base camp and everybody else's trying to trillow
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:37.040]   Trello, uh
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:42.640]   On the one hand I think as a company you might say well my cut my uh, my employees love facebook
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:47.280]   They know how to use facebook. There's no training involved. It gives me all the features of these others
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:53.280]   But the other hand you might worry a little bit about giving this information to facebook even though if they may they do promise it's private
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:58.320]   Yeah, they change that a lot though. Don't they? Yeah, I feel like facebook is one of the companies you can't
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:03.840]   Can't trust to be consistent. They are charging for this. It is not free. They are three bucks per user
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:08.640]   That's a lot less than slack to a thousand users and then it's two bucks up to 10,000 and three bucks
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:11.120]   It's one of the most affordable solutions, right?
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:15.680]   And the enterprise space is like the one one of the few spaces where you can charge for the sort of thing
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:22.000]   They they know where they could charge consumers for this and after all the biggest competitor here would be share point for microsoft and google
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.760]   And I don't know do they do you me might trust microsoft in the enterprise?
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:29.600]   But I don't have google's anymore trustworthy in the facebook in the enterprise. What do you think ben?
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:37.040]   Well, I mean to be to be queer that it is very is separate the data is all separate from the consumer app and frankly
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:40.000]   I think that's it's fair to expect that will be the case
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.960]   I mean their credibility and opportunity to be completely shot if that we're not the case or ever shown to not be the case
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:47.600]   That said
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:51.600]   Certainly theoretically again. There's a lot here that makes sense people know how to use it
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.600]   It's mobile first all that sort of thing
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:13:00.560]   It's a and it's a I think it is much bigger than so I could say whole scale sort of replacement for your communications infrastructure
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:03.360]   uh, that's also a problem I think because
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:09.680]   The way you get into an enterprise be given the nature of it and the way it has to be tied into identity
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:17.280]   If this is a top-down sort of product that's going to be implemented by a cio for example or or or in a startup or whatever it might be
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:20.880]   And that's that's a challenge that means building a sales force
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:26.480]   That means building all the sorts of things that again facebook has not shown any inclination or capability or
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:27.920]   or
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:31.040]   willingness to do the big difference with something like slack is
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:36.080]   Slack has two advantages that don't seem like advantage at first but the first advantage is it only does chat
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:37.840]   Which is well facebook does so much more
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:43.360]   Well, if you have a company that already has an established communications infrastructure slack is offering a new thing
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:45.680]   Which is community chat? Yes, we've had with irc
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:52.000]   But for most people it's it's a new product and so it slots in with what's already there and so there's more opportunity for one
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.560]   but then two slacks free to try all you need is an email address and
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:02.480]   If you like it and you need some of the capabilities a team manager can pull it as company credit card and can pay for it
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:07.280]   And so you can have more more of a bottoms up sort of infiltration of the enterprise approach
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:12.400]   Where slack eventually once they build up a sales team can go to the say I'll say oh by the way
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:15.760]   70 percent of your 60 percent of your companies already using our products
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:18.480]   How will we put together a a product that works for your
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:25.200]   Deal that works for your whole company and I think that's a really revolutionary change in selling enterprise software
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:31.120]   And it's only enabled by being on the cloud and and that's a big shift and facebook
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:37.440]   As compelling as the product will be and I think there will be some businesses where it's going to be really successful and make a lot of sense
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:41.520]   The level of commitment needed and the way it's going to be sold
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:47.120]   I think are going to be challenges for for the product and it frankly it feels like let's do it because we can
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:50.240]   And that's not a good route to success in business frankly
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:55.760]   Like you you succeed in business because you align entire organization incentives and the way you make money around
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:01.920]   Making a product successful not throwing something over the wall because well, we're already using it internally. Maybe you like to use it too
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:05.120]   Well, there you go
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:07.840]   Forget it mark now a chance in hell
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:11.040]   Uh, I know I think there is a chance
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:16.160]   Well, what the thing remember is it's it is a great product and facebook has been using it has been beta testing
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:21.360]   And you talk to anyone at facebook. I've never met anyone who doesn't love that
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:25.600]   That's often their favorite thing about working at facebook is the way that you can use facebook
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:28.000]   Internal groups
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.880]   Those other products and i've actually had some personal experience here not using facebook
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:37.040]   But when I was at automatic, we use a combination of what are called p2 blogs
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:42.320]   It's kind of front-facing front-posting blog that feels a lot like facebook plus it was irc
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:48.640]   Then they use slack now, uh along with along with skype for video chatting and we kind of patched together this multi piece
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:54.160]   Communication layer that was amazing. I've never felt more connected and in the loop about what's going on
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:57.280]   Despite the fact automatics totally remote and people live all over the world
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:05.680]   So like this idea of this completely new way of doing communications is compelling in the fact facebook's offering an integrated solution
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:10.320]   That does that is amazing. I guess the big question I have is again the sort of go-to-market thing
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:18.480]   How are they gonna actually get companies using that and the nature of the product being all in requires an all-in commitment from companies that use it
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:23.520]   And so maybe if you're a startup it might be super compelling to start your company working that way
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:26.720]   Going into established companies. I think I think that
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.440]   just by virtue of being
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:37.040]   A single use product and having a more compelling business model for a small team that slack still has pretty significant advantages
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:42.160]   And the you know going even earlier than startups they're free to educational institutions
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:46.080]   So universities might use it theoretically and non-profits might use it
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:50.480]   And so this could be a long-term play that could pay off because if they can get people
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:56.560]   Uh in you know who who need to get a solution like this who can get it for free and then they move into the workplace and so on
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:01.600]   Then that could work. I personally think it's gonna fail despite how good it apparently is
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:06.080]   Um most of the things that facebook has launched over the years have completely failed
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:13.520]   Uh, and I think we forget that don't we that's a surprisingly large number of things so many things. Yeah, so many things. Yeah, isn't that funny?
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:16.480]   Yeah, well, that's the case for all of the incumbent companies. I think I think the
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:19.760]   incumbents don't generally innovate very well do they
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:22.560]   Well, the the problem is that
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:23.680]   uh
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:30.560]   When a company has started its initial product is there's a need in the market that they are fulfilling and everything about the company becomes
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:37.440]   Aligned in fulfilling that need whether it would be the culture whether it be how they make their incentives the structure how they make money all that sort of stuff
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:38.720]   and
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:43.760]   In the future when a new opportunity comes up their advantage is they have tons of resources
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:50.800]   Whereas another startup is very much aligned to the opportunity and I think uh an unfortunate
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:56.560]   Mistake a lot of pundits make is they because resources can be easily measured and calculated
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:01.120]   They over index on resources when actually it's a lot of this other stuff
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:07.680]   It it's it's having a very focused company a very focused product that matters more and and so yeah
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:09.760]   I'm with mike my default is
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:16.080]   Against an incumbent shifting to a new area particularly if it entails a new way of selling a new business model
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:19.920]   That's that's a lot more difficult shift to make than I think most people appreciate
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.800]   It's just really hard to get people to break their habits
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:27.360]   I mean in companies we have established ways of of doing things and and communicating
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:30.000]   I mean, I think a lot of us would love to give up email
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.160]   But we can't get our newsroom to give up email to save our lives. You know, it's like it's so
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:36.080]   At least they'll make you use lotus 1 2 3
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:37.760]   There's that there's that it could be worse
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:40.720]   But we've tried to bring in some companies use lotus 1 2 3 4
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:42.080]   Some companies are still using it
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:43.120]   I know
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:46.960]   And and some newsrooms are worked in the past use irc and loved it
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:54.160]   You know, we're we've tried to adopt slack and it's uh, it's in some teams in some parts of the journal
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:57.680]   It's it's been a tremendous success and others. It's a miserable failure and nobody uses it
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:01.760]   The trouble with irc is you need some you need a team that really understands irc
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:03.920]   You got to be a little it can customize the hell out of it
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:08.240]   But if they can and they do and I use our chat room as an example
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:12.880]   We have really smart people. Yeah, it can be a very very powerful. Oh, it's a blast
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:18.800]   You got to be a little learning to use it. You know, it's a blast very real time very intimate. It's great. I love it
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:20.880]   Yeah, so with what we just I'm sorry
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:23.760]   I was just gonna say with you know, but agreeing with what you're saying, Ben
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:27.520]   I mean with workplace trying to basically come at all fronts and do everything all at once
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:30.080]   It seems like it might be great software
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:33.840]   But to to get people to give up all these things that they're used to and they're there
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:36.480]   You know, even if they hate them, it's their routine
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:38.960]   Is difficult. So I feel like
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:44.000]   The maybe the opportunity might come in a long-term play with with those companies that are just starting
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.760]   But I feel like this is probably gonna fall on its face as well. Yeah
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:50.560]   Um
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:55.040]   You want to talk about yahoo or do you want to talk about twitter or do you want to are we done with google?
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.800]   Have we talked about every?
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:59.200]   aspect of the google announcement
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:02.800]   I think we've talked about the ai and where where google's going with that
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:05.360]   How so
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:07.440]   Of the panel who's actually gotten their hands on the phone?
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:10.160]   I did a hands-on with it at the event but you're the only one
[01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:16.880]   Uh, and then there are some people I know one of our audience members has one waiting for him when he gets back to Australia
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:18.880]   Yeah, because tellstra
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:22.320]   Screwed up screwed up. Oh, they started shipping them early. They shipped them early
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:27.840]   Uh, we we haven't got one here. Jason howl has his order. He'll get it in a few days on the 20th
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:31.520]   That's the earliest you get a mind doesn't come to the 8th. I'm very intrigued
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:37.360]   I just I had to say my jaw dropped when they that's the price. I just the sticker shock me too
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:42.800]   I was a little disappointed is that because just because the expectation the nexus is always a little less expensive or
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:46.880]   I don't know. I think they really want to position themselves as a premium brand of sorts
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:51.200]   It doesn't seem to have flagship all the flagship features. No SD card. No waterproofing
[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:56.000]   Um, I no wireless charging no wireless charging. That's a big one for me
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.800]   Well none of those were premium features according to apple as of two months ago. Oh apples at apples in it
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:04.160]   So Apple still doesn't have wireless charging. It is why they don't have fast charging
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:09.120]   Which might be two reasons why their batteries don't blow up. I think there are batteries last all day
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:12.640]   I've never had a phone last better. Yeah, actually the seven
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:16.480]   I was carrying around the battery case with a 6s and I haven't needed it with a seven
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:21.840]   Which yeah pretty impressed partly. That's tight control of the ecosystem of the software. Yeah, oh, that's right
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:27.680]   Sure stuff will not run in the background. You have to launch google photos periodically just to get it to back up your fun
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:34.080]   Yeah, it's that's apple. You know, there's there's their platform. Yeah, um, I think we need to talk about yahoo though
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:37.760]   Let's talk about yahoo. I gotta say i'm still pretty mad about all this stuff
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:42.080]   I'm mad too. And what i'm really disappointed frankly by marissa mire
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:45.520]   I expected better of her. Maybe I was foolish
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:52.880]   But what's apparently the case look yahoo was there's two big stories of course and we've mentioned them before yahoo was hacked
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:56.240]   And it pretty much the entire yahoo user database leaked out
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:02.720]   Yeah, they had passwords hashed but we don't know how well hashed since it was a long time ago probably not so well and
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:05.360]   Secret questions were in the clear
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:13.040]   And emails were in the clear obviously and then the real question is when did yahoo know about this and there's some evidence that marissa mire
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:18.640]   Knew as early as july, but kept it a secret in order to keep the verizon sale alive. Yep
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:23.120]   Now verizon's calling foul and saying hey that's material information
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:28.320]   Uh, they could either cancel the sale or probably what they're going to do is get a significant discount
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:31.920]   Yeah billion discount, which would be smart on their part. You know
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:37.440]   It just so that's part one of the problem. Yeah, what did they know when did they know it?
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:43.360]   Uh, are we satisfied that they knew about it and sat on it and if they did that's it sure seems that way
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:49.840]   I mean there's reprehensible. I forget the title of the fellow who resigned but there was uh, basically one of their top security guys
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:54.800]   Found out about this and then resigned and quit. I mean, uh, Alex tamas
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:57.920]   Yeah, it was is now at facebook ironically and how long ago was that?
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:02.800]   I was a while ago. It was like a year ago or something. So it's like they've they've known about this for a long time
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:06.080]   The data leak, uh, the data breach like you said affected
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:10.640]   You know hundreds of million five hundred million people. It's the largest data breach of all
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:12.880]   That's bigger than my years ago
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:18.560]   A billion users including you and me and everybody listens. It's like if you use yahoo
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:23.200]   What reason do you have to stay using yahoo right now? I mean they've done
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:28.640]   Everything they can to show us with with these moves that they don't care
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:36.400]   About our privacy about our security. Uh, it's just it just feels like a huge slap in the face massive disrespect
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:43.920]   stamos joined facebook as their chief security officer june 2015. Yeah. Yeah more than a year before
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:50.800]   Even yahoo was supposed to know you got to wonder what was going on and I know there's I know there's you know certain things in
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:55.200]   In contracts for guys like this so that he can't you know blab about it or whatever
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:24:00.880]   But the fact that that happened so long ago and we're just finding out about it now and that marissa mayor knew about it
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:04.960]   And she tried to keep it secret for the and listen. She's got to protect her shareholders. I get it
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:08.000]   No, but god damn it. She's got to protect her users
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.800]   Because if you don't protect us
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:14.400]   That's going out the window and those shares aren't going to be worth a goddamn thing
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:20.960]   You know it's difficult to leave yahoo. They'd for a while that disabled female forwarding. They put that back saying that was that too
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:25.280]   That was good. I wasn't a mistake that too pisses me off. You know, I mean
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:29.680]   The only thought
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:34.240]   The only thing I use yahoo for right now is fantasy football as soon as the season's over i'm out
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:37.120]   Well, I see these flickers are the guy like flicker. We use
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:42.000]   I flickers great too. Listen, there's a lot of good stuff that yahoo does but all these things are so bad
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:49.680]   Yeah, and so terrible it feels to me like the the the plane was on fire and all they've been focused on is making sure they're parachute is packed
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:55.120]   Right and all that stuff and they just wanted to get out before all the stuff blew up and that is completely kicking the can down the road
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:57.280]   Yeah, because they'll be rising's problems soon. Right?
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:04.240]   I've had to say I've thought there was a problem with yahoo for several years because it was yahoo mail that was always hacked
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:11.760]   It was always yahoo mail that you got the email from your friend saying i'm in europe and i lost my wallet and send me a thousand dollars
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:14.160]   That was always yahoo mail
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:20.960]   And I just feel like it's been insecure at least for a long time and maybe that breach
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:27.040]   You know was already stuff was being filtered out out of that breach. I just it's uh turn on two factor
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:31.520]   Do not now here's the thing do not we had a piece yesterday and if you want to we we uh
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:35.680]   We showed you how to delete your yahoo mail yesterday. I knew we had a piece in that
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:37.440]   But I don't recommend it
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:42.400]   a because you got your football and you got your uh flicker and you got your tumbler
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:46.640]   But b because you may you don't remember you've been using the yahoo email address
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:52.560]   As a way to maybe get second factor authentication or a preset. Yeah, yeah on other accounts and
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:58.000]   If you do release your account, they will reuse that email address. They've already started. They've done that before
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:01.600]   So you what you really would behoove you to do is kind of sanitize it
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:06.160]   It's changed the password turn on two factor and then every month send one email. Yeah
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:09.920]   You know we like
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:11.920]   Imagine we're asking people to
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:18.960]   Empty empty their yahoo accounts of any sensitive data and then just leave it there like to check on a once a month
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:24.880]   So that the company doesn't screw them over worse. Yeah, I mean jesus and there's a will understood within geek circles problem
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:27.840]   Right. Okay. We have a we have an update la dodgers
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:30.880]   No, no, he said don't pound. I was pounding the table john
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:34.480]   Table because of yeah
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:38.160]   As long as you're here, could you check the dodgers score? Marissa myers fault
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:46.240]   Now speaking of dodgers, they're not gonna do their earnings call this week. Uh, yeah, yeah, yahoo canceled their earnings call
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:50.000]   No
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.440]   Speaking of dodgers
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:27:00.000]   Can they do that speaking of people who dodge things? They still have to announce earnings so shady so shady
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.120]   They're not gonna do it all they can cancel a call. They have to release earnings
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:08.320]   They just don't want to answer questions incredibly shady look if Donald trump and hillary clinton can have a debate on wednesday
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:12.960]   Yahoo can have their earnings call they're not gonna have a debate. I don't think you don't think something they'll cancel that too
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:19.440]   I know no no. There's no mr. Mr. Trump is not a quitter. There's no benefit to either of them
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:25.920]   They're gonna do it. They have to it's it's this is this is our version of the coliseum
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:28.800]   Yeah, christians and the lions so bad
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:35.200]   It's also bad don't don't buy Samsung phones. Don't use yahoo anything. Hey the debates. Oh god
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:37.440]   Okay, and then there was one more thing yahoo did
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:40.400]   Yeah, that also loses some faith
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:42.880]   uh now
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:47.520]   Yahoo has a checkered past with the federal government. This is this is never in worse yahoo turned over a couple of chinese
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:53.520]   Decidants right that was at almost 10 years ago. Yeah. Yeah, but this is that same issue you do business in china
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:58.320]   You have to hear the to the laws of China. All right. All right. Anyway, you could go back and forth on that one
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:04.960]   After that they did fight some national security letters, right? They went to court. They tried to protect user data. They lost
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:08.400]   Then they got another one apparently
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:13.920]   The us government secret order saying you need to search your email
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:19.600]   All the users email for some specific information a signature that we believe belongs
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:23.520]   To a malefactor roiters reported that last a couple of weeks ago
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:32.960]   Um, it was look the new york times reported the government was looking for a specific digital signature of a communications method used by a state sponsored foreign torrid terrorist organization
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:37.680]   Hey, they should find that yahoo initially said. Oh, it was easy. We just modified our spam filter
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:42.560]   That's already going through the mail and we just said hey look for this too while you're at it, but then apparently that's not the case
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:49.280]   Anonymous sources and again, you always have to consider the source anonymous sources told the new york times
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:52.000]   that uh
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.200]   Actually told motherboard. I apologize that it was not
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:29:00.640]   spam filtering or child pornography filtering, but the tool is more like a root kit
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:08.400]   And it was discovered by alex stamos's internal security testing team during one of their checkups
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:11.360]   They thought hackers had put a root kit on yahoo
[01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:16.880]   Until they got a memo from upstairs saying oh no no no it was us. That's okay
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:21.840]   If it was just a slight modification the spam and child pornography filters the security team
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:24.960]   Wouldn't have noticed and freaked out said an x yahoo
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:29.920]   Employee it definitely contained something that did not look like anything yahoo mail would have installed the back door
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:34.640]   Was installed in a way that endangered all of yahoo's
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:40.080]   User and supposedly without the the knowledge of the actual security team right?
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:48.080]   But this is what the nsa and the and the police organizations around the country want they want their own private back door
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:49.680]   They believe
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:52.880]   Delusionally that nobody else can access it. Nobody else would get at it
[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:58.880]   We just want our ability to just have free reign inside of every place where everybody's having conversations
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:01.120]   That's what we want and we're doing it for the children
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:04.800]   And by the way since it was in fact stamos
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:07.680]   Who discovered it was installed on purpose
[01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:15.920]   We know this happened prior to 20 june 2015. It was year more than a year ago. Yeah. Yeah, it was so bad
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:23.600]   That after this happened google microsoft twitter facebook basically all his major companies came out and said we're not doing this same sort of thing
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:27.040]   Right and don't worry. We're not doing that and you know and
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:30.880]   Whether or not you want to believe him is one thing
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:34.800]   But the fact that that all these companies have to come out and acknowledge that
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:38.720]   I think says something about the weight and the seriousness of of of this
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:42.320]   It's it's this is even worse to me than the than the hacking thing
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:49.200]   This is just one more reason to if you have a yahoo account to question what the hell are you still using it for and do you really want?
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:51.360]   Yeah, sad because
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:56.560]   When jerry and david created yahoo it was the first internet search tool
[01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:00.560]   Uh, it was a they were internet pioneers and I remember using yahoo
[01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:04.000]   I remember just going visiting yahoo and seeing the servers. They were still on premises
[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:07.200]   Yeah, and they said yeah, it's over there. That's the yeah, there's the yeah
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:14.640]   Wow, that's exodus. It was at the exodus facility. Yeah, it was like there's yahoo. Wow. There's yahoo on those boxes right there
[01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:20.800]   Not the same yahoo anymore. Nope. They should just sell it off for parts and close the doors. It's
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:24.640]   Well, this is this is the big thing. I mean because yahoo
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:28.560]   the reality is is that initial yahoo was was
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:33.840]   yahoo was doomed in their competition against google from the beginning because they were a
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:39.120]   They were a media company really from the beginning. They were creating a list of links that are on the internet
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:46.880]   It's never a search engine. Right. Exactly. Google was google was using the links the very structure of the internet to to create its index
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:48.880]   Which meant as the web got bigger
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:53.600]   yahoo increasingly didn't work and as the web but as the web got bigger google got better
[01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:58.160]   And that was that was something that they really in the long run with my compete against the one thing they have
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:03.840]   Is this massive user base like to to our points about advertising and stuff. It's hard to change
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:08.080]   Consumer behavior, but no, I agree for both of these things
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:13.920]   The I mean, I mean at a minimum I object to the fact that they had to install anything
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:18.640]   Like this but at a minimum they'll least do it in the most possible secure way
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:20.640]   And the least damage. Yeah
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:25.200]   Constrained way. Yeah, frankly. No, I agree with you. I mean frankly there is
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:29.840]   I hope the message gets out to the general population that
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:32.480]   You should not be using a who period
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:33.600]   It's like yeah
[01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:41.200]   And if if that ruins their value to to Verizon good like they they deserve it and frankly we need some examples of companies
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:44.160]   just utterly selling people down the river like this and
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:51.120]   I think the the upcoming shareholder lawsuits on certain things are gonna be very fascinating and deserved and to a certain extent yahoo's
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:54.160]   entire business is stupid because
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:59.280]   There's not only that but your business is stupid exactly
[01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:03.120]   There's no unifying glue for yahoo. They've acquired a thousand
[01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:08.880]   Companies and they slap their logo on us and then they you find out about these great things when they close them
[01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:11.440]   Yeah, I just closed you know, I love it a lot
[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:17.840]   Like really I could have I would have loved that. Yeah, and so there's just really no connection between tumblr
[01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:22.480]   And the fantasy football thing and the weather and why are these things?
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:24.800]   This is going to be we're going to look back
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:32.320]   at 2016 maybe 2017 say it was the year yahoo and twitter died and we'll talk about that in a second but first
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:36.560]   I'm hoping
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:38.400]   first ladies and gentlemen
[01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:43.680]   We had a great weekend if you missed any of it. We have created a small movie for you to enjoy watch
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:49.680]   Previously on to it at this point most people are going i'm done
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:53.040]   I don't need that yet in my account anymore. I don't trust these guys
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:58.560]   We thought we'd get you on because you're the only person in the world who seems to know how to delete a yahoo account
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:04.880]   There is a page uh surprise, but I could not find it by searching through yahoo
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:13.520]   All about android so this is a fair mitral now picked up in shina by me about company called vinci as you can see vinci
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:19.200]   Whatever it's android it has sensors so it can detect like with us on your head and pause when you're removing and stuff
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:25.360]   It streams music from spotify and from a amazon music a bunch of other music services and it has voice control
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:30.880]   But I think it's kind of cool like that we see android in devices that are wearable, but are not smart. Why?
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:37.440]   Triangulation ben wisener is our guest. He's director of aclu speech privacy and technology
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:41.440]   His claim to fame principal advisor to s Edward snoden
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:44.800]   Do you think the intelligence community is waiting for another san brianino to?
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:49.920]   Once again launch that effort or have they understood the need for strong encryption?
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:53.200]   I think the intelligence community is really divided on that question
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:59.600]   And this is what's so fascinating about it is that you see people in the military and the nsa who realize that actually we have more to lose
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:05.920]   Than more to gain in a world where encryption is easily breakable. I want for us. That's twit for justice
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:12.000]   If you miss that interview with ben wisener on monday that watch that download that I was just
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:14.240]   fantastic
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:19.280]   snoden's legal counsel and the head of the aclu speech privacy
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:22.320]   and security
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:24.800]   Something some project
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:30.080]   What's ahead? Well, I can tell you actually I probably shouldn't tell you because we have a whole team of people working on that
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:32.640]   Let's just ask jason how Jason
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:37.760]   Hey, thanks. Leo. Here's a look at just a few of the stories that we're going to be watching in the week ahead on monday
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:45.360]   october 17th tesla is expected to announce a new product ceo ela musk took to twitter last week to tease the announcement saying the product
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:51.600]   Will be unexpected by most people tesla normally rolls out the red carpet for major product reveals
[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:56.320]   So this will most likely be something a little less than say an actual vehicle in housemen
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:36:03.600]   The rumored solar roof perhaps an updated autopilot will find out more tomorrow on thursday october 20th
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:09.520]   Google will begin to ship its new pixel devices to those who ordered them after the product announcement earlier this month
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:16.400]   This signals the beginning of google's efforts to go toe-to-toe with competing premium smartphone offerings with the devices conceptualized
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:23.760]   From the ground up by the company also on the 20th amazon smaller second generation echo dot begins shipping to consumers for
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:31.280]   4999 the dot has much of the functionality of the full size echo and don't forget that you can buy a six pack for the price of
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:37.280]   Five that should give you plenty of stock and stuff for awesomeness for the holidays mega moroni and I cover all of this and a whole
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:43.920]   Lot more all week on tech news today each and every weekday at four p.m. Pacific. That's a look at the week ahead back to you leo
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:47.680]   Thank you, Jason how it is earnings week so we're gonna have earnings calls from apple until
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:50.800]   not yahoo
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:56.160]   Lot of lot of companies as well. So there's lots of news coming up this week. I wonder what elan is announcing
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:37:01.040]   Can't wait they found a way out of the simulation that's what okay, so
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:07.920]   So the rumor was that elan and some others are paying physicists to find a way to break through
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:14.640]   The simulation that elans convinced we are all in that we are in a video game. We're in the matrix basically
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:17.120]   Yeah, we're in the matrix and uh, that's all
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:19.840]   I love it, but you can't prove it one way or the other
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:24.000]   How does it change your life in any significant way and I don't know or can you?
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:28.880]   Well, but if you could pay physicists to break us out, maybe that's what he's gonna announce tomorrow
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:33.040]   That would be a big announcement. God. No one is more fun. He's just like let's go to mars
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:36.160]   Let's make rockets. Let's make large cars. Let's find out if we're in the major
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:40.320]   Like you know what i'm saying. This is i have a red pill and i have a blue pill
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:47.600]   And would you like to take one make sure though you choose wisely? I don't remember. I don't want to remember nothing nothing
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:54.080]   I like I like this simulation. I'm gonna stay here. You know the only thing that would be kind of a relief is that so
[01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:59.840]   When you die do you wake up and go well that was a great game you want to play again? That's right. What are you doing? I don't
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:07.760]   What are you I mean are we playing ourselves or is somebody playing us good question good question and does elon musk have the cheat codes
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:13.920]   Well, what he did say is because he believes this it gives him a remarkable amount of freedom, right?
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:18.080]   Because he can't you know well if it is a game just might as well play as hard as you can
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:22.240]   Yeah, yeah, not worry about what's gonna happen. That would be a nice perspective to have on the world
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:25.840]   I don't want to wake up and have to do a new map though. That's not gonna be fun
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:30.960]   Can I use the same map i'm i've gotten good at this one. I think they've got a better map now there
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:33.920]   Oh lord
[01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:37.760]   All right twitter oh women i'm gonna do an ad then i'll do twitter how about that?
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:42.400]   I was very skeptical. I have to say and i've tried you know kind of enterprise grade
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:44.960]   systems like ubiquity and
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:48.560]   You know the top of the line routers hundred dollar multi hundred dollar routers
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:54.560]   Uh and nobody had solved this big problem which was getting the very simple problem but fundamental problem of
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:57.360]   Distributing Wi-Fi over my entire home
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:03.440]   And i'd actually put in power line networking and repeaters and all sorts of stuff like wireless distribution system
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:07.760]   And then euro sent me uh this this is the euro uh system
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:12.480]   And it is solves really the single route router model is dead euro
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:15.840]   Is the new way and and you you start you could buy
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:20.640]   An individual euro in fact if you were in a studio apartment, this would be a great choice for your
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:24.880]   Your base unit like any router it has uh ethernet in
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:29.200]   ethernet out you could attach that and it works fine and i do this to a switch or a hub or a
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:31.200]   PlayStation or something yeah
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:36.400]   Uh yeah well actually what i do is i put it on a switch and then i can have everything be wired to the euro
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:40.960]   But then it also has the Wi-Fi you fire up the euro app on your iphone or your android device
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:43.280]   And you then add another euro
[01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:46.880]   And another euro and as many euros as you need each one
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:52.560]   Distributes it to a larger area and this is the first Wi-Fi system i found that actually
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:58.640]   Gets to every point in my house without a dead zone without complaints from lisa and that's a big one these
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:05.840]   Spousal the spousal approval factor very high. Yes. No more buffering. That's why they call it. Wifi
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:11.120]   You know it's funny. I was just showing a nathan the euro app on my uh on my uh my iphone
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:16.480]   And it said hey there's an update this one of the other things that euro does it's awesome you create an euro account and it updates
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:20.400]   Automatically hey there's an update we can wait till later tonight or would you want to do it now?
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:25.440]   I said well, nobody's home. So I just updated all my routers from here. That's cool. It's really cool
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:28.000]   You can see if you go to the uh your network settings
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:36.240]   You can it does constant uh bandwidth checks to so you know the status of your network shows you all the devices on the network currently and
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:42.800]   Previously by name you can reserve devices and then you're to some additional smart stuff for instance
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:48.800]   And I talked to the founder of euro about this it looks at the device it knows for instance that that's an apple tv
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:53.760]   And it says okay. Well, we're gonna give you qos on that device
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:41:01.120]   We're gonna improve the streaming on that device because you're not gonna really need it so much on your nexus six p
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:05.040]   It's amazing. That's good. It has great guests networks
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:11.840]   Uh, this thing really works. Yeah, you don't have and the thing is it's simple. It's easy. You can give this to
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:14.320]   uh an unsophisticated
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:16.960]   member of your family or friend and
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:23.440]   Suddenly they're gonna have Wi-Fi that works, but leo what about all the exercise I get holding the laptop in the corner of the room or the
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:26.160]   Wi-Fi I can't help you with that mic. I'm sorry
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:30.960]   Uh, by the way wpa to encryption of course nothing less. They wouldn't dream of it
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:36.400]   It's customer support night and I tested them out on this I called them and I said I am trying to set up a
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:38.320]   I have a server
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:41.120]   I'm trying to set up on my euro and I can't I need to
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:45.760]   Port forward and you know I gave them a typical kind of geeky question. They were great
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:47.120]   They walked me right through it
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:53.440]   They said that we helped did that work and he sat with me uh, maybe an hour on the phone and reboot it through reboots and everything
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:57.920]   Uh, it is an enterprise grade Wi-Fi system that really works
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:03.520]   We're partnering with euro to offer you free overnight shipping if you go to euro.com and use the offer code
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:06.080]   Twitch so what you do is you go to eer o
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:07.920]   dot com
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:09.760]   buy your euro system
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:15.920]   Uh, and then at checkout just check the boxes overnight shipping and enter the code twit and then I'll boom that'll be zero
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:18.880]   Eer o dot com offer code
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:20.880]   Twit if you have been suffering
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:23.280]   And I know so many people are
[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:28.720]   With dead spots with Wi-Fi that just doesn't work that speeds that fluctuate up and down
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:32.240]   This is such a great solution eer o
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:33.200]   euro
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:35.200]   Dot com and don't forget the offer code
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:38.160]   Uh, twit for free overnight shipping put down there
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:40.960]   I love that euro thing love it
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:47.360]   Uh, I don't know if I look I have I should I should always recuse myself from any conversation about twitter
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:51.600]   I was an early adopter got on at first december 2006
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:54.560]   Even in the first six months I quit
[01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:59.840]   At the first I quit because of the confusion between twit and twitter
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:04.640]   And I remember interviewing have williams and I said ev why did you name it twitter?
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:08.720]   You knew we because he'd been on our shows. He said I didn't think either of us was going anywhere
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:13.840]   I thought I thought both of these small companies would be no conflict double bird
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:15.920]   Well, he went somewhere twitter went somewhere
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:21.360]   Um, but I always had these mixed feelings and then of course with the with the free speech issues the trolling issues
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:24.720]   Um, at the same time you can't I can't quit you right?
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:28.000]   Uh, if some if I hear a rumor that celebrity has passed away
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:32.400]   I don't turn on cnn you go to twitter right you don't go to facebook you go to twitter
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:35.280]   Um, it's still my favorite social network to use
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:40.960]   You know, I'm not crazy about 140 characters makes people talk like they're having a stroke
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:46.480]   This is true, uh, I don't I think that that's a problem now there. I know they've done some things lately to change that
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:50.320]   I I also feel like it's disjointed so you'll be following
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:53.520]   You know, everybody's talking about the debate and then somebody says something about his sandwich
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:55.680]   It's like what it's like
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:57.680]   Maybe i'm too old. It's yeah
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:00.400]   Hashtags never have been the solution to its
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:02.240]   Fragment stations that they should have been
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:08.240]   Um, and then also and this is the thing that's growing gnawing away at me. I I blame twitter a little bit
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:12.720]   For what's going on in our country right now because I
[01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:15.920]   Oh, this sounds terrible
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:18.880]   But I think we have a little too much democracy
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:24.480]   I was a big believer at the beginning of the internet. This is going to be great. Everybody's going to get a voice
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:30.240]   and the bad voices like shine the light of day on it and that will
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:33.040]   You know disinfect
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:35.760]   And ultimately what we're going to do is get rid of these
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:43.440]   Elites who control the media and everybody's going to have a voice and I was a real utopian and now I feel like it's a little dystopian
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:49.040]   Well, you know, you've got some great conversations on multiple twitch shows on this topic
[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:53.120]   I know I bang this gun. No, no, but it's important and this is the moment to talk about it
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:56.640]   I think that to me personally, I think that the solution is somewhat obvious
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:45:01.440]   So people talk about real names versus anonymity. I think you need pseudodimony
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:05.360]   I think you basically have to have a real name facing twitter behind the scenes
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:10.320]   And then you can call yourself anything you want but the point is you can't create a new account every 30 seconds
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:15.520]   Yeah, and I've had so many arguments in the last three months political arguments with
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:19.680]   People with zero followers or five followers and an egg avatar
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:21.680]   You shouldn't be talking to them. Why are you talking about that?
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:24.880]   And so it's the people just creating this funny account
[01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:29.600]   What I would say the biggest problem with twitter is is that everybody is equal on twitter and every account have or dumb
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:34.240]   However, few followers has equal voice with every other account and so
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:37.040]   brands especially
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:43.840]   Fall for this and they see stuff on twitter and they take it seriously. It's as if oh my god, you know
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:49.120]   Jane Paulie just said something bad about me. That's a bad choice of person
[01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:52.080]   You know what i'm saying that everybody's equal on twitter
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:56.960]   So it's a little too much democracy anyway, none of this matters. Let's let's stipulate
[01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:00.880]   No, it does matter. Well, I want to stipulate you could fix this
[01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:03.600]   Now go ahead
[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:08.640]   Well, first off I will push back against any argument that that says
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:11.840]   everyone is equal is a problem because
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:17.920]   Frankly the fact that internet makes everyone equal is the entire reason why i've been able to build the career
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:25.280]   I've been able to and I get a little and I get a little I get a little irk like that that Norwegian editor writing about facebook
[01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:31.920]   demanding special privileges because he's an editor on facebook like that to me that's very problematic and
[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:40.000]   A return to a world where yes, there was it was simpler and there was more defined what we saw
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:44.960]   There's lots of stuff. We didn't see we didn't see police violence. We didn't see
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:49.280]   Uh, you know this sort of wouldn't we have seen all that without just like that
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:57.600]   The Arab spring would have happened without twitter you cannot say it's true. I'm just saying i'm just saying like it's really easy
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:47:05.680]   It's always easier to see the problems that have arisen for something than it is to see the benefits particularly
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:13.520]   When and in general it's easy to look back at the good old days when you benefited from the good old days and
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:19.360]   To not see the millions of people that did not benefit from the good old days. I think there's no twitter
[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:24.560]   There's no donald trump but okay, but here's the problem. It's not that everybody is equal is that everybody is not equal
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:26.960]   So you leo le port
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:32.240]   Everybody knows where you work what you do what your thoughts are what your laptop is what you're this who your family
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:37.840]   All that said they know all about and then some anonymous creep will come along and get into this
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:43.840]   War with you and you two are not equal. They have a huge advantage. They might have 20 fake accounts
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:48.640]   So it's 20 against one. I should apologize because you know what we've had this conversation so many times
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:53.520]   There's no point in belaboring this. I will stipulate twitter's fixable. The issue today is
[01:47:53.520 --> 01:48:00.480]   Will anybody buy twitter and if nobody buys twitter what will happen to twitter twitter announced it was for sale
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:05.520]   It had some suitors all of whom every one of whom has said never mind
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:10.560]   For reasons. I think this conversation illustrates. Yeah, so now what
[01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:18.000]   Well, it's it's there's no place for real-time ish conversations to happen online like twitter
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:24.960]   There's just there's nothing else like it right and so uh, you know trolling issues aside which are persistent and but also
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:29.680]   Let's say it's fixable. Why would sales force apple google and disney altar and but turn their back on
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:34.240]   Well, I mean if it's fixable then why hasn't twitter figured out in the first place, right?
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:37.440]   Because it's functional management and always has been
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:39.520]   Well, there's luck on that. I mean to
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:41.440]   To mike's point the mike
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:44.960]   I like the point is exactly right the fastest easiest way to fix this is to
[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:47.760]   Figure out a way that one person can only create one account
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:51.200]   Obviously there will always be holes in that but twitter doesn't do anything to restrict that
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:53.520]   And why don't they do anything to restrict that?
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:49:00.320]   Well, there could be stupid or it could be that the single most important number driving their stock is the number of monthly active users
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:07.520]   Well, and also twitter was founded as the free speech wing of the free speech party quote-unquote. Yeah, so there's a historical
[01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:10.160]   Thing in twitter that we are not
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:16.880]   And by the way look at 4chan and look at reddit as two other companies with the same attitude. Yeah who are suffering as well
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:23.600]   Yeah, but you know, I think for for for for you know google for apple for disney for sales force
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:28.320]   I think the question is okay. What is twitter and how does it fit into our business and twitter?
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:31.120]   interestingly enough like yaw who has never been able to
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:37.680]   Really articulate what it's about and and and some of the frustration that comes with it
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:42.800]   I think is a reflection of us as people who use it is we all use it for different ways, right?
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:50.160]   Trump uses it for his thing other people use it to find music other people use it to help organize like the black lives matter movement other people use it to
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:52.720]   Talk about sports and fashion or whatever
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:57.520]   So there's all these different things that people are using it for but there's no clear, you know
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:02.960]   Like like what is it is it is where you go for news? Is it where you go to talk to your friends?
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:04.960]   Is it where you go to like what is it?
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:09.120]   Ask what the phone system does or you know, I mean what what is the internet in general?
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:12.240]   It could be all of the above I don't have a problem with it being many things
[01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:16.640]   But I think it's hard for these other companies to figure out how it fits in and what to do with it
[01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:18.640]   Well, who is somebody gonna buy it?
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:20.640]   Right. Well, first of all before we get to who might buy it
[01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:25.200]   Let's talk about who's not buying it and why I think each of these companies has a completely different reason
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:30.000]   I mean for example, some have talked about Bloomberg buying it. This is a private company
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.720]   They could probably use the data they say. I'm not sure
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:35.760]   Well, I think any company is looking at it is looking at the data more than anything else
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:39.760]   But that's a completely whack business for them and it's really expensive for Bloomberg
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:42.960]   So you look at Google Google doesn't really need the data
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:44.240]   Don't they though?
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:47.920]   I don't think they do they have such such superior data the problem with twitter is
[01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:51.600]   This thing that Twitter already gives them a number of people who are identifiable
[01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:55.040]   But the number of people are identifiable that where okay, this is Leo report
[01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:58.880]   There's the same little port that has this youtube account that that's the same person
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:05.360]   It's a tiny number of people on twitter. There's so much anonymity. Twitter has 300 million monthly active users of which
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:14.000]   No more than half probably significantly less than half are not spammers. Right. So let's say a hundred million active real active users
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:18.880]   That's a small number compared to a billion and a half Facebook. Mr. Stazmore right now
[01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:23.280]   I think we ran a story on Instagram has three times that number exactly
[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:26.560]   It's a completely out of left field business for salesforce
[01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:32.000]   Disney doesn't want to be associated with all the vitriol and profanity and pornography and all that stuff apple doesn't
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.160]   Really want to be in the social networking business
[01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:39.040]   And so each of these companies that has the money has a different reason for not wanting it
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:46.400]   So I really buy into the the inevitability that some financial no-name financial company nobody's heard of it's going to buy it strip it for parts
[01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:51.520]   Turn it into nothing and it'll be the end of twig. I like this article from uh john hepton. He's a
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:55.920]   hedge fund guy at brontie capital. He says you're right
[01:51:55.920 --> 01:52:00.960]   It'll be an investment company, but the reason it'll be an investment company is because in order to make twitter work
[01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:05.920]   They have two billion dollars revenue. You've got to cut a significant amount of the cost
[01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:11.120]   Well, here's and it's going to be so brutal. They're gonna cut down. It's so ugly. Yeah that no
[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:15.040]   Company with a public face really wants to buy it. So it's going to be some
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:22.000]   Yeah, investment company like carl icon or somebody who doesn't care what you think he says literally a wall street bastard
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:25.440]   Yeah, and that person can do the job needed
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:31.040]   To turn twitter into something useful not to shut it down not even sell it off for parts
[01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:35.520]   But just to to clean it up and make it faster when you need one, you know, and does that make sense?
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:38.000]   It does. I mean a lot of folks
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.640]   Uh, you know that that I was talking to and and you know
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:45.200]   Talk to you on some of these sorts of things say that there's too many people over there who don't know
[01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:48.240]   What they're doing and the staff's too big and it's kind of a bloated company
[01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:50.720]   Everybody talks about how there's mismanagement
[01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:54.800]   But I think that the best example of that is that their costs have gone
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:59.920]   Way way way up and their losses have remained constant. So no matter how much
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:02.480]   And the revenue has gone way up too
[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:06.400]   Twitter is a company that you they could have continued to run
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:13.040]   On a shoestring budget and it would still be 95% as good as it is now, but they've had Facebook envy
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:16.320]   Everybody's telling them you got to be Facebook your public company. You got to go out for the money
[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:17.600]   You have to be like Facebook. Yep
[01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:20.000]   And so they've they've twisted it and changed it
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:26.720]   Ronti says if you can't have a 40% operating margin, then you're inadequately brutal personally, I think 50% is possible
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:32.080]   What about you Ben? You agree? What do you think you see you follow this stuff very closely and you're good in the financial markets
[01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:34.080]   You think that's what makes sense?
[01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:35.600]   I do
[01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:38.960]   The the the problem for twitter is it it goes back to
[01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:43.200]   Horrible management in that the horrible management is impactful in two ways
[01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:49.920]   so first off the products stagnated and did not improve any meaningful way for like four years and
[01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:54.320]   The the problem is the initial twitter concept was so good
[01:53:54.320 --> 01:54:01.120]   It got a huge number of users and they never had to go through the trouble of figuring out what make twitter compelling and selling that to other people
[01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:03.280]   and so right now it's this sort of like
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:09.600]   Unfinished rough product that does a ton of different things and it's not focused on on really an event
[01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:18.080]   In doing them very well. The second problem with mismanagement though is by virtue of the mismanagement by not figuring out the product and not building a business
[01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:23.040]   They compensate it by raising an absolute epic ton of venture capital
[01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:24.960]   Twitter raised
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:27.680]   760 million dollars worth of venture capital which is
[01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:32.000]   Way more than Facebook raised for a much smaller
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:38.880]   Business that frankly doesn't do very much and the reason was they were too busy fighting with each other to actually build a business
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:41.200]   and so the problem is
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:44.160]   Venture capital is makes a ton of sense forceless network
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:47.200]   It's really the only way to build this this sort of product or media category
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:48.160]   We want to call twitter
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:53.120]   It's only reason to call to build this sort of company because you need all the costs are up front
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:59.040]   And you want to generate a scale engine on both sides on user side with the user-generant content and on the advertising side
[01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:03.760]   Where you want to build sort of a self-serving sort of business that scales along with the users
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:09.840]   The problem is that the user growth capped out and they never got the scale advertising business model off the ground
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:12.960]   I know the vast majority of their advertising is selling is selling it directly
[01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:18.160]   So you have this company that the way I analogize it another podcast was it's like your kids
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:23.840]   They get a little chubby before they grow tall twitter got really really really chubby and they never grew tall
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:26.960]   And so they have this massive cost structure
[01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:29.440]   That is huge bloated company
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:34.240]   Where they could be a very nice five billion dollar company with their current revenue model
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:37.680]   Maybe even higher, but I completely agree with john hems
[01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:42.160]   And I think it was a various dude article. It was very well put that the right now
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:47.040]   The company like we still talk about twitter in this ridiculous way. Oh twitter is so much potential
[01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:50.160]   Oh, imagine what they could do with this. It's a they're 10 years old
[01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:54.240]   Like the time to talk about them and their potential is past
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:56:00.960]   They are what they are and I increasingly agree that the appropriate route is to embrace that
[01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:06.160]   Are they going to lose all their engineers? You know lose all their talent? Yes, they are but unfortunately they have their chance
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:08.480]   it's past and
[01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:11.840]   And hopefully they can build something about what's there and to your point
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:17.760]   I think to have this point is well made they will be a much more attractive acquisition target once that process is over
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:22.080]   Yes, they might die the surgery might kill the patient, but at this point
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:26.720]   To buy twitter now is it would be full-hard. Why would you want this company?
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:30.400]   The only one that makes a possible passive of sense is google
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:35.040]   Just because they don't have any sort of feed product on mobile for all the business model reasons i'm talking before
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:37.360]   But the fact is google
[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:43.280]   twitter inventories on double quick and they get the firehose of data because twitter made this deal this desperate deal
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:48.480]   That google would save them and now google has everything they need from twitter without having to have paid a dime for it
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:56.880]   So yeah, i'm i'm a pessimist as well. I also I also hate the fact that every silicon valley company has to make a trillion dollars of
[01:56:56.880 --> 01:57:03.040]   Profit a year. Otherwise, they're nothing. Why can't twitter just have a hundred thousand active users
[01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:12.000]   Grow slow be this incredibly valuable thing make a plus model. Yes. Well, I don't know that google plus is actually profitable for people
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:16.480]   But that's the problem with the all the venture capital that they raised and that's what goes back to management
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:20.800]   They they put themselves in weight. They can't tread water at this point
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:26.160]   Right. Well, the only way out of their predicament was to grow hugely and now they're paying out all these stock options
[01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:28.560]   This is a ridiculous number of stock options to keep talent there
[01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:36.240]   And it's only deepening the hole that they're in the only way out for twitter as it's constructed is to dramatically increase their user base
[01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:38.400]   And that's not happening. We've seen
[01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:45.360]   I wrote this on their ipo in 2013 that the company was in big trouble because their user base because they had this user
[01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:52.240]   This user growing problem and especially as advertising gets more and more concentrated and they never built a scalable advertising model like
[01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:56.000]   I mean, this has been apparent for years that this was a problem
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:02.400]   I think what's increasingly apparent now is just how toxic and asset this would be and why no one would want to buy them and
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:05.920]   The they're stuck in this paradox right now the the
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:11.440]   Value of twitter is almost assuredly much less than its current market cap
[01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:15.760]   The problem is its current market cap is inflated because people hope someone will buy them
[01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:18.000]   But they won't be bought until the price goes down
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:23.440]   So they're stuck in this paradox where they will only be bought once everyone gives up on the prospects of them being bought
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:28.160]   The problem is that might only happen when they die and that would be unfortunate. Well, I think we're getting close to that
[01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:34.000]   Stock price has been dumb. We're really going to be missing something though. I agree. No, I agree. It's a loss
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.240]   If it goes away, I hope it doesn't go away
[01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:41.520]   Yeah, I hope it doesn't and there's there is this is why it's so frustrating because there's so much value
[01:58:41.520 --> 01:58:46.640]   There it's an incredibly value piece of interest that's really not duplicated anywhere in there
[01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:51.040]   It's highly differentiator and and so I do hope it goes through this process
[01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:55.840]   Just because if it could come out either a much leaner company like like to my as Mike said
[01:58:55.840 --> 01:59:02.640]   They're generating 2.2 billion dollars in revenue and they have an up their gross profit is 1.5 billion like they have a
[01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:10.160]   Workable model here. The problem is their gna and their in their compensation prices are so out of whack
[01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:17.200]   With the reality of the business can they get out of those or they are they committed at this point? I mean, aren't they contractually like student loans?
[01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:20.080]   Yeah, well, I mean that that's that's the
[01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:27.520]   That's that's the big question around you know acquisition and lots of people being laid off and things things of that nature
[01:59:27.520 --> 01:59:29.200]   I mean that's that's why
[01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:34.080]   I think there's increasing sort of sense that that's the only way out for them because they have to get out of this
[01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:39.840]   You sound sad. Yeah
[01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:43.120]   You know, here's why it's sad. Here's exactly why it's sad
[01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:48.960]   We all want to embrace and and invest our time in a social network that we love where we develop
[01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:51.840]   connections and friends and and so on and
[01:59:51.840 --> 01:59:57.840]   These keep getting ripped out from under us as people scatter off to these little social networks and now where do you go?
[01:59:57.840 --> 02:00:03.280]   I think I wonder if there isn't a backlash against social in general that we're yeah, I think there might be yeah
[02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:07.520]   Maybe social isn't really I think maybe like a public public facing social thing
[02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:11.200]   I think you know a lot of the trend I think we're seeing is more private stuff like this
[02:00:11.200 --> 02:00:13.440]   That's just go to a bar and have a drink
[02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:16.960]   Forget this internet. It doesn't scale. No, Leo
[02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:24.400]   Scales plenty you don't need more than 10 friends. Do you? Well, then you have a chain of bars or whatever, right?
[02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:27.280]   Well again again
[02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:31.200]   The evidence of the way people actually spend their time is not that social is calling anywhere
[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:35.280]   It's that it's it's it's deepening and I certainly share
[02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:41.760]   concerns about the societal impact frankly, I think Facebook is the biggest issue not Twitter and the way that
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:47.120]   It's customized to you just because we're addicted to it doesn't mean it's good for us. Amen to that. Well
[02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:56.160]   Well, but just because it's a dramatic shift in the way the world works is also not mean. It's a bad thing again. I think it's really easy to
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:02.000]   Particularly for people in media and in journalism who've had their business models decimated by the internet
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:05.440]   It's really easy to pin the blame on whoever is winning now
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:11.360]   And the fact the matter is the world is significantly different a major theme for me writing in general is that you know
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:13.680]   the internet is
[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:17.520]   Although level of the industrial revolution where everything about society is going to change though
[02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:20.640]   Our political institutions are going to need to change the way our media isn't going to change
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:24.320]   every the way people work is going to change all these things are going to change and
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:31.440]   That's a lot one. It's going to be really hard. It's going to be really painful and then do because this is very different from tech
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:34.240]   This is very different from the first tech 1.0
[02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:38.400]   Which was you know like ERP solutions and all that stuff which made business way more efficient
[02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:42.720]   But didn't change the way business worked the way business works is fundamentally changing
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:47.120]   And that's by definition going to entail a lot of pain and a lot of upheaval
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:52.560]   But I don't want to go back to the middle ages before the initial revolution, but I
[02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:55.920]   It's hard like and
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:01:58.560]   My concern is not that we
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:05.520]   We stuff a genie back in the box or that we close my door to box or however many metaphors I can mix in one sentence
[02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:08.320]   the question is
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:13.440]   What's our level of awareness of the reality of this change and how quickly can we
[02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:16.880]   Get our society and our institutions
[02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:21.040]   in a in a way to handle this change and
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:28.400]   It's not going to stop like it's just it is what it is and I think once we accept that and configure our way forward
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:31.840]   We'll be in a healthier place. I'll be it's still a very challenging one
[02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:36.400]   Well, it's just in on twitter elon musk tweets moving the tesla announcement to wednesday
[02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:38.960]   Needs a few more days of refinement
[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:47.440]   By the way, you might note that elon has 5.6 million followers and files 39 people and where's he gonna make that announcement once twitter dies
[02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:52.160]   Right. That's a very good point. That's the beauty of twitter
[02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:58.720]   It's a place where people are not cast and where anybody can potentially so so if somebody with with 10 followers
[02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:02.960]   tweet something massive it snowballs and just retweeted becomes this
[02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:07.280]   And that's and it's a place where you can go reliably to get the big news
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:10.240]   And the and the real-time news
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:13.520]   On the moments tab no
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:18.800]   Twitter's own big news tab done work. No, I don't I don't think I don't think twitter is ultimately
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:23.280]   Gonna die I think something's gonna happen. You know, it's it's probably gonna be like what we're talking about where some
[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:25.840]   You know, maybe possibly terrible
[02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:29.680]   You know activist investor group takes it over strips it away
[02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:34.880]   But I what's terrible about an activist group that actually builds a bible business out of twitter
[02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:38.800]   I mean if they could it could be great. There are just lots of terrible ones that don't right
[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:43.840]   That's true of them a lot of companies deserve to die and that's also true. That's also
[02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:46.400]   And as somebody pointed out in the chat room
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:49.200]   We don't we don't lament netscape navigator
[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:53.040]   Anymore either. Yeah, this is the nature of self
[02:03:53.040 --> 02:03:56.400]   This is the nature of
[02:03:56.400 --> 02:04:01.040]   Stuff moves on. Yeah stuff moves on. We're gonna move on. You know, but twitter
[02:04:01.040 --> 02:04:04.000]   I can't move on twitter. It's a
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:10.400]   Keep talking Ben. I swore no I swore off a write about twitter or forester chakra because I should too because notice how
[02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:14.880]   It's a but you can't you can't stay away. It can't stay away. I I think twitter
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:16.880]   I think I'm op I'm an optimist in this
[02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:23.200]   I think twitter is so unique and offers such unique value that I do think I just
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:27.200]   Decried this phrasing, but I do think there is a business here
[02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:31.200]   And I think it's sticky enough that it will survive the surgery
[02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:34.160]   But I think I do think the surgery needs to happen
[02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:38.800]   For all of us. It's difficult is to figure out who should do the surgery and what the surgery should be
[02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:41.840]   We don't even know why the patient is sick and don't use a chainsaw, please
[02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:45.360]   Well, maybe it's gonna take a chainsaw. I mean, I
[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:50.880]   I don't know and I think one of the reasons companies have walked away from twitter is they don't they're not really sure what
[02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:56.000]   Surgery needs to be done. We all see value. Right. We all see problems
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:03.200]   Um, and I don't know what the uh, the solution is crowd fund a takeover by the journalists of the world
[02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:08.320]   Yeah, that was the world you're not interesting and we see so many like a crappy market caps
[02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:15.520]   We've seen so many people try to duplicate twitter with no success. It's really it's a very it's a fascinating
[02:05:15.520 --> 02:05:17.680]   So a
[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:22.400]   Any product with user-jarian content or any sort of network effect has to be free like there is no other
[02:05:22.400 --> 02:05:26.880]   Right, however they make money. It has to be free for the user. It's not viable. Otherwise
[02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:34.000]   The single most important feature of any network is do I have friends or family using it or professional contacts or whatever it will
[02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:35.360]   Whatever it might be
[02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:41.840]   One of the disappointing things is I feel like they're actually onto something with live video with that kind of conversation happening underneath it
[02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:46.720]   I mean, you know, hey, I know mark Zuckerberg says he wants facebook to be video centric and all that stuff
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:50.080]   But it is my facebook feed is live video all the time
[02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:56.800]   But the conversations that happen on facebook underneath your feed aren't close to what you get when you see it on twitter or you see it on periscope
[02:05:56.800 --> 02:06:02.320]   I mean they really do something different and it might be because facebook hides so much behind their login
[02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:06.080]   You know, they're their free paywall or whatever, you know, but
[02:06:06.080 --> 02:06:09.600]   You know, there is no wall like that for twitter
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:12.400]   You can you can see what's going on even if you don't take part
[02:06:12.400 --> 02:06:20.240]   And with the with with the way streaming is booming right now. There's something special that's happening here. I I hope that they figure it out before
[02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:26.160]   Will you watch election night? Will you watch the bloomberg feed on twitter? I will
[02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:31.600]   I think that's the place to be I do I think I will I know I'm doing it for sports now and I've been doing it for the elections
[02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:35.840]   I'm watching the Oscars a super bowl and all that kind of the debates always
[02:06:35.840 --> 02:06:40.800]   I always have twitter running with the tv on but you're saying like a maniac too
[02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:46.320]   But you're saying twitter strategy of putting live video on the feed means you can just watch
[02:06:46.320 --> 02:06:51.600]   Just sit on twitter. Yeah, and that and they have you know like that their apple tv app is you know pretty clever
[02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:57.040]   And I think you know, does anybody use that that seems really weird to me to watch the app have the apple tv app running
[02:06:57.760 --> 02:07:01.840]   Well, I like it the problem is the the currently if you watch video on the app
[02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:05.840]   It just shows random tweets. It doesn't show your right twitter stream
[02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:12.800]   Which I mean which I guess makes sense in that the goal is to reach people who don't have their own stream properly curated
[02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:16.080]   That could be awesome. Is it how is it curated? It's not well
[02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:22.800]   The promise was curation has always been has always been bad and it's all it's always been focused on brands and like
[02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:30.720]   Famous people which is you get boring brandy type tweets like whereas the real value of twitter is the little more
[02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:36.720]   How so is a spicier tweets that can accompany a sporting event or something like that and the jokes that that rise up
[02:07:36.720 --> 02:07:43.680]   Could could you make a bot that would curate twitter appropriately? Could you do sentiment analysis or some sort of
[02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:49.040]   Grading of tweets that could and how is twitter going to hire those people?
[02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:52.000]   Yeah, because they don't have stock that anybody wants
[02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:58.320]   Because they love twitter. That's why google should buy open source it. I mean people don't get paid to do open source projects
[02:07:58.320 --> 02:08:02.160]   Yeah, and there's some amazing stuff being right there. I don't know. It seems like there's a solution
[02:08:02.160 --> 02:08:04.000]   Somewhere
[02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:07.040]   All right, let's take a break. We'll come back lots more to talk about but only
[02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:10.160]   About a minute more in the show. We're really running out of time
[02:08:10.160 --> 02:08:15.520]   I I we got to make these shows with Ben and Mike and Nathan four hours long. Can we do that?
[02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:17.520]   Okay
[02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:22.560]   Mike Elgin is here. He's our digital nomad becoming nomad.com and elgin.com
[02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:26.320]   It's so nice to have you in studio great to be here. He has devoured. He's a glacier got here Leo
[02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:32.240]   It's a kind of you know, it's similar. Does it feel familiar a little bit? It's weird. It's different, but it's the same
[02:08:32.240 --> 02:08:35.360]   It's weird that way. Yeah, uh, Nathan Oliveris Giles
[02:08:35.360 --> 02:08:38.240]   From the wall street journal and a dodger lover
[02:08:38.240 --> 02:08:45.680]   Beautiful as long as they're in LA. They're my team's beautiful thing. I love you. I like your niners hat sir. Thank you for wearing that
[02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:48.320]   Why?
[02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:53.280]   Used to be a nine years mug somebody has peeled the nine years bad. You're off my mug some logic
[02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:56.560]   Some dodger fan was in here
[02:08:56.560 --> 02:09:00.560]   Check his fingernails
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:03.920]   No, you know what it is and I know because you admitted it's a Raiders fan
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:06.080]   That's who would do that
[02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:09.360]   They got no conscience no conscience also with us
[02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:13.280]   Always great to have him from streptecharie.com Ben Thompson
[02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:18.880]   And the sun is now out fully in Taipei and shining in his window. It's nice to have you boy
[02:09:18.880 --> 02:09:22.640]   You guys are always so good so salient so pithy
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:27.440]   So wise I appreciate that our show today brought to you by dinner my dinner
[02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:29.600]   blue apron
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:34.240]   Blue apron they said they'll their their missions make incredible home cooking accessible to everyone
[02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:37.440]   while supporting a more sustainable food system
[02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:43.360]   Setting the highest standards for ingredients and building a community of home chefs and they do such a good job
[02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:48.240]   Man, I love it when I get home in that blue apron boxes on the porch there and I know inside I've got
[02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:50.880]   three different meals
[02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:55.120]   With all the ingredients I need a step-by-step recipe card easy to follow
[02:09:55.120 --> 02:10:01.200]   Everything I need to make an amazing meal something I would never have dreamed of making before in 40 minutes or less
[02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:05.440]   And by the way, and I want to really nip this in the bud sometimes I think people look at this and say well
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:12.000]   That's got to cost you it's 60 percent more expensive to shop at a store than you use blue apron because there's no brick or mortar
[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:16.320]   There's no clerk. It's much easier for them to do this much you save money
[02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:20.400]   You're gonna spend under ten dollars per person for healthy home cooked meals
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:23.040]   with the best ingredients
[02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:25.040]   sustainably
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:30.720]   Seasourced seafood humanely raised beef chickens are free range the pork is arranged in that raised naturally
[02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:33.600]   regenerative farming practices
[02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:40.240]   And it's unusual ingredients stuff you may not have had before when you get salmon wild caught Alaskan salmon
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:44.240]   When you get tomatoes heirloom tomatoes blue apron brings you the best
[02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:50.320]   Research shows blue apron families cook together nearly three times as often they have two kinds of plans that plan for a couple
[02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:52.720]   Great for date night. Oh
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:59.120]   What a way to win somebody's heart but also family plans which have a little bit more kid-friendly ingredients
[02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:04.160]   Uh, and they're great. It's so much fun to cook with the kids and get them excited about cooking
[02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:10.160]   New recipes created every week by blue apron's culinary team and they will not repeat for a year
[02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:16.640]   So you're gonna have new stuff to try all the time like crispy chicken meal and a with warm brussel sprouts celery and potato salad
[02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:20.560]   I hate doing these ads at dinner time. I am dying here
[02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:26.480]   Thai green curry chicken and squash with uchoi don't know what that is, but I could tell you it's gonna be great
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:29.600]   I think it's a kind of bok choy jasmine rice and cashews
[02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:36.160]   Oh, oh, oh, oh roasted pork steamed buns with black garlic mayonnaise and spicy cabbage slaw
[02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:40.720]   Seared salmon and fall vegetable hash with apple brown butter dressing and by the way
[02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:43.760]   We don't talk about this. We should if you're a
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:47.440]   cooking for yourself if you're cooking a meal for one person
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:50.880]   Make that meal and now you've got dinner tomorrow
[02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:56.240]   And that's great. You're gonna love this it fills the house with beautiful aromas
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:12:01.760]   Oh your first feel three meals are free by the way with free shipping to most of the continental United States
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:04.640]   If you go to blue apron.com/twit blue apron
[02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:07.600]   Dot com slash
[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:13.120]   Twit visit the website see how it works and pick your first three meals you
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:16.080]   Will love it blue apron dot com slash twit
[02:12:16.080 --> 02:12:23.440]   Okay, we talked about twitter we talked about yahoo
[02:12:23.440 --> 02:12:28.640]   This is depressing. Let's talk what can we talk about facebook?
[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:32.560]   Talk about sam songs sam songs exploding phones
[02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:35.280]   What's the good news in tech?
[02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:40.240]   Google fact check I think this is google using its power for good not evil. Yes. Yes
[02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:46.480]   Very interesting one of the things twitter and others have done and the internet has done has made it possible to
[02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:52.160]   Spread this information as easily as quickly as information and when it's spread at a rapid pace
[02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:58.800]   It's almost so fast that you believe it. Mm-hmm. So what I think what google's doing in my opinion
[02:12:58.800 --> 02:13:01.280]   And I'd love to hear what you think you wrote the article on this Nathan
[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:04.400]   Yeah, they're gonna add a fact check label
[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:06.560]   to
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:12.320]   Search results. Yeah, basically in google news now for for for listening to news stories
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:18.880]   Oh, it's just a news just in news so far. You know, this is the sort of thing that could that could bleed over news makes better sense though
[02:13:18.880 --> 02:13:25.440]   Yeah, but basically there are there are more than 100 websites that they've identified that are dedicated to fact-checking
[02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:30.320]   Wow, there's political fact. I know political fact full fact. They have a lot of others. There's actually
[02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:32.400]   um
[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:39.680]   I guess you could include snopes in that list too. Oh, I would absolutely. Yeah, so there's there's just been more than rise the last few years of these
[02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:44.800]   Websites that are dedicated to this not to mention the source stuff that the Wall Street Journal does, you know, the washington post the New York Times
[02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:46.640]   Everybody's NPR does great
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:51.520]   Uh fact-checking during this is difficult though for news outlets to do especially where
[02:13:51.520 --> 02:13:58.480]   Candidates are saying well the media is manipulating this election. You can't believe what they say and I think people believe that they do
[02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:04.720]   So it's hard to find um objective information. Well, I've discovered in arguing with uh
[02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:08.720]   Politically-minded trolls on this one. This is Mike's article about the same
[02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:18.880]   And what I found is that the that that certain I'm not going to get political here to political but but certain political groups have pre-inoculated their idiotic users
[02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:23.920]   Uh followers whatever you want to call it against fact-checking itself, right?
[02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:30.160]   Yeah, trust the facts matters the fact-checking sites are just a smokescreen for the for the for the powers of the et cetera
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:35.200]   It's exactly and so that's that's a real problem, but I think that um
[02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:40.400]   My message to the world is no most of these fact-checking sites are very good
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:44.880]   That the politicians have learned to speak in a way that's fact-check proof
[02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:49.040]   So for example in my article I give a couple of examples
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:56.320]   But essentially speaking vaguely and categorically instead of specifically enables them to have nothing to fact-check
[02:14:56.320 --> 02:15:02.880]   It's like quicksand. Yeah, um, I would like to say one thing on this there the different fact-checking sites do different things
[02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:06.480]   So the political ones like political fact-check.org and so on
[02:15:06.480 --> 02:15:09.120]   Are great for politics?
[02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:13.520]   They there are ones for you know urban legends and so on and also politics like snopes
[02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:17.520]   Uh about dot com, uh, and so on hoax layers a good one
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:21.280]   Um, but there's one that's for tech mostly. Oh, it's very good
[02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:28.240]   It's called emergent if you can throw that on the screen. It's called emergent. Yeah, it's called emergent dot info is the merge
[02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:31.200]   That's right and they have this they have this you see if it's green
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:38.880]   It's true if it's red. It's not true and and if it's white, it's not clear if it's true or verified. Yeah, and oh, this is good
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:44.640]   I'm gonna add this to my isn't this great. So it's a real they call it a real-time rumor tracker, but again, it's very heavily
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:47.120]   uh, uh, uh,
[02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:51.520]   It's spun toward technology and it's just a fantastic resource
[02:15:51.520 --> 02:15:56.480]   Uh that where they just get to the bottom of it. They explain they they talk about the originating source
[02:15:56.480 --> 02:16:04.640]   Um, it's tagged so you can search by tags or keywords and so on and it's just a great way to separate the bs from the truth
[02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:09.920]   Yeah, it is you know google doing this and labeling, um
[02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:16.800]   The emergent dot info by the way, just get a little hard to find on google news is kind of a responsible thing to do
[02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:23.280]   I mean, you know, because like you said, there are those that are known for doing legit stuff and and and google is taking a non-partisan approach
[02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:29.120]   Um on this and that matters. It's basically just calling it out and saying hey, this is someone's verified
[02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:31.920]   Someone that's legit that has a history of of doing this right
[02:16:31.920 --> 02:16:35.360]   Um, and you know if if you don't believe
[02:16:35.360 --> 02:16:38.560]   uh, the media, uh, you know, uh,
[02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:42.880]   Then you probably don't believe google's a little tags either
[02:16:42.880 --> 02:16:46.240]   So this might not be for you and that's I think I guess okay
[02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:48.720]   But again, there are forces out there that want
[02:16:48.720 --> 02:16:52.400]   That they're in opposition to actual facts and of course
[02:16:52.400 --> 02:17:00.240]   Actual reality and they want to convince everybody that facts are there's no such things as facts and there's only opinion or bias or whatever
[02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:04.160]   And that's simply not true. They're in fact our facts. Yeah, the facts exist
[02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:12.000]   And and so you know we we need to and and here's my general tip, which I think uh really resonated with a lot of my readers
[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:19.120]   Instead of using fact checking sites as as places where you go and look up things that people are disagreeing with
[02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:22.160]   Use them like they're publications use them like their blogs
[02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:25.280]   Go to them preemptively and get the truth before you get the lies
[02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:31.920]   And and just browse them there they're actually the way that they tend to format content is actually a very readable
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:36.080]   way to get the news to get the information that's out there and
[02:17:36.080 --> 02:17:41.600]   You know follow their twitter accounts follow their social media accounts and they tend to tweet out
[02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:43.680]   Or send out
[02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:47.040]   What they've concluded. Yeah, and you can just see it go by and you're like, oh, okay
[02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:52.720]   So that's that's not true. And then when you actually see the falsehood later on you already know. Oh, that's not true
[02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:56.000]   Yeah, and so it's it's a really powerful thing
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:59.840]   The internet has made it super easy to spread falsehoods
[02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:05.760]   But they've also made it easy to identify what's true and what's false and we should all be active and
[02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:09.360]   Figuring that out this really to me isn't isn't a new problem
[02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:12.960]   I mean, this has been you know an issue as long as there's been in media
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:15.440]   As long as there's been politicians the speed of light now
[02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:20.160]   They move quicker now and they've proliferated in a way that's harder and harder to know what's right
[02:18:20.160 --> 02:18:25.120]   But I think ultimately um kind of on talking on some of the things that that Ben brought up with twitter is
[02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:29.280]   You know, there's there are more people engaging in these conversations than ever before
[02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:34.000]   The business models for for news outlets and and journalist organizations and things like that
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:38.880]   Uh have been hurt incredibly by the internet, but more people are reading the work than ever before that we do
[02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:44.880]   Yeah, and I think that's ultimately a good thing now. We do have some folks maybe who are in certain camps
[02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:50.000]   Uh, you know who who might want to believe their uh, their, you know
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:55.440]   Political heroes who say that all media is bad and there are no facts and there is no truth
[02:18:55.440 --> 02:19:01.600]   Um, but I think that most people um know that that's bs and I think that um
[02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:07.680]   Just as before um with before the internet, uh, if a responsible
[02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:11.040]   uh, consumer of news uh of
[02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:16.480]   A responsible person who just wants to learn about the world around them is going to look to more than one newspaper
[02:19:16.480 --> 02:19:22.800]   It's going to look to more than one news website is going to look to more than one fact-checking website is going to constantly be challenging
[02:19:22.800 --> 02:19:24.800]   What they know to be true?
[02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:30.320]   Uh, and to read more than one book and all that stuff. So it's the same sort of problem. It moves quicker
[02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:35.840]   I think sometimes it feels amplified and more emotional because we're we're just it's being thrown in our face every day
[02:19:35.840 --> 02:19:40.720]   When every time we got on facebook and twitter every time we turn on, uh, you know cable news
[02:19:40.720 --> 02:19:44.800]   Or look at the home page of of any news website. It it feels bad
[02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:48.000]   I think it feels a little heightened right now because it's an election year
[02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.560]   Um, but I think uh
[02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:55.440]   Uh, there's something good underneath all of this and the fact that we're all participating in these conversations
[02:19:55.440 --> 02:19:59.440]   And maybe a uh of larger and more public way than ever before
[02:19:59.440 --> 02:20:02.320]   And and I think uh more young people
[02:20:02.320 --> 02:20:04.000]   um
[02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:09.520]   And and and communities that maybe hadn't been included in some of these conversations before are getting included nowadays
[02:20:09.520 --> 02:20:14.160]   So, um, that's also something that is a threat to a lot of the the stakeholders
[02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:19.760]   And old power structures and all those things so ultimately I I think this is going to be good
[02:20:19.760 --> 02:20:22.160]   But i'm glad that google is making this move me too
[02:20:22.160 --> 02:20:27.360]   Uh, unfortunately we got to wrap it up, but i'm going to give you guys if anybody has a story that we didn't cover
[02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:31.200]   That you should add what add one please do. Um
[02:20:32.880 --> 02:20:35.040]   I thought nathan made a really important point that
[02:20:35.040 --> 02:20:39.040]   Whether all effect of this is going to be I I questioned it just
[02:20:39.040 --> 02:20:45.200]   How effective it will it will ultimately turn out people believe the facts they the effects they want to believe well one does
[02:20:45.200 --> 02:20:47.440]   It's more it's more. How is it get in front of them?
[02:20:47.440 --> 02:20:51.600]   You have to actually search for the the question in in
[02:20:51.600 --> 02:20:54.560]   Add issue and then there'll be a label in the search results
[02:20:54.560 --> 02:21:01.520]   And I guess the thing I would take here is I think google does deserve a lot of praise for here because the real company that needs to make
[02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:03.520]   Will pure is facebook amen and yeah
[02:21:03.520 --> 02:21:07.360]   Faceless almost doing the opposite with their trending stories. Yeah
[02:21:07.360 --> 02:21:10.240]   And this is not a fact
[02:21:10.240 --> 02:21:15.680]   And it's trending and facebook will tailor your newsfeed depending on what you're most likely to engage with which means if you
[02:21:15.680 --> 02:21:19.840]   Share and interact the more liberal stuff. They'll show you more of that and conservative vice versa
[02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:25.120]   You can counter that though. I made a point of following every presidential candidate including all the republican candidates on my facebook
[02:21:25.120 --> 02:21:29.760]   So I do see donald trump's tweet right there right but no one else does that really?
[02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:38.080]   I mean very few and I think I think your point about the trending stories and they their facebook's response to accusations of bias was to fire the entire team
[02:21:38.080 --> 02:21:41.920]   It's preposterous and it's it's frankly
[02:21:41.920 --> 02:21:50.720]   It's not taking seriously their role in society and there's no indications that they care or that they they understand that
[02:21:50.720 --> 02:21:59.200]   And so by all means let's praise google to the skies and by implication let's shame facebook because their facebook's
[02:22:00.160 --> 02:22:04.080]   Yes, I this whole thing that facebook's immediate company is dumb. They're not a media company
[02:22:04.080 --> 02:22:09.200]   They are like the reason why they're valuables. They are a platform and they live on user gerry content
[02:22:09.200 --> 02:22:16.640]   but at the at the same time their role and their impact on society cannot be denied and their
[02:22:16.640 --> 02:22:23.440]   refusal to take that seriously and to put their head in the sand and pretend that they will fix it with an algorithm
[02:22:23.440 --> 02:22:28.240]   Is in the long run? I think it's gonna be bad for facebook because there's gonna be a backlash eventually
[02:22:28.480 --> 02:22:33.200]   I've been denying your points the other about a backlash, but there will be one and the concern for facebook
[02:22:33.200 --> 02:22:36.560]   We saw what happened with that picture, you know in in Norway
[02:22:36.560 --> 02:22:40.960]   Like at some point the government's gonna get involved and that's not gonna be good for facebook's business
[02:22:40.960 --> 02:22:45.280]   And they they need to take it seriously and so I would praise google with the
[02:22:45.280 --> 02:22:53.760]   Queer undercurrent. That's that's not no longer implicit. It's very explicit that what a welcome counter to what we're seeing from from kind of the
[02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:59.920]   Real news distribution source. I have to say now that i'm looking at facebook's trending stories
[02:22:59.920 --> 02:23:08.000]   They I think they've solved this problem by eliminating news entirely. Yeah, and just covering like well stuff like this so
[02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.960]   There's fake stories and then there's real stories about fake things
[02:23:10.960 --> 02:23:13.680]   There you go
[02:23:13.680 --> 02:23:16.720]   Uh, there is something fake here, but it's not the story. No, okay
[02:23:16.720 --> 02:23:23.440]   Uh anything we missed uh boy would agree. I think that's a great way to end and I appreciate everybody for being here
[02:23:23.680 --> 02:23:25.680]   Ben Thompson for stethcory
[02:23:25.680 --> 02:23:29.920]   You know, I know Ben has his bully pulpit. You've got the exponent podcast

[02:23:42.240 --> 02:23:46.960]   I'm no need to apologize. It might have been my fault. I actually haven't even if it wasn't your fault. It wasn't your fault
[02:23:46.960 --> 02:23:49.040]   I don't blame you at all
[02:23:49.040 --> 02:23:52.000]   Uh, we also thank mike elgan because whenever you're in town

[02:23:54.400 --> 02:23:57.520]   Lottes. Did you like both of them? I drank both of them. I don't care
[02:23:57.520 --> 02:24:01.360]   You saw me sprinting and scampering away in the bathroom. Yeah, you ate sleep in the night by the boy
[02:24:01.360 --> 02:24:07.440]   I only got like halfway through my i'll sleep next week. The pumpkin spice is strong in this one. Yes. Yes
[02:24:07.440 --> 02:24:13.360]   Uh, we also uh, I'm thrilled as always to have nathan all of her as jiles now that I gave him my mac pro
[02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:16.160]   He has to show up anytime I ask him to actually
[02:24:16.160 --> 02:24:22.080]   Uh, there's a stickers app that my colleague joanna stern and I uh created we think it's what?
[02:24:22.080 --> 02:24:28.000]   Pupmoji. Yeah, it was great. Wait a minute. This is for our messages. Yeah, apples messages
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:31.200]   What's it called? It's called pupmoji now you drew the cartoons of her dog
[02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:32.400]   I drew the cartoons of her dog
[02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:36.160]   She put in a column about how easy it is to make a iMessage app and um
[02:24:36.160 --> 02:24:40.720]   I drew them on an ipad pro, but I finished them on the mac pro you gave me
[02:24:40.720 --> 02:24:45.120]   Uh, see see i'm already gaining the benefit of that. It's a free app
[02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:48.880]   We're not going to charge for it because it was you know for a new story. There's only a couple
[02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:54.640]   We want to add more um, but uh, but yeah, this is this is a direct result of that top thanks moji

[02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:15.680]   And this is joanna's ball. Yeah, so joanna like coded it. It's really simple
[02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:21.840]   If you have x code there's it's basically just templates. It's not hard to do at all, but um, i'm impressed
[02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:26.320]   Yeah, I basically drew those on an ipad pro then using uh adobe's
[02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:31.600]   You know cloud i brought it up on the adobe illustrator app on the mac pro and finished them there
