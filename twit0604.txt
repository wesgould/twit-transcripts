[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.760]   about the latest what?
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.400]   The latest tech news, that's Alex Wilhelm.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.360]   He's from Canada.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.000]   It's true.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.840]   No, he's not.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.840]   I am actually Tech Cruise's lost son.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.120]   Are you?
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.480]   Fantastic.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.600]   Yes, no, definitely not.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.240]   Are you a blonde?
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.280]   It's-- I'm going bald.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.120]   So kind of ambivalent on the one.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.760]   Nice to have you.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.240]   Your new site, crunchbase.com, has launched.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.160]   No, not yet.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.600]   Tarn it.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.560]   I know, sorry.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.800]   You said it would have launched by now.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.240]   I was a big old liar.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.480]   So congratulations, editor-in-chief at a new site
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.040]   from TechCrunch folks, spin-off, really, from the TechCrunch.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.840]   That's close enough.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.200]   Yeah, it's a spin-off.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.600]   Crunchbase is now independent company.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.400]   Any relationship to AOL and TechCrunch?
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.480]   I mean, they used to own us.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.440]   But not anymore.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.840]   They don't.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.520]   We were spun out.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.640]   I don't know if they own a piece or not.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.400]   I'm not really privy to our financials.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.880]   OK.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.480]   So it's a standalone.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.400]   So you can say this doesn't work there right now.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.680]   So go for it.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.400]   AOL retains a significant portion of the app.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.000]   That's Peter Rojas.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.200]   He knows founder of Engadget--
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.640]   I worked a little bit on the spin-off.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.280]   Is it like the angel to your Buffy?
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.960]   I'm not allowed to comment on such interesting things as that.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.000]   That is-- oh, that flow.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.440]   It's spin-offs.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.080]   Florence Eye--
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.000]   Today is also Buffy's 20th anniversary.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.400]   Is it really happy birthday, Buffy?
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.760]   Happy birthday, Buffy.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.480]   It seems like it was older than that, really.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.040]   20 doesn't seem that old.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.800]   So it came out in 1997--
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.240]   Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.360]   Yeah, 1997 on the WB.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.040]   On the WB.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.720]   Wow, that's a throwback itself for them.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.160]   I feel like you were watching that all last night to celebrate.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.400]   I mean, I was watching Buffy when I was--
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.760]   when it came on-- girl power.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.800]   So welcome, Peter.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.720]   What are you doing these days?
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.160]   We talked about this last time, but just refresh my memory.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.640]   Yeah, I raised a venture fund doing seed investing.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.640]   Your own fund?
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.640]   Well, with partners.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.920]   Is that RoJ.AS?
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.920]   Is that where we'd find that?
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.120]   No.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.640]   I mean, you could, but--
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.160]   That's your stuff.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.880]   --it's with beta works.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.320]   Beta works.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.800]   That's right.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.000]   We talked about this one.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Just kind of coming back.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.320]   How big is your fund?
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.800]   I can't announce that yet.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.560]   Are you going to see it?
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.800]   Remember, you're talking to Crunchbase at this point.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.520]   It's just me, really, but--
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.600]   Now I'm hyper curious.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.880]   Yeah, we can talk about it later.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.400]   OK.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.920]   Off the air.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.880]   Technically, I'm not allowed to say--
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.400]   Nice.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.440]   I think I've probably already said too much, according to the SEC.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.720]   You guys should talk about this offline.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.120]   Oh, there's SEC involved.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.400]   Yeah, there's a lot of little else with that.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.640]   And Alex can--
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.160]   I think Vatcha-- there's a lot of rules
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.400]   around what you can say around raising new funds.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.880]   Right.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.880]   Solicitation and so forth.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.640]   The jobs actually--
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.360]   So this is actually--
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.240]   No, I'm not soliciting anyone.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.000]   This is not a solicitation.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.880]   Read the prospectus carefully before you
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.880]   listen to Peter Rojas.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.640]   That's the bottom line, basically.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.040]   Well, if I had money, I'd be an LP for you.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.400]   You know, I can't even--
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.200]   Just say nothing.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.800]   Just blink twice.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.280]   What's LP?
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.040]   Licker pal?
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.520]   Exactly.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.800]   OK.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.760]   It's a limited partner.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.960]   Oh, OK.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.360]   Hey, calm down.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.040]   This week, "Contangences" on the air.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.720]   I mentioned you, Flo.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.480]   Thank you, Florence.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.040]   I am also a host of all about Android Create2HaveYou.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.000]   You are bearing in your hands something
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.320]   returned from Barcelona.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.120]   Can I talk about it?
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.120]   Yes.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.120]   I actually-- I didn't get to go to Barcelona, unfortunately.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.800]   You didn't go to Baltimore Congress, but you covered it.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.360]   But I-- yeah.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.200]   Is it the G6?
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.560]   Yeah, I did get a G6.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.080]   Nice.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.080]   Peter, do you have a vestigial, still vestigial,
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.720]   interesting gadgets from your time out in gadget?
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.080]   Of course.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.960]   Of course.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:08.560]   You can't get off.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.640]   I follow a very close list.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.160]   So a number of phones announced this week
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.360]   at Mobile World Congress.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.200]   This was-- I think probably the lion's-- well, this
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.400]   and the Nokia 3310.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.360]   This was a surprisingly--
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.880]   Yeah, got the lion's share of attention.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.520]   The 3310 is a candy bar feature phone.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.640]   But the fact that it's back, I guess, excites people.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.080]   Nokia announced some good smart--
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.520]   I thought interesting low priced smart phones,
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.960]   but then get nearly the attention.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.200]   The 3310 did.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.600]   And they run Android now.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.800]   Which is also--
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.280]   They're not actually made by Nokia.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.000]   They're made by former Nokia engineers who went next door,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.880]   literally next door, into a new company.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.360]   But Nokia sells--
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.040]   Well, they had to wait a few years after they
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.600]   sold the smartphone business to Microsoft.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.400]   I think it was-- was it a three year lock out or five year
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.400]   lock out in the financial--
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.800]   It sounds like it's just by the--
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.880]   But I think it's expired now.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.400]   Yeah, it's expired.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.080]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.200]   I mean, this is on the up and up.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.280]   But I think when that sale happened,
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.680]   I don't think anyone expected that one, that lock out,
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.520]   ended that there were going to go back.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.960]   Well, that there wouldn't be any Windows phones, basically.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.280]   Nobody wants Windows phones.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.280]   And so Nokia-- which, by the way, those Lumias were great--
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.480]   They were great phones.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.000]   Microsoft was probably right to buy them.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.160]   They've gone back to making smartphones,
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.000]   as well as candy bar phones.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.400]   But these are less expensive phones, probably
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.520]   for the developing world, I would guess.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.640]   But for Android phones, they're nice.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.120]   They're made of gorilla glass, and they're all aluminum.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.840]   Well, it's also the Nokia brand carries a lot more weight
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.200]   outside the US.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.680]   Absolutely.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.680]   Right.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.680]   Yeah.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.520]   It definitely does.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.000]   So I'm rooting for them.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.240]   I'd love to see them succeed.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.840]   They also announced, as we mentioned, the candy bar 3310,
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.800]   which has Snake on.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.000]   Did you-- have you played with that yet?
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.680]   I don't want to buy one.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.440]   51 bucks.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.360]   Why not?
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.360]   It's your burner phone.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.400]   Yeah, that's a good one.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.240]   That's a good idea.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.200]   Tell us about the G6.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.240]   This is LG's flagship.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.760]   Yeah, so this is LG's flagship.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.880]   You know, Samsung didn't announce anything big this year
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:56.880]   at MWC.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.380]   Yeah.
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:57.380]   Because--
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.240]   That's coming March 29.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:58.720]   That's coming.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.160]   They did announce the Tab S3 at MWC,
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.560]   which is a new sort of the iPad Pro to the Tab S2.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.280]   I got up early for that announcement.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:06.880]   You did?
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.920]   We broadcast it much to my disappointment in chagrin.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.920]   Because it wasn't much.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.040]   It looks just like an iPad, right?
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.920]   I mean, it looks just like a giant metal Tab S2.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.420]   Yeah.
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.520]   With a really nice stylus.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.400]   You put this microphone right up front of you.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.760]   I want to hear--
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.760]   Yeah, let's hear it.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.420]   Hear me.
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.120]   So show me the LG G6.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.360]   Yeah, this is a G6.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.960]   It's really pretty.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:29.880]   Is this a glass back?
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.440]   This is a glass back.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.080]   Now, curiously, it's got different layers.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.600]   It's got different gorilla glass around it.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.000]   Yeah, they're doing all that stuff now.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.760]   Everybody's doing that.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.560]   Yeah, which is interesting.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.680]   Samsung might have started this with the S7 probably, right?
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:41.960]   I mean--
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.360]   Mate, actually, I'm not sure about that.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.040]   Possibly.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:52.360]   So 5.7 inch LCD screen, quad HD, HDR, capable HDR display.
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.400]   Is this the one that's a two by one aspect ratio?
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:56.880]   Yes.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.280]   So that was one thing I kind of intrigued me.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.320]   And I thought it's a little taller than normal.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:00.920]   It's narrow.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.240]   Even the screenshots are very narrow.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.120]   And the idea was that you would then
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.480]   be able to use it with one hand, but it's still a 5.7 inch
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:06.800]   phone.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.840]   You can't use this as one hand.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.960]   I mean, I can't.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.160]   I thought it would look a little bit odd,
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.360]   but it doesn't look too tall.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:13.860]   No.
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.120]   I mean, look, I mean, it's pretty.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.960]   It's a pretty phone.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.600]   Water resistance, IP68 rated.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.360]   So you're just going to--
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:19.360]   What is that there?
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.000]   You're going to shower.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.860]   IP68.
[00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.200]   You can take it with you into the shower
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:22.960]   for up to half an hour.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.240]   Fingerprint rate is on the back.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.440]   That's what-- of course, a lot of phones are doing now.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.880]   And an animal button.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.160]   It still has a physical home button?
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.400]   Well, the back is the--
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.880]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.560]   Not the home button.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.400]   It goes in, though.
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.560]   It's the power button.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:34.960]   Yes.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.480]   Oh, that's really strange.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:36.920]   Yes.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.160]   So you turn it on and off from the fingerprint rate of the back.
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.520]   And that's how you take your screenshots
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.360]   as you hold the back and then--
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.160]   It's weird.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:44.920]   I mean, it's beautiful.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.400]   Can I see it?
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.120]   Yeah, it's really pretty.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.920]   We're really at peak phone, though.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.560]   It's very hard for any of these companies
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.120]   to do anything that's at all interesting.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.040]   We're talking about now little, tiny slivers of distance.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:55.600]   Difference.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.800]   This has, like the iPhone 7 plus two cameras--
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.320]   Yes, both.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.200]   One super wide, one normal.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.680]   Both are wide-- sorry.
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.280]   Both are 13 megapixel.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.280]   One is wide angle.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:07.760]   OK.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.960]   And then the front facing camera is 5 megapixel
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.320]   with 100 degree lens.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.480]   Well, that's pretty wide.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.880]   So your face will look a little--
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.440]   but you'll be able to fit in a bunch of people with you.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.680]   You get a bunch of people with you.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.080]   So USB-C 3300 milliamp battery pack.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.400]   Isn't it really now just Samsung and Apple
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.760]   and who cares about the rest, at least in the US,
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.600]   at least in the high end market?
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.840]   There's a lot of market for $400 and $200.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.400]   People likes the LG phones, though.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.800]   Like the G2 and the G3 sold really well.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.600]   And then the G4 and the G5 were kind of--
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.160]   They feel like--
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.080]   Very different concepts.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.080]   They like the Sony--
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:42.840]   It's not kind of on.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.960]   --that they were enthusiast phones.
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.360]   Like the Sony fans love their experience.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.840]   Sony had new experience.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.000]   Everybody else goes, well, that's very ho-hum.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.480]   Same thing with the LGs.
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.680]   The LG fans love them.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.000]   Everybody else goes, well, it's hard to distinguish that
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.040]   from a Samsung, frankly.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.960]   It looks a lot like an S7, the Square S7, not the edge, right?
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.560]   It's how you can have the always on display.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.280]   Like, how committed do you think LG
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.440]   is to continue to make smartphones?
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.040]   Because they're not doing that well.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.640]   What's their market share right now?
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.280]   It's pretty small.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:13.840]   It's pretty small.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.280]   But the real question is how committed
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.680]   is anybody except Samsung and Apple, right?
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.120]   Because at the higher end of the market.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:19.600]   At the higher end.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.280]   And then there's--
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.080]   Well, Huawei.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.800]   Let's not forget Huawei.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.120]   We'll stick around.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.480]   Google's-- they've committed to doing at least
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.480]   another piece of phone.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.560]   And I think that they'll continue to put our phones even
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.600]   if they have a different mission.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.040]   They're trying to get Android a lot.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.040]   LG has 10% of the smartphone market right now.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:37.840]   Oh, that's not cool.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.280]   You ask her globally.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.320]   This is Top Smartphone OEMs from ComScore US.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:42.840]   Oh, that's--
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.840]   That's the nine points.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.760]   You know why?
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.160]   Low and in mid-range phones.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.320]   Low and in mid-range phones.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.640]   They saw a lot of them at like the MVNOs.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.640]   OK, short short short short short.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.920]   But globally, what I thought was interesting was--
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.600]   if you actually-- there was a report, was it Gartner?
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.240]   Just put out a report.
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.400]   It was-- the company, it's Oppo.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:10:59.840]   Yes.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.480]   Love Oppo.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.080]   Which also--
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.320]   They kind of spun in one plus.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:09.240]   But then also, there was a third brand under there.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.480]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.040]   They were cagey about one plus even.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.120]   I want to say Newseo.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.120]   Newseo?
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.360]   Newseo, which I can never--
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:16.920]   Newseo?
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:17.920]   Newseo?
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.120]   New-- it's a Chinese smartphone brand.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.600]   This is why I'm glad I have a computer in front of me.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.320]   The company BBK, they also do Vivo.
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.520]   Vivo, I don't even know that.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:28.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:29.800]   That's some overuse.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.880]   So for Americans--
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.760]   For Americans, there's a lot of brands
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:33.880]   that we don't really see.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.280]   Yeah.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.400]   Like, Blue is very popular around the world
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.040]   as a low-cost Android device.
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.480]   Vio, we have it here.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.920]   But how many people do you ever see carrying a blue?
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.160]   No.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.560]   Well, I forgot the LG made phones
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.760]   before this conversation.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.440]   Really?
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:47.720]   Yeah.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.600]   I live in the iPhone world.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:48.960]   There you go.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.200]   I mean, I just buy a new iPhone every two years.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.240]   And it works out great and they're pretty good and I'm happy.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.040]   And I see no real reason to change.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:55.640]   Maybe I should.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.240]   Maybe I'm being ignorant.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.600]   You tried the Pixel.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.120]   OK.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:58.400]   Why?
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.920]   What's the best-- OK, what's the best--
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:01.560]   I carry a Pixel.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.160]   It's great.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.400]   I love the Pixel, too.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:03.880]   OK?
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.680]   I carry both, though.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.520]   I carry an iPhone 7.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.080]   Yeah, I carry both.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:06.680]   And a Pixel.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.240]   Yeah, I carry both.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.120]   I think those are-- that's the best Android in iOS devices.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.040]   You're right.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.560]   Pixel's pretty pure.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.160]   You don't get all these fun little things.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.960]   I was mentioning before the show that I just ordered the HTC
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.040]   U-Ultra, the one that--
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:19.960]   Which is so pretty.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.440]   It's pretty.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.160]   It's a gorgeous phone.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.360]   And it has a second screen at the top with extra little icon.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.360]   I mean, they're stretching.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.320]   They're pushing to find something to make them--
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.880]   How did you did that with the V20?
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:29.880]   Right.
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.000]   And it stopped.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.320]   So I think we can stipulate, at least in the US, flagship
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.800]   owned pretty much outright by Apple and Samsung.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.360]   The rest are small.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.800]   How about in the budget phone?
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.680]   Because there's still a big market for sub $200 phones.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.800]   I mean, Motorola and S though G5.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:52.720]   What do you think?
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.360]   Did you see that?
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.680]   Did you talk about that at all?
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.640]   Yeah, I mean, it's a metal mid-range phone.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.520]   It's cheap.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.480]   It's 200 bucks.
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.360]   It's 200 bucks.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.840]   I mean, I've always been a fan of the Moto Gs.
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.160]   And they're great mid-range, low-end devices.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.480]   And then if you really want to go cheap,
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.880]   then Nokia 33, 10, 50 bucks, 51 bucks.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:11.360]   Right.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.920]   But I believe that one's only 2G though.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.400]   Yeah, it's not a data phone.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:15.880]   It's a phone armor.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.720]   No, no, that's fine.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.640]   Because it's not a data phone.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.840]   It's a phone phone.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.440]   You don't need 2, 3, 4, or LTE.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.040]   That's true.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.400]   Because what are you doing?
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.480]   They do have a browser, but I don't know why.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.000]   That's it.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:27.880]   They have Snake.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:28.640]   You don't need LG.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.040]   You don't need data for Snake.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.160]   You don't need data to make phone calls.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.040]   You don't need data for tech?
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.400]   No, you have to keep checking in to authenticate your access.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:36.960]   There's live data.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.560]   I'm sorry, Snake is an online-only game.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:40.840]   No pirating your snake.
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.760]   We want to improve the experience of our customers.
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.880]   OK, we're late front of that.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.880]   But remember, back in the day of flip phones,
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.120]   there were app stores that were de-arrant.
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.120]   Well, they were terrible.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.000]   And I was in the Verizon V-Cast store.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.520]   I'll never have access those apps.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.080]   Oh, I remember that.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.120]   There was Blackberry stores.
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.440]   Speaking of Blackberry, we'll be in trouble
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.440]   if we don't mention the key one.
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:00.940]   Oh.
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.000]   What is the key one?
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.400]   That is the new Blackberry phone.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.840]   It runs Android.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.800]   I'm going to make it bigger for you.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.560]   Got a keyboard.
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.400]   It has a--
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.000]   It's a keyboard that does a slide.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.720]   It's in the space bar.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.480]   OK.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.760]   It's productivity focused.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:17.920]   Does it run Twitter?
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:18.420]   Yeah.
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:19.280]   Well, then I'm a fan.
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:19.800]   It's Android.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:20.480]   It's a full Android.
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.400]   In fact, it's you, Sarah, are so different than what I care about.
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.640]   Like fingerprint readers and this.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.880]   I just want to tweet.
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.960]   Like if my phone only tweeted, I'd be like 85% happy with this.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.160]   We'd be in the Nokia.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.160]   The problem with the most recent Black--
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.840]   I remember there was the peak, which I think was the--
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:34.360]   Yes.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:34.880]   Yes.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.480]   Which was just for Twitter.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.960]   And there was one for email, too, right?
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.560]   There was these mono useful ones.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.360]   And they were trash and no one bought them,
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.200]   because it turns out I'm the only person who wants that.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.560]   Did you have a peak now?
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.360]   I don't know if I found--
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.760]   Even you didn't have a peak.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.160]   It was adorable.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:48.960]   It wasn't a phone.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.040]   But it was like, here's a device.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:50.800]   No, it wasn't a phone.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.360]   It was just a Twitter device.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:52.840]   They sold two.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.640]   There was one for one for doing email.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.760]   And then another one they sold that was just for doing Twitter.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:57.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.040]   I'll hold up.
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.560]   I won't.
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.560]   I don't think I can find one now.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.000]   I carry both.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.480]   Peak internet web name.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.320]   You can't read me.
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:03.880]   You can't read email.
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.080]   That's Twitter.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:05.600]   Hold on.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.080]   Let me do it.
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:06.600]   Hold on.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.120]   Wait.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.400]   No, here's a headline.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.160]   The Twitter peak is so dumb, it makes my brain hurt.
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.920]   Thank you, 2009, gizmodo.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:14.640]   You're welcome.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.120]   Back in the day, still have some spice to them.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.880]   Look how cute that is.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.760]   I mean, I kind of want to take it home and do not marry it.
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.160]   I bet it doesn't even work anymore.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.400]   I bet it doesn't-- I bet it support--
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.480]   it doesn't-- the Twitter API.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.080]   No longer--
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.320]   I love the disclaimers on this.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.480]   Actually, service plan no longer
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.680]   is supported by manufacturer.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.080]   Oh, that's a bummer.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.480]   Does it even have Wi-Fi?
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.000]   We don't know.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   If we're wearing this later--
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.200]   I'm not in full recharge in under two hours.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.640]   I'm going to say they're so proud of that.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.280]   That's charging.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:38.960]   I know.
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.480]   This is really quick, guys, in 2009.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.920]   That's how far we've been, though, in the last eight years.
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:44.920]   It's incredible to me.
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.200]   I can't believe there's 34 customer reviews on that.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.400]   I'm throwing in my wings.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.480]   I think we got one in for review, and I was just so--
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.960]   Three stars, actually, pretty generous.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.600]   This is good average.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.520]   So the keyboard on the new Blackberries
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.960]   is not the Blackberry keyboard we love.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:00.440]   No.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.320]   And that's part of the problem, is you're giving them
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.120]   a physical keyboard, but it's not a good usable--
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.200]   Actually, I haven't played with it,
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.280]   but people that have got hands on with it in Barcelona said--
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.560]   I had the Priv, and it was very hard to type on.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.680]   And it looks like the Priv.
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.800]   Yeah, I had hands on with it at CES, actually.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:16.280]   The key one?
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.400]   The key one, yes.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:22.400]   And it feels like a traditional Blackberry phone.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.280]   Oh, it does.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:23.720]   And when you--
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.600]   Well, some people want that.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.080]   The keyboard definitely is a tiny bit,
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.600]   or reminds me of--
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.640]   you know, when the Blackberry got a little smaller,
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.800]   and they were making them in seven colors and Verizon,
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.280]   I actually don't know what model number that was.
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.360]   I think it was the bold.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.800]   But it's a nice--
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.760]   it harkens back to those glory days.
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.960]   Has a nice rubbery back, which kind of adds--
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:44.920]   I'm kind of interested in it.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.880]   It's really nice.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.680]   Can you type faster on it than you can on Android or Android?
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:52.000]   Well, I mean, there's a learning curve, right?
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.440]   Because we got to go fast.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.360]   So when I had a physical keyboard,
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.840]   I mean, I used to carry a Blackberry back in the day.
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.640]   And I could type them, but I'm a lot smarter off of it.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.240]   Probably faster than I can on Android.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.120]   But I used to be able to type so fast on T9.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.640]   Oh, you were one of those.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.040]   I could do that with my eyes closed in class.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.680]   It's very disappointing.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.720]   According to the scene that the 3310, the Nokia candy bar,
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.760]   will not work in the US.
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.720]   It doesn't have the right frequencies.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.560]   Yeah, that sounds about right.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.800]   But can it still play a snake for 51 bucks?
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.280]   It can.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.160]   And that guess I'm still going to--
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.160]   Think of it as a snake machine.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:20.520]   That's fine.
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.440]   It's like a Twitter machine, but even better,
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.160]   because it still works.
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.480]   There's actually an app that emulates it, by the way.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.160]   Emulates snake.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.600]   I really hate to go down to Stowgeline.
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.880]   My mom had one of the old Nokia's when I was a little kid.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:30.720]   And I would play in the car.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.480]   I'm just in the grocery store.
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.320]   And I have so many awesome memories of that game.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.160]   She left it in the car?
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:34.520]   I was like--
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.240]   Did she leave the windows?
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:35.680]   She rolled up the windows.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.600]   She rolled up the windows.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.080]   She rolled up the four.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.000]   I'm not that young.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:38.960]   Calm down.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.720]   But I remember playing that incessantly.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.200]   She put a sign in the thing.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.120]   She says, the kid's OK.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:43.840]   Just ignore it.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.240]   Or like, hopefully the kid's not OK.
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.960]   Please don't pick window.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.960]   No, but I really--
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.880]   I think it's fun to see the occasional throwback in tech
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.440]   that actually hits the mark and makes an improvement on some
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.640]   we all know and love.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.080]   I like that one.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.800]   Which I think is the Blackberry Key One.
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.120]   OK.
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.880]   Well, in that case, buy one, review it,
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.120]   and then tell them about it.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.400]   I bought the Priv, and I kind of regret it.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.400]   The Priv was not Blackberry's return to greatness.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.960]   Well, that's what I think the Key One probably isn't either.
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.720]   And I think it was-- well, but the difference
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.800]   is that the Blackberry Priv was done by Blackberry, Blackberry,
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.840]   not by--
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:14.880]   Well, who's doing the Key One?
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.000]   Well, now it's TCL.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.800]   And Alcatel--
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.440]   TCL, the Chinese TV Company.
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.760]   Yes, but they have Alcatel.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.760]   I love how you knew that.
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.520]   They own Alcatel, the French phone company.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.480]   I'm confused.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.000]   I'll wait for Canadian companies to have new devices.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.360]   I think that they have the rights to the electronics brands.
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.120]   Yes, they do.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:32.600]   OK.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.920]   So Canadian companies' brand is being built by a Chinese television
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.160]   company and marketed under a--
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.000]   The hardware is--
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:38.480]   French.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.480]   The software is still developed in Canada.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.360]   So this is--
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.040]   Alcatel is basically a licensed sub-brand for TCL.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.400]   I think this is why I still use iPhones because I'm lazy.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.960]   And I don't have to think about any of this stuff.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:49.720]   I will tell you--
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.560]   Oh, you know, TCL.
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.280]   Alcatel's phones are pretty great.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:52.760]   Yeah, they are.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.160]   They have really good mid-range and low-end phones.
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.600]   My iPhone broke, and I needed a phone in 45 minutes.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.160]   When you had--
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.240]   I bought the Alcatel the Idol 3, I think.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:01.720]   You did.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.400]   I got it in 45 minutes from Amazon.
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.080]   I think it was a good rate.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:05.600]   200 bucks.
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.640]   Was it Amazon now?
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.680]   Prime now, yeah.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.560]   I think that's--
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.120]   No, literally.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.240]   I dropped my phone, stopped working.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.680]   I'm like--
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:12.560]   OK, I need something new.
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.760]   And I literally have some--
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:15.760]   Oh, no.
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:20.480]   No, no, I should say Nokia bought Alcatel and Lucent.
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.560]   Remember Alcatel bought--
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.560]   The networking gear side of it.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.400]   Right.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:29.960]   So Lucent, which was AT&T's Bell Labs,
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:35.160]   sewed to Alcatel, which then became part of Nokia.
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.000]   So that's really confusing.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.240]   Actually, what it shows you, does it
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.600]   show you a mature industry shaking out and merging
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.160]   and reconfiguring--
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.280]   That's what happened to TV.
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.440]   Yeah, and have PCs.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:47.960]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.520]   Think about all the consolidation in the PC market right now.
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.920]   Lenovo's buying up--
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:52.840]   It's not playing with Lenovo.
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.080]   Lenovo's about to buy--
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:54.600]   No.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.880]   Lenovo's gobbling them up.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:56.960]   But who are they going to buy?
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.840]   They're going to buy another PC OEM.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:00.680]   Who is?
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.200]   Lenovo.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:01.720]   Lenovo.
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.720]   Lenovo is, yeah.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:03.960]   I think they're buying Toshiba's.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.200]   Why would you do that?
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.120]   Why wouldn't you?
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.960]   Because I lived in an HP talent after they bought Compaq.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.960]   So I've seen what happens to buying--
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:10.960]   Yeah, that was a terrible act.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:11.640]   Oh, wow, yeah.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.120]   Half my friends, parents got fired through that.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:14.600]   Oh, HP.
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.200]   On the other hand, you're buying market share, basically.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.120]   Lenovo did--
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.680]   Has that great with the ThinkPad brand?
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.400]   You don't understand the benefit of scale.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.120]   Well, if you're Lenovo, you're manufacturing at scale.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.280]   So it's--
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.760]   I don't-- but there's no economics in making a million PCs.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.280]   Well, because--
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:30.760]   Because--
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:30.920]   2 million.
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.440]   Well, because-- well, but they do make some money.
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.880]   It's just a very low margin business.
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:35.920]   And the thing is they essentially get
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.000]   given the business for free because, like, Toshiba,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:38.800]   for example--
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.800]   They want to--
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.800]   They're using money on it.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:40.800]   They want to.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.800]   They just basically give it to--
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.160]   Oh, OK.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.160]   That's what happens.
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.160]   I understand that then.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.160]   I understand that then.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.160]   Which they can also--
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.200]   So you're really just branding some laptops to Toshiba
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.800]   because that's a known laptop brand.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.320]   Absolutely.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:51.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:52.680]   So you're buying the badge.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.680]   You're buying the badge.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.920]   It's like you're basically buying--
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.520]   And it can't cost that much.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.160]   And if you can pick up an eight points of market share,
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.360]   you can push your suppliers a little harder.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.360]   OK, I can see that.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:00.360]   Yeah.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.720]   But it's not a huge move in terms of--
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.440]   No, but it's a move that happens
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:08.520]   at this stage of a market where the business is essentially--
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.000]   the products are commodity.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.120]   And you have legacy players who are not making any money
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:14.920]   that want to get out.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:15.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.600]   And we saw this over and over.
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.600]   It just happened to automobiles.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.320]   And it's happening out to Android back to our earlier
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.320]   point about differentiation.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:20.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.240]   So we should expect, in fact, in the next few years,
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.240]   a shakeout of a lot of these Android companies.
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.240]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:27.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.840]   And I wonder if they'll just fold or if they'll say,
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.320]   well, let's sell the brand.
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:35.120]   It'd be interesting if Nokia kind of acquired
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.560]   all the low rent brands leaving the high end market to Samsung
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.280]   and Apple, but saying we'd like to dominate--
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.280]   The company wants to BBK the one I was talking about.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:43.440]   BBK.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:50.360]   That's the one that owns Oppo 1 Plus and one called IMU.
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.560]   They also have an advantage because they can sell--
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.240]   So they have--
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.440]   A lot of these companies cannot sell into China.
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.640]   And the thing is, if you actually
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:01.040]   add all the market share from their BBKs different brands,
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.080]   they're the third biggest maker of mine.
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.680]   Vivo Oppo 1 Plus.
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.880]   No, I'm looking at the BBK Wikipedia entry.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.440]   They've got all the--
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.920]   But Gartner just put out a report.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:21.680]   OK, so they put-- so because Apple, Samsung, Huawei,
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.080]   then they put Oppo and BBK as separate.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.840]   But actually, if you combine them,
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.640]   they have more market share than Huawei
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.120]   and not that far behind Samsung and Apple.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.120]   Interesting.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:38.040]   Anything else from Mobile World Congress before we move along,
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.560]   do we hit all the highlights?
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.600]   When somebody wrote the Qualcomm was really the big story.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.960]   Yes.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.040]   Maybe.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:50.840]   Because almost all of these phones, almost to a phone,
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.120]   they all had-- except for-- Samsung uses its own chips.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.360]   But in the US, even they use Qualcomm chips.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.160]   Apple was single sourced on Qualcomm,
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.280]   but they've started to be nervous about that.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.440]   So they're using Intel as well to their detriment.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.160]   They're not as good as Qualcomm.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.520]   For the chipsets.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.600]   Well, it's all a system on a chip, right?
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.080]   You get the radio, you get everything, right?
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.520]   GPU.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.280]   Yeah, I mean, Apple still makes its CPU.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.200]   Yes.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.960]   Everything else is Qualcomm.
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.200]   Qualcomm does $6 billion a quarter in revenue.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.080]   I didn't know they were that big.
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:24.760]   It's impressive.
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.280]   Qualcomm's enormous.
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:30.760]   But Intel is introducing next generation of LTE chipsets.
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.760]   And they've learned--
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.320]   And I believe that Apple is committed to using them.
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.040]   Right.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.920]   Of course, their story was in the iPhone 7,
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:41.000]   they dual sourced their radios.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.080]   Qualcomm and Intel and the LTE radios from Intel
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.080]   were so much slower than the Qualcomm chips
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.400]   that Apple admitted to their seat.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:47.920]   Yeah, it was a problem.
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.920]   They slowed down the Qualcomm chips
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.880]   so there wouldn't be an obvious inequality.
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.160]   So you don't get the better stuff.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.120]   Everyone gets the same data.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.560]   They just get the better stuff.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.040]   They throttled them.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.000]   That's one way to handle PR.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.840]   But the thing is with this next generation of LTE,
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:04.040]   which people are going to start to call 5G, but it's not.
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.080]   But there'll be 4 and 1/2 G.
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.880]   Sorry, that's all I've been hearing about is 5G.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.160]   But we saw the same thing with HSPA+
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.360]   where people were trying to call that 4G.
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.120]   Remember that?
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.720]   We went through this before and we survived.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.840]   Because it's a marketing term.
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:16.840]   It's not a technical term.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:17.400]   It's a marketing term.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.080]   You got to make it sound?
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.160]   Well, there actually is a technical definition for 5G.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.280]   As there was for 4G.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.000]   That's what it's about.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.120]   And what happened was--
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:25.160]   5G finalies.
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.600]   They have defined it as a finalized.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.440]   It's not finalies.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.520]   But I think they defined it as--
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.720]   It was really great.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.360]   At least one gigabit.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.720]   Yeah, they find it as a gigabit.
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.600]   So for instance, at Mobile Congress,
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.840]   DTE had a gigabit phone that they were showing off,
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.280]   which was to show off the capabilities of what phones
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.280]   would be able to do once 5G becomes available.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.600]   So it's the same stuff we do now, but faster?
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.920]   Well, it's going to enable wireless.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.320]   Like you'll be able to do VR better.
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:53.880]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.320]   Well, it tells us the latency.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.560]   I mean, they're protecting one millisecond latency.
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.240]   Which, if it's possible, then you actually
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.200]   start to be able to do stuff with autonomous vehicles
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.480]   that you can't do otherwise.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:03.980]   Right.
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.120]   OK, now I just got excited.
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.120]   Is this an opportunity--
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:09.680]   It's just an opportunity to overthrow Qualcomm's dominance
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.040]   and LTE from a company like Intel?
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:12.560]   Because they're willing--
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.440]   Intel would love to.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:13.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.840]   I mean, they really blew it with mobile.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.600]   They ignored mobile for a long time.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.560]   And then desktop went away.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.960]   Well, I mean, their strategy was bad.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.560]   I mean, they tried to go with atom processors,
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:24.760]   which made no sense.
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:25.800]   And then--
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.120]   They had the scale for a while.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.520]   They were attempting a mobile processor.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.640]   And then they tried to buy their way into the market,
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:31.640]   which didn't work.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:35.200]   Now they admit they're fabbing arm chips, which is crazy.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.640]   Kind of a bummer.
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.320]   There was one good Intel Android laptop that, unfortunately--
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.480]   Qualcomm wants to be big in 5G.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.800]   These are 5G trials of Qualcomm's involved in.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:50.480]   And of course, they also have the Snapdragon 835,
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.000]   which is in this phone.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.680]   It's in-- the Snapdragons are in watches.
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.280]   They're in tablets.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.280]   Qualcomm's everywhere.
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.280]   Actually, this one's 821.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.280]   It's the older 821.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.280]   It's still the 821.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.280]   It's still the 821.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.280]   We will say 835 based.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.280]   In fact, I think the S8--
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.920]   You're going to see some AR headsets with 835s.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.600]   That's also true.
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.600]   This is a 10--
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.600]   I played with one.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.600]   10 nanometer fin fit.
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.600]   Yeah.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:13.600]   It is very advanced chip.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.600]   But servers even are--
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.160]   But very supply constrained right now.
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:20.840]   And there was one issue with-- I think HTC wasn't able to get a supply of them for
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:21.840]   the new phone for the ultra.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:22.840]   Ultra.
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:23.840]   What?
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:24.840]   I want money.
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:25.840]   It isn't a 21.
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:26.840]   I believe so.
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.400]   821 is a very credible chip.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.400]   No, it's fine.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.400]   It's interesting.
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.400]   The dominance of Qualcomm though can hurt the chip.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.400]   But it is obsolete.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:38.080]   The 810 two generations ago was so terrible that a lot of phones had a throttle at.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.080]   They were heat problems.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:42.480]   It hurt the entire Android market for a whole year.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.720]   There were a lot of terrible phones based on the 810.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.880]   It shows you how dependent the market is.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.840]   And I'm sure these companies would love to see a second source.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:54.160]   So if they have an 810 situation once again with Qualcomm, they could go to Intel or someone
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.160]   else.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.000]   And what else is there yet?
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   It's really at Qualcomm's.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   Just Samsung on phone.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   And Huawei's got its care in.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   I've said.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.440]   Could Intel mount a credible threat against Qualcomm and the mobile space within five years
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.840]   if they put in their free sources into it?
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.200]   Because I have the earnings here and they're still very PC heavy.
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.040]   I mean, that's their plans.
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.040]   They've got to.
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.040]   What else can they do?
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.040]   But do we think they're going to pull it off?
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.040]   It's my question.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.040]   I get their goals.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.040]   They want to.
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.040]   They have to.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.040]   Yeah, it's an existential--
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.040]   I've heard that before followed by failure and then death.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.040]   I don't know.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.040]   It's really a say.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.160]   But I don't think it's a sure thing either.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:29.000]   It's like 40, 60?
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.960]   Well, the upside is that they've already done it.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.520]   So they've already kind of had the trial run.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.840]   And so now they can see where the industry's going and sort of adapt to that.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:41.360]   And maybe 5G is a good entrance to that.
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:45.520]   As long as we're in the phones and then we're going to move on, there have been leaks quite
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.520]   a few of the Galaxy S8.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:55.080]   They announced an event, March 29th in New York City, to show this.
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:59.160]   And I think at this point we know probably everything there is to know about the Galaxy.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.560]   Yes, I can't imagine there'll be much new.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.120]   There's going to be an edge version.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:08.040]   There's an S8 Plus as well, which will be 6.2 inches.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:10.560]   I'll be very curious.
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:15.040]   It really seems like we've all decided that 6 is too big, that 5, 8, 5, 7--
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.360]   People are complaining now.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.360]   They want bigger.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.240]   But phones are getting too big and they want smaller.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.240]   Yes, that's what I think.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.920]   SE is a nice sweet spot for a lot of people.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.520]   They really like the iPhone SE because it was--
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.760]   Depends on the bezels though.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.760]   Also true.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.760]   Well, this is 5.7 inches.
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.240]   And it doesn't feel--
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.240]   That's so thick.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:35.480]   It has to do with the size of the bezel around it and the thickness of the phone.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:40.320]   So I think that if-- I mean, personally, I think 6.2, even without pretty minimal bezels,
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.200]   is probably too big for me.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:47.600]   I remember that Google, the Nexus 6, 6-inch phone, that thing was--
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.600]   I'd carried that.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.200]   It was code-named Shamo because it was a whale.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.640]   Aww, but the SE is the smaller iPhone, right?
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.640]   Yes.
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.160]   Can I have more of a Trumpian size?
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.160]   Smaller hands?
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:58.880]   For baby hands?
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.720]   Exactly.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.720]   S8 will be AMOLED.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.240]   It will be-- I mean, this will be 835.
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.720]   All models, 4 gigs of RAMs.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.960]   This is all rumors, obviously.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:14.560]   64 gigs, they will continue support for the microSD cards, which is good.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.040]   But nobody's doing removable batteries.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.080]   Even LG abandoned the removable battery, which is too bad.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.240]   That was the last phone, I think.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.760]   For a lot of Android diehards, it's going to be a battery.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.160]   I like a removable battery.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.360]   But if you want to get better battery life, you want to get more battery in the same
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:34.600]   space and by eliminating the packaging, you get better battery life.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:39.280]   The sad thing about the S8 is Samsung continues along its path to duplicate what Google's
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.520]   already done with Android.
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:45.400]   They have a new virtual assistant named Bixby, just what you always wanted.
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.760]   One more thing to talk to.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.760]   They had purchased-- I forget the company that--
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:49.760]   Is it Nuance?
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.920]   Oh, it's a Vivi AI?
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:52.920]   It's a VIVi AI?
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.200]   Is this VIV-- so VIV was started by the-- some of the guys who did Siri, Samsung bought
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.200]   them.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.200]   So this is VIV, Bixby?
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.520]   In part, yeah.
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.160]   Interesting.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.720]   They were using Nuance for S-Voice.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:05.720]   They were licensing Nuance.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.720]   Yeah.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.720]   I think so, yeah.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.720]   They realized that they needed to have something to announce.
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.720]   Their own thing.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.720]   And so-- Bixby.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:15.160]   But it does remind me a lot of Samsung's earlier efforts to say, like, oh, we've got
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.160]   to have our own--
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.160]   The S-Voice?
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.160]   --app store.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.160]   Everything, right?
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.160]   They're on the music store.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.160]   And then they launched these things and they pulled in their retreat.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.160]   Yes.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.160]   So.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.160]   All right.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.160]   Well, we'll find out March 29th.
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.160]   Soon enough.
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:31.760]   Apparently shipping April 21st.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:32.760]   Should we talk about Pixel?
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:37.640]   Because Rick Osterlow, who's now-- and had a hardware at Google-- was at Moto.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.640]   Yep.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.640]   --ran Moto.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.240]   Did a very-- I thought very good job with the Moto X.
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.240]   Moto X was a great phone.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.240]   It was one of my favorite phones.
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.240]   Me too.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.240]   Rick is a great hardware guy.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.480]   He misspoke.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.280]   I think-- well, I'm not sure what happened.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:53.960]   He said there won't be another Pixel Chromebook.
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.360]   Then came back and said, I want to clarify that.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:00.840]   We have no plans at this time for a Chromebook Pixel.
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:04.520]   So I'm not sure whether that means he got in trouble or if they're really not doing
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.520]   it.
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:10.320]   He also said that they're working on a Pixel 2 for later this year.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.320]   We don't know when later.
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.320]   But--
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:14.320]   Probably actual.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.320]   Right because they did.
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.000]   It would be a year old in September because they announced it right before the iPhone.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.520]   So that's the time to-- and then today I saw a new rumor that there might be a low priced
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.520]   Google Android phone.
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:26.840]   They won't call the Pixel.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.560]   So like an Android one.
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:29.560]   Which would be great.
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:30.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.560]   Because the Pixel is way too expensive.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:33.560]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.600]   It's only for people who want to spend $700 or $100.
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.840]   Or as an Android one device you could sell at them via.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:39.840]   What happened to Android one?
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:40.840]   Are they still doing that?
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:44.080]   It wasn't doing so well overseas and India was where like the test--
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.080]   It wasn't cheap enough.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.080]   --was more than for it.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.440]   It just didn't take off and there's so much competition overseas in that market anyway.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.440]   Right.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.440]   So--
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.440]   Time confess.
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.440]   I have no idea what Android one is.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.280]   You don't care because you are all about iPhone.
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:02.560]   Android one was the low-- it was sort of the low end version of Android that Google announced
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.480]   a couple of years ago at Google I/O to help people--
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.480]   --knowing market version of the--
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.480]   --just to run out.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.480]   Oh, that was really cool.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.480]   --hearancyed updates, which is one thing that's sort of not--
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.680]   That's the number one thing people should look for in an Android phone.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.680]   I don't like that.
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.680]   It's too much and work out.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:16.680]   It's too bad.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:17.680]   What do you have about--
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.680]   A gum collection over there?
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.680]   I found the candy jar before I got it.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.680]   It's got air heads and nerds.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:22.680]   They're out of control.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.680]   This is a long shoot, man.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.680]   This is like two and a half hours of talking.
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.680]   You got to have some sustenance.
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:26.680]   That's what you're friends.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:27.680]   That's what you're bringing in your Jeep R.T.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:34.680]   I mean, you guys have little boxes of nerds.
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.680]   All right, I'll tell you what.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:38.680]   I'll give you a break if you want to go scavenge for candy.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.680]   When we come back, there's still lots to talk about.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.680]   Uber.
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:43.680]   Snap.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:44.680]   Right?
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.680]   Uber and Snap.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:46.680]   And then Snap and Uber.
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:47.680]   And Apple.
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:50.680]   And Apple and other stuff.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.680]   Spotify.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:53.680]   Spotify.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.680]   Well, you got something to say about Spotify?
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:56.680]   Something--
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:57.680]   What does it say?
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.680]   That's me.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:32:59.680]   As if they knew--
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.880]   I'm the resident millennial.
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:05.520]   As a baby boomer, I don't care what you think.
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.520]   I'm 27.
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.680]   Oh, you're stronger than me.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.720]   27 makes you millennial.
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.760]   Pretty much.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:12.760]   He's a baby.
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:13.760]   He's the baby of the book.
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:14.760]   Am I in trouble now?
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:15.760]   No.
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.760]   No.
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:17.760]   Okay.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.760]   That's why he's eating nerds and air heads.
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:19.760]   I worked out this morning.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.760]   I'm tired.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.760]   All right.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.760]   I am too.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:23.760]   I am too, but I didn't work out.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:24.760]   Our show today brought you by Stamps.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:25.760]   No, I did actually.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:26.760]   What did you do?
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:27.760]   Do you do the pecs?
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.880]   Because you got the glamour muscles working.
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.880]   Thank you.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:31.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.080]   Stop hitting on me on the show, dude.
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.640]   So did they brought you by Stamps.com.
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:40.280]   Hey, do you do mailing in your business?
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.280]   Who doesn't?
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.280]   Right?
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:46.680]   Even if it's just invoices brochures, maybe you sell on Etsy or Amazon or eBay and you got
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.680]   a mail stuff.
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:51.760]   You don't-- I get everyone someone help buy something on Etsy or eBay.
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:52.760]   This happens to me too.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:58.360]   They brown paper with twine wrapped package and stamps that are licked and there's like
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.360]   hundreds of them.
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:03.840]   Hap has to be placed all over the front and a handwritten address.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:04.840]   Now that's fine.
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.640]   It got to me, although sometimes postage do.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.360]   Sometimes too much postage.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:13.080]   Wouldn't it be great if your stuff, your packages looked as professional as the big boys they
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.920]   can with Stamps.com.

[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.520]   And we've been using Stamps.com even longer.
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:01.920]   All right.
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.800]   How many of you bought Snapstock?
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.200]   We had Kevin Rose on yesterday.
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.200]   He said, "I passed on Snap."
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.200]   Do you pass on Snap?
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.520]   It's not ethical for me.
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:12.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:13.520]   We can.
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:16.600]   I could, but I passed.
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.600]   So I think that...
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:18.600]   Why you don't believe in millennials?
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.400]   Sorry, I'm just kidding.
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.400]   Go ahead.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.400]   I don't see age.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.760]   I actually think that it probably will be a little bit like Facebook where you had this
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:33.920]   big pop, people got excited, and then they have a slow down earnings or growth doesn't
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.840]   shape up as quickly as possible.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.920]   It drops, and so maybe I'll buy it when it drops.
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.880]   There apparently, they expect as many as a billion dollars.
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:41.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:42.880]   Stop.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:43.880]   I hate to.
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.360]   I had all play video.
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:49.080]   I thought I had it turned off apparently not.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:52.560]   Apparently there's as much as a billion dollars in shorting going on right now in Snap.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:56.360]   There's a lot of people betting as you will that that pop will go away.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.040]   They were saying that they were going to...
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.240]   And you'll help me with this because you're the financial guy.
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.240]   Sure.
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.240]   Right?
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:06.200]   They were saying initially that the IPO would be $14 to $16.
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:10.800]   They ended up opting for $17, which means they took a lot of money off the table.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.360]   The founders each took $300 million for themselves.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.680]   You have $1.25 billion and $300 million.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.800]   Yeah, I forget the final number, but right in there.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.480]   Right in there.
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:26.320]   In the first day, they went from $24 a share, which means it was a lot of institutional
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:30.240]   and insider trading upfront right before they went...
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.720]   Well, you set up price...
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:35.000]   It's a big dance on the first day of the IPO because you sell the shares to the uneriders,
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.800]   you fill the book beforehand at $17 a share, and then the opening price is set by kind of
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.000]   a give and take, take place in the nasty...
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.360]   The underwriters, they got special clients, they got people they particularly like, they
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:45.760]   get, let them in on the deal, right?
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.280]   You and I are not going to get a lot of IPO allocation, I wouldn't think.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:58.560]   If you did, if you were lucky enough to, 44% pop by the time the day was done, $24.48.
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.160]   And I don't know what it is right now.
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:01.800]   Sharepress is when it's high as 26.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.520]   Made a lot of people very rich, including one parochial high school.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.520]   Yeah, I saw that.
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.880]   Which one was it?
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.880]   Well, the story is...
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.520]   In Los Gatos, right?
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.560]   Yeah, it was a Bay Area high school.
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.560]   Of course.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.560]   The story is that...
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:17.560]   St. Francis.
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:21.400]   Barry Eggers, you may know his name, he's at Lightspeed Ventures, they were one of the
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.400]   early snap investors.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:23.400]   They were the first?
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.840]   Yeah, they were the first, they made a lot of money, right?
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.320]   They had a really good one.
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:30.080]   They had a really 26,000% return.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:33.480]   But Barry spread the wealth because he's a parent at that high school.
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:37.520]   And the high school, which is weird, had an investment fund, a financial growth fund.
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.720]   He's the chairman and he said, "Hey, I can get you in."
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:40.720]   I can get you in.
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:41.720]   Well, he still conned Valley thanks to Cheerio.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:43.160]   I can get you in taste to that.
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:49.440]   So they bought $15,000 in shares, which are worth now.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:52.120]   Well, they sold two thirds of them.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.960]   They got $24 million.
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:55.960]   That's a new gymnasium.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.760]   Did your high school have a fund?
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.520]   Because my public high school had like two pencils.
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:01.520]   I know.
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:02.520]   A loan.
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.520]   I'm not a Christian school, so I'm not.
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:08.200]   If they have endowments, though, they have to invest in endowments.
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:11.200]   So a lot of private schools have endowments.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.640]   People leave the money or whatever.
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.040]   It may not be a lot of money.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.040]   A lot of middle school had endowments.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.680]   $15,000, though, is not a huge amount.
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:19.920]   I would have loved to invest at $15,000.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:20.920]   They didn't even sell all of it.
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:21.920]   You know what?
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:22.920]   Hindsight is always 20/20 on these things.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:27.720]   If you put $15,000 into Uber or $15,000 into a lot of things, you'd be, you know.
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:28.720]   True.
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.360]   Alternatively, Clinkle or Washoe.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.720]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:32.720]   You don't know.
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.720]   Is it a Clinkle or is it a snap?
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:34.720]   You don't know.
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:39.960]   Simon Chu is the president of St. Francis High School, said, "Barry, this is the president
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:40.960]   of the school.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:45.000]   Barry now joins the illustrious list of individuals and families whose foresight and generosity
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.480]   have enriched St. Francis High School."
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:48.480]   So enriched.
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:51.200]   Did you come enrich my student loans?
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.200]   Come enrich me.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.200]   Wow.
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.800]   But that's actually not even the biggest take.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.200]   As you say, light speed did very, very well.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:01.680]   You know, if anything about light speed is a Jeremy Lu had a following out with Evan.
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.640]   Evan Spiegel, the founder.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.640]   Uh-huh.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.960]   And did not continue to invest.
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:11.280]   You probably have made a lot, scarily as it sounds, could have made it a lot more money
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.280]   if you could take a picture on it.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.280]   Wow.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:17.320]   Do you want to break down for us how that happened and the terms in like normal human
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.320]   speak?
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.600]   So, I mean, I don't have the article in front.
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:27.540]   I mean, I read it a week or two ago, but essentially Jeremy took the entire seed round
[00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:28.740]   was done by light speed.
[00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:34.900]   And he put some terms in it that I think gave light speed the right to, I think, block any
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:39.180]   future investment and also take 50% of any future rounds.
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:42.540]   And so what happens is- So they could have had more and more and more of snare.
[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:46.500]   Well, so what happens though is that when you go to raise more money, the later stage
[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:49.220]   investors say, "I can't invest in those terms.
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:53.300]   I need to be able to take 50% three quarters of this next round."
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:55.140]   I'm not going to give you money if that's the term.
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:56.140]   Yeah.
[00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:58.140]   At that point, it was pretty angry.
[00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:00.540]   And so they came to some sort of accommodation with light speed.
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:01.540]   This happens.
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:02.540]   But light speed didn't continue to invest.
[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:03.540]   And so-
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:04.540]   Well, it killed the relationship.
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:05.540]   It killed the relationship.
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:06.540]   It killed the relationship.
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.540]   Snap and light speed.
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:08.540]   So they got frozen out.
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:09.540]   I don't feel too bad.
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:10.540]   No, no.
[00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:12.940]   Light speed made $147 million on that one day.
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:14.740]   I mean, they did all right.
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:15.740]   Oh, yeah, they did fine.
[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:18.380]   But I mean, they could have made a lot more money if they hadn't been so aggressive with
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:19.380]   their terms.
[00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:22.580]   You don't bought half a billion dollars, NBC Universal bought half a billion dollars
[00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.580]   and stuff.
[00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:27.980]   This tells you why Snap is interesting to these investors because Snap is one of the
[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:30.700]   few vehicles that reaches young people.
[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:32.340]   People even younger than you, Alex.
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:35.740]   18, well, 18 to 35, but you don't use Snap, do you?
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:36.740]   I do off and on.
[00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:37.740]   Yeah.
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:38.740]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:41.660]   But it's really the '25, 18 to 25, I think is the sweet spot for Snap.
[00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:43.980]   SnapChat is a great app.
[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:44.980]   You use it.
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:45.980]   I do.
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:46.980]   I use it every day.
[00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:47.980]   It's my reality TV.
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:48.980]   Well, you're at a 35.
[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:50.260]   But that's the point is that you guys don't watch.
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:51.940]   You don't see that Coke commercial.
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:53.500]   No, I don't.
[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:54.500]   You don't see them TV.
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:55.940]   No, I see it on Snap.
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:56.940]   You see it on Snap.
[00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:00.380]   Every time I go through my friends and then I go through the celebrities that I follow,
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:04.500]   I get little ads after every one of their long stories.
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:05.500]   It's kind of nuts though.
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:10.060]   I mean, I remember when Facebook bug Instagram for a billion bucks and everyone went, "That's
[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:11.300]   an app for a billion dollars."
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:12.300]   It went crazy.
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.540]   Everybody said, "I got to do an app.
[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:14.640]   I got to do an app."
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:21.380]   And then what's app sells to Facebook for the equivalent of $22 billion?
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:27.700]   This is an app essentially that is worth even more than that.
[00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:28.700]   Well, what's that?
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:30.860]   34 billion dollars in market cap.
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:31.860]   Snap is worth.
[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:32.860]   Snap.
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:33.860]   34.
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:34.860]   That's interesting.
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:35.860]   It's an app.
[00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:38.340]   Well, it did $405 million in revenue last year.
[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:39.340]   Wait a minute.
[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:40.340]   Everybody always says that.
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:41.340]   That's what Kevin said.
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:42.340]   What revenue from where?
[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:43.340]   That's revenue.
[00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:44.340]   What was his profit on that?
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:45.340]   Negative $515.
[00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:46.340]   Okay, look.
[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:48.340]   So let's just be very clear.
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:50.620]   They even set in the process.
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:53.540]   They even said in the prospectus, "We may never make money."
[00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:54.740]   But that's an every single person.
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:55.740]   They have to say that.
[00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:56.740]   That's boy.
[00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:57.740]   Okay.
[00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:58.740]   That's like we breathe oxygen.
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:42:59.740]   We have two feet.
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:00.740]   You know, we might not make money.
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:01.740]   Just in case they don't make money, they don't want anybody to do it.
[00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:02.740]   Just like I said, I'm not soliciting for...
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:03.740]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:05.740]   It is backside covering for their lawyers.
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:06.740]   But you are?
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:07.740]   I'm not.
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:08.740]   Okay, but here's...
[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:09.740]   Just definitely not.
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.540]   Just say this Peter, and I may never make money.
[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:13.540]   Just say that.
[00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:14.540]   And yeah, no, exactly.
[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:15.540]   I like you.
[00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:20.300]   You know, in fact, when I was at AOL, I was in charge of experimental product development.
[00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:22.740]   And so I'd have these quarterly meetings with the budget team.
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:26.780]   They'd be like, "Oh, so could you project out your revenue for next year?"
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:27.780]   And I was like, "How about this?"
[00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:29.380]   I actually said in one of these meetings I got really fed up.
[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:31.220]   I was like, "Just take that number.
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:32.740]   Just pretend that you set that number off.
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:33.980]   That pile of money on fire."
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:34.980]   Because that's what's going to happen.
[00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:35.980]   That's what's going to happen.
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:36.980]   That's fair.
[00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:37.980]   That's amazing.
[00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:41.100]   No one can accuse you of over inflating your value.
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:42.100]   I don't know.
[00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:43.100]   Yeah.
[00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:44.580]   However, I know that's not true.
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:46.940]   I'm going to make a lot of money over here.
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:49.740]   Well, you know who didn't make money off this now?
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:51.100]   I will make no money at this table.
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:52.660]   You know who didn't make money?
[00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:58.060]   Chris Saka, celebrity investor, the guy in the cowboy shirts, he tweeted a picture of
[00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:01.060]   an email he received inviting him to invest in Snap.
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:02.260]   Oh, they just advised them.
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:03.260]   It's even more relaxed than that.
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:04.260]   They just wanted to hang out.
[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:05.260]   They just wanted to hang out.
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:07.740]   And he said, "Guess who didn't make any money in Snap?
[00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:09.300]   I didn't answer the email."
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:11.300]   But this is always...
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:13.100]   There's always things you're going to miss.
[00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:15.260]   There's no way around it.
[00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:19.540]   When Facebook went public, if you had bought stock on that day, you would do very well
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:20.540]   in that.
[00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:21.540]   No, but you would have lost it.
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:22.540]   Initially you would have lost it.
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:26.220]   And the thing is, so what Facebook was in the middle of at that moment was the transition
[00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:29.100]   from desktop centric product to a mobile centric product.
[00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:32.260]   And if they had flubbed that or screwed that up, they would be toast.
[00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:33.740]   That was the risk at that point.
[00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:34.740]   They made that transition.
[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:45.060]   And in fact, when I said the time was, if you buy Facebook, what you're really doing
[00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:49.140]   is investing in Mark Zuckerberg and saying, "I trust that he can make this transition.
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:50.140]   He's a smart guy."
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:51.140]   Is it the same case with Snap?
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:52.820]   You're buying Bobby Murphy and Evan Spiegel.
[00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:54.540]   Are you saying, "These guys are smart.
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:56.740]   I know that they're going to take Snap somewhere."
[00:44:56.740 --> 00:45:00.740]   Facebook had a billion dollars in profit in the year before when public.
[00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:03.860]   Snapchat lost $515 million in the year before when public.
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:04.860]   Well, and worse than that...
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:06.660]   It was 10 times the revenue it had.
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:12.580]   And worse than that, right before this IPO, the numbers started to go down as people left
[00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:14.940]   Snap to go to Instagram or growth slowed.
[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:15.940]   The numbers didn't go down the growth.
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:18.140]   The numbers did not go down, but the growth that slowed a lot.
[00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:22.700]   The changes that they made to Instagram definitely blunted their growth.
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:27.580]   I think that, again, it's one of these things that's really hard to say where this goes.
[00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:36.220]   I do think that there is, in a way, a lot of people have an incentive for Snapchat to
[00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:41.900]   become successful, as if for no other reason, is a counterweight to Facebook.
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:43.140]   Now whether that happens, I don't know.
[00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:44.620]   It's a counterweight to Facebook.
[00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:45.620]   What do you mean by that?
[00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:48.220]   Facebook has a monopoly on distribution.
[00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:52.300]   Not only do they have Facebook with they have Instagram and they have WhatsApp, they bought
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:53.500]   those threats.
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:58.260]   They tried to buy Snap to put multiple times, offer them a lot of money.
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:03.020]   And to his credit, Evan Spiegel said no.
[00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:05.700]   And in fact, they have a big payday today because they said no to Facebook.
[00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:07.700]   Yeah, I was trying to buy Facebook, right?
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:08.700]   Yeah.
[00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:09.700]   So many times, right?
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:10.700]   Yeah, I tried to buy Google.
[00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:13.100]   Hey, Microsoft tried to buy Yahoo.
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:15.700]   And that's what the future Microsoft didn't buy something.
[00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:17.340]   And it was great.
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:18.340]   Aquan to Nokia.
[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:19.340]   Oops.
[00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:20.340]   Now, let's go on.
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:25.620]   Ashton Kutcher rejected early opportunities to invest in Snap after meeting Spiegel.
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:29.420]   Part of that is a lot of people thought, and I tried to argue against this because my
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:31.460]   kids use Snapchat.
[00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:33.660]   But a lot of people thought it was a sexting tool.
[00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:36.460]   Oh, the kids just sending naked pictures of each other.
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:39.380]   That's why they like Snapchat because they evaporate.
[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:42.420]   And I knew even then there wasn't because I watched my kids using it and they said,
[00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:45.500]   "Oh, no, this is how we like to communicate with our friends."
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:48.620]   It brings delight into normal banal conversations.
[00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:51.500]   Like with developers and so forth, it makes just talking to someone a lot more fun.
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:52.660]   And I have to give credit.
[00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:57.220]   I do have to get credit to the team because they've kept it relevant and interesting.
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:59.580]   They've added those faces.
[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:01.780]   They've added the Discover tab.
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:03.900]   They've added Snap Stories.
[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:08.740]   They've managed to without killing the audience, which is always a risk.
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:12.900]   They've managed to add new features that engage the audience and kept them using it.
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:13.900]   Yeah.
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:19.820]   And I think long-term, if Snap is going to become a massive, successful, say, $100 billion or
[00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:25.900]   $200 billion company, then they're well positioned for the transition dogmented reality that's
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:28.260]   going to happen over the next five to 10 years.
[00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:29.260]   Very much so.
[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:33.420]   Better than anybody else right now, except perhaps maybe Apple.
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:40.260]   But I think that they've figured out a lot around designing user experiences that people
[00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:43.340]   don't even realize are augmented reality when it comes down to it with this.
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:44.340]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:49.620]   And maybe that's what the market's saying is they could be an early player in AR.
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:53.540]   I don't know if a lot of the retail investors are taking that long-term.
[00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:54.540]   They're not that sophisticated.
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:48:01.460]   It's a hitter of you, but to me, that's their path to becoming a really massive business.
[00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:05.500]   Do you think Spectacles would count as an early edition of consumer AR hardware?
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:06.500]   Nope.
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:07.500]   No, it's just a camera.
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:08.500]   It's just a camera.
[00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:09.500]   It's just an accessory.
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:10.500]   It's just an accessory.
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:11.500]   They're usually an intersection.
[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:12.500]   Yeah.
[00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:13.500]   They're testing the market.
[00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:16.340]   I think it was a little bit about branding.
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:17.340]   It was fun.
[00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:20.060]   It was brand-ing themselves prior to the IPO.
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:21.060]   Which it did very well.
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:22.060]   Yeah.
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.820]   I will say that one of the rumors I have been hearing is that Apple is going to juice
[00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:26.300]   something very similar to Spectacle.
[00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:27.300]   No, man.
[00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:28.300]   Now, come on.
[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:29.300]   That way.
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:30.300]   It's a really good segue.
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:31.300]   You've been listening to the Sculls.
[00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:32.380]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:34.220]   I think Sculls will get it done.
[00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:36.660]   Sculls, no, he was on two weeks ago and I have a bet with him.
[00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:42.100]   I said, if he thinks that the next iPhone will be clear and then I'm going to reality
[00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:43.100]   device.
[00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:44.100]   No, no, no.
[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:45.100]   Yeah.
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:48.220]   And I said, if that happens, I will buy you dinner in Paris and you don't have to bet
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:49.220]   anything on the other side.
[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:50.220]   That's never going to happen.
[00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:51.220]   No, he's wrong.
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:52.220]   Of course he is.
[00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:56.060]   Now, he points out that Apple has a whole bunch of people, a thousand, maybe a thousand
[00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:58.540]   engineers working on augmented reality.
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:48:59.540]   But what is that going to look like?
[00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:00.540]   It's not going to be a clear phone.
[00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:01.540]   Nobody wants to be a clear phone.
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:02.540]   It doesn't even need to be a clear phone.
[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:03.540]   What we need to do is a clear phone.
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:04.540]   I don't even want one.
[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:05.540]   It looks a little smudgy.
[00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:06.540]   Yeah, that'd be horrible.
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:08.860]   Well, where would the battery go?
[00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:09.860]   It doesn't make any sense.
[00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:11.980]   You hold the battery with your left hand, phone in your right.
[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:12.980]   It's fine.
[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:16.580]   I love it because Robert is continuing to double down and he said, my career is on the line,
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:20.220]   but I am convinced Apple's going to do AR this year.
[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:21.780]   What is Apple going to do, Peter?
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:26.820]   So from what I understand, what I've been hearing, that they will do probably some sort of dual
[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:31.260]   camera thing that can do some depth sensing similar to the Tango technology.
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:33.100]   So it would be like Tango on the iPhone?
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:34.100]   Yes.
[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:35.900]   Or be like any of the Huawei phones.
[00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:37.700]   Yeah, it's going to be pretty basic.
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:39.100]   It's like Pokemon Go, right?
[00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:42.700]   Where I have a Pokemon in the real world and I'm throwing a ball.
[00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:48.300]   Yeah, but with Pokemon, I mean, because it's single camera, you can't walk around things.
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:51.140]   There's no real shading or situation.
[00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:53.340]   You're not actually being situated within the battery.
[00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:58.220]   So this is more like HoloLens, a way to integrate digital assets into your room.
[00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:00.060]   You need at least two cameras to do that.
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:06.140]   But the thing is, in terms of what I was saying about the spectacles, the camera, that would
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:09.820]   be something where I think Apple would be again sort of testing the waters.
[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:11.340]   It's not a big business for it.
[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:12.340]   It's a hobby at this point.
[00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:13.420]   It would probably be a hobby.
[00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:18.700]   I have to say, nobody who uses Snap just quickly on that, nobody who is a Snap that
[00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:22.460]   I know really like you said, calls that AR.
[00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:26.820]   And I sort of, I see a lot of people coming over to Instagram and I'm just hearing all
[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:31.060]   this IPO stuff just makes me think of it's really going to Instagram stories.
[00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:32.540]   Instagram doesn't do what Snap does.
[00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:35.060]   It doesn't, but a lot of people don't want that extra combination.
[00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:36.540]   They don't really care about it.
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:37.540]   I don't think of it as AR.
[00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:39.460]   They just want to tell their story to their friends.
[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:40.460]   The filter.
[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:41.460]   I'm not funny at all.
[00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:42.460]   They just need to see it as filters.
[00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:45.100]   But the filter in the funny hat does augment your reality.
[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:46.100]   It does, but a lot of tech.
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:49.100]   And it is, but it's just fun.
[00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:51.260]   It makes it so much more enjoyable.
[00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:55.220]   But the user base, every time I use Snapchat, I never grin on Instagram.
[00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:56.220]   I'm like, ah, food.
[00:50:56.220 --> 00:51:00.820]   But fewer people see my snaps in my real life than they see my Instagram stories.
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:04.380]   How many friends do you think see your Instagram story on a weekly basis?
[00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:05.380]   You know that you get that information.
[00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:08.180]   Yes, you have, you can see how many people.
[00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:12.100]   So when I post a Snap, the most I will ever have, and this is going to say something about
[00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:16.060]   my metrics, please don't write this down, is I'll have 200 max people look at it.
[00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:21.940]   I'll get my snaps per snap for Instagram because I have way more people on Instagram.
[00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:23.700]   I've had a longer time to build up that base.
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:25.700]   I have a lot of people who have been following me from doing publications.
[00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:27.380]   How many Instagram followers do you have?
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:30.540]   I have at least more than a thousand.
[00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:31.540]   I have more than a thousand.
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:32.540]   Are you?
[00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:33.540]   Oh, that flow on Instagram.
[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:35.380]   I can easily get like 250.
[00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:38.060]   Okay, so you get more engagement on Instagram.
[00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:39.060]   Yeah.
[00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:41.980]   It's puzzled me because I look at Instagram and I don't feel like it's UI is very good.
[00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:46.020]   I don't, I don't see it as a, to me, it's not an even close.
[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:48.740]   It's close to compelling alternative to snap.
[00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:53.260]   And yet we see these, and maybe it's, maybe it's a misunderstanding, but we see these snaps
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:55.620]   growth slowed because of Instagram.
[00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:57.420]   Maybe that wasn't why snaps growth slowed.
[00:51:57.420 --> 00:52:00.260]   I don't, you, my kids aren't all of a sudden using Instagram.
[00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:01.260]   Yeah, no, absolutely.
[00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:02.860]   It's just an anecdotal thing I noticed.
[00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:03.860]   It seems reasonable.
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:04.860]   Yeah.
[00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:05.860]   But everybody said that.
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:06.860]   Everybody said that.
[00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:07.860]   I said it.
[00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:08.860]   I'm all right.
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:09.860]   Ancdotally, it seems like that.
[00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:10.860]   It's kind of anecdotal.
[00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:11.860]   Well, if it wasn't that was.
[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:12.860]   Exactly.
[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:14.940]   Well, if, look, if you're going to invest a snap or if you're, if you're a snap, you've
[00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:16.940]   got to figure out why is our growth slowing?
[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:17.940]   It's not Instagram.
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:18.940]   What is it?
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:22.940]   There's been 112% of their revenue last year on Cog's.
[00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:23.940]   Oops.
[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:24.940]   What's Cog's?
[00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:25.940]   Cost of goods sold.
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:26.940]   Cost of revenue.
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:27.940]   It's the first cut of revenue.
[00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:30.460]   In other words, they spent that much money to get less money.
[00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:31.460]   Yeah.
[00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:32.460]   Yeah.
[00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:33.460]   Just before staff and share base.
[00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:34.460]   But they'll make it up in volume.
[00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:35.460]   Exactly.
[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:36.860]   That's, that's back to the earlier point about Android.
[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:37.860]   Sorry.
[00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:39.660]   PC OEMs we had in about finding margin.
[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:40.660]   Right.
[00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:43.940]   Anyways, I, I'm glad they did well to kind of sum this up.
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:45.620]   And they're at $27 and change per share.
[00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:47.700]   Now it's up 10 bucks a share since the CEO price.
[00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:50.820]   So maybe we're all just big old haters.
[00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:53.260]   Some of Snapchat stars, there are Snapchat stars.
[00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:54.260]   Yes, there are.
[00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:55.740]   And I follow some of them and they're great.
[00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:56.740]   Like DJ Kelly.
[00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:59.420]   Oh, no, I follow Spencer Pratt and Kelly Oxford.
[00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:00.420]   Too very great.
[00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:01.420]   I should follow.
[00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:04.220]   Kelly Oxford is a New York best, a New York Times bestselling author.
[00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:05.220]   What's her book?
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:06.220]   She wrote.
[00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:07.220]   See, that's interesting.
[00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:10.220]   There's somebody who's in one six, she wrote a sitcom.
[00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:11.220]   She wrote a sitcom.
[00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:13.620]   She's very popular on Twitter and social media.
[00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:15.140]   And she's hilarious on Snap.
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:16.300]   So, so Snap.
[00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:17.300]   Awesome.
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:21.380]   And it sounds like a more intimate connection that somebody could have with an audience,
[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:22.380]   right?
[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:23.380]   Even better than Twitter, right?
[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:24.380]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:25.380]   Because you're talking to them.
[00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:28.220]   There's video and there's funny, you know, faces.
[00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:30.260]   You don't have to deal with trolls and arguing.
[00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:31.260]   And it's like a confessional.
[00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:32.260]   Well, that's a good point.
[00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:33.260]   Unlike Instagram, there's no commenting.
[00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:34.260]   Is there?
[00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:35.260]   Not really.
[00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:36.260]   There's something you can mess with you.
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:37.260]   It's really different.
[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:39.700]   Yeah, I turned mine off so only my friends can comment.
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:43.140]   So why are these big shots, these Snap stars?
[00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:49.700]   It says they're frustrated and leaving for YouTube and Instagram.
[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:55.460]   Like Mike Plattko, who had an sizable audience.
[00:53:55.460 --> 00:53:56.660]   He went to visit Snap.
[00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:58.620]   He was turned away at the door.
[00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:01.300]   We don't want to talk to you.
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:03.700]   And as a result, he says, well, I'm done with Snap.
[00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:05.420]   He has half a million Snap Chat followers.
[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:10.020]   You know what I don't like about a lot of these quote celebrities is they're hawking
[00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:12.020]   tea and clothes.
[00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:13.020]   They all look the same for me.
[00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:14.020]   It's all crap.
[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:15.020]   It's all crap.
[00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:17.900]   It feels like they're, it's just scant.
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:20.340]   It doesn't, not scam me, but it's kind of cheesy.
[00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:23.140]   How many times are you going to tell me to get a FabFit Fun Box?
[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:25.660]   You don't want a FabFit Fun Box.
[00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:26.660]   We'll never get.
[00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:28.220]   What is a FabFit Fun Box?
[00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:29.220]   Oh, watch.
[00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:31.020]   It's like, how does everything that makes you FabFit and Fun?
[00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:32.020]   We're only $40.
[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:34.260]   But I'm not a FabFit or for the rest of your life.
[00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:36.260]   No, I can't say those words on television.
[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:37.260]   We've seen this before, though.
[00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:39.260]   It's you toward women who would be FabFit and Fun.
[00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:41.100]   I want to be those things too.
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:42.100]   I just don't have any hair.
[00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:43.100]   It's okay.
[00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:44.420]   You will never be FabFit and Fun.
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:45.420]   Oh, rude.
[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:49.420]   You're flabby, flaxid, and flatulent.
[00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:53.700]   Now that box I would get, the flabby, fact-sident.
[00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:54.700]   It's pronounced flaccid.
[00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:56.060]   You're not even proud of the word.
[00:54:56.060 --> 00:54:57.460]   There's two things Leo.
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:59.860]   Well, flax seed is different.
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:00.860]   Flaxid.
[00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:01.860]   You say flaccid, I say flaxid.
[00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:02.860]   I like flax-sluings.
[00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:04.060]   Then I can make a probiotics joke.
[00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:05.060]   Yeah.
[00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:07.020]   This is the first time I've actually been burned on a show that I just kind of blushed a little
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:08.020]   bit.
[00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:09.020]   Did you blush?
[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:10.020]   Little bit.
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:11.020]   Did I actually get your face to turn right?
[00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:12.020]   Actually, you made it to my feelings.
[00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:14.740]   Let me just burn you a little bit more.
[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:16.700]   Here's how flaxid is pronounced.
[00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:17.700]   Flaxid.
[00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:18.700]   Flaxid.
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:19.700]   Flaxid.
[00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:20.700]   Flaxid.
[00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:21.700]   It's yours, your show, man.
[00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:22.700]   Flaxid.
[00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:23.700]   When you're flaxid, you know.
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:24.700]   Flaxid.
[00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:25.700]   What did I say?
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:26.700]   Flaxid, flaxid, and you're flabby.
[00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:28.700]   I really wasn't wearing my coat, but you sure right now?
[00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:29.700]   I thought it was flaccid.
[00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:30.700]   It's flaccid.
[00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:31.700]   It's flaccid.
[00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:32.700]   It's flaccid.
[00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:33.700]   This is a dictionary.
[00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:35.340]   It's pronounced flaxid.
[00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:37.860]   Do you trust Merriam Webster?
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:38.860]   No.
[00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:39.860]   I never trust.
[00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:41.860]   A woman named Merriam.
[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:45.140]   You trust dictionary.com?
[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:46.140]   Flaxid.
[00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:47.140]   Flaxid.
[00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:48.140]   Flaxid.
[00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:51.500]   I can concede that I was wrong about how to pronounce the word.
[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:53.140]   How do you pronounce it?
[00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:54.140]   Flaxid.
[00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:55.140]   Flaxid.
[00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:57.140]   I will say.
[00:55:57.140 --> 00:55:59.140]   I'm genuinely surprised.
[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:00.740]   I'm genuinely surprised.
[00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:01.740]   I'm genuinely surprised.
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:02.740]   I'm genuinely surprised.
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:03.740]   I'm genuinely surprised.
[00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:04.740]   I don't know.
[00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:05.740]   Do an Adleo.
[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:09.700]   After that, it's a hell of an intro right there.
[00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:13.580]   If only we had a Pfizer ad right now.
[00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:15.420]   It would be really good.
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:17.780]   I'm not even the age group for that one.
[00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:18.780]   Pfizer.
[00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:22.460]   You can never be too young for the little blue pill.
[00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:24.100]   Let me just tell you my friend.
[00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:25.100]   Let's take a break.
[00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:29.900]   When we come back, we will have more with this fabulous flaxid and flaccid panel.
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:31.180]   It is seriously blowing my mind.
[00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:32.180]   Not me.
[00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:33.180]   I've been expressing that word for that.
[00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:34.180]   You guys are writers.
[00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:35.180]   I have a master's in English.
[00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:36.180]   I'm really surprised.
[00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:39.060]   I think flaccid is a second accepted pronunciation.
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:42.140]   I am my parents are immigrants.
[00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:43.300]   I get away with everything.
[00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:45.300]   She's a gypsy.
[00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:46.300]   She's a gypsy.
[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:47.300]   Did you know that?
[00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:48.300]   Don't look at me and say that.
[00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:49.300]   I look over there.
[00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:50.300]   Gypsy.
[00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:51.300]   Listen to your style.
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:52.300]   It's Roma.
[00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:53.300]   She's Roma.
[00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:55.300]   Oh, is Gypsy like saying?
[00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:56.300]   Is that the G word?
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:58.580]   Is that a bad word for Roma's?
[00:56:58.580 --> 00:57:01.460]   If I say Roma, it sounds like you're a tomato.
[00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:02.780]   Are you of the Roma?
[00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:03.780]   Do you have a violin?
[00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:04.780]   Can you guys like?
[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:05.780]   Will you play for me?
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:06.780]   I don't like Roma tomatoes.
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:08.780]   Our show, we had a great week this week.
[00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:10.940]   It was so much better than this show.
[00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:13.260]   Watch this video and enjoy.
[00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:15.020]   Previously on Twitch.
[00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:19.620]   NASA is feeling a little Oprah Winfrey at the moment and has decided that everyone in
[00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:22.660]   the world gets a bunch of their favorite software for free.
[00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:23.660]   Flaccid.
[00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:24.660]   You get a global reference atmosphere.
[00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:25.660]   Flaccid.
[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:27.380]   For Earth, Mars, Venus and Neptune.
[00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:29.940]   You get an app that calculates the Boolean subtract.
[00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:30.940]   Flaccid.
[00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:32.740]   Watertight, triangular polyhedrals.
[00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:34.540]   We all win people.
[00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:35.540]   Yes.
[00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:38.380]   There was no NASA software under my chair.
[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:40.140]   The new screensabers.
[00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:42.620]   Hey, you know what you can make from crickets?
[00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:43.620]   You're blacked.
[00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:44.620]   Crissps.
[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:46.620]   These are made out of crickets flower.
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:48.620]   Crickets are all green.
[00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:49.620]   Oh no.
[00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:50.620]   They are so good.
[00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:51.620]   They're so good.
[00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:52.620]   No, you eat.
[00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:53.620]   I have more than you like some.
[00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:56.620]   A company that sells internet connected teddy bears.
[00:57:56.620 --> 00:58:01.660]   The only bad thing is after I ate one, I had a little antenna that started my credentials.
[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:02.660]   Totally exposed.
[00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:05.340]   It's like they had to tell me wipe the antenna.
[00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:09.460]   These pets do not use any pairing.
[00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:19.500]   Anyone within Bluetooth LE range is able to connect to a child's cloud pets and upload
[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:21.700]   their own content.
[00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:22.700]   Flaccid.
[00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:23.700]   Twit.
[00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:25.700]   He tested, mother approved.
[00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:26.700]   I've never heard of pronounced flax.
[00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:27.700]   I'm very interested.
[00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:28.700]   I'm very interested.
[00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:29.700]   How about, yeah.
[00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:30.700]   It's not exactly vegetarian.
[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:32.460]   I mean, what would that be?
[00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:33.460]   It's not pescatarian.
[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:34.460]   It's foggid.
[00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:36.460]   It's like a cricutarian.
[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:41.900]   Jason Howell has a look at the week ahead, Jason.
[00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:42.900]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:45.580]   Here's a look at a few stories we'll be watching in the coming weeks.
[00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:47.620]   It's kind of a slow week, I'll be honest.
[00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:49.540]   But here we go on Wednesday, March 8th.
[00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:55.260]   Google opens its doors for its cloud next 2017 conference with the speakers, including
[00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:58.580]   Sundar Pichai, Eric Schmidt and Diane Green.
[00:58:58.580 --> 00:58:59.580]   The event is sold out.
[00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:01.980]   So I really hope you got your ticket in time.
[00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:07.020]   On Thursday, March 9th, the Federal Trade Commission is hosting its third annual FinTech
[00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:11.620]   Forum, shining a light on artificial intelligence and blockchain technology.
[00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:16.420]   Then on Friday, March 10th, South by Southwest, is kicking off in Austin, Texas for a few weeks
[00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:20.220]   of interactive film and music-related panels and festivals.
[00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:24.100]   If you go, make sure and pick me up some barbecue and let Austin know I miss it.
[00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:29.020]   Also on March 10th, LG is releasing its next big flagship phone, the LG G6.
[00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:33.380]   But don't get too excited, it's launching in Korea first with a release in the US.
[00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:36.980]   Still unannounced, though it's expected to happen sometime in April.
[00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:39.180]   And I'm sure Uber will have some news as well.
[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:42.540]   Let's look at a few of the things we'll be tracking in the coming week.
[00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:48.620]   Join Meghan Moroni and me on Tech News Today, every weekday, 4PM Pacific, 7PM Eastern, here
[00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:50.580]   at Twit.tv.
[00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:51.740]   Back to you, Leo.
[00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:53.540]   Thank you, Jason Howell.
[00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:55.420]   Also your colleague on all about Android.
[00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:56.420]   It is my colleague.
[00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:58.220]   On Tuesday, 5PM Pacific.
[00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:02.020]   Or his colleague.
[01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:05.660]   We come to you on a 10-gigabit symmetric fiber line.
[01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:06.660]   Did you know that?
[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:07.660]   No.
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:10.580]   I just love saying that.
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:14.100]   The funny thing is I'll just do the fast.com test here.
[01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:17.820]   None of our devices, none of our switches, none of our connectors are more than a gigabit.
[01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:22.260]   But I am getting a 940 megabits, very close to a gigabit on here.
[01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:23.260]   Yeah, you are too.
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:24.340]   Fast.com, I'll tell you that.
[01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:25.340]   That's the Netflix.
[01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:27.940]   They connect to the Netflix server.
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:32.500]   Thanks to Sonic, the greatest internet service provider.
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:33.700]   Well, you're on a Mac.
[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:34.700]   What did you want?
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:35.900]   You're on Wi-Fi too.
[01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:36.900]   Yeah.
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:38.700]   I'm hardwired.
[01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:41.820]   The greatest internet service provider ever.
[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:47.420]   I almost feel bad doing these ads for Sonic because so few of you can get Sonic.
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:50.700]   It's really just a mean thing to talk about what Sonic offers.
[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:51.700]   Listen to this.
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:54.380]   They're doing residential and business fiber to the premise.
[01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:56.020]   Fiber to the premise.
[01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:57.020]   Okay.
[01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.780]   Now, look at this is the gigabit connect.
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:00.100]   We kind of went overboard.
[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:02.060]   But this is what you get with their gigabit connectivity.
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:05.780]   It's available in San Francisco, the North Bay area, the East Bay area.
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:07.580]   They are expanding fast.
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:12.580]   You get a fit, besides gigabit service, internet service includes 15 email accounts.
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:17.580]   You get a gigabyte of cloud storage, personal web hosting with the new domain, fax line
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:18.580]   service.
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:19.860]   You also get a home phone.
[01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:24.380]   This is all for one price with unlimited local and long distance calling.
[01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:27.820]   You even can keep your existing phone numbers and port it over from your current carrier.
[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:29.660]   That's easy.
[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:31.900]   $40 a month.
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:34.500]   $40 a month.
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:37.260]   Now think about your internet service provider and what you're paying for stuff that's not
[01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:38.260]   even as good as that.
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:40.580]   And by the way, no bandwidth cap.
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:42.340]   No bandwidth cap.
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:47.780]   And if you look at the EFF, they've got what five, six stars, all the stars for privacy,
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:54.580]   for standing up for their customers against governments, subpoenas and warrants, friendly
[01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:56.860]   local customers support.
[01:01:56.860 --> 01:02:00.220]   This is what every internet service provider should be.
[01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:04.260]   Sonic's customer advocacy is paving the way for a better state of internet all over the
[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:05.260]   country.
[01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:10.540]   And we've got to tip our hat to them and thank them for our amazing gigabit, 10 gigabit
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:13.220]   service here in the studios.
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:14.220]   Join the internet revolution.

[01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:40.020]   And I love giving them a plug not only because of what they do for us, but just because I
[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:43.140]   think they're really setting showing that you could be an internet service provider and
[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:48.540]   you can do all this and you can make money at 40 bucks with no bandwidth caps, which
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:49.540]   just drive me crazy at home.
[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:50.940]   I can't get sonic.
[01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:53.020]   I come to work if I really want to download anything.
[01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:55.300]   I would switch if they came to my neighborhood.
[01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:56.300]   Who wouldn't?
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:57.300]   Right.
[01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:58.300]   Come on, sonic.
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:02:59.300]   Who wouldn't?
[01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:00.300]   Do you have webcasts?
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:01.300]   Or you're in the city?
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:03.020]   Webcasts is not so residential.
[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:04.020]   It's only apartments.
[01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:05.020]   Partly buildings.
[01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:06.700]   Oh, Malek's always raving about his...
[01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:11.060]   I have Comcast like every other...
[01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:12.620]   Yeah.
[01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:16.860]   By the way, it's only going to get worse.
[01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:20.580]   I suppose we should do our weekly Adjut Pie update.
[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:21.580]   Oh, Jesus.
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:23.460]   He's trying to imperson him.
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:24.460]   He's a delight.
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:25.940]   He seems like a nice guy.
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:27.780]   He's just wrong about everything.
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:29.380]   All right, Gee.
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:30.380]   PBS NewsHour.
[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:33.380]   That's a good link.
[01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:34.380]   PBS NewsHour.
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:36.140]   Is that the one I should go to?
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:38.940]   FCC may scale back net neutrality.
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:39.940]   That's not all.
[01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:42.940]   They've backed back.
[01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:43.940]   Yes, I want to...
[01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:45.660]   Notice there's no auto play on public media.
[01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:46.660]   Thank you.
[01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:47.660]   Public media.
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:48.660]   No auto play.
[01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:49.660]   No auto play.
[01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:50.660]   Don't worry, Trump's going to kill everyone.
[01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:57.860]   They've eliminated the privacy restrictions that were placed late last year by the FCC
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:02.740]   on internet service providers protecting your data, protecting you against selling your
[01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:03.740]   data.
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:06.060]   I mean, it just goes on and on and on.
[01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:08.140]   I'm so happy to be protected.
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:11.380]   He says net neutrality is a mistake.
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:12.380]   All right.
[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:13.380]   Well...
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:15.940]   To quote someone else, elections have consequences.
[01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:16.940]   Yeah.
[01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:18.540]   Let's not forget.
[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:21.380]   Will, you know, what can you do?
[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:22.380]   Well, you can...
[01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:23.380]   I don't know.
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:24.380]   I read this.
[01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:25.380]   Vote next time.
[01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:26.380]   If you didn't vote, vote next time.
[01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:27.380]   Did you vote?
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:28.380]   He's Canadian.
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:29.380]   He can't vote for her.
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:30.380]   It's because...
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:31.380]   I voted for...
[01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:32.380]   What's his name?
[01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:33.380]   The handsome one.
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:34.380]   Turny?
[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:35.380]   No.
[01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:36.380]   Trudeau.
[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:37.380]   Thank you.
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:38.380]   This new goes handsome.
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:39.380]   It's Janrance.
[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:40.380]   Bernie.
[01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:41.380]   Bernie Sanders.
[01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:42.380]   He's flabby-flexed and flatulent.
[01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:43.380]   I'll tell you that right now.
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:44.380]   If you ever...
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.380]   Yeah.
[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:47.380]   Spend any time in the campaign buzz with Bernie.
[01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:49.380]   Do you have stories for us?
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:50.380]   Do you want to tell?
[01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:51.380]   Because that's even really specific.
[01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:52.380]   Well, it's 1843.
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:55.620]   And then we were passing back the first.
[01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:56.620]   We were talking about...
[01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:59.020]   Before the break, we were talking about Apple AR.
[01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:01.060]   We do hear a lot of rumors about the next iPhone.
[01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:02.460]   I don't know how many of them are credible.
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:04.180]   But one I really thought was interesting.
[01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:08.060]   And now there's being a little bit debated is whether it will have a Type C connector,
[01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:11.220]   whether Apple will actually five years in abandon the lightning.
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:12.220]   There it is.
[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:13.220]   So that got walked back.
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:14.220]   Yeah.
[01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:15.220]   Well...
[01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:16.220]   Okay.
[01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:19.060]   Ming-Chi Kuo walked it back saying, "Oh no, they're going to have Type C charging."
[01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:20.060]   Right.
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:21.060]   Fast charging.
[01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:22.060]   So you can go...
[01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:24.260]   I mean, that frankly would make more sense because Apple...
[01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:25.820]   It'll be USB-C to lightning.
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:26.820]   People...
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:28.620]   But there's nothing to say about that.
[01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:29.620]   What does that even mean?
[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:33.060]   Well, I mean, it does address the one can, you know, complain about...
[01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:34.420]   You could plug it into a MacBook.
[01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:35.420]   Yeah.
[01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:36.420]   So...
[01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:39.500]   So they're going to provide a cable, a cable which by the way, I've already purchased many
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:43.740]   times for five bucks that has a USB-C on one end and a lightning on the other end.
[01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:44.740]   That's not a big deal.
[01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:45.740]   That's not even news.
[01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:48.300]   So you think that was just a... a bogus story?
[01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:51.660]   Well, I think it was just... who... I can't remember the original sourcing on that, but
[01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:53.380]   I think it was just poorly...
[01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:55.780]   They misunderstood what they were saying.
[01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:56.780]   Yeah.
[01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:58.780]   But with Apple, you want to report every small tip that you get your hands on because it's
[01:05:58.780 --> 01:05:59.780]   so competitive on the reporting side.
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:00.780]   It was a small newspaper.
[01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:01.780]   Yeah, I bet it was.
[01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:04.520]   It's a newspaper called The Wall Street Journal, I think.
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.620]   Oh, I've heard of that.
[01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:06.620]   Smell the lady paper.
[01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:07.620]   Are these doing paper?
[01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:08.620]   They're out of it.
[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:09.620]   They're on an island.
[01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:10.960]   They're out there on the East Coast.
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.660]   I think it's called Men.
[01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:13.660]   Hah-tah-tah-tah-tah-tah.
[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:15.660]   I read the journal on print this week.
[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:20.200]   Yeah, it was, it was kind of the last paragraph of their... of their leak story.
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:25.040]   They said that there would be Type C and they didn't make a big deal out of it, which everybody
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:32.720]   who knows Apple and has iPhones would make a huge deal out of it because abandoning the
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:36.120]   lighting connectors so quickly would just frustrate lots of people.
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:37.680]   I would upset many people.
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:38.680]   Christina Warren, which is...
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:39.680]   Apple has courage.
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:40.680]   Don't forget.
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:41.680]   So much courage.
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:42.680]   Well, that's why it's somewhat...
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:43.680]   It's somewhat...
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.160]   It's somewhat credible only because...
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:46.680]   Do you know what Orela did it first?
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:47.680]   She says the right thing.
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:48.680]   Is he...
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:49.680]   Is he...
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:50.680]   As far as I know?
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:51.680]   It's...
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:52.680]   I'm just speaking the truth.
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:56.240]   iPhone 8 rumor is absolutely insane.
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:59.960]   And at the end, she says, "I have invested a not insignificant amount of money in lightning
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:03.040]   accessories and cables as is everybody who owns an iPhone.
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:07.880]   If the next iPhone really does have a USB-C port, I'm gonna have to laugh and then cry."
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:08.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:10.680]   So expensive to replace all those apples.
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:12.280]   Yeah, so that's why Apple wouldn't do it.
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:14.560]   On the other hand, if they did it, it would be a good thing.
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:15.560]   I would be happy.
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:17.120]   In the long run.
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.120]   Right.
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.560]   Because we have Type C on our laptops.
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:22.560]   We have Type C on every other phone.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.560]   And one of the things is...
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:26.720]   Is that gonna be your new phone?
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:30.560]   In Europe, there actually is a regulation around...
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:31.560]   There's a standard for...
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:36.200]   That's why micro USB took off because Europe in the EU, they said it has to be micro USB.
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:39.840]   So Apple has to ship an adapter with the iPhones there.
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.680]   That seems so top-down.
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:44.960]   What if Apple shipped a lightning-to-sea adapter and did change the port?
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.680]   Would that make people feel better?
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:49.920]   I think you would still feel a bit taken advantage of it.
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.680]   I'd find all this stuff and then have to use another adapter.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.680]   Because imagine how many adapters you'd have to have in your pocket.
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:55.680]   I think of all the stars that come with the plug-ins.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:56.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:57.680]   And those...
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:58.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:58.680 --> 01:07:59.680]   You can't really just update car designs very quickly.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:01.240]   That takes like two or three years.
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:02.240]   No.
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.960]   Well, every alarm clock in a hotel has a 30-pin.
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:05.960]   So...
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:06.960]   Oh my gosh, that's right.
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:07.960]   They still do.
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:09.960]   Oh, you mean you don't have the adapter on you at all times?
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:10.960]   Exactly.
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:12.960]   They just didn't want to buy you a new $10 clock radio.
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:14.960]   Oh, the converter...
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:15.960]   Forgetting the converter is worse.
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:16.960]   It's like...
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:17.960]   Yeah.
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:18.960]   I do that every single time I travel.
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:20.840]   You know how many times I've burned off my hair?
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:22.720]   How many times have you burned off your hair?
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:23.720]   Several times.
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:24.720]   Okay, you know it's a little weird.
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:26.400]   Maybe it's me.
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:27.640]   This is the article.
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:28.640]   Yes.
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:31.040]   It seems to have that paragraph missing now.
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.040]   The type...
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.040]   Where is it?
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.040]   It's in the middle.
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.040]   I won't look at the TV.
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:36.040]   It's in the middle.
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.480]   Look at it over your show.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:38.480]   See if you can find it.
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:39.480]   Because I...
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:40.480]   Look at the TV.
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:41.480]   Look at the TV.
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:42.480]   They said it.
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:43.480]   That's a different article.
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:44.480]   What are you looking at?
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:45.480]   It's down here.
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:46.480]   Oh, it's after the graph.
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:47.480]   Oh, I missed it.
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:48.480]   I stopped.
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:49.480]   Here it is.
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:50.480]   You know what?
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:52.400]   I need to zoom it in so I can see it better.
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:55.800]   They said, by the way, they're talking about people familiar with Apple's plans.
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:56.800]   You know what that is?
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:57.800]   Employees.
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.200]   Yeah, PR people who called...
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:01.560]   Because the journal does this routinely.
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:06.720]   If the Apple PR wants to send a triobloon up or warn people that we're not going to
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:09.760]   release this, they call the journal and they say, "Don't quote me.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:13.200]   It's on the background deep deep."
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:14.200]   But we're not going to do that.
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:18.000]   Do you remember they did this with the original iPad where they said it was going to be $1,000?
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   Yes, they...
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.600]   What is the Trump team's word for that?
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:22.600]   It was a...
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:23.600]   Alternative fact.
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:24.600]   No, no, no.
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:27.720]   They did this right before the non-state of the union address.
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:32.120]   They told everybody he was going to let people have citizenship and they said that that was...
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:33.120]   Why?
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:37.320]   No, there's a phrase for that.
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:41.840]   Anyway, they said Apple would introduce other updates including a USB-C port for the power
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:42.840]   cord.
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:46.720]   So that could be interpreted as you did, although that's kind of a trivial thing.
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:48.720]   They have a USB on the other side.
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:52.520]   I guess that I think it was either shoddily reported or...
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:53.520]   Misunderstood.
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:54.520]   Misunderstood.
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:55.520]   Yeah.
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:56.520]   Okay.
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:57.520]   We'll never know.
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:58.520]   Okay.
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:09:59.520]   Well, we'll know in September.
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:00.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:06.840]   Ming Chi Kuo, who is also a pretty good leaker on this whole thing, says, "No, no, no, no.
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.080]   They misunderstood.
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:13.240]   It's going to be Type C power delivery technology while still retaining a lightning port."
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:16.240]   As you guys said.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:20.440]   Well, hopefully it's fast.
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:21.520]   I'm going to buy it.
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:22.520]   Whatever it is.
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:25.880]   See, it said every Apple fan everywhere.
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:29.160]   To me, it's like the generic high quality smartphone experience.
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:30.160]   It's comfortable.
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:31.160]   It's like a Honda Civic.
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.160]   It is definitely in...
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.160]   And your two years is up, right?
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:34.160]   Because you have the older ones.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.680]   Yeah, so my two years are up in June.
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:38.160]   So I'm going to wait for the next one to come out whenever it does.
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:40.560]   I don't cover Apple, but it's going to be fine.
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:41.800]   It's going to run Twitter.
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:45.000]   Like my current phone runs Twitter and after a year and a half it'll start sucking.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000]   I have to admit, I've been here.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.640]   No, they're blocking Twitter, actually.
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:50.280]   Actually, because I'm moving over to Android, how y'all doing?
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:54.280]   I've been using the iPhone more, I have to say.
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:57.640]   Well, it's half and half now, guys.
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:01.280]   Yeah, only because like a lot of apps come out with...
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:02.280]   I don't know.
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:03.280]   I just...
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:04.280]   I don't feel strongly about it.
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.280]   I don't feel strongly.
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:09.680]   Android or Fire is there for updates, more security, the App Store is a little crappier.
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:10.680]   It's more work to get what I want.
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:12.680]   Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:13.680]   Wait a minute.
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:19.360]   There is a new story on this doc that we have in front of it says...
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:20.360]   It's "Slexid."
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.360]   Where's it?
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.360]   [laughter]
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:26.560]   Oh, iPhones are much more unreliable than Android devices.
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:28.200]   I thought that was a claims report.
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.960]   I thought that was a very strange...
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:32.120]   I thought that was a very strange report.
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.960]   I thought that was a very strange report.
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:35.960]   I don't...
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:36.960]   How do they just...
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:37.960]   Because I've used Android devices and I've used...
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:40.760]   When was the last time you used an Android device?
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:42.480]   Well, I just happened on my hand like 10 minutes ago.
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:47.480]   Peter and I are the only two who can speak here because we both use Android and iOS equally.
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:48.480]   That's fair.
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:49.480]   I carry both.
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:50.480]   I have them in pockets right now.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:51.480]   I think they're both equally reliable.
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:53.280]   Must be nice having pockets on your pants.
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.880]   Well, you know, I paid extra.
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:56.280]   Don't be jealous.
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:58.280]   The pocket thing's gonna be that way.
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:03.640]   Anyways, do you agree that Apple is less reliable than Android?
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:12.120]   So I have found that the most recent updates to iOS addressed a lot of bugginess and unreliable.
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:13.120]   Okay.
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:18.160]   Certainly the random restarts and things like that have gone down.
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:21.800]   But there was a good six or seven months where the iPhone was...
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:23.520]   My iPhone was remarkably unstable.
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:24.520]   It would re-spring.
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:26.600]   There were periods of time when it would re-spring.
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:27.960]   Not restart, but re-spring.
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:29.080]   It looks like a restart.
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:35.160]   But what happens is the springboard, the user interface, program crashes, university crashes.
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:36.520]   But it's not like a full restart.
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:40.680]   You don't get the white Apple and you have to wait a minute while it's starting.
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.600]   There was a period of time when that a lot of that happened.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:44.880]   But that seemed like a minor.
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:50.600]   Well, I did say the most unreliable iPhone is the iPhone 6 with a failure rate of 16%.
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.520]   Well, that's the battery problem, right?
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:55.240]   With the iPhone 6s and 5s close behind with an 8% failure rate.
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:56.240]   It's like a hardware failure.
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:57.920]   Well, I had a success with the battery issue.
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:58.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:12:59.920]   And I had to swap on my battery.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:00.920]   Interesting.
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:01.920]   Apple recalled a lot of 6s.
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:06.680]   Only 3% failure on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which includes battery drain WiFi connectivity
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:07.680]   Bluetooth touch screen.
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:12.840]   That's actually impressive when you sell 74 million devices.
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:19.600]   But even with 3% failure rate of 3% times 74 is millions of devices, right?
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:22.920]   So on my iPhone 6, I have AirPods and I loved them when I got them.
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:26.000]   And now my iPhone has gotten 2.22 million devices.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   I just be exact.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000]   Okay.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   No, you're playing like you.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000]   AirPods.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000]   I don't have enough.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000]   It was from, if I have AirPods and from my hand to my ears, it can no longer connect
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   to them.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000]   I have lots and problems with the AirPods.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000]   Great.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.680]   I can walk around and within two weeks is really falling apart.
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:41.240]   Sounds like a personal problem.
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:42.240]   Maybe it's the user error.
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:43.480]   I'm just saying I was happier.
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:47.840]   No, I have dropped calls a lot on my iPhone, but I think it's because it's using Wi-Fi
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:50.040]   calling and that may be T-motor for me.
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.040]   I don't know.
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:56.040]   Samsung tops the unreliability charts with a 16% failure rate given that it is the biggest
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:57.040]   Android vendor.
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:59.320]   Including exploding Note 7 in that number.
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:00.840]   Actually, that's a good question.
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:03.960]   If you include that, it'd be 100% failure rate.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:09.760]   It is Xiaomi, Motorola, Sony and Lenovo with failure rates of 5, 4, 3 and 3% respectively.
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:14.960]   This is independent information from repair settings or something like that.
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:15.960]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:18.360]   ZDNet reported on it.
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:19.360]   Okay.
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:22.480]   One-co technology group independent.
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:23.480]   You can believe Blanco.
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:26.920]   Very good link was in there.
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:28.960]   You can't go wrong.
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:31.040]   Our show today, oh, you know what I cooked last night?
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:33.120]   It was so good.
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:38.600]   It was a Japanese barbecue sauce on chicken.
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:39.600]   And then I can't remember.
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:41.720]   It was like yaki nuki sauce or something.
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:43.240]   I'd never had it before.
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:47.080]   And then I used something called mirin, I think mirin, which was a rice vinegar.
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:50.400]   And then I shredded carrots and I marinated the, I'm talking about my blue apron.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:51.560]   And I've got blue apron tonight.
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:54.720]   I think we're going to do a teriyaki salmon.
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:57.200]   Blue apron is awesome.
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:00.800]   It's been kind of one of my New Year's resolutions to not eat out so much.
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:01.800]   Lots of calories eating out.
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:03.520]   I was like, you know, you get the bread.
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:04.520]   You can't say no.
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:05.520]   You eat the bread.
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:06.520]   That's a mistake.
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.200]   You get dessert lots of times.
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:10.600]   So we really be trying to be good and cook at home.
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:12.320]   And blue apron has been such a boom.
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:18.320]   Blue apron is the number one fresh ingredient and recipe delivery service in the country.
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:20.320]   They deliver amazing.
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:21.320]   It's all fresh.
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:22.320]   It's uncooked.
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:25.800]   They're giving you the recipe and the ingredients to make an amazing meal.
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:31.880]   The house fills with the smells of ginger or shallots or saute and garlic.
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:35.720]   I made jasmine rice and they taught me a better way to make jasmine rice.
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:39.240]   Sautéed garlic and what else?
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:40.760]   Something else.
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:43.080]   And then I put the rice in and browned that a little bit.
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:44.080]   Then I added the water and cooked it.
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:45.080]   It was the best brown.
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:46.080]   It was the best brown.
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:47.720]   It was jasmine rice I've ever had.
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:51.000]   And so once you learn these techniques from now on, I even went on Amazon.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.320]   I boarded, ordered more of that.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.600]   It was a yaki nuki sauce.
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.320]   It said, "Japanese barbecue sauce."
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:56.320]   Incredible.
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:57.320]   Incredible.
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:59.280]   So you learn these techniques.
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:03.000]   You learn new ingredients and you're having delicious meals.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.000]   They have two plans.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.360]   One for couples.
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.360]   One for families.
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:07.800]   Family of four.
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:12.720]   Although we use the two person plan and we feed our teenager too.
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:18.600]   So it's generous portions, but they're delicious and healthful.
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:21.240]   And I always assume all this has caused me more, but it's worth it.
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:24.920]   Actually, you paid 60% more to grocery store because if you think about it, they don't
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:26.200]   have as much overhead as a grocery store.
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:27.200]   Look what's on the menu.
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:29.440]   Pork and cabbage tacos.
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:32.280]   Those look really, really good.
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:35.320]   With pineapple and pickled jalapeno salsa.
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:37.240]   Oh man.
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:38.680]   And you get just the right ingredients.
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:43.200]   So I got the mirin, which is a rice wine, a very good rice wine vinegar.
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:44.200]   But I only need two tablespoons.
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.800]   So it comes in the little bottle of two tablespoons of mirin.
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:47.800]   So you have no waste.
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:50.360]   There's no, you know, there's leftovers if you don't need all the food, but there's
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:51.920]   no leftovers from cooking it.
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:53.560]   You don't get extra stuff.
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:54.560]   Salmon.
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:55.560]   That's what I'm making tonight.
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:58.200]   Sam Pecato with Orzo and broccoli.
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:00.720]   Pork chops and miso butter with bok choy and marinated apple.
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:02.080]   We had some good bok choy less.
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:03.080]   And that was so good.
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:07.480]   I sauteed it in the pan with the yakanuki sauce or whatever it's called in the mirin
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:08.480]   at home.
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:13.200]   And marin, vegetable, chili and baked sweet potatoes with crispy tortilla strips, spicy
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.000]   shrimp coconut curry with cabbage and rice.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.000]   Look, here's what it goes.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.360]   There's no weekly commitment.
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.960]   You only get deliveries when you want them.
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:20.840]   You go to the website, you look at the menus.
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:22.800]   They only, they never repeat more than once a year.
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:24.680]   So you're always something interesting and different.
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:29.480]   You customize it, they deliver to 99% of the continental United States.
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:32.280]   Check out this week's menu and you're going to get your first three meals free with your
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:36.360]   first purchase and free shipping, blueapering.com/twit.
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:41.680]   Blueapering.com/twit.
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:45.520]   It's named Blue Apron because that's the color of the little blue aprons that the
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:53.640]   apprentice chefs at the famous French cooking steel school, the Courtenham Blau, wear blue
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:54.640]   aprons.
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:55.640]   Blueapering.com/twit.
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:56.640]   I love it.
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:57.640]   I really love it.
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:58.640]   We're going home.
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.280]   Lisa said, should we eat out tonight?
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:01.680]   I said, no, we got the salmon.
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:03.080]   We're going to make the salmon pakata.
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:06.120]   She said, oh, that sounds good.
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:07.840]   So hungry.
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:08.840]   I know.
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:10.920]   It's mean of me to do those ads.
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:11.920]   It's mean.
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:12.920]   All right.
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:13.920]   You wanted to talk about Spotify.
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:14.920]   Yes, please.
[01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:18.400]   Well, 50 million paid subscribers.
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:22.960]   It's weird because they just, their growth does not seem to be slowed by competition
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:28.880]   from Apple or Pandora or Amazon, which announced it's unlimited.
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:29.880]   You don't seem so--
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:31.320]   Oh, I honestly didn't say title.
[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:33.720]   Yeah, whatever happened to that.
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:35.120]   But they're doing a title thing, right?
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:40.320]   They've announced that they're going to do high quality music now for a little more money,
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:41.320]   right?
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:42.640]   They're testing $14 or $20 a month.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:43.640]   Yeah, that's a lot.
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:44.640]   Which I would definitely pay for.
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:47.120]   I'd pay for as well if I could have high quality music in my car.
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:48.120]   Oh, for sure.
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:49.120]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:52.360]   Now, Spotify's 320 kilobits, MP3s at its highest level.
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.400]   That's pretty good, right?
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:55.400]   So is this uncompressed?
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:56.560]   My ears are not good enough.
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:58.040]   Yeah, I can't tell it every time.
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:18:59.360]   I'm a big old music dork.
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:00.360]   So this is uncompressed.
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:01.360]   It's CD quality.
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.600]   I always, just to hear the difference in sound.
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:06.200]   Do you do this effect with your hands and face when you just--
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:07.920]   Oh, oh, the sound.
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:09.120]   You could just get a recording of--
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:12.520]   [imitates car noises]
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:16.400]   And play that behind your CDs and it would sound just like you're listening to a record.
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:17.400]   It's true.
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:18.400]   Hey, what do those mean?
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:20.200]   Oh, you weren't kidding.
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:21.200]   You actually do buy vinyl.
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:22.200]   Yeah.
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:23.200]   All that's hilarious.
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:24.200]   Like latest.
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:25.200]   Like latest.
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:26.200]   Okay.
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:30.080]   So you would spend $20 a month, both of you would, for high-fi.
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:33.120]   I mean, Spotify is the best money I spend every month, by far.
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:34.120]   I agree.
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:35.120]   Why is Spotify--
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:36.120]   It's got a weekly playlist.
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:37.120]   It's so good, by the way.
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:38.120]   Oh, I'll discover weekly.
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:41.440]   Every Tuesday, they make a new playlist based on your interests.
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.320]   It's never off the mark.
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.320]   Like I--
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:45.320]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:46.320]   Oh, really?
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:47.320]   Yeah.
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:48.320]   Are you sharing your account with the YouTube?
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:49.320]   Yes, that's why.
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:50.320]   No?
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:52.680]   No, actually, I have the family plan where I have a separate account for--
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:55.440]   I got one just for the Sonos.
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:56.600]   I did get for a while.
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:58.200]   It's a lot of country music, first.
[01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:02.680]   And then all of a sudden, it was all piano, classical piano, like 18 different kinds of
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:03.680]   moonlight sonata.
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:05.160]   So every once in a while, I'll discover weekly.
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:06.160]   Depends.
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:07.160]   I'm a very-- I mean, I guess I'm limited.
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:08.160]   I quit.
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.160]   You just stick to a certain genre.
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:10.160]   I quit.
[01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:11.160]   I quit Spotify.
[01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:12.160]   Wait, where'd you go?
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:13.160]   Wait, you switched.
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:14.160]   I switched.
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:15.160]   Two.
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:17.280]   Well, I already had Google Music.
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.280]   Google All Access or whatever they call it.
[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:19.280]   Google Play Music.
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:20.280]   I walked out of it.
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:21.280]   Anyway.
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:22.280]   You're locked out of it?
[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:23.280]   Did you try to cheat them?
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:24.280]   She broke out of the campus again.
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:25.280]   We'll have 50 devices on my account.
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:26.280]   Oh, yeah, you're not allowed to do that.
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:27.520]   I just have never called Google.
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:28.520]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:29.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:30.520]   Yeah.
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:34.320]   And then I-- because I have an Amazon Echo, I decided to get the Amazon Unlimited.
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:35.320]   Yeah.
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:36.320]   And that's cheap.
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:37.320]   That's eight bucks a month.
[01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:40.480]   And as far as I can tell, almost all the same songs on all of them, right?
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:43.640]   It's all roughly the same 30 million song playlist.
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:47.960]   You know what's really interesting how the music industry's changed?
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:53.840]   Because remember, it wasn't so long ago that the record industry knew that, well, we're
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:55.320]   going to have two good songs in this band.
[01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:56.640]   Let's put in an album with 10 songs.
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:57.640]   We'll sell them the album.
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:20:58.640]   We'll make more money.
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:20:59.640]   Yeah.
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:02.320]   Then Apple came along and strong armed them and said, we're going to do CDs.
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:03.840]   We're going to do singles for 99 cents.
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:05.880]   And the record industry said, no.
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:08.560]   And they said, and Steve Jobs literally said, I don't care.
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:09.880]   We're doing it.
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:12.400]   And was able to force it through.
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.680]   It changed the record industry.
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:16.360]   People bought individual-- bought a la carte.
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:17.360]   But they bought.
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:18.360]   They still bought.
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:20.800]   Then along come these streaming services.
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:23.360]   And I've got to think nobody's buying music anymore.
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.360]   Why would you?
[01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:25.360]   I just bought CDs.
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:26.360]   I got a good idea.
[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:27.360]   Why?
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:28.360]   I want to support the artists.
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:29.360]   And I realize that sounds like--
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:30.360]   That's the only reason.
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:31.360]   No.
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:32.920]   I'm not trying to be like a good person.
[01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:36.040]   But honestly, if I love an artist, I'm going to go see them live.
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:37.440]   I'm going to pay all the money to see them live.
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:40.120]   I'm going to buy their records or their CDs.
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:45.040]   Meanwhile, all the artists that you listen to but aren't like a fan
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:47.200]   are making half a quarter of a third of a cent.
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:48.840]   But I still listen to them on Spotify.
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:50.880]   Yeah, but they're not making any money on Spotify.
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:51.880]   Make better music?
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:55.960]   So Spotify now says it has 50 million paid subscribers.
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:22:00.480]   Compare that to Apple music, which is at less than half, 20 million.
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:04.200]   So I did the math on this, please, because I like Spotify a whole bunch.
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:09.880]   So they added 10 million subs from September 14, 16 to today, which is about 59,000 per
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:11.800]   day or 1.78 million a month.
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:12.800]   Wow.
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:16.440]   And then I averaged out their entire lifelong cadence from 2011 through 16.
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:18.760]   And it was $590K a month.
[01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:20.240]   But if you go back to just 2016--
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:21.240]   Do you have a graph?
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:22.240]   Can you show me this in a graph?
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:23.240]   Do you have a PowerPoint?
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:24.240]   Do you like math?
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:25.880]   I don't understand this.
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:27.040]   I am indeed a dork.
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:28.040]   Yes.
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:29.040]   That's what you're aiming for.
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:30.040]   Jealous.
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:33.200]   Anyways, the point is they managed to keep up their 2016 new paid user accretion rate.
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:35.200]   Their acceleration has been maintained.
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:36.200]   It has been maintained.
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:37.200]   Yes.
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:40.280]   So they're growing faster out than they were before, which builds really well for them.
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:42.760]   The problem is their revenue is mostly passed through.
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:47.720]   So by 85% of it goes to the labels, this is drive margin just on 15% that goes to credit
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:49.800]   card processing, marketing, promotions, and so forth.
[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:52.640]   It's precisely the problem all the services has.
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:56.320]   So Spotify needs to find a way to get leverage against the labels to drive a better deal.
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:59.040]   The problem is the labels bought part of Spotify.
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:02.040]   So now Spotify has to beat up its parents to get bigger allowance so it doesn't die
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:03.720]   before it can go public.
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:04.720]   But it can't--
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:05.880]   You know, the record industry loves.
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:08.440]   They love the idea that they own this.
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:11.680]   And at any point they could choke it off.
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:16.040]   If they use it as long as they get some value out of it, maybe there's promotional value,
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:20.720]   but there's unlike Apple, which they cannot control, they control--
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:21.720]   Spotify.
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:22.720]   Spotify.
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:27.480]   And this is the problem that all the-- in my opinion, I've said this before, none of
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:32.800]   these independents have a chance because Apple, Amazon, and Google don't need the revenue
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:34.400]   from their music services.
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:36.840]   It's incidental revenue and criminal revenue.
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:39.040]   They can keep it going for other reasons.
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:44.440]   Spotify, Pandora, title, they're living on the scraps the music industry allows them.
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:47.360]   And at any point, the music industry could say that's it.
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:48.360]   Yeah.
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:49.360]   It's built--
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:50.360]   It's built like airlines.
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:52.360]   Like none of the airlines really make any money.
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:54.360]   Well, how do they live?
[01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:57.120]   They all kind of barely scrape by.
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:58.120]   I love hearing that.
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:01.600]   Oh, transportation I rely on is just really scrape by.
[01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:02.600]   But it's true.
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:03.600]   Oh wait, that's Bart, too.
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:04.600]   It's true.
[01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:05.600]   Wait, no.
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:08.440]   Southwest had $522 million in that income lost quarter.
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:09.440]   Wow.
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:10.440]   But it's insane.
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:11.440]   But it's insane.
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:12.440]   They don't compare it to the $5 billion.
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:13.440]   But they're not like big--
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:14.440]   They're not Google.
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:15.440]   All right.
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:17.200]   But there's only one Google.
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:20.080]   I'm saying compared to the size of the airline industry, though.
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:22.160]   I mean, short.
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:26.520]   Did you see that Spotify is trying to get into original podcasts, by the way, speaking
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:27.520]   of--
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:28.520]   Well, if an airline is trying to--
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:33.560]   No, this is actually, though, exactly how all of these companies are responding is--
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:34.560]   And even Audible's doing this--
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:35.560]   Yes.
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:38.560]   --is they're saying, if we create our own content, then we're not behold of the record
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:40.680]   industry, the publishers.
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:46.520]   And maybe we can somehow get a grasp on this business, make some money if we create our
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:47.520]   own original content.
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:49.760]   Which is why Facebook is getting into TV-style content, right?
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:50.760]   Yeah.
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:51.760]   I mean, everyone's doing this.
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:52.760]   Facebook doesn't have the challenge these companies do.
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:56.400]   They need a revenue source that isn't controlled by the music industry.
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:57.400]   Yeah.
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:24:58.400]   And also can drive differentiation between them and--
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:00.200]   They want a 30 million track.
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:01.200]   They're all the same.
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:04.760]   If you're a Spotify, and you can say the only place to have the Metallica record, kind
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:05.760]   of how titles be using--
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:06.760]   Yeah.
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:07.760]   --it's the title is tried to do this.
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:08.760]   Exactly.
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:11.240]   But Spotify has more clout, I think, and more total heft than title is by a factor of
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:12.240]   probably about eight.
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:15.680]   They have the same issue, though, because there's-- who clog trolls who gets exclusives,
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:16.680]   the record industry?
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:17.680]   Right.
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:18.680]   Right.
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.440]   Once again, they're completely at the mercy of the record industry.
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:23.200]   So how long until Spotify starts buying up independent labels?
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:26.120]   Do they have the money to do that?
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:29.920]   Well, they borrowed a bunch of money at a very, very expensive rate, as I'm sure Peter
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:31.840]   knows, because of the terms on the debt.
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:34.960]   If they don't IPO, the discounts that the people who lent the money get larger as time
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:35.960]   goes along.
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:36.960]   When does this--
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:37.960]   When does this iratch it?
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:38.960]   Yeah.
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:39.960]   When is the clock tick?
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:40.960]   What now?
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:41.960]   They have to IPO now?
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:42.960]   They need to IPO this year, and they can.
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:43.960]   Really?
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:45.400]   It's going to be very, very difficult for them to IPO.
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:51.640]   So this headline, Spotify now has 50 million paid subscribers, tells none of the story.
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:52.640]   No.
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:56.360]   This is a company that probably isn't going to survive 2017.
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:58.280]   Their article is about the money out of cash this year.
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:00.120]   It's super bad, but they will not die.
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:01.120]   They will not die.
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:04.720]   This company will zombion forever, because they condue between my wallet and the labels,
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:05.720]   and they own a piece of it.
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:08.360]   So you can't kill it, but it may not be healthy and it may not be able to go apart.
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:09.360]   Also a good brand.
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:10.360]   I mean, a lot of people know Spotify.
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:11.360]   I love it.
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:12.360]   Look at you guys.
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:13.360]   You love Spotify.
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:14.360]   I love Spotify.
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:17.160]   You guys, you evangelize for Android, because we're dorks for this stuff.
[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:19.400]   But I should point out, I also love Spotify.
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:23.520]   I love Discover Weekly, but I didn't love it so much that I wasn't willing to go to what
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:27.560]   is essentially an equal service, very close to equal service, because I didn't want to
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:28.560]   pay for three services.
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:29.800]   I'm already paying for two.
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:31.320]   Well, playlist lock is a big deal.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.160]   I have playlists that I've built on Spotify.
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:34.160]   Yes.
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:35.160]   I love to buy.
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:36.160]   Yes.
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:37.160]   But to me, that's a very personal thing.
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:38.160]   That really hits me right in my personal.
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:39.160]   I kind of miss Spotify.
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.160]   I'm very tempted to rejoin.
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:43.920]   Well, if you just leave that Amazon business behind, you can come back to the cool kid table.
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:48.560]   I like how easy the offline feature is on a smartphone, because I mean, I...
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:49.560]   Yeah, it's huge.
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:51.400]   I can even use it on my Chromebook, which is awesome.
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:52.400]   Yeah.
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:53.960]   I mean, yes, I can do it on a desktop, but I just...
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:54.960]   That's a Chromebook, right?
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:55.960]   Yes.
[01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:56.960]   This is a Chromebook.
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:57.960]   Miss Making Sure.
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:00.200]   So you guys just want to talk about this just because you love Spotify.
[01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:01.200]   That's so cute.
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:05.240]   I mean, we can't be cynical and horrible about everything.
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:06.240]   Just most things.
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:08.280]   So their growth is good.
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:10.720]   But growth means nothing if you don't make any money.
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:13.680]   Just like when Snapchat makes more revenue, because this is more money.
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:14.680]   Yeah.
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:15.680]   This is a similar...
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:17.920]   Snapchat also drying develop its own original content.
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:22.840]   The original content push right now is a facet of the broader platform wars we're seeing
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:23.840]   among the major tech companies.
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:27.120]   I have my own original content coming out soon, and I mean everybody's got original content.
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:29.120]   You have original content?
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:30.120]   I mean...
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:32.760]   Jinx, yo me a cook.
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:34.320]   I come here too much, I think.
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:36.320]   Anyways, what's your original content flow?
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:39.640]   You know, it's me.
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:40.640]   I'm my original content.
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:43.400]   My original content is coming out of her mouth right now.
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:44.400]   This guy is exactly...
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:45.400]   You're experiencing it.
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:47.160]   This wasn't derivative dribbled then.
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:48.160]   Okay.
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:49.160]   That's what I mean.
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:50.440]   Is anybody can make original content now?
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:51.840]   I mean, we mean...
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:52.840]   Come on.
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:53.840]   You know what I mean.
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:58.520]   Stranger things was original content to a higher level.
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:27:59.520]   Right, yes.
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:00.520]   Stuff that drives conversation.
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:03.000]   It came out through us for HBO and so forth.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000]   You know, premiere...
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000]   Oh, you mean exclusive content.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.000]   It's what you mean.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000]   Essentially, it's original content.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000]   Yeah.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000]   Exactly.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.000]   But that's what could happen with Spotify.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.040]   They get all these like Bieber wannabes who get on YouTube and they get all popular and
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:16.520]   they go, "You know, that's the model they should emulate.
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:21.240]   They just look at what how YouTube made it because nobody signed it YouTube, right?
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:22.720]   But YouTube has its own star.
[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:28.320]   So Spotify needs become the YouTube for music, but guess who's already doing that SoundCloud?
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:29.880]   Can they beat SoundCloud at its end?
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:30.880]   I think that's the plan.
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:32.720]   If anything, SoundCloud's going to go on a business.
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:34.520]   They're struggling too.
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:35.520]   Yeah.
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:36.520]   All right.
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:38.320]   Spotify acquires SoundCloud and builds...
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:39.320]   They've talked.
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:40.320]   They know that they were...
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:42.000]   They have been in conversations.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.720]   I don't think that that deal is going to happen.
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:45.960]   Which is a bummer because that would be great for...
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:48.480]   I mean, I love the stuff that's on SoundCloud.
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:49.480]   I want to have that experience.
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:52.080]   Is that the name of your exclusive kind of go with the flow?
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:53.080]   It should be.
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:54.080]   It's really good.
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:55.080]   Yeah.
[01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:56.080]   The SoundCloud loses a ton of money too.
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:58.880]   They're actually there in worse shape than those Spotify is.
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:28:59.880]   Pandora.
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:00.880]   SoundCloud.
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:04.160]   So from what I understand, Vivo, someone just went into the chat room.
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:09.440]   I heard that for every dollar that they take in and revenue, $100, $5 has to be paid out
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:10.440]   in royalties.
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:11.440]   Yeah.
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:12.440]   See, that's not a sample.
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:13.440]   It's just $1.50.
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:14.440]   No, $1.05.
[01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:16.440]   That's not as bad.
[01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:17.440]   But they have like the...
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:18.440]   It snaps going publically.
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:21.040]   But Spotify, it's like 85 cents at every dollar.
[01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:22.040]   But with Vivo, they actually...
[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:23.040]   They're negative.
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.040]   They're negative.
[01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:25.040]   That's gone.
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:26.040]   That doesn't...
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:28.040]   I don't know.
[01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:30.320]   They're operating expenses and all that stuff, marketing.
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:31.320]   That's on top of the dollar.
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:32.320]   How many of them are five?
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:34.480]   But you know why they don't care?
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:35.960]   You know whose owns Vivo, Sony?
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:36.960]   No, I know.
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:37.960]   And Universal.
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:40.240]   It's basically a record company zone it.
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:44.720]   So they're basically paying their artists a nickel more.
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:45.880]   To make original content.
[01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:46.880]   To make original content.
[01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:51.640]   Well, and the interesting thing is one reason that Apple was able to do the iTunes deals
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:56.000]   in the first place is that the major labels weren't able at the time to collude to build
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.840]   their own digital distribution.
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:29:58.840]   Now they can collude.
[01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:03.240]   Well, now they were able to do it by having somebody else come along like Spotify and
[01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:07.000]   then make investments in it as part of their licensing deals.
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.640]   By the way, one more story, Ed Japaya, I forgot to mention, has said, "I am not going to
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:12.880]   review the AT&T Time Warner merger."
[01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:18.000]   This is actually a reversal of what candidate Trump said on the campaign trail.
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:22.320]   He said he didn't like the idea of the AT&T Time Warner merger and was going to turn it
[01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:23.320]   around.
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:27.600]   As soon as he gets in office, his FCC chairman says, "It's going to go through."
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:30.600]   Are you saying something that Trump said would happen is not going to happen?
[01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:31.600]   Well, yeah.
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:33.280]   Because that's never happened before.
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:37.520]   This is pie is all along said that the FCC shouldn't stop mergers.
[01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:45.160]   And I presume there is still an FTC or maybe the DOJ can get involved, but you're right.
[01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:47.240]   I think this is going to happen.
[01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:49.160]   I think this is going to happen.
[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:51.160]   We should just have her people with my answers.
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:52.160]   Well, just have her answers.
[01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:53.160]   It'll be fine.
[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:54.160]   Nobody's going to look at it.
[01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:55.160]   It'll be fine.
[01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:56.160]   It's just Ratchet P.E.
[01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:57.160]   Price sale ratio.
[01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:58.160]   It's Pocket.
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:01.400]   Yes, that was out of the blue.
[01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:04.400]   Mozilla, I thought, was an open source company.
[01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:06.240]   Pocket been shopping themselves for a while.
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:07.240]   Really?
[01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:08.240]   Years and years.
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:09.240]   I still use it.
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:10.240]   I never read anything I couldn't do.
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:11.240]   Yeah.
[01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:12.240]   Is there any way to make money in Pocket?
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:13.240]   You put ads in there?
[01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:14.240]   Yes.
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:15.240]   Do they put ads in there?
[01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:16.240]   Was there a subscription model?
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:18.080]   There is a premium service.
[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:21.240]   And I don't think there's really much in the way of advertising.
[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:22.240]   Yeah.
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:23.320]   But they raise way too much money.
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:26.440]   And then when they were trying to shop themselves for years.
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:27.440]   How much did they raise total?
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:29.680]   Well, I'm 28, I think.
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:33.760]   For those who don't know, Pocket is a way to save articles and read them later.
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:35.840]   It's kind of a read it later service.
[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:41.040]   What really hurt their business is when Apple built that into its own browser.
[01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:43.080]   I don't know if Chrome does that.
[01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:44.080]   I use Pocket.
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:47.360]   You can have a-- you have save to inbox and it sends you an email.
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:48.360]   Who wants that?
[01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:49.360]   That's how good it makes that.
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:50.360]   They raise Fortune B.
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:51.360]   Our IP Google Reader.
[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:53.360]   $14.5 million across three rounds.
[01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:56.600]   There's a $7 million series being in February 2015.
[01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:58.080]   So just about two years ago now.
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:31:59.280]   This guy is Crunchbase.
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:00.280]   Yes.
[01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:01.280]   You know, like you just ask him.
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:02.280]   And he knows.
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:03.280]   He's impressive.
[01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:04.280]   This is my jam.
[01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:05.280]   Financial.
[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:06.280]   You shouldn't be asking me how much money they raised.
[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:07.280]   Well, I thought you would know.
[01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:08.280]   He was testing.
[01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:09.280]   I was just saying.
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.280]   I was just saying.
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:11.280]   I was just saying.
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:12.280]   He specified pool of capital for certain purposes.
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:13.280]   Well, not for Pocket.
[01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:14.280]   Hopefully.
[01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:15.280]   Unlike NEA.
[01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:19.240]   According to the Verge, Pocket flirted with an acquisition six years ago when Everno offered
[01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:25.480]   to buy them, but CEO Nate Weiner rejected Everno's offer when it became apparent the
[01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:29.920]   pocket was likely to become a feature inside the bigger company's app rather than a standalone.
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:30.920]   That's fair.
[01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:31.920]   That's a weird.
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:32.920]   I'm going to tell you.
[01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:33.920]   I'm a Pinterest bought Instapaper.
[01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:34.920]   It's biggest rival last year.
[01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:35.920]   True.
[01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:36.920]   Yep.
[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:37.920]   And that was an Instapaper.
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:40.400]   So, you know, we're going to beta works and that was a beta work to the quarter.
[01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:41.400]   I loved Instapaper.
[01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:42.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:43.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:44.560]   And a good exit.
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:45.560]   It sounds like Pinterest bought a good--
[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:49.200]   Well, I mean, also because beta works was able to acquire Instapaper.
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:51.760]   They attracted pennies on the dollar as they said.
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:53.080]   No, I don't want to get specific.
[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:55.240]   Attractive prices are a great way to phrase fires in.
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:57.680]   No, there's a compliment.
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:32:58.680]   Attractive prices.
[01:32:58.680 --> 01:32:59.680]   When all--
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:06.760]   So, I'm not sure why Mozilla-- I guess you could have a-- Mozilla nonprofit or is it
[01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:09.320]   a-- I guess it's a for-profit company.
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:12.360]   This is the Mozilla Foundation, but they can still acquire things.
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:13.360]   They can acquire stuff.
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:14.360]   All right.
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:17.600]   Netflix has twice the subscribers as Comcast.
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:18.600]   Twice.
[01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:20.440]   They have better stuff.
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:21.440]   How about that, huh?
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:24.160]   We're also going to watch "Orange is the New Black" and "Stranger Things."
[01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:25.160]   No, Comcast.
[01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:26.920]   Well, you can't through Comcast.
[01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:33.280]   In this top 10 downstream web traffic, 35% of web traffic is Netflix.
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:34.280]   Wow.
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:36.040]   17 and a half percent YouTube.
[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:37.640]   So it's twice as big as YouTube.
[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:39.480]   I watched both of those on the daily.
[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:40.720]   You know what I don't see there?
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:44.560]   Amazon video 4.3% other, a big 4.2%.
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:45.560]   That's my question.
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:49.800]   All older person content fall into the other category.
[01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:51.240]   I watched Google Play.
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:52.240]   Does that count?
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:54.240]   Not quite what I had in mind, but we can take that.
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:55.240]   Interesting, though.
[01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:59.520]   When you are sitting in front of your TV, most people have Roku or Apple TV or some sort
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:05.520]   of solution, you can watch-- you can rent a movie from any of a number of services,
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:06.520]   right?
[01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:07.520]   Yeah, that's what I do.
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:11.240]   So you could do play, you could do iTunes, you could do Amazon, you could do Voodoo, there's--
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:12.800]   and then there's a bunch more.
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:15.040]   Do you have one that you choose all the time?
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:16.040]   You play--
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:17.360]   You always-- and why?
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:20.720]   Because it's integrated into my Google account and it works with all my different devices.
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:21.720]   Somebody told me that.
[01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:22.720]   We have a lot of sales.
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:23.720]   We have a lot of sales.
[01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:27.520]   Get on Google Play because then you can-- everything has YouTube and if you own something on Google
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:29.520]   Play, you can watch it on YouTube, which means you can watch me.
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:33.200]   And I have a family library, which I share with my besties, and we all take turns buying
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:39.000]   reality TV seasons, and that's how we get our reality TV without having cable.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.640]   Your friends sound a lot cooler than my friends.
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:41.640]   Which reality?
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:43.320]   That's a really good idea, actually.
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:44.320]   Which reality TV?
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:45.320]   Real housewives.
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:46.320]   Bravo, bravo.
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:48.480]   Because none of us have bravo on cable.
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:49.720]   That's the cultural channel, right?
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:50.720]   Bravo.
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:52.720]   Lots of operas, looking orchestras.
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:54.440]   What about you, Peter?
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:56.000]   Do you have a preference?
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.880]   So I have an LG--
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:34:59.880]   TV.
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:00.880]   --and it has--
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:01.880]   Smart TV.
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:02.880]   --Netflix and--
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:03.880]   That's the one with WebO.
[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:04.880]   WebO-S?
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:05.880]   Yeah, the WebO-S.
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:06.880]   It's actually a great TV.
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:07.880]   Wonderful interface.
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:10.720]   And it has-- actually, I know the guy who designed it.
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:11.720]   Really?
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:12.720]   He's a parent at my kid's school.
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:13.720]   Oh.
[01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:14.720]   Was he from WebO-S?
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:17.720]   Yeah, he came through the acquisition at LG.
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:18.720]   Wow.
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:19.720]   He'd worked at HP.
[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:20.720]   Small world.
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:21.720]   And then it also worked on the Pebble.
[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:23.640]   So he was at WebO-S?
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:24.640]   Then HP.
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:25.640]   No, no, HP.
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:26.640]   Yes, WebO-S and HP.
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:27.640]   And then now at--
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:29.640]   And then the Pebble to launch.
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:30.640]   Oh, OK.
[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:31.640]   Yeah, anyway.
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:32.640]   He's a great guy.
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:36.280]   And so it has Netflix.
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:40.240]   It has Google Play, and it has Amazon, and Voodoo, which I never used Voodoo.
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:43.240]   So I usually bounce between Amazon and Google, depending on availability and price.
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:46.040]   I know I don't have a real strong brand loyalty.
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:49.880]   I just-- it's whatever-- everybody has Netflix.
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:52.320]   And that's why you see 35.7% percent.
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:55.720]   Yeah, I mean, that's all the original content that people talk about.
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:56.720]   Yeah.
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:58.880]   There's a couple of things on Hulu that people start talking about.
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:35:59.880]   What?
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:00.880]   Difficult people.
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:02.800]   A lot of people like that show.
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:06.680]   It's probably with Hulu is the ads.
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:07.880]   And it's not so much the ads.
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:09.640]   You can pay for the upgraded.
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:13.720]   It's the dot-- you know, good at it, it's Captain Obvious ad, the same ad, like four
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:16.000]   times in the show, is really annoying.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.000]   Yeah, I know.
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000]   I wouldn't mind if we're four different ads so much.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.200]   But it's the same ad because they can't sell it.
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:22.200]   Yeah.
[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:23.200]   You can pay to get all the ads gone.
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:24.200]   Almost all the ads.
[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:25.200]   Yeah, that's what I thought.
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:26.440]   And show time.
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:28.040]   I have Hulu, Ultimeter, whatever it is.
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:29.040]   There's still some ads.
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:31.200]   I'd let my subscription lapse to Hulu.
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:32.200]   Yeah.
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:33.200]   I just didn't feel like I was getting enough.
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:34.200]   Yeah.
[01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:35.200]   A Golden Girls is on there now.
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:36.200]   Golden Girls.
[01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:37.200]   You have a lot more free time than I do, I think.
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:38.200]   Golden Girls.
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:39.200]   No, no.
[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:40.200]   No, no, no, no.
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:41.200]   You've got kids though.
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:42.200]   I have kids.
[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:43.200]   It doesn't mean I have free time.
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:45.600]   It's just stuff that I like to have stuff on in the background when I'm doing other things.
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:47.480]   He's trying to raise an unsecured capital pool.
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:48.480]   I'm not--
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:50.240]   I'm not listening anyone for anything.
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:51.840]   I said that carefully.
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:55.920]   No, but I think parents have a different set of time constraints on their lives.
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:37:00.040]   Here's the-- actually, this is a more interesting graph.
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:03.480]   The black line is total cable subscriptions.
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:04.480]   This is from 2012.
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:05.480]   Just going down.
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:06.480]   Slowly going down.
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:07.480]   Unsurprising.
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:11.120]   The red line, which is up, up, up, is Netflix.
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:14.600]   Then the yellow line is-- that flax it is.
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:16.600]   I knew that flax is a lot of time.
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:19.400]   And then Comcast is the yellow line.
[01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:21.120]   Comcast is flat.
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:22.120]   Cable's going down.
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:24.440]   It's not worth the money.
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:25.440]   Right.
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:26.440]   I cut the cord.
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:28.160]   This is a cord cutter's story, isn't it?
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:29.160]   Right there.
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:30.160]   That graph tells it all.
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:34.200]   It's a story of a giant corporation that's overcharging for things that you don't need to be.
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:35.200]   You know what's missing?
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:36.200]   You know what's missing in this?
[01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:38.200]   And this also adds is an amazing affront.
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:39.200]   Do you get to get to the computer?
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:41.960]   Here's what's missing in this.
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:44.040]   This is Comcast subscribers.
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:45.880]   But Comcast isn't stupid.
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:48.480]   This is Comcast revenue.
[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:50.240]   Because how do you get Netflix?
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:55.120]   You get it over your internet, which Comcast has slowly raised the price of, to make up
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:58.480]   for the loss in television revenues.
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:37:59.800]   So Comcast is not stupid.
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:03.480]   My Comcast bill is basically the same as it always has been.
[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:04.480]   That's true.
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:07.120]   It's to have internet and it's like $100.
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:08.120]   Yeah.
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:09.120]   Yeah.
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:10.120]   So you didn't save any money.
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:11.120]   I'm not saving anything.
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:12.760]   Comcast very cleverly orchestrated that, right?
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:14.600]   Because there's no competition.
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:15.800]   Where are you going to go?
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:16.800]   Yeah.
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:18.600]   And look, the people who run Comcast are not dumb.
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:19.600]   No.
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:25.920]   The whole thing about Apple and Apple TV, the reason why we haven't seen an Apple TV box
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:29.120]   that integrated with cable and all the things that they were trying to do is because Comcast
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:30.920]   refused to do the deal.
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:31.920]   Yeah.
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:32.920]   Yeah.
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:34.800]   They got everybody by the short hairs.
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:35.800]   Yeah.
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:36.800]   They don't need anybody.
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:38.160]   Quick break and then we'll wrap it up.
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:40.640]   We haven't talked about the Nintendo Switch.
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:43.640]   I think we should talk about that.
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:47.520]   Which of you are going to go round the moon with Elon Musk next year?
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:49.280]   I mean, I've been asking him.
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:50.280]   And he hasn't replied to me.
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:54.080]   The game of the year, GDC was this week, the game developers conference.
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:56.240]   What did they pick as the game of the year?
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:58.040]   Don't look at the notes.
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:38:59.040]   Think.
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:00.040]   Use your head.
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:01.520]   Use your noggin.
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:06.320]   Use your flatulent flaxid flabby noggin.
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:10.520]   Our show name brought to you by Zippracruder.
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:13.640]   If you wanted to hire a new host for this week in tech, you know what you would do?
[01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:16.960]   You would go to Zippracruder because I'll tell you what, let's assume the right, the
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:21.200]   perfect person to host this show is somewhere, not me, obviously, but somewhere.
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:22.280]   That person's there.
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:23.600]   And what job board is that person on?
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:24.600]   Do you know?
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:25.600]   No, you don't know.
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:26.600]   You don't know.
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:27.600]   There's hundreds of them.
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:28.600]   So here's the deal.
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:29.600]   You go to Zippracruder.
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:35.120]   One, since Zippracruder, it goes to 200 plus job boards and Facebook and Twitter and everywhere.

[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:47.360]   I don't want all those phone calls.
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:48.760]   No, you won't get any.
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:52.240]   You'll get zero because it goes into the Zippracruder interface.
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:53.720]   And the Zippracruder interface is awesome.
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:57.720]   It reformats the resumes to their uniforms so you can read them quickly and easily.
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:01.920]   You could set up standard questions, multiple choice, yes, no, even essay questions that
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:03.400]   you ask every candidate.
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:07.440]   You can then review those, screen out the people who don't match and then pick the right
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:13.080]   person fast all in that interface so fast that this in a few days you'll have the best
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:14.080]   candidate.

[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:47.280]   Game of the Year, GDC.
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:48.920]   And I agree with it.
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:49.920]   Any thoughts?
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:50.920]   Do you know?
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:53.320]   I'm a little out of the game.
[01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:54.320]   Never watch.
[01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:55.320]   Oh, I believe that.
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:56.320]   Awesome.
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:57.320]   Awesome.
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:58.320]   Awesome.
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:40:59.320]   Awesome.
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:00.320]   It's really, really fun.
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:01.320]   Well now I feel terrible for not guessing that because obviously.
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:02.720]   I was thinking for.
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:04.720]   I was thinking for.
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:07.560]   You know, they're great games at Call of Duty and they're great games out there.
[01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:15.600]   But Overwatch has combined the first person shooter with online multiplayer with fun
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:17.800]   and funny.
[01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:18.800]   It's engaging.
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:20.640]   It's fast paced.
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:22.800]   You could talk to people while you're playing.
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:23.800]   It's got all of it.
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:24.800]   People love it.
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:26.160]   No, so here's how big Overwatch is.
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:27.160]   I just saw this.
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:32.720]   I think it was Pornhub released their report for the top 20 most searched terms on Pornhub
[01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:33.720]   last year.
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:34.960]   Overwatch was number 11.
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:37.640]   Okay, I'm not going to say how I know.
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:40.600]   Which I didn't know that Overwatch porn was a thing.
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:45.480]   So what they do is they take the character.
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:50.400]   Some of the ladies particularly in Overwatch, well actually even the guys are, you know,
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:51.400]   good looking.
[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:52.760]   I'm not looking at you.
[01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:57.640]   And somehow people have figured out ways to take those characters and animate them.
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:41:59.040]   Somehow they've done it.
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:00.760]   And it's wow.
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:03.400]   I stumbled across it on the internet.
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:06.440]   On the P.G. side of things, I bought an Xbox this last week.
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:08.120]   And this is the thing I'm most excited about playing.
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:09.120]   Yeah.
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:10.640]   Because I want them to get in the Xbox.
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:11.640]   Xbox one.
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:12.640]   Yeah.
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:13.640]   Get Overwatch origins.
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:14.640]   Okay.
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:15.640]   I have a PC already.
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:16.640]   That's not the original.
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:17.640]   Okay.
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:18.640]   Well then I don't know if you get it.
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:19.640]   I think I have to buy it again.
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:20.640]   I think you have to buy it again.
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:21.640]   That's fine.
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:22.640]   60 bucks.
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:23.640]   Very fun.
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:24.680]   They've done a great job with it.
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:30.680]   So the number one game at GDC and that's like getting an Oscar because that's your peers
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:32.320]   looking for you on that one.
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:33.320]   That's a big deal.
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:36.280]   Now all it needs is an Emmy, a Tony, a Grammy.
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:38.080]   Maybe he got.
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:39.080]   J-J-C.
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:40.080]   Genes.
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:47.440]   SpaceX has announced that next year, no, I don't, this seems on the face of it a little
[01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:48.560]   difficult.
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:57.040]   But next year, they're going to fly two paying space tourists around the moon.
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:42:59.440]   They didn't say what the price is but I guess if you have to ask, you can't afford it.
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:01.480]   If this happens in 10 years.
[01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:02.480]   Next year, 2018.
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:07.360]   But I mean, if this becomes mainstream where I can like buy a ticket to the moon and I'm
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:09.880]   going to start saving my money and I'm going to start doing it.
[01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:13.840]   If I save my money for like 714 years, I can probably afford it one way.
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:14.840]   Forget it.
[01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:17.000]   The two who are going have already placed deposits.
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.280]   How dare they?
[01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:23.160]   We don't know who they are but Elon Musk said they will undergo fitness tests and begin
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:24.160]   training later this year.
[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:26.000]   Oh, you have to work out for this?
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.000]   Oh yeah.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000]   Like the Apollo astronauts before them.
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.760]   These individuals will trip on the stupid suit of money.
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:35.180]   No, the Russians have been doing the space tourism for I mean, was it like 10 million
[01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:36.180]   dollars?
[01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:37.180]   Yeah, but that's like a lower Thor bit.
[01:43:37.180 --> 01:43:38.180]   This is cool.
[01:43:38.180 --> 01:43:41.040]   No, no, I'm better saying but like if it's got to be probably what?
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:43.560]   It was hundreds of thousands of dollars to do it.
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:47.360]   I think it was the Russia space tourism was like $10 or $20 million.
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:48.360]   Oh, is that much?
[01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:49.360]   Yeah.
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:51.640]   I imagine that this is probably a 50 million.
[01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:52.640]   Yeah, Marshall.
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:53.640]   That's right.
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:54.640]   It's a $50 million probably ticket.
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:56.200]   Well, you got to pay for it.
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:58.800]   Okay, but to be totally honest though, it's a historical moment for having a commercial
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:03.640]   company do you know, if you're a multi billionaire, NASA pays the Russian.
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:05.200]   That's a yacht dog.
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:09.640]   When NASA puts an astronaut aboard a Russian space vehicle to get him to the space station,
[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:11.040]   it's $80 million.
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:13.360]   There you go.
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:17.320]   The space tourists paid $20 million for trip to ISS.
[01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:20.160]   I don't know why tourists get a cut get a big, better.
[01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:21.160]   Can I ask?
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:26.040]   Is anybody worried about the fact that you know, space programs, maybe Luz, NASA not
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:27.200]   really getting funded?
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:29.240]   Now we have space tourism coming to space.
[01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:34.520]   I think a lot of people say, yeah, I think a lot of people have long time said commercial
[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:40.600]   space is an alternative to be done hand in hand with government space.
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:48.760]   But for instance, if you could go to an asteroid and mine it, there could be potentially,
[01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:51.200]   depending on the asteroid, trillions of dollars in resources.
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:52.560]   There's a startup working on that.
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:54.040]   And there are a Schmidt is an investor.
[01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:58.400]   You are human rights violations than going to Africa for all of the planning.
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:44:59.400]   Yeah, think of that.
[01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:00.400]   Yeah.
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:04.480]   So in fact, Apple, Apple had to stop its coal ball operation briefly because they heard
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:06.840]   that there was child labor involved and mine in.
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:08.680]   No child labor on an asteroid.
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:09.680]   Hopefully.
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:10.680]   Yeah.
[01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:12.160]   But who's going to send a kid to an asteroid?
[01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:14.120]   What if you never don't like the kid?
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:15.120]   What if it didn't eat broccoli?
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:16.120]   It's a lighter payload.
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:18.120]   Of course, I said, I'll send my kid.
[01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:20.800]   But now we know we're going to be forced.
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:22.320]   My kid's been doing asteroid.
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:23.320]   What's your kid?
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:26.760]   But I asked her to mine and I feel like it's pretty far out.
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:29.600]   You know, I think it's as far out as you think.
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:30.600]   Calm, calm down.
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:31.600]   I think there are a lot of.
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:32.600]   We'll see it in our lifetime.
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:33.600]   Yeah.
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:34.600]   Yeah.
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:35.600]   But we're going to live pretty far, I think.
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:36.600]   Your lifetime not my life.
[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:37.600]   We are medical advancements.
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:38.600]   We're going to live for a while, I think.
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:40.480]   Yeah, Leo, you were born like 20 years too early.
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:42.720]   I know, I might miss it.
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:45.720]   So do not eat Nintendo Switch cartridges.
[01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:49.800]   I don't understand this, but then somebody says something this morning that made sense
[01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:51.440]   why this happened.
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:54.680]   And it's because just to keep children from putting things in their mouth.
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:56.920]   So did any of you suck your thumb?
[01:45:56.920 --> 01:45:57.920]   I actually.
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:45:58.920]   Or bite your nails?
[01:45:58.920 --> 01:45:59.920]   I had three fingers.
[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:01.400]   I was a three finger kid.
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:02.400]   Okay.
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:03.400]   Yeah.
[01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:05.240]   Did your parents at any point put anything on them to keep you from doing that?
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:07.640]   No, my mother would just.
[01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:11.720]   So I know a couple of people, Kevin Rose is one of them whose parents did do that.
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:12.720]   Oh, wow.
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:14.040]   It's Dennatonium benzoate.
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:17.640]   It's a bittering agent that's used by parents.
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:20.080]   You buy it and you put it on their nails and they kids.
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:22.280]   Oh, that's what's on those cartridges.
[01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:28.800]   And it was intentionally put their buy Nintendo to keep people, kids, from eating the cartridges.
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:30.920]   Actually, it's kind of a good.
[01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:31.920]   Yeah, I know it is.
[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:32.920]   It's brilliant.
[01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:33.920]   After I heard that.
[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:34.920]   It's a life hack.
[01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:37.400]   I looked Anthony's cartridge.
[01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:39.640]   And I never had so much fun in my life.
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:41.440]   No, and it does.
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:42.440]   It's bitter.
[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:43.440]   It's weird.
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:44.640]   He has the Nintendo Switch.
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:45.640]   Right.
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:47.160]   I don't know why I'm pointing over there.
[01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:50.840]   He's he's he's he's he's he was a little traumatized by the whole thing.
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:52.240]   I'm traumatized hearing about it.
[01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:53.240]   Yeah.
[01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:54.240]   It's pretty sweet.
[01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:58.440]   The Nintendo Switch we had a review yesterday on the new screen savers.
[01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:00.480]   300 bucks.
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:01.680]   Be hard to get it right now.
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:05.640]   I actually went out to eBay and paid a slight premium, $70 premium to get it.
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:06.640]   That's actually not that bad.
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:07.640]   It's not that bad.
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:12.680]   And you know, for 33 included the Zelda and a lot of people are saying this.
[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:13.760]   Now I never played Zelda.
[01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:14.760]   You didn't either.
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:19.120]   You were a Mario kid, but I'm told this is the best Zelda ever.
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:20.120]   And that's what sent me.
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:21.120]   That's a pretty high bar.
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:22.120]   That's a very high.
[01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:25.120]   That's insane in the membrane.
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:26.480]   Is it insane in the membrane?
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:28.480]   Can we gift that?
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:32.160]   The sound just for my own personal documentation.
[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:33.560]   That'll be a good thing.
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:34.560]   I can't do that sound.
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:38.360]   Is there anything really insane in the membrane?
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:41.080]   It's such a Zelda, such a popular franchise.
[01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:43.440]   I mean, it's such a long standing franchise.
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:45.680]   I went to the symphony and made me cry.
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:46.840]   They played Zelda.
[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:48.000]   I've never played Zelda.
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:49.720]   You never played Zelda at all?
[01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:50.720]   No.
[01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:52.240]   I hadn't until yesterday.
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:53.240]   What's wrong with y'all?
[01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:54.240]   But I played it a little bit on the Switch and it was neat.
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:55.240]   My parents and my parents.
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:57.920]   You guys know the convoy truck anthem and you haven't played Zelda?
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:47:58.920]   It was the same thing.
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:01.480]   I mean, I thought that I was the one who was like the weird at the table, but y'all are
[01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:02.480]   broken inside.
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:03.480]   Broken.
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:06.560]   Anyway, I am now very bullish on this.
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:11.680]   The problem is Nintendo like Apple and Google and so many other companies can't seem to
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:12.680]   make enough of them.
[01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:13.680]   What's going on?
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:16.640]   Why is it so hard to make enough to fill demand?
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:21.600]   Every person who comes to the game stop and says you have the Switch and you go no and
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:24.560]   they walk away is $300 out the window.
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:25.560]   Why is this happening?
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:29.560]   Isn't it like what Snapchat did with the spectacles and make up, you know?
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:30.560]   Oh, it shows intentional.
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:31.560]   I don't think it's intentional.
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:32.560]   I know.
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:35.560]   You do artificial supply constraints when you want to use the product for branding purposes
[01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:37.560]   and not to drive revenue and use the volume.
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:38.960]   Ergo now.
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:41.040]   So they would like to sell more switches.
[01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:42.440]   Why can't what's the problem?
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:43.880]   They're bad at their jobs.
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:45.800]   No, but not bad.
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:46.800]   Google's not bad.
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:49.960]   No, but first you can get a pixel to save your life.
[01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:50.960]   True.
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:55.160]   After Samsung made bon phones and Apple's had supply chain issues around some of its
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:56.160]   air pods.
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:48:58.160]   I think might not have ever been shipped for.
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:00.160]   I mean, it was looking really bad.
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:04.720]   I mean, these things happen, you know, without having looked into it.
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:07.880]   I mean, it's possible that there's some things to play constraints around like the display
[01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:09.080]   or around the chip or something.
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:11.240]   They're using a tagry, I think, on this.
[01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:16.840]   It's basically, I was told by our reviewer, John Davison from It's the Rolling Stones
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:25.240]   Gaming thing Glixol that it's, I was so busy remembering his name in magazine.
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:26.240]   I can't remember his website.
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:28.120]   I can't remember what we were talking about.
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:29.120]   What were we talking about?
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:31.800]   Oh, it's the same as an Nvidia Shield, basically.
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:36.400]   It's very similar to an Nvidia Shield in hardware, except it's not running Android
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:37.760]   as the Shield is.
[01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:39.760]   It's running a very stripped down OS.
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:41.640]   There's hardly any interface on it at all.
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:43.840]   Sometimes you also think you'll sell fewer than you actually will.
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:44.840]   You can underestimate demand.
[01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:46.200]   You don't want to make too many.
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:50.200]   Like Microsoft learned with the Surface RT, which they had a couple extra laying around
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:51.200]   afterwards.
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:52.360]   So I think maybe there's still some bad-
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:53.360]   They gave me one.
[01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:54.360]   They gave a lot of people-
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:57.680]   Do you want to get them the little one, the mini Surface mini?
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:49:58.680]   Oh, one of my friends helped me.
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:49:59.680]   I know they never sold that.
[01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:00.680]   They never sold that.
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:01.680]   They didn't.
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:06.560]   So the story on that is it was that they made millions and this was when Satya Nadella
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:10.440]   became CEO and this first act as CEO is we're not selling that.
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:11.440]   And they had somewhere.
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:12.440]   There's a landfill.
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:13.440]   There's a landfill.
[01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:14.440]   Someone get on eBay.
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:16.800]   There's got to be some fun around on eBay.
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:17.800]   No, there's not.
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:21.360]   I mean, one of my friends who works in the press held one and got to record on it because
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:25.480]   he got a, like a, I know, but they were super locked down, which makes me kind of curious
[01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:30.360]   whether it's so awful that they don't want anyone to even see them or resources.
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:31.480]   I mean, they're pretty big.
[01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:36.160]   For some reason, I don't know why Virginia is the first state to pass a law letting robots
[01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:38.360]   deliver goods to you, to your daughter.
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:39.680]   There it goes.
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:40.680]   Why would it goes what?
[01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:41.680]   Beginning of the end.
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:49.200]   So, so Virginia, the law was written by Starship Technologies and Estonia based ground delivery
[01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:50.200]   robotics companies.
[01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:52.040]   I know they've got their ex-Skype.
[01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:53.800]   Ah, Estonia is Skype, of course.
[01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:55.440]   How do you Skype mafia?
[01:50:55.440 --> 01:51:00.860]   They were early Skype, but because of the way that the founders took basically...
[01:51:00.860 --> 01:51:01.860]   Nicholas Zenstrom.
[01:51:01.860 --> 01:51:02.860]   Yeah, they took all the equity.
[01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:03.860]   They took all the equity.
[01:51:03.860 --> 01:51:04.860]   Yeah.
[01:51:04.860 --> 01:51:08.720]   So they were part of the team, but not part of the equity owning cohort.
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:13.200]   Essentially, yeah, when eBay acquired eBay, I didn't make any.
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:16.760]   So the robots under the law cannot exceed 10 miles an hour.
[01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:17.760]   And I think that's good.
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:19.400]   Starship ones only go, I think, five.
[01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:20.400]   Yeah.
[01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:23.440]   And they can't weigh over 50 pounds, but they are autonomous.
[01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:29.240]   So get ready if you live in Virginia to see these little robots wandering around.
[01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:30.240]   What ones are the pet?
[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:32.880]   These make more sense, I think, than trying to do delivery by drone.
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:33.880]   Drone is insane.
[01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:34.880]   Nobody's going to do that.
[01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:36.880]   Drone is the flying car compared to this.
[01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:40.600]   But don't you think that these robots will get rolled?
[01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:42.520]   So there was a little robot called the boss.
[01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:43.880]   They went around to hotel rooms.
[01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:44.880]   It was about this tall.
[01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:45.880]   Yeah.
[01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:46.880]   And it was pretty cool.
[01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:47.880]   And I asked them about that.
[01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:48.880]   Like, what if I'm eight and I just want to mess with the robot?
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:49.880]   They're like, well, it's weighted.
[01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:52.280]   So you can't really knock it over if you're that size.
[01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:53.280]   And I was like, yeah, but I'm an adult.
[01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:55.440]   If I have a couple more teens, I'm just going to whack it.
[01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:56.440]   Yeah, there's a few things.
[01:51:56.440 --> 01:52:00.160]   I mean, one is, you know, if you do try to steal it, it has the ability to track you
[01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:01.160]   pretty easily.
[01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:03.520]   And also, if there's an issue, a human can take it over.
[01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:05.760]   Which is probably an open and take the tool.
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:06.760]   It's pretty secure.
[01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:10.000]   It can actually only be unlocked using your phone when it gets your house.
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:11.560]   So they've thought about this.
[01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:14.400]   I'm just thinking, remember that a couple of years ago there was this robot hitchhiking
[01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:15.400]   across the country?
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:16.400]   Oh, no, I'm not.
[01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:19.840]   Remember, and it got to Philadelphia and they beat the crap out of it?
[01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:22.600]   The city of brother Lila.
[01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:24.400]   He ended up in Philly and he got...
[01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:26.640]   I mean, it sounds pretty appropriate for Philly.
[01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:27.640]   Yeah.
[01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:28.640]   There's pieces of it all over.
[01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:29.640]   There's Philadelphia and peace.
[01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:31.440]   There were pieces of it all over.
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:33.440]   It was a social experiment.
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:34.440]   Is that Roboticize?
[01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:36.240]   It didn't, as well.
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:37.240]   Roboticize.
[01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:38.240]   Roboticize.
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:39.240]   Just vandalism, right?
[01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:41.240]   He was headed to San Francisco.
[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:43.240]   He didn't make it to San Francisco.
[01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:44.240]   No.
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:46.720]   Before we wrap up, can we talk about the studio song?
[01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:47.880]   Because I'm still in love with this thing.
[01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:48.880]   Okay.
[01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:52.800]   I've been with this a lot, but Alex is all excited about my computer.
[01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:54.680]   It's a Surface Studio.
[01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:57.360]   Yes, I still love it.
[01:52:57.360 --> 01:52:59.480]   I got it right away.
[01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:01.520]   I ordered it the minute they put it on sale.
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:03.480]   I got it in late December.
[01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:04.480]   It's an all-in-one.
[01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:08.080]   And as an all-in-one, I don't know if I would use this like an iMac.
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:12.360]   But as soon as you do this, and this kills me that Apple has never done this, this is
[01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:15.120]   something that Apple should absolutely offer.
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:18.440]   It could go down a 20 degree angle, so it's like a drafting table.
[01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:22.640]   And then it's touch, which Apple also kind of as choose.
[01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:29.080]   And I think touch makes this a very nice device.
[01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:30.080]   Imagine tweeting.
[01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:31.920]   I know you're all about this.
[01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:32.920]   I love Brad.
[01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:33.920]   Brad's great.
[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:34.920]   That's a global.
[01:53:34.920 --> 01:53:35.920]   Yeah.
[01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:37.400]   And Brianna, look, I follow the best people.
[01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:38.400]   Oh, Joshua Tree.
[01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:39.400]   Yeah, I follow them all.
[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:40.400]   You've never been there.
[01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:41.400]   Yeah.
[01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:42.400]   Yeah.
[01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:43.400]   These are my peeps.
[01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:44.400]   Look, there's you.
[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:45.400]   That's me.
[01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:48.400]   That's what you do to me.
[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:50.600]   That's all I feel whenever I come up here and spend my time with you.
[01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:54.720]   What's that is it's hard to figure out exactly which cringe worthy moment that was.
[01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:58.240]   There's been, there's been one for the books, I think.
[01:53:58.240 --> 01:54:00.080]   He's playing, you're playing with black and white today, Michael.
[01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:01.920]   Why did you use that for my Facebook profile?
[01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:02.920]   That photo.
[01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:05.800]   Michael O'Donnell, he's our unpaid house photographer.
[01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:07.560]   He's actually Silicon Valley's house photographer.
[01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:10.160]   The guy gets some of the best pictures.
[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:13.200]   So many feels, crickets.
[01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:14.200]   And he is, you're good.
[01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:15.200]   You're doing a great job.
[01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:18.080]   He uploads these as we do the show.
[01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:19.080]   Very nice.
[01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:20.440]   Look at there's Cara.
[01:54:20.440 --> 01:54:21.680]   Did you see Cara?
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:22.680]   Picture you.
[01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:23.680]   Look.
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:24.680]   Yeah.
[01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:25.680]   She's not a criff.
[01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:27.680]   She doesn't care.
[01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:33.080]   Yeah, some of these, some of the actual, some of the staff at Twitter actually uses windows
[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:35.000]   on Atlanta.
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.360]   So including me right now, there's, there are you Peter.
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:38.360]   Hey.
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:39.360]   Just get equal opportunity.
[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:40.360]   Or finally.
[01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:41.360]   Yeah, finally.
[01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:42.360]   Nice.
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:44.200]   You're cut off on that one.
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:45.200]   Camera's just boring.
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:48.120]   Hey, I want to thank everybody for stopping by Peter Rojas.
[01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:50.400]   R-O-J dot A-S.
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:55.200]   He's a partner at beta works and is not starting a fund under no circumstances.
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:58.440]   Should you even consider investing?
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:00.480]   You'd be guaranteed to lose your money.
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:01.480]   Is that okay?
[01:55:01.480 --> 01:55:03.840]   I think you just got me in big trouble.
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:06.720]   Can we just, can we control Z all the jokes about that?
[01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:08.360]   We can, we can, we can delete everything.
[01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:09.420]   He's not starting a fund.
[01:55:09.420 --> 01:55:11.200]   There is no fund.
[01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:12.200]   And we can delete everything.
[01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:14.840]   You don't want anything about that in there.
[01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:17.840]   You know, but actually, you know, in this Trump administration, I don't think the SEC
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:18.840]   is really.
[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:19.840]   They're not.
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:20.840]   They're, they're fishing.
[01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:22.480]   Pretty sure Jeep has joined their time off.
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:23.720]   That's a great picture of you.
[01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:24.720]   Thank you.
[01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:25.720]   Yeah.
[01:55:25.720 --> 01:55:26.720]   Look how beautiful flow is.
[01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:27.720]   That's nice.
[01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:30.760]   And you're, you're processing these in the phone and your phone.
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:32.160]   You're just sending them straight out.
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:33.920]   You're just sending them straight out from the camera.
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:34.920]   Wow.
[01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:38.640]   Shoot in a can, can in five D Mark two, right?
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:41.160]   Mark two, Mark four, of course.
[01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:43.160]   I'm not great with Roman numerous.
[01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:44.640]   There you go.
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:47.760]   He's at photo.
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:48.760]   Thank you for being here, Peter.
[01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:49.760]   It's always a pleasure to see you.
[01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:52.360]   I'm glad you're out out our, our coast now.
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:53.880]   So I hope we'll see more of you.
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:55.120]   We see a lot of flow.
[01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:56.680]   And I'm very happy about that.
[01:55:56.680 --> 01:55:57.840]   Oh, that flow on the Twitter.
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:02.600]   She's at Android Central dot com and every Tuesday on all about Android.
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:03.760]   Oh, he's a pleasure.
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:04.760]   Thank you for coming.
[01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:05.760]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:06.760]   I'm sorry.
[01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:07.760]   I called you gypsy.
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:08.760]   I'm not sorry.
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:09.760]   I called you flaxid.
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:10.760]   Oh, hell.
[01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:15.760]   Oh, I love how you were like serious, serious, serious.
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:17.760]   And then over here, my job.
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:18.760]   I'm your editor in chief.
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:19.760]   It's so fitting.
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:20.760]   I love it.
[01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:23.400]   The brand new crunch base dot com, which doesn't, isn't there yet?
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:24.760]   Crunch base dot com is there.
[01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:25.760]   My little site's not up yet.
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:26.760]   It'll be up soon.
[01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:27.760]   What will the URL be?
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:28.760]   You don't want to say?
[01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:29.760]   I think it's going to be crunch base dot news, but not you.
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:30.760]   Oh, I like that.
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:31.760]   But love that.
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:33.840]   But you're working on this is a process Peter knows about this.
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:34.840]   You started his site.
[01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:35.840]   It takes time.
[01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:37.440]   You got to do this a lot of stuff.
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:38.440]   So, so, so, so, so, patience.
[01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:41.040]   I will come back and tell you about it when it's, when it's online.
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:42.840]   So soon.
[01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:43.840]   Any day you're always welcome.
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:44.840]   I love having you.
[01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:46.040]   We love having all of you join us.
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:47.880]   We had some great studio audience members.

[01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:53.320]   We do this Sunday afternoon.

[01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:56.840]   Pacific local time, 6 p.m. Eastern time.

[01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:12.800]   There's a Roku app.
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:17.680]   And of course you can get the podcast after the fact download audio or video on demand.
[01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:22.840]   Twit.tv/thisweekintech.
[01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:25.760]   Thanks so much to Carson Bonny, our producer running the board.
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:27.240]   Anything Carson that I left out?
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:29.320]   Oh, we didn't do Uber.
[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:30.560]   What are you going to say about Uber though?
[01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:32.840]   I've got lots of thoughts about Uber's economics.
[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:33.840]   Really?
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:34.840]   Uh huh.
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:35.840]   It's bad.
[01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:37.440]   It's another horrible week.
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:41.120]   Every week there's new revelations about Uber.
[01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:42.120]   So we're going to do that.
[01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:45.160]   Don't treat your female employees like crap.
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:52.480]   Well it started with Susan Fowler, but then Travis Kalinek yells at a driver and the
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:53.480]   driver's recording.
[01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:54.480]   What a thought.
[01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:56.680]   It's almost like Travis should not yell at people.
[01:57:56.680 --> 01:57:59.280]   You can't do anything without someone recording it by the way.
[01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:00.280]   Yeah.
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:01.280]   I mean come on.
[01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:02.280]   Yeah.
[01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:03.280]   Supercord.
[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:07.320]   Now who how many people have left now under the under the scandal?
[01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:10.080]   The head of engineering got pushed out.
[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:12.120]   And somebody left today.
[01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:13.120]   I mean this week.
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:14.600]   There's been a number of blog posts.
[01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:16.040]   Oh and the head of growth left.
[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:17.040]   Gross.
[01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:18.040]   And they're VP of engineering.
[01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:19.040]   VP of engineering.
[01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:21.040]   The Google guy who had a sexual.
[01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:23.240]   Oh, I'm in St. Gall who was from Google.
[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:29.200]   He's the grandfather of the Google search engine by the way, which is like.
[01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:33.240]   This about a potential another potential scandal regarding Uber.
[01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:36.720]   We just record that and use it over and over.
[01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:40.880]   This is this is the one that broke this week is a tool called Grayball.
[01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:41.880]   Yes.
[01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:47.800]   That lets Uber drivers evade authorities when a thought when some police or a taxi commissioner
[01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:50.280]   or somebody tries to hail an Uber.
[01:58:50.280 --> 01:58:52.640]   The software says no, no, don't pick that one up.
[01:58:52.640 --> 01:58:54.720]   But I don't think this is technically illegal.
[01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:55.880]   I think it's just.
[01:58:55.880 --> 01:58:56.880]   Lame.
[01:58:56.880 --> 01:58:57.880]   Well, well.
[01:58:57.880 --> 01:59:00.480]   But a lot of Uber hits that gray zone in between.
[01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:01.480]   It wasn't.
[01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:03.560]   So it's called Grayball like black ball, right?
[01:59:03.560 --> 01:59:07.720]   And the idea is of course that tool is used for bad customers.
[01:59:07.720 --> 01:59:10.840]   Because one of the things Uber does, you rank the drivers, but the driver can rank you
[01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:12.600]   and they want a black ball customer.
[01:59:12.600 --> 01:59:13.600]   Yeah.
[01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:15.880]   It was part of a program called violation of terms of service.
[01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:20.200]   And so they don't want people who are going to violate, you know, their service.
[01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:25.880]   But in the article, it says that new people who were comfortable with how it was used,
[01:59:25.880 --> 01:59:26.880]   right?
[01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:32.040]   To me, even though it wasn't always used in illegal fashion, certainly that people internally
[01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:34.400]   were uncomfortable at it tells you how they were using it.
[01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:35.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:37.920]   We're saying of all the things that have come out, this is probably the.
[01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:38.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:59:38.920 --> 01:59:43.880]   Oh, in terms of what it does is it really it's one more piece of evidence that this was
[01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:46.640]   a really nasty corporate culture, right?
[01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:50.560]   That this was a this was a corporate culture that was aggressive, that was cheating, that
[01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:53.640]   was misogynistic.
[01:59:53.640 --> 01:59:57.000]   And yet as an investor, do you really care?
[01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:58.920]   I mean, what you're what you wouldn't be.
[01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:03.520]   But I mean, in general, he's it got money in Uber, right?
[02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:05.920]   He's Rachel, but he wasn't he a scout.
[02:00:05.920 --> 02:00:06.920]   Would he defend them?
[02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:08.400]   That wasn't his money, right?
[02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:11.640]   Yeah, but he has a lot of carry.
[02:00:11.640 --> 02:00:13.960]   Oh, and that makes me really mad.
[02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:18.560]   So he wants Uber to do well, but even he must at some point say, but this is this is
[02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:22.400]   we got to bring in somebody and get mean, didn't Ariana say that?
[02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:24.400]   Isn't that why they brought an Eric Holder to investigate?
[02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:26.280]   I think Ariana is going to show up there actually.
[02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:27.800]   No, she doesn't care.
[02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:28.800]   She doesn't.
[02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:33.840]   You know, I mean, I think at the end of the day, an investor, you know, or the board is
[02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:39.760]   going to make a decision as to what's going to end up maximizing value towards an IPO.
[02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:45.120]   And if they decide that Travis is, you know, net negative rather than net positive, like
[02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:46.120]   they will get rid of him.
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:47.120]   But I don't think they're at that point.
[02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:48.600]   Is Travis the problem?
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:49.600]   Absolutely.
[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:53.000]   Fish rots from the head.
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.400]   Is it too late?
[02:00:55.400 --> 02:00:58.280]   Can you eliminate Travis and then change corporate culture?
[02:00:58.280 --> 02:00:59.440]   Isn't that built into the culture?
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:00.440]   Yeah.
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:03.440]   And I think something that's really dangerous for Uber right now is that, I mean, I know
[02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:04.640]   like a lot of people like I swear.
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:05.640]   Dump Uber is what's dangerous.
[02:01:05.640 --> 02:01:07.640]   I thought you said I'm hashtag dump Uber.
[02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:08.640]   I stopped using Uber.
[02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:09.640]   Delete Uber.
[02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:10.640]   I'm moving to Lyft this week.
[02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:11.640]   Me too.
[02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:13.640]   I said a few weeks ago and I think that that's bad.
[02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:18.560]   I mean, they weren't profitable anyway, but I mean, I would say that like it is not
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:23.520]   at least in San Francisco, using Uber is not something that you necessarily want to admit
[02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:24.520]   to anymore.
[02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:26.520]   No, that's interesting.
[02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:28.480]   That's like a bad thing for them.
[02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:31.440]   It's shameful to use Uber.
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:33.240]   Even if I continue to use it, I would not want to.
[02:01:33.240 --> 02:01:34.240]   You wouldn't want anybody to know.
[02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:36.480]   I mean, I don't mind using Uber, but you're right.
[02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:37.480]   I wouldn't want anybody.
[02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:38.480]   I wouldn't want to announce it.
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:41.200]   Paulie from Bloomberg said, who's still using Uber?
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:45.040]   Who could possibly and I had to be like, Oh, yeah, I meant to delete that.
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:46.040]   And so I confess I felt bad.
[02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:47.040]   It's really so easy.
[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:52.040]   But Lyft is nearly as convenient and costs like 50% more.
[02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:53.640]   And you can do more expensive.
[02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:55.880]   You can tip your drivers too.
[02:01:55.880 --> 02:01:56.880]   It's better.
[02:01:56.880 --> 02:01:57.880]   It's better.
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:01:58.880]   It's over.
[02:01:58.880 --> 02:01:59.880]   It's less supply.
[02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:01.200]   That's another thing Uber did, which kind of pisses me off for years.
[02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:06.120]   I took Uber with a kind of tacit understanding that they were taking care of the drivers.
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:07.760]   And then you find out, no, they never have been.
[02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:09.080]   They never got tips.
[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:11.760]   And then I feel like a jerk for never tipping my driver.
[02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:13.200]   Now I over tip them.
[02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:16.080]   Would you give this to the other guy that I forgot to tip five years ago?
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:19.040]   I'm sure he'll pass it along.
[02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:21.800]   One time an Uber driver asked us for a $40 tip.
[02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:22.800]   What?
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:23.800]   I wait.
[02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:24.800]   I don't understand the math there.
[02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:26.760]   How big was the bill?
[02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:27.760]   He asked you.
[02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:29.520]   Is this the Vegas story?
[02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:30.760]   No, this was in New York.
[02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:32.320]   He didn't like how a lot of friends were.
[02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:34.960]   And he would have to give you a big, super loud.
[02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:35.960]   Well, do they do that?
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:37.800]   They blackmail you to say, I'll give you a bad rating.
[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:38.800]   Yes.
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:39.800]   What do you say?
[02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:40.800]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:41.800]   That's black.
[02:02:41.800 --> 02:02:42.800]   You're just yelling at us to give him money.
[02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:43.800]   Like, see, you got out and he was like, give me more?
[02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:44.800]   Yeah.
[02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:45.800]   I don't give you more money.
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:46.800]   I won't give you a bad rating.
[02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:47.800]   So we gave him money.
[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:51.040]   You need to like, down rate him and then make a note.
[02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:52.040]   Yeah, this was your choice.
[02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:54.040]   If you make a note, you can put that next in there.
[02:02:54.040 --> 02:02:55.040]   It becomes part of the story.
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:58.880]   The only trouble we've ever had with Uber, we were in Paris when they had just launched
[02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:02.600]   and the Uber driver said, oh, the app crashed.
[02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:04.360]   That's happened to me before.
[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:06.080]   I don't know what to charge you.
[02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:07.080]   Give me money.
[02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:08.080]   Yes.
[02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:09.080]   You have $90.
[02:03:09.080 --> 02:03:10.080]   That's so French.
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:11.080]   It's very French.
[02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:12.080]   That's such a Parisian experience.
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:13.080]   And you know what?
[02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:14.520]   I gave money because I was just so happy to have a ride.
[02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:16.520]   Because the cab drivers are far worse.
[02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:17.520]   Uber lost.
[02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:20.640]   Uber, we were in Paris and it started to snow.
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:25.840]   And all the cabbies get out their newspaper, roll up the windows and they start smoking.
[02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:26.840]   Wow.
[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:27.840]   No.
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:29.240]   I'm not giving it no.
[02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:30.600]   Remember, we're trying to get a ride.
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:31.600]   It's snowing.
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:32.600]   We want to get home.
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:33.600]   No.
[02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:35.360]   That's why Uber does well.
[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:39.040]   Uber lost almost $3 billion last year, according to most estimates.
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:42.040]   So I don't think Uber's doing that well.
[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:44.920]   If Uber doesn't do well, Jason doesn't do well.
[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:48.280]   And if Jason doesn't do well, am I allowed to be biased here?
[02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:49.280]   No.
[02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:50.280]   Okay.
[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:51.280]   He's a friend of the network.
[02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:54.280]   Used to be my enemy, but now he's my friend.
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:56.280]   I'll get there too.
[02:03:56.280 --> 02:04:01.680]   Well, I guess all it's left is to say, thanks for being here.
[02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:02.680]   We'll see you next time.
[02:04:02.680 --> 02:04:04.920]   Another twit is in the can.
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:06.920]   Bye bye.
[02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:07.920]   Yeah.
[02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:09.920]   Don't beat your robot.
[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:19.000]   Do the twit.
