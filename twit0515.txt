[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.760]   This is show where we cover the weeks.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.440]   Tech news, we go to Brooklyn, New York,
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.080]   where Barretunde Thurston is dialing in.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.600]   Hello, Barretunde.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.600]   Shookoo!
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.120]   Hello, America.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.040]   This is Barretunde from Brooklyn/LA,
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.400]   but Brooklyn this time, thank you, Leo,
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.240]   for having me back.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.080]   It's good to be here.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.760]   I see you on the longest day of the year.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.000]   This is a solstice.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.400]   Solstice, happy solstice.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.680]   Hey, look who else is here.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.360]   And he hasn't been, I think this is the first time
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.400]   in a year and a half, so I'm thrilled to welcome Tom Merritt.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.400]   It's about time I got off my duffin' and invited you back.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.400]   Hello, Tom.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.360]   I come to you from LA/just...
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.320]   LA. LA/LA.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.160]   DailyTechNewsShow.com.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.480]   DailyTechNewsShow.com, did I miss anything?
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.000]   Nope.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.560]   And in fact, I'm gonna have you do the week ahead
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.640]   a little later.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.000]   Great, I'll try to figure out what that is.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.720]   It's the same stuff as always.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.560]   That's the funny thing.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.880]   I just go to Techbeam and rip it off, right?
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.760]   Exactly, that's what I do.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.000]   I don't know.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.640]   By the beard of Merritt.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.720]   And we're hoping Ben Thompson from Taipei will join us
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.880]   of Stretecharifeme.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.400]   Ben is like 6.20 in the morning there,
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.560]   so I think he may still be sawing logs.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.600]   But after a very, very aggressive and party filled,
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.400]   Father's Day.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.800]   So, by the way--
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.080]   Get that dad bot on.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.040]   Yeah, nothing like the dad bot.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.120]   Do not email me and say that it's not the longest day
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.040]   of the year, Mr. LaPort.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.280]   It's always 24 hours the day.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.840]   And this is just merely the most sunlight of the year.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.000]   'Cause I don't wanna hear it.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.840]   I'm gonna call.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.680]   But we already got the call.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.800]   I'm gonna call the court of voice memo
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.240]   to sound just like that.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.080]   Oh, hello.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.160]   I'm gonna set up a program to email it to you.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.000]   Mr. LaPort.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.840]   Every hour.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.000]   Or half on the longest day.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.920]   You don't realize the day is always 24 hours.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.200]   Actually, I think we have a leap second.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.720]   Didn't we have a leap second, June 1st?
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.560]   I believe we did.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.920]   Yes, yeah, actually, times.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.720]   'Cause I mean, we got a second or we lost a second.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.280]   Tom's going to explain.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.840]   I think they had one, right?
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.880]   I don't know.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.640]   I think they had one in to catch up
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.200]   and then it throws off some servers
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.400]   that are really super accurate.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.240]   Like padding?
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.080]   They just like padding this time?
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.880]   And I think it's like a leap day.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.400]   You added day to February
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.400]   to kind of get yourself back on track.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.320]   It's a very, it's 'cause the atomic clocks are so accurate
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.320]   and yet the earth seems to be slowing down.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.320]   So they were worried, in fact, that the leap second
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.280]   would cause chaos.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.320]   It was June 30th.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.160]   Oh, it's coming up.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.200]   It's in a week.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.880]   It's June 30th.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.760]   At June 30th at 2359.59 GMT,
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.960]   the world's clocks will add one extra second.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.920]   So you get one extra second to do anything you want with.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.760]   (laughs)
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.600]   What a yell.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.200]   And that's because the atomic clocks,
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.440]   which are very accurate,
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.920]   don't allow for earth time,
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.640]   which is actually kind of off.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.560]   But it could--
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.480]   What are you saying the earth isn't perfect?
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.880]   The earth is far from perfect.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.600]   We do this not infrequently.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.960]   And they're worried that it could cause some issues
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.800]   with some super accurate servers and so forth.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.640]   So that's coming up.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.040]   Something to look forward to.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.600]   Stock up on your canned food.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.560]   (laughs)
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.480]   Make sure you have your 72 hour go bag.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.640]   It's a good question to consider
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.040]   what would you do with an extra second?
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.160]   And then some servers, I think Google is splitting out up
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.400]   into tenths of a second things.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.320]   Like they're gonna spread it out.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.160]   (laughs)
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.000]   Why do they not have?
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.600]   Why can't they just do what everybody else is doing?
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.440]   Because--
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.800]   They wanna have 10 times as many problems.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.720]   They're better than all of us.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.040]   So there have been problems in the past.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.680]   I guess a couple of years ago this happened.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.600]   And Qantas Airlines computers broke.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.440]   And for a few hours they were down
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.520]   and they had to check in passengers by hand.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.320]   Wait, how do you do that?
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.200]   I don't know one knows anymore.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.720]   I showed up with my watch and they said,
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.760]   I don't know what to do with that.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.600]   Thank you.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.440]   I'll take the last--
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.760]   They did get airlines the last time I flew to Seattle.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.120]   They checked you in by hand?
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.720]   Like they have like a manifest?
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.680]   It had that little sliding thing, it was like that.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.640]   They were like looking at your boarding pass,
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.840]   checking something off like with a pen.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.120]   Well, like it didn't.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.680]   It's a little consumer word of warning.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.760]   If that's happening, that means their computers are down.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.520]   That may be bad for the rest of the flight.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.640]   The real test of customer service.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.480]   I lived.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.000]   (laughs)
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.640]   There have been 25 leap seconds since 2012.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.600]   Oh, who knew?
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.600]   Then we do it all the time.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.480]   We do it all the time.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.040]   Although this was like a once in a lifetime, like a comet.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.880]   No.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.720]   Situation.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.120]   Apparently happens many times a year.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.120]   I've been acting like it's a big deal.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.520]   It's somebody under my table, I know.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.640]   Sensational media at its best, way to go, Leo.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.600]   Yeah, I know.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.200]   The Linux kernel folks aren't expecting any major issues.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.600]   But Linus Torvald said almost every time
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.400]   we have a leap second, something bad happens.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.040]   So it's like Y2K every couple of years.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.320]   Basically nothing happens.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.480]   Linus says the reason problems happen in this space
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.320]   is because it's obviously rare and special, not that rare.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.440]   And testing for it in one circumstance
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.680]   might miss some other situation.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.880]   Whoa, network time protocol freezes time
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.880]   during the leap second.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.120]   Right.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.160]   You can imagine that that's not necessarily good.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.000]   Frozen.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.840]   Right.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.680]   OK.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.800]   All right, I don't know how I got on that.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.920]   I wasn't even in our show notes.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.760]   No, I don't.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.600]   It just came to my mind.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.520]   I was a part of it.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.520]   Mark Merren, who does a podcast, in fact,
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.280]   you probably all listen to it because it's a great, funny,
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.680]   very popular podcasting.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.160]   Sorry, that might I understand.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.520]   Somebody said he invented podcasting.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.360]   (laughing)
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.760]   Tom is just trolling.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.920]   That makes me angry.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.760]   I'm just being a trolly, I'm sorry.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.920]   No, he did not invent podcasting,
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.000]   but he's a great comic.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.920]   He's on IFC, going into his third year now
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.280]   on the independent film channel.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.280]   Not a big cable channel, but who am I to mock?
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.480]   But he got the president to go to his garage on Thursday
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.840]   and do an interview.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:21.080]   Wow, this is one of those things where it's clear
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.560]   that President Obama is following my lead.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.920]   (laughing)
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.520]   Having also gone to Mark Merren's garage
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.360]   and been an honored guest on that show.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.960]   What was that for you when you were talking
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.040]   to the man who talked for the president?
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.280]   It's, you know, I feel like I had a very deep
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.200]   and prying conversation with the president,
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.080]   basically, changing the property of conversations.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.120]   That's kind of how it works with WTF, so.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.080]   It's like that old song.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.320]   Tom will remember this.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.720]   I dance with a man who, dance with a girl
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.740]   who dance with a prince of Wales.
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.080]   Wow, no, I don't.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.640]   (laughing)
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.480]   I'm sorry.
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.480]   I'm not saying anybody alive knows that song.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.320]   What is that?
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.920]   I'm sorry, I don't know.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.520]   Why did you try to drag Tom into it?
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.080]   (laughing)
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.480]   I thought he would know.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.520]   I thought I would too.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.520]   Okay.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.640]   So what was the security sweep for you, like,
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.760]   Baratunde, when you showed up?
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.920]   Was it similar to the president?
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.760]   Here's the thing.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.520]   I parked my car on a hill.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.840]   And then I walked up to the door.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.920]   And I knocked on the door.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.520]   And then they looked through the people.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.360]   Yeah, right.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.560]   And did a facial recognition scan
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.760]   with a built-in ID verification system
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.000]   based in various courtesies of the mind,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   acknowledged me and then granted me access.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.560]   So when Mark says it's in a garage,
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.280]   is that really a multi-million dollar studio?
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.120]   It's in a garage, dude.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.200]   Like, it's in a garage filled with books.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.040]   With crap.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:50.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.200]   Like a real one.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.360]   And then there's mugs everywhere.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.040]   It's a bit disheveled.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.760]   It is not a crack studio that he's pretending
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.720]   is some like earthy, grounded underground.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.720]   Like it feels like a bunker.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.560]   Wow.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.880]   It feels legitimately underground.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.400]   It's very cool, but it is not a fancy place.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.720]   It works really well.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.080]   And you feel like you're in somebody's garage
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.320]   where they've like stored their life.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.360]   He gave a little interview to the New York Times
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.240]   after the event.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.840]   So apparently it was a little bit like that scene
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.920]   from E.T. where they quarantine the house
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.440]   and they've got a tent and a tube going all the way out
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.120]   and they've got federal agents with guns
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.280]   or if you saw it later without guns,
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.840]   the president's car pulled up into the tent.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.680]   Right.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.760]   And then he emerges invisible to the outside.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.040]   Well, 'cause everybody knows.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.480]   I have to decontaminate him
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.160]   so they can mark Marin safe.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.000]   That's what it is.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.560]   And everybody knows where he is
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.360]   and everybody knows where Mark Marin's garage is.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.520]   So I think the presumption is,
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.480]   you know, there's gonna be a lot of people looking
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.440]   so you cannot see the president.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.160]   He gets out, emerges, goes down this tunnel into the garage.
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:01.520]   Marin said that they talked a little bit about, of course,
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.920]   by here there's the obligatory selfie, by the way.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.840]   That's embarrassing.
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.240]   - It's a pretty good camera quality.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.680]   (laughing)
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.680]   One of the phoneies you think the president knew
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.040]   that what WTF stands for?
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:14.880]   - I'm sure he did.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.760]   - Okay.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.600]   - Yeah.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.440]   - He wants to be hip, right?
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.120]   This is, he's not running for anything.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.200]   - He's like the coolest president
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.040]   you ever had.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:21.880]   I don't think you need once in front of that.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.800]   He's a pretty smooth operator in a non-creepy way.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.880]   Like Bill Clinton was smooth, but he was also dirty.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.120]   - He's a little weird.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.160]   - So Clinton did, remember Clinton did Arsenio
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.760]   and played the saxophone.
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:33.600]   - That's right.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.440]   That's right.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.880]   - That was for that time, I guess that was,
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.880]   Arsenio was the workman.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:37.720]   - That was the music guy.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.760]   Yeah, the Arsenio Hall show.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.960]   He looked pretty cool, but then he also was like a philander
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.040]   or constantly. - Right.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:43.920]   - It was less cool.
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:48.080]   - And remember that Obama also did Zach Goliath and Akas
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.680]   his podcast or whatever that is.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.520]   - He's been to Ferns.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.360]   - Yeah.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.200]   - I'm not a fucking guy.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.040]   - That's right.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.920]   - Goliath and Akas, remember this, asked him,
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.880]   how does it feel to be the last black president?
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.120]   And Obama said, when he said, he said,
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:02.960]   how about that?
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.120]   - How about that hangover three?
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.760]   - Yeah, yeah, he win it.
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.000]   That was really well done.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.520]   - That was brilliant.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.840]   - Some disclosure, I guess it's a disclosure slash humblebrag.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.680]   I don't know what's out of the spectrum.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.080]   - Did you write that joke?
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.320]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.120]   I'm going much lower than that.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.360]   I have just interacted with and done some meetings
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.160]   with the public engagement office at the White House
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.560]   basically advised them in the past.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.560]   - Neat.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.000]   - How they think about communicating with the public.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.240]   And what's fascinating, this White House is like,
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.400]   came of age, really in a digital media era.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.880]   Bush just missed it.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.040]   And the president Obama, like Snapchat's here,
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.400]   YouTube is full on, wireless networks.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.080]   So we used to count on the official media,
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.440]   the formal credentialed media,
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.080]   to relay messages from the executive branch
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.680]   and to interrogate them on our behalf.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.800]   And now that is not the case anymore.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.360]   The White House publishes a whole bunch of its own stuff.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.600]   They have primary outlets on all these social channels.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.600]   But then they also go to niche media
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.880]   to try to get their message out.
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.000]   I mean, the first lady has done all this stuff
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.720]   around her Let's Move initiative targeting eye village
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.800]   in like very particular communities.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.520]   - So the equivalent of doing like local press
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.360]   back in the day.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.520]   - So do they talk to you and they say,
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.120]   you know, what would your advice be?
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.160]   'Cause you're obviously, you know, a millennial
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.840]   and you're hooked into all of this.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.320]   - I told him to come on Twitch.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.760]   That was stuff basically.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.400]   - And he didn't listen.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.240]   - Not yet.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.920]   - He said spoke to a Twitter.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.640]   - We did one of these meetings, Leo,
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.680]   if you remember when I was still a Twitch,
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.080]   I went down to Mountain View and met
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.120]   with a representative from the White House earlier,
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.520]   obviously a couple of years ago.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.360]   - Really?
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.600]   - I was talking about video on the internet.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.440]   - Really?
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.200]   - I think you couldn't make it for some reason or something.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.280]   So I went down and it was me,
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.040]   the guy who was doing IV.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.000]   Do you remember that service that got sued
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:56.840]   out of existence?
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.040]   'Cause they were just rebroadcasting.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.840]   There were a couple of people from YouTube there,
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.760]   a couple of Google legal representatives.
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.560]   It was really interesting because they were just
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.760]   kind of fact finding.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.520]   They wanted to know like, what are your concerns?
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.360]   You know, what are the issues that you face
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.960]   trying to get your message out on the internet?
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.640]   And I think they were also collecting information
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.920]   for themselves for what Baritunde is talking about.
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.560]   - Here's a picture of the president talking to Mark.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.920]   Baritunde, does it look like he cleaned up the studio
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:21.760]   a little bit?
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.480]   - It actually does.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.680]   The piles are more orderly in this shot.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.520]   - Yeah.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.360]   - Than I remember.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.440]   - Yeah, a little tidied there.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.320]   - But it's that's cramped as I remember.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.480]   He didn't overdo it.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.240]   I think he probably swept and like shuffle the papers
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.240]   to get the stacks lined up a little better.
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.400]   - Secret Service probably did that when they came through.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.680]   - And you might if they put this guitar over here, sir,
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:44.960]   I think.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.680]   - Do you mind if we vacuum up this dust?
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.680]   - What is this?
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.240]   - This is this poison.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.080]   What is this?
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.920]   - I need to have a check.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.400]   - Jeez.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.880]   Of course, New York Times interviewed Mr. Mr.,
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.800]   I'm gonna call him Mr. Marin now.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.640]   - Ooh.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.520]   - Mr. Marin right after the show.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.720]   - Sir Marin.
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.960]   - You finished speaking with the president a short while ago.
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:04.960]   How are you feeling?
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.760]   How did it go?
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.200]   Marin said, I feel good.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.040]   (laughing)
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.800]   They did talk about, of course,
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.800]   the Charleston killings had happened the day before
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.880]   on Wednesday.
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.560]   So they talked, you know, they had some serious conversation.
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.320]   Think about Marin is he likes, correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.800]   but just from listening to the show,
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.440]   but you know better than I, Baritone,
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.560]   he likes to really kind of talk about you as a human.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:32.360]   - Yeah, he is not a topical current events show.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.480]   His is an examination of the dark recesses of your soul.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.320]   - Yeah.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.160]   - And it's like a mix of a confession booth
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:43.800]   and like a support circle and an interrogation
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.160]   and like hanging out with a funny person
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.480]   all wrapped up in one.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.320]   - So funny.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.680]   - I think he's very much into like your story
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:54.680]   and your traumas if you're willing to share some of those.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.440]   'Cause he identifies a lot with the darkness within.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.760]   - He mentions in the news.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.600]   - 'Cause a lot of the people
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.600]   - All the darkness within.
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.920]   - It should be.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.080]   Although WTF ain't bad either.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.720]   He mentions in the interview with the New York Times
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:08.920]   that he used to be, I didn't know there's a radio
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.560]   talk show host, a commentator.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.640]   And he says, "I just lost interest in politics.
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.200]   I don't follow it anymore."
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.800]   He said, "So I didn't think of political questions
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.640]   to ask the president.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.000]   I was gonna do it my way, engage in a personal way.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.040]   But he knows all the tricks."
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:25.880]   Says Marin.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.720]   "He's the president.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.480]   I wasn't gonna put anything over on him
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.480]   by acting more comfortable than I was,
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.320]   but it was weird.
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.160]   He came over.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.640]   He made me very comfortable very quickly.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.520]   He was very engaged.
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.880]   He was looking forward to having a nice chat.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.880]   And I think I steamrolled into the conversation
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.720]   very intensely, very quickly like I do sometimes,
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.120]   especially when I'm a little bit nervous.
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.680]   They asked him, the times asked him,
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.520]   "How did this happen?"
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.520]   He said, "Well, you know, we would have
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.800]   in this conversation between my producer and the White House.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.120]   And then over the last month or so,
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.680]   it became clear that it might happen."
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.520]   And then Mark says, "But where am I gonna do it?
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:57.680]   Do I go to the Oval Office?
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.520]   Do I go to his hotel?"
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.880]   Then they told him, "No, he wants to come to your garage."
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.600]   So that's pretty wild.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.480]   Big Secret Service.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.840]   There were snipers on my neighbor's roof,
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:11.240]   a sniper on my garage roof, LAPD
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.680]   around the perimeter, 40 Secret Service people.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:18.520]   They asked, and I was kind of interested in this question,
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.920]   were you given any guidelines or restrictions
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.720]   about what you could discuss with the president?
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.600]   And Marron said, "No, no guidelines, no restrictions."
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.660]   And we had final edit, wow.
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.960]   - I hope you add some stuff into that final edit.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.720]   (laughing)
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.200]   - Final doctoring.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.840]   - Yeah, I feel like I couldn't talk to, you know,
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.520]   Bill Gates, you want to interview Bill Gates,
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.400]   they give you the questions,
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.560]   they approve the questions, they want final edit.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.000]   That's why I've never interviewed Bill Gates,
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.600]   I never would put up with that.
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.640]   - I assume it's because it's a political public figure.
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.640]   Laws are different.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.480]   - Oh.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.200]   - You know that sort of person versus a CEO.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.160]   - Oh, you have a good point.
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.920]   Yeah, you can't manage it that way, can you?
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.320]   - Yeah.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.960]   - Huh, that's a great question.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.960]   I wonder though, because I imagine that
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.720]   maybe they just trusted him ultimately
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.640]   to be respectful even if he wasn't
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.120]   like carrying the president's line.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:13.960]   But.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.120]   - Well, Tom, that's why you and I didn't get the interview.
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:16.960]   - Yeah.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.880]   - Right, that's my story.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.840]   - I don't think there's any laws that would prevent
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.320]   a communications department of a public figure
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.600]   from trying to manage an interview.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:27.920]   And they're like, "No, you can't ask about that."
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.520]   I'm pretty sure elected officials do that all the time.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.800]   - I can't wait to hear, this isn't, it's not out yet, right?
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:33.640]   It'll come out.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.480]   - It'll come out on Monday.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.320]   - No, this week.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.160]   - Okay.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.520]   - Yeah, it's an access issue.
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.400]   They're basically saying,
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.000]   "We're not going to give pre-approved questions
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.200]   "because if that got out, it would look bad."
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.040]   - Right.
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.360]   - So we're willing to take the risk.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.600]   And you're rightly, they must have just trusted,
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:52.200]   like, well, the situation will be such that,
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.240]   you know, we won't run into any hot water,
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.680]   especially if they know that Marin
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.320]   doesn't really talk about politics.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.160]   - Right.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.000]   - Yeah.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.680]   - It was probably an astute choice, wasn't it?
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.160]   - The other thing, I mean, when they partnered
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.280]   pretty heavily, there was a man who was in the public engagement office
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:10.600]   named Brad Jenkins, he now runs Funny or Die's DC office.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.680]   They have his office down there.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:12.520]   - Really?
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.360]   - Yeah.
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.040]   - And he was a big part of connecting the White House to
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.440]   the LA community, the Hollywood community,
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.000]   and especially comedians.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.960]   And a lot of the videos that came out for Obamacare,
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.240]   that Funny or Die did, they ended up driving enrollment.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.760]   Like, they were trying to reach that community of young people
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.720]   who hang out and watch funny videos online.
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.920]   And that's not gonna be drive time radio.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.840]   And that's not gonna be ABC News or NBC Nightly News.
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:42.280]   So they're, I think that part of their strategy
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.720]   is probably, you know, Marin has an audience
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.120]   that they want this president to be exposed to.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.800]   Maybe he's doing a closing lap too.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.280]   I'm just like, whoa, I'm not touched.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.280]   - He's not running.
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.680]   So it's not like, you know, I can understand as a candidate,
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.000]   you might be reaching out to young people.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.840]   But when he did the two Ferns interview,
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.280]   he was promoting his--
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.280]   - That was Obamacare.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.560]   - Yeah. - Yeah, the ACA.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.520]   - Right. - So, and I've seen, you know,
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.960]   youth get out the vote kind of stuff with MTV
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.800]   and things like that, but this, he's got no X to grind here.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.920]   - Maybe he's just a fan.
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.080]   - Maybe he's a fan.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.160]   I like that.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.920]   Let's just say that he's in his, he's in his senior spring.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.840]   - Right. - And he's checking off his bucket list.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.600]   Like, you know what, I wanna be on WCF.
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.000]   I can do that as a president.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.080]   - I can not do that.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.160]   - Yeah.
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.000]   - That's awesome. - That's awesome.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.920]   - In the United States, you should start doing other stuff.
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.320]   You know, skydiving and like--
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.040]   - Does it say anything about--
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.160]   - He's putting it in line.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.360]   - Yeah, one. - Hike the Appalachian Trail.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.080]   - I'm gonna carry a wallet with money.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:43.360]   - Does it say anything about podcasts that, I mean,
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.120]   this is a big, I think this is a big deal for a podcast, right?
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.960]   - Yeah, no, I mean, you got serial and then this.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:49.920]   - Yeah. - So, the question is,
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.440]   I think did the president kill?
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.480]   - Hey. - I think podcasts
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.880]   are coming through, going through a renaissance right now.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.720]   That's what I think.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:01.160]   And let's take a break, I want a love letter from sort of,
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.160]   more like a breakup letter from Taylor Swift to Apple.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.320]   And a lot more coming up. - Yeah.
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.800]   - Tom Maritz here, it's great to have him
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.680]   from the Daily Tech News Show, DTNS.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.760]   Dailytechnewsshow.com, Baratunde, snapatunde.
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.000]   Last time you were on with built and you said,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.920]   oh yeah, I'm using, I'm doing a Snapchat all,
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.400]   and you still are.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.920]   - Yeah, I actually, the story that's up now,
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.880]   by the time most of your people hear this,
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.200]   it will be gone because that's the nature of--
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.440]   - That's why I don't do it.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.880]   - I'll probably archive this one on my YouTube channel
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.680]   or my website on the site. - Oh, you can?
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:35.200]   - Yeah, you can export the stories that you make,
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:40.080]   not the messages as easily, but it'll create a MP4 file
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.800]   of the length of a full play of the story,
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.000]   as if the user had depressed their thumb
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:45.960]   with the whole thing.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:50.240]   I created some art, I created like psychedelic Snapchat art
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:54.280]   last night and it's pretty amazing.
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.680]   In fact, I'm gonna try to get a screenshot you can show.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.200]   - I'm actually just, you can show it right now,
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.280]   you're holding it right now.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.800]   - Show it right now.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.120]   - Ooh, wow.
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.120]   Now that was skipped to the--
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.720]   - I have to keep my thumb on the thing, wait a minute.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.640]   - Do what you were doing before, hold it down.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.720]   - Yeah, look at that, now tap with your index finger
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.000]   somewhere else on the screen.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.600]   No, keep your finger depressed, now tap elsewhere
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.000]   while that finger is depressed with another finger.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.880]   (laughing)
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.880]   - Really, you think this is a good medium, huh?
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.160]   - Wow.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.040]   - Right, look at that.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:25.880]   - Wow.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.960]   - Wow, let's play the medium shooting.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:34.760]   - You know, I'd be kind of glad that does disappear
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:35.840]   after a day.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.760]   - I, Tom, I answered your question.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:42.400]   I had my phone, I threw it to my monitor,
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.280]   through Apple TV and I was just curious what would happen
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:51.280]   if I tried to make a Snapchat of what my camera saw
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.760]   which was what my camera was seeing.
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.680]   So I created this whole of Mirrors Effect.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.120]   There's like fractal effect, basically,
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.680]   'cause there's a latency between each image.
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.560]   So the longer you focus on what you're focusing on,
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:06.040]   what you're focusing on, it just creates this tunnel effect.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.600]   And then I played around with filters
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.440]   and rotation angles and things like that.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.080]   - I think Katie Couric already did that on the,
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.280]   I don't know, I may be wrong, but I think I said her.
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.000]   - That legitimately was.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.360]   - You're missing, was your top-stealing?
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.200]   - After.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.480]   - This is kind of cool, but this isn't typical
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.800]   of what you do, right?
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.320]   - No, I was just, I had some time last night
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.080]   and I was just messing around.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.360]   So I don't know if that's just a one trick thing,
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.880]   but I'd love to see other people play with,
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.520]   basically mirror effects and kind of looking.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.360]   (laughing)
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.240]   - It's dollar bill.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.600]   - Yeah, yeah, I made it rain and then I took the money away.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.960]   - You made it rain, baby.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.320]   - That is.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.720]   - And then you create this like domino effect
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.560]   when you make things fall.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.120]   - Now, and I can't watch that again, right?
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.680]   That's it. - But you can't, you can.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.960]   You have to scroll down.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.040]   So whatever you just did, don't do that.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.840]   - I don't understand.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:01.480]   - You're young people, you and your crazy Snapchat.
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:02.400]   - Hold your hand.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.520]   I got Nick to thank for this.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.720]   Nick got me, you know, so I haven't been on Twitch
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.440]   without him in a long time.
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.720]   It feels, I feel like I'm cheating on Nick built-in right now.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.280]   - Why didn't we, it was their reason
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.120]   we didn't get to Nick on here?
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:14.960]   - I don't, I assume.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.800]   - I just, the chance.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.800]   - The capacity is the reason why.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.400]   - He isn't like you anymore and he doesn't want to.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.760]   No, I don't know.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.920]   We should, I just feel like you got to mix it up sometimes.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.240]   - I love mix, I haven't been on a comment.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.880]   - Barretunde doesn't have to go with built-in.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.280]   - Oh, no, I'm my own, I'm my own man.
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.720]   - You're your own man.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.160]   - How can you have any Barretunde
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.320]   if you haven't had your built-in?
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:34.560]   (laughing)
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.680]   - You're about to have your built-in.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.320]   - Our show today brought to you by Fresh Books,
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:43.080]   the super, by the way, John, John really liked that, Tommy.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.320]   Any, anytime you do a little pink Floyd in there.
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.160]   - Yeah, of course.
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.000]   - Of course he did.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.920]   - Little Roger Waters, he's gonna be happy.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.400]   The episode brought to you by Fresh Books
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:54.400]   if you run your own small business,
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.840]   anywhere you charge for your time and expertise,
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.200]   that means you're busy, I hope, you're working hard.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.080]   And the last thing you wanna do is come the end of the month,
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:07.640]   open word or excel and make invoices.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.080]   Fresh Books makes it easy.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.080]   It's the super simple cloud accounting solution
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.800]   designed just exactly for small business owners like you.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.240]   You can create and send invoices easy
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.920]   as pie beautiful professional looking invoices.
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:23.920]   You can also use their phone app to capture and manage expenses,
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.480]   keep track of hours, get it right into the invoices,
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.840]   it's so easy to use, looks so good.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.120]   Fresh Books has done some studies of Fresh Books users,
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.080]   they found out that Fresh Books users
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.800]   save around 16 hours a month on the administrative tasks.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.120]   16, that's like two days, two work days a month.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.480]   But more importantly, you get paid on average
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.520]   of five days faster.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.600]   That's because that invoice has a pay button
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.320]   that you can use, your client can use to pay you
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.160]   and they wanna pay you.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.960]   If they don't, then of course, Fresh Books
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:01.280]   will automatically send additional reminders, which is nice.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.880]   But because you can accept credit cards
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.240]   and all the online payment systems,
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.080]   it makes it so much easier for them to pay you.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.080]   And if you ever need help,
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.880]   the Fresh Books support rock stars are there.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:15.360]   At the offices, ready to help you, they're fantastic.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.120]   I used it for a long time and I really loved it.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.920]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.360]   Join the five million folks over the last 10 years
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:24.880]   who have used Fresh Books.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.520]   Go to freshbooks.com/twit
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.080]   and if they ask you how you heard about it,
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.920]   just say "twit" in that little form there.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.640]   Start your 30 day free trial today,
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.720]   we thank them so much.
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:39.080]   Freshbooks.com for supporting this episode of Twit.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:43.560]   FreshBooks.com, your 30 day trial awaits.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.560]   Fresh Books.com.
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.120]   Yeah, you use that?
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:49.720]   Here's a segue, Leo, from that to one of the stories
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.120]   for the day that I thought was pretty perfect.
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:57.120]   You talked about Fresh Book facilitating faster payments.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.720]   Clients wanna pay you, this makes it easier.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.960]   Unless of course that client is Apple
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.000]   and you are a musician.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.800]   That case, you can wait 90 days.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.360]   Exactly, it's like the anti-Fresh Books.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:13.760]   So Taylor Swift on her tumble log writes,
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.840]   "To Apple, love Taylor."
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.440]   But like many Taylor Swift songs,
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.880]   this is really about breaking up.
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:23.520]   I'll write this to explain why I'm holding back my album.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.320]   She's gonna gettin' good at this.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.520]   Remember Taylor held back 1989 from Spotify
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.480]   because they wouldn't let her take it off the free tier.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.600]   I'm holding back my album 1989
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.280]   from the new streaming service Apple Music.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.720]   I feel this deserves an explanation
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.640]   because Apple has been and will continue to be
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.440]   one of my best partners in selling music.
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.840]   This is kinda weird and creating ways for me
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:45.880]   to connect with my fans.
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:49.240]   I respect the company and the truly ingenious minds.
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:51.480]   They've created a legacy based on innovation
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.160]   and pushing the right boundaries.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.440]   I'm sure you are aware, she goes on to write,
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.480]   that Apple Music will be offering a free three month trial
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.720]   to anyone who signs up for the service.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.680]   That starts by the way at the end of the month, next month.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.080]   No, this month, it should be any day now, right?
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.880]   July, June 29th.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.000]   Oh, it's very close to when we get that extra second.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.240]   You could spend it on Apple Music.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.400]   Apple Music, an extra, so the problem is
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.480]   Apple's gonna give you a free trial for three months
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.680]   on both the Mac on iOS when you get 8.4.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.920]   Not on Android, no free trial when it comes out on Android,
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.360]   but Windows I guess will also get a free trial.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.040]   And Apple has said, and Taylor says,
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.080]   "I'm sure you know Apple will not be paying,
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.640]   "will not be paying writers, producers or artists
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.960]   "for those three months."
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.720]   I find it to be shocking, she says,
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.760]   disappointing and completely unlike
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.400]   this historically progressive and generous company.
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.600]   This is not about me.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.120]   She obviously understands that people are gonna say,
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.880]   "Oh Taylor, you're rich, you're being."
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.200]   She says, "No, I'm not being,
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.040]   "these are not the complaints
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.680]   "of a spoiled, petulant child," she writes.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.960]   She says, "I'm on my fifth album,
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.600]   "I can support myself, my band, my crew,
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:00.040]   "and entire management team just by playing live shows."
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.200]   But, and she makes this, I think, an excellent point.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.720]   This is about the new artist or band
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.040]   that has just released their first single
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:07.880]   and won't be paid.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.680]   I mean, imagine you just come out with your hit single,
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.640]   and for three months people can listen to it for free
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.680]   on a music.
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.240]   - And when you think about,
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:19.040]   and I don't know what the curve looks like for music,
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:22.600]   is there a power curve basically of play volume,
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.040]   like it spikes in the first few weeks or months,
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.440]   and then it probably tapers off
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.120]   as people discover artists.
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:31.040]   And so you're probably not missing out
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.640]   in a years period, you may be missing out on more
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.760]   than a quarter of the compensation.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:40.240]   That first quarter of release may represent a half
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:43.000]   of your plays for that year on this platform.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.800]   So I like the Dear John Letter,
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.360]   that Taylor Swift wrote Apple.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.720]   She felt a little political,
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.920]   it felt like the politician goes into
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.400]   like a small town or a company,
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:56.600]   and like the good people of Iowa are always hardworking,
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.440]   ingenious minds, you've contributed so much
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.400]   to the American economy,
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:05.880]   and then they follow that with ripping them a bit.
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.000]   But the case for the new musician,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.960]   I felt was strong and unique.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.840]   It wasn't the way Metallica was like way back in the day.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.440]   Like you're stealing our money,
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.160]   and it's hard to feel sympathy for someone you assume
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.600]   is very highly compensated.
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.320]   So I felt like she was taking a hit
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:21.160]   on behalf of people who don't have a voice.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.320]   It was actually quite a political move.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.160]   I like it.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.040]   - She says she's not trying to engender any bad blood
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.440]   with Apple, but she's saying you're not out of the woods.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.480]   - Well she's a little too cautious about that really, right?
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.680]   I mean, come on.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.640]   You don't have to keep samples asked.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:39.640]   - I think if you are, if you recognize as an artist
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.440]   the direct relationship you have,
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.600]   based on the phone you're using,
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.080]   like she probably wrote that on an Apple device.
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:46.920]   - Of course she is.
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.760]   - You know what I mean?
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:48.600]   - Right, yeah.
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.600]   - So she is grateful for that iTunes
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:51.840]   has changed the whole game
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.480]   and maybe allowed someone like her to rise.
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.840]   Like them and Google, especially together,
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.440]   probably changed the total relationship
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.080]   but Apple takes credit for it.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.200]   And then her other big point I think is look,
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:04.480]   you're asking the weakest among us
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.200]   to subsidize your product launch.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:12.080]   And so like the US Treasury has $50 billion on hand.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.640]   Apple has $160 billion on hand.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:19.280]   You think they can't afford to offer the artists
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.000]   on whose back the service depends.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.840]   Like without musicians, Apple Music is just an empty vessel.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.240]   So she's like, look, why don't you,
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.840]   if you want this product to see so much,
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:32.080]   you invest in it, don't force your suppliers,
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.280]   like the heart of your product to make that investment.
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:36.640]   And without even asking too.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.800]   - Here's my guess about what happened here though.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:43.000]   Is instead of giving the 70% that normally a Spotify will take,
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.320]   Apple agreed to more.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.840]   Some people say it's 71.5, I guess in Europe it's 73.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:52.440]   And my guess is that Apple agreed to that
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.440]   in exchange for the three month free exclusive.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.920]   They said, well, that'll balance it out.
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.760]   We'll give you a larger amount over time
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.280]   if we can juice up the stats
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.160]   at the beginning with three months free.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.320]   And the labels agreed to that.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:08.440]   So this isn't really about Apple versus the artists.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.640]   This was about the labels once again,
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.120]   selling out their artists interests.
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.760]   - As it always has been.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.600]   - Because they'll get their money down the line,
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.920]   even if it hurts some individual artists along the way.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:23.200]   - But I wonder if,
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.080]   because artists are rarely at the table
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.120]   they're represented by publishers,
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.600]   who have the rights to these songs
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.440]   and by the music labels who have other rights.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.840]   So maybe it's just the case
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.280]   where the labels not fighting hard enough.
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.040]   Maybe they're just totally whipped by Apple
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.080]   and they know they're gonna lose an any rate
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.800]   because how do you tell,
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.080]   it's just a very awkward conversation.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:42.920]   I feel like to be like,
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.400]   yeah, we're gonna ask your artists to pay for this.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:48.720]   And you're saying that from like a throne
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.400]   that you're sitting in, which is made of solid gold.
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.160]   (laughing)
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.840]   - She says at the end of her letter,
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.640]   we don't ask you for free iPhones.
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.400]   Please don't ask us to provide you
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.920]   with our music for no compensation.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.480]   - We do, with two year contracts.
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.760]   - I think though, all right.
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.920]   Look, obviously she, on the face of it, she's right.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:13.360]   But for years now, artists have accepted that
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.880]   you're not gonna make much money on radio play.
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.600]   In fact, as a performer, you make zero,
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.760]   only the publisher, the songwriter, gets any money.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:24.840]   You're not gonna make a lot of money even
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.880]   with the other streaming music services
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.560]   like Pandora Spotify.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.960]   But if you're a new artist,
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.400]   that's how your music gets out.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.840]   She herself says, "I make my money touring."
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:39.120]   Isn't that really just the fact of life these days?
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.320]   - Josh Konstein over at TechCrunch had a great point,
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.800]   which was the company that gets this,
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:46.280]   will start selling merch and concert tickets
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.560]   through their streaming service.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.400]   - Exactly.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.920]   - Cutting in the artists where they make their actual money,
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.120]   and no one will care so much
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.960]   about all these individual streams, which are minuscule.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.000]   - And that's already, I mean, that's been happening
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.360]   in since Yahoo music service
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.280]   from built on Rhapsody forever ago.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.120]   - Right.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.040]   - Spotify has a concert, you can follow an artist
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.360]   and get notifications.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:07.720]   I assume there's not an affiliate link deal
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.640]   if you buy a ticket based on that click,
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:11.800]   because they're the ones who are responsible
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.440]   for you discovering that.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.640]   - This is the thing new either.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:17.480]   Apple's given away free songs every week for a long time,
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:21.000]   and they don't pay the artist for those, as far as I know.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.600]   That's when you get chosen to give away a free song.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:25.840]   Congratulations.
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.560]   Same thing with Amazon, with their free app every day,
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.640]   right? They do a free app?
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:30.480]   You don't give anybody.
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:34.360]   You just force downloads of artists' entire albums.
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.520]   - That's a great idea.
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.360]   They call it the YouTube strategy.
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.200]   - And charge you on top of it.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.040]   - For everybody.
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:41.080]   - Yeah.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:44.400]   - They actually didn't, they pay you to more than $100 million
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.680]   for the right to put songs of innocence on my phone.
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.040]   I think they paid a lot.
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.800]   - Well, yeah, and that's what that deal.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.400]   - That's why I'm convinced that Apple has the money
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.840]   to give the labels.
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:57.760]   It was the labels saying,
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:00.000]   "Okay, we'll give you three months free."
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   If you pay us more over time going forward,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.120]   and Apple agreed to it,
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.680]   no one was considering individual artists at that point.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:07.520]   - That's right.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.600]   Taylor wasn't asked.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:09.600]   Her label did this.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:10.600]   - And Taylor's got her own label
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.000]   so she can just pull out and go,
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   "No, this doesn't actually doesn't--"
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:13.840]   - Oh, is that it?
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.440]   She's not on a label.
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.360]   - Well, she's on a label,
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:19.480]   but it's a label that is independent of these other agreements
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.320]   as I understand.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.040]   - So maybe she just pissed off Apple didn't talk to her.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.200]   - I doubt that very much.
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.280]   I'm sure Apple wanted to talk to Taylor Swift.
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.240]   - Oh, no, 'cause they have her back catalog in here.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.080]   - Right.
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:29.920]   - Just not the current album.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:30.760]   - Yeah.
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:34.920]   - She's saying, "I wish you would give us better royalties."
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:35.760]   - Right.
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.400]   And she's saying, "Reconsider, it's not too late."
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.480]   She says, "It's not too late.
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.320]   Reconsider."
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.160]   - "He's got a blank space.
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.480]   "She'll write their name."
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:42.720]   (laughs)
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.680]   - I got word from Mr. Nick Bilton.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:46.880]   I wanted to make sure I was okay to share this.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.520]   He is a new father.
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.080]   - I know.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:51.600]   Congratulations, Nick.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:52.760]   - Happy Father's Day, Nick Bilton.
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:53.880]   - Yeah.
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:54.720]   He was amazing.
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:55.960]   He found a wife and a child
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.680]   like within a space of a month or two.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:58.520]   (laughs)
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:59.360]   It's really--
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:02.480]   - He found a wife a bit earlier than that.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.400]   - Okay, all right.
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.680]   I've been watching his adorable baby pictures.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:08.680]   - Yeah.
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:09.600]   - It's the fam.
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.800]   - Thanks for checking, 'cause you know what?
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.920]   I would've just said it without asking him ahead of time,
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:13.760]   so I appreciate your support.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:17.480]   - I have been burned by sharing other people's details
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.240]   without checking first.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:22.240]   And as my own reach gets larger,
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.000]   that's more painful to people who didn't ask for it.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.320]   And so I'm a high person.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.640]   - You forget when you see something
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:32.320]   like on Facebook that maybe it's not public.
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:35.000]   I always assume it's public.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.600]   So anyway, so yes, congratulations.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.400]   And do you remember the name of his baby?
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.400]   - I do, though I don't know if that's public,
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.240]   so I'm not--
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.640]   - Okay, okay.
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.720]   Okay, aren't we careful here?
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:49.720]   - Yeah.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:50.560]   - Yeah.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.680]   So I think we can safely say we're all sympathetic
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:54.880]   with Taylor's point of view,
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.040]   and absolutely if you're a new artist
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.600]   and you're losing three months of sales,
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.720]   that could be a significant ding.
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.400]   But I think you're also right, Tom,
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:06.320]   this was a deal the labels made.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.400]   The Apple didn't do this unilaterally.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:12.880]   - Yeah, and it becomes a bad deal for all the indie labels,
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.240]   all the individual artists who weren't at that table.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.760]   - Yeah, like these British labels are complaining about
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.880]   the same thing that Taylor Swift is complaining about
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:20.720]   on behalf of Apple.
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.120]   - And Apple music's not gonna have a full catalog
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.200]   because of that.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.200]   - Oh really?
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.440]   - Are labels saying, well, they're not gonna have 1989,
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.320]   but you mean it's beyond that?
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.160]   - They're some of the smaller indie labels
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.400]   are not gonna be in the service either.
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.240]   - Interesting.
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.840]   Isn't it the case though, really,
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:37.160]   that I read this somewhere I would like to give credit,
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.120]   but I don't remember that in fact,
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:42.000]   it's all a matter of time before the labels
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.880]   put all of these services out of business.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.760]   Spotify has never made any money,
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:48.880]   and even though they're getting funding like crazy,
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.720]   it's really up to the labels,
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.520]   and the labels don't want this, or do they?
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.280]   - They don't want it too fast.
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.440]   They don't want it to undermine the current business model
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.240]   before they've figured out how to move all that money.
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.800]   - But that's why Apple's doing this, right?
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:06.000]   'Cause they saw 14% decline in sales last year.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.600]   - Right, oh wow.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.040]   - And I don't know the last time I...
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:10.040]   - I rarely buy...
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:12.240]   - Right, you don't need to, you listen to Spotify,
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.920]   you got every song.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.000]   - That's all in the cloud, it's a streaming life, man.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.880]   It's a streaming life. - 1989.
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.640]   - Like my apartment, right?
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.960]   - I actually bought...
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.920]   - He don't, I bought for the 18th time another...
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:26.000]   (laughing)
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.880]   - Another collection. - They're the best.
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.000]   - Well, they deserve the money,
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.280]   they need it, those poor guys, young stars.
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.040]   - Well too. - Struggling.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:37.080]   I bought, I guess, there's a little metal apple,
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.160]   green apple, with a USB key.
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:45.040]   And it's got flack versions of the 2009 remaster, 24-bit.
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:49.000]   So I put, but then you have to re-encode that for streaming.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.600]   - Right, so you obviously use like a real networks,
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:53.760]   like 14- - Sure.
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:54.840]   - A little bit shorter. - Real player,
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.640]   there it is, that's the little thing.
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.600]   And it's actually pretty good.
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:02.240]   And then, but then, 'cause they're not on any streaming service, right?
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:06.360]   So I had to upload it to Amazon, so I could hear it on my Echo,
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:09.040]   and upload it to Google, so I could listen to it.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.440]   'Cause otherwise you can't stream the Beatles,
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.760]   unless you own the Beatles.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.320]   But they're the only artists.
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.200]   - Yeah, I have a little music all access,
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:18.520]   which lets me stream the Beatles music I own.
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:19.760]   - But you have to own it, exactly.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:20.840]   - But I have to own it, yeah.
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:22.600]   - And does someone from Google come to your house
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.680]   to inspect your record collection?
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:26.200]   - Yeah, my wife, she works there.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.360]   - Cool.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.960]   - So she authenticates it. - Literally, literally,
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:32.960]   somebody from Google inspects his collection regularly.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.480]   - Make sure you didn't just borrow those discs from the press.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.200]   - What's interesting is Google's,
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:41.600]   I use Google access, and I like it.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.920]   But it's tied to your Google account,
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.280]   so only you can use it.
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:49.120]   There are limits, kind of draconian limits,
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.360]   which I wasn't really aware of,
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.960]   to how many times you can re-download your own music.
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:57.000]   I think you only can do it a couple of times a year.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:57.840]   - Okay.
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.840]   - There's all sorts of issues with Google Music,
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:03.080]   and I love the idea, because my collection is in
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:04.960]   Google Music with 30 million other songs,
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:08.280]   so as you say, Tom, I can supplement the Beatles and so forth.
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.560]   Double Twist actually has just launched a solution
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.040]   to get around this.
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:13.880]   - I love this.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.280]   - Called Cloud Player.
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:19.120]   I tried to download it this morning, I couldn't get it.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:23.440]   But the idea is, if your music is on Dropbox,
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.240]   you can stream it to Double Twist on Android.
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:30.960]   And I guess it does it also use Google Drive?
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.720]   Yes, Dropbox OneDrive or Google Drive.
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.120]   And so it gets literally, by pluses,
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:37.920]   all of Google's restrictions about
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.480]   how many times you can download your music,
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:44.040]   who owns it, you can only authorize five devices with Google.
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:46.600]   All of that's bypassed by Double Twist.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.520]   - Good.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:50.640]   - Ah, you've got to wonder what Google's gonna do in response.
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.200]   - Welcome from Google's search results,
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.440]   which is a nice segue, am I right?
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:00.840]   - Into, gosh, Baratunde, you're doing my job.
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:02.720]   - Thank you.
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:03.560]   - Just keep moving, Leo.
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:04.400]   - Keep it moving.
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.080]   Go ahead, I don't know where you're going with this though.
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:11.080]   - I was going with the revenge porn being stricken
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:12.800]   from Google search results.
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.440]   - But you have to ask for it.
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:15.280]   - Yeah, you have to request it.
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.800]   It's just like the right to be forgotten
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.680]   implementation over in Europe.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.280]   - They do that with, I didn't know this,
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.400]   but according to USA Today,
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.960]   they've always done that with bank account and social security.
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:28.360]   So if your search is turning up your social,
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.080]   you can ask them to take it down.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.160]   - I didn't know that either.
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:35.120]   I was curious why that wasn't a bigger deal,
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.320]   like finding someone's signature and their social.
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.160]   - Right.
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.280]   - You can open up everything in their name
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.000]   and ensure people have scanned it
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.440]   and posted, ended up online and forums by accident.
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.280]   'Cause they're automatically--
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:48.400]   - Child pornography has had that policy as well.
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.360]   - If that would make sense.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:54.360]   But this is, if you see, if your ex is putting up nude pictures
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:58.720]   of you as revenge, you can fill out a form
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:01.720]   which is not yet available, but will be soon saying,
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.200]   "Hey, I did not give permission for this imagery
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:05.160]   "to be on the internet.
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.520]   "Would you please take down the search results?"
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.240]   And I think that's a good thing.
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.760]   - Agreed.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:13.000]   - If it's not on Google, it doesn't exist.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.880]   - And I like the idea that you have,
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:18.080]   it seems like for such a long time,
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.960]   there was a very hands off,
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:23.280]   like outside of the realm of morality and ethics attitude
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.760]   about the power of this technology to do great harm.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:26.600]   - Right.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:28.720]   - And it's like, "Oh, we're just an algorithm, right?
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:31.360]   "Just doing what the machines tell us to do."
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.960]   Like, that's how you end up with some pretty bad outcomes
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.320]   from time to time.
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.120]   So for Google to be saying, like,
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.560]   look, this information, it's our job.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.120]   I'm paraphrasing, like, their mission
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.200]   is to organize the world's information,
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.920]   but it's really to organize the world's valuable information.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.520]   And this information has no value.
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:50.200]   It only has harm attached to it.
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:53.400]   So it's not a good look for them to be connected
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:58.160]   to a place where you can go to find ways to hurt people
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.720]   and destroy their reputation.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:01.640]   - Don't you think it opens up the door
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:03.760]   to the right to be forgotten in a broader way?
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.800]   Like, okay, well, that's harmful,
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:08.120]   but what about that article about me
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:10.880]   that said I bribed a judge 20 years ago?
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.640]   Isn't that, shouldn't I be able to take that down too?
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:14.480]   Not that I did.
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:15.680]   I'm not saying me.
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:17.600]   - Well, I think that puts the argument
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.760]   where it's supposed to be, which is saying,
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:24.920]   what is the line between what should be allowed
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:26.160]   and what shouldn't be allowed?
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:28.240]   I mean, just like freedom of expression
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:30.640]   says you can't yell fire in a crowded theater,
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.040]   there is a line where you say,
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:35.440]   you can't say everything.
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:37.360]   We try to make it as abundant as possible.
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.080]   And I think Google is saying,
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.120]   revenge porn is on that side of the line.
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.640]   There is no value to it.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:43.720]   - No, no question that. - That would have questioned that.
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:44.960]   - Right, to be forgotten.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:45.800]   - Right.
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.480]   - Sometimes there is still value to that
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.000]   because it's actual facts.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.600]   It's not necessarily libelous or slanderous.
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.240]   It's just old.
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:55.600]   And I think I'm sympathetic to the argument
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.240]   where they're saying, I think you should have a higher burden
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:58.360]   of proof that something like that
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.400]   should be removed from search results.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.240]   - What Tom said, everything, cosignal?
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:05.760]   - Apparently, Jackie Speer from California
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.880]   is about to introduce federal legislation
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:09.280]   that would make you the illegal.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.800]   It's not illegal, revenge porn.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:12.920]   And John Oliver's gonna,
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:14.760]   now this is really gonna carry a lot of weight.
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:16.960]   John Oliver rolled to it on Sunday last week tonight.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.080]   Hey, look who woke up.
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.280]   Mr. Ben Thompson from Stratecary joins us.
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.680]   Hi, Ben.
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:23.520]   - Hi, I'm here.
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:24.360]   Can you hear me?
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:25.680]   - Did you, were you asleep?
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:30.120]   - I had a time zone malfunction.
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.200]   - No problem.
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.920]   We're always grateful that you tune in
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.040]   at six in the morning anyway.
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:38.240]   - So, well, someone's gonna make a bad,
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.040]   someone probably should make like an Apple Watch
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:41.760]   up or something, but yeah, there's no day with it.
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.160]   There's no day with savings time here.
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:46.440]   - Oh, which I think I've remarked previously.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:47.760]   I got it right the last time I was on,
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:51.120]   but I just, I went to bed, set my alarm for 645
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:54.520]   and woke up at 645 to 57 Skype messages
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:55.360]   asking where I was.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:56.520]   - Oh, I'm so sorry.
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.960]   No, it's my fault.
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.480]   - I'm so sorry.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:01.560]   Well, no, we're thrilled to have you.
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:02.960]   - Yeah, well, I would just, I mean,
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.960]   I would love to jump in on the conversation.
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:08.560]   I think the one point I would make is,
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:13.400]   I think in tech and around some of these issues
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:15.840]   in particular, the kind of slope-free slope
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:18.960]   argument gets a little oversold.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.640]   And I say this as someone who takes it very, very seriously.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:24.480]   I mean, actually my background in university is not tech.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.520]   It was political science and actually constitutional
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.360]   law specifically.
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:31.440]   So the concept of slope-free slope in the First Amendment
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.000]   and all those sorts of things is something that
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.560]   I've certainly understand very well and rings very true.
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.800]   That said, I feel like the argument of this is a step
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:45.880]   down a slope-free slope is taken so far to the extreme.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:48.200]   The reality is everything is on the slope.
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:53.200]   And it's kind of insulting to suggest that no one
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:57.360]   has the judgment to figure out where and when we can go.
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:00.880]   I mean, so you literally get arguments of people arguing
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:05.360]   that private corporations should not put some sort of limit
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:09.600]   on truly egregious, awful behavior or speech in the name
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:13.360]   of a slippery slope argument that one is nonsensical
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:15.280]   if you actually back up and think about it.
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:18.560]   Two is kind of insulting and three,
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:20.240]   private corporations aren't covered by the First Amendment
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.080]   anyway.
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:23.080]   So I mean, I'm good on Google for doing this
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:27.360]   and good on the taking it a little easy
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.200]   on the slippery slope argument.
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:32.640]   - And I'm not making the slippery slope argument really.
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:33.480]   - Oh, that's fine.
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:34.560]   - Because it's kind of a hobby horse for me.
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:35.760]   - No, but I'm gonna jump on it.
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:36.680]   But I'm gonna jump on it.
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:40.640]   I will kind of take the point of view just to give you more
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:41.840]   to push against.
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:46.800]   You can certainly make the case that if there's editorial
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:50.840]   discretion of any kind, if it's not completely algorithmic
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:54.920]   then that changes the whole complexion of the matter.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.120]   Then where does that end?
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:58.840]   Where does editorial discretion end?
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:01.120]   Shouldn't it be entirely algorithmic
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:03.560]   and there should be no human intervention at all
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:04.920]   if in all?
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:08.080]   - I don't know that why that happened.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.960]   - In other words, address revenge point at the source.
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:12.280]   Why does Google have to change its algorithm?
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.000]   Take down the, you know, go to that.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.080]   Certainly go to the sites where it's up there.
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:19.320]   And as they did recently, throw them in jail.
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:21.000]   - Because Google's a point of leverage
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.360]   and can actually make a difference.
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:26.320]   I mean, if we didn't act except at the root source
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.480]   of every problem, we wouldn't do anything.
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.800]   Right? We wouldn't have energy if we felt that way.
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.160]   We'd all fly to the sun to get it.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:34.760]   Like we have to have intermediate methods
[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:36.720]   of getting things done and Google represents
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:39.160]   a major gateway and they've made a call that says,
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:40.600]   look, we're not the cause of the problem
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:44.600]   but we contribute by making, by creating a market for this.
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.120]   Now we search as a market.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:48.600]   People look up folks' information
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.720]   and if this is what they find on someone
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.200]   which is only an act of malice
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.960]   not the fact based journalistic stuff
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:55.320]   that Tom was talking about earlier
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.400]   that has no value.
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:00.200]   And for Google to be like, oh, we didn't start the fire.
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.800]   Does that mean you don't help put it out?
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:04.960]   - Yeah, I think there's also an argument
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:06.360]   to be made in high-ben, I'm Tom.
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:07.920]   Nice to meet you. - Hey, Tom.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:09.920]   Tom, Aaron, Ben, Tom.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.840]   - I think there's an argument to be made too
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:14.120]   that this is Google admitting
[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:15.800]   that their algorithm isn't perfect
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.160]   and that if their algorithm was perfect,
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:18.560]   it would be able to tell that this was
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:21.680]   valueless content and kick it out, but it can't.
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:23.520]   And so you have to put a patch on it,
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.440]   a human patch for the time being.
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:26.280]   - Well, the other thing.
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:28.960]   - And that idea that too is the idea
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:32.320]   that the best world is one
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:34.840]   that doesn't require human intervention.
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:36.680]   No, that's the sky net world.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:39.560]   We've seen that documentary so many times before.
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:42.600]   And I don't know that that's the highest level
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:44.040]   of like creative achievement
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.840]   is one where no people are required.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.200]   Like that shouldn't be the goal.
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:50.760]   - You guys are pushing me in the opposite direction now.
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:52.880]   The more I hear this, the more I don't like this idea.
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:54.440]   I feel like if you're gonna say,
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:55.640]   I'm gonna make a search engine,
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:57.640]   what you should do is make a search engine
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:59.360]   that indexes what's on the net,
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:02.280]   regardless of content, because that's what's on the net.
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.600]   Your job is to reflect what's on the net
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:08.240]   and give the best results, not to editorialize.
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:12.080]   And then if you don't like something that's on the net,
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:13.920]   you should go to where it is on the net,
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:16.880]   not take the search engine to task.
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.920]   - So there's two issues, Leo.
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:21.320]   And for the record, I'm very sympathetic.
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:25.840]   I mean, I had a similar position recently.
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:28.080]   And so I get it.
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:30.880]   I think there's plenty of stuff I would love
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:32.600]   to take down on the net.
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.560]   Everybody knows that.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:37.440]   So I'm arguing against my own interest,
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:38.920]   but I think it's in all of our interest
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:41.640]   that Google be an independent aggregator
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:44.600]   of whatever reflection of what's on the net
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.800]   and not with any human editorial intervention.
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:51.400]   'Cause editorial intervention always introduces bias.
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:52.240]   - So the problem though, is--
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:53.840]   - It's all about algorithmic intervention.
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:56.160]   - It's a bias, it's a sorry Ben, go ahead.
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:57.640]   - Yeah, actually Ben you go.
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:58.720]   And then I think that's an interesting
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:01.720]   port baritone, and you get the next one.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:02.560]   Go ahead Ben.
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:04.880]   - No, I think we're, well, maybe we're gonna simply,
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:06.640]   I mean, who writes the algorithms?
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:10.280]   - Exactly.
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:11.720]   Other algorithms.
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.280]   (laughing)
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:14.120]   - Guiding back.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.380]   (laughing)
[00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:22.760]   - The truth is one humans write algorithms.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:27.680]   And so there is going to be some level of bias already in them.
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:30.920]   Two, Google has already made this decision
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:32.720]   to censor some sort of content.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.080]   They have a long standing as noted,
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:39.200]   policy to not show child pornography for example.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.640]   They also don't show certain piracy results,
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:43.000]   some of them because they have to,
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.120]   some of them because they choose not to.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:47.600]   There's a whole list of stuff.
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:50.360]   They choose not to feature sites that
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:52.640]   wink to themselves and have all that sort of stuff
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:56.400]   in the various penguin updates and panda and Peregrine
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:57.920]   or whatever the names are.
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:01.280]   The reality is that the search algorithm itself
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:02.920]   is a very human endeavor.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:07.080]   And we can't pretend that it is inherently objective
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:08.020]   when it's not.
[00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:13.840]   More broadly, we need to deal with the world as it is,
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:16.440]   not with the theoretical world where there's an impartial
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.560]   computer answering our questions.
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:22.240]   The reality is, is that in a world of infinite information,
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:25.600]   the point that organizes that information for better or worse
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:28.920]   has unbelievable power and leverage.
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:33.080]   And frankly, in Google's interest
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:34.760]   that they don't take the responsibility,
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:37.640]   they shouldn't be surprised if governments
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:39.000]   take the responsibility for them.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.060]   So this is actually probably a self-inertial move on
[00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:42.600]   those four-year-olds. - I agree with that.
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:45.280]   But that's kind of a politically realistic point of view.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:49.400]   I disagree, I think an algorithm can be completely objective.
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:52.160]   In fact, PageRank at its fundamental root
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:54.840]   is it takes no account of the content at all.
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:56.320]   - No, but here's the-- - It merely says,
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.360]   if somebody else, if people are linking to this page,
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:51:59.280]   it's highly ranked.
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.560]   The higher the rank of the page is that a linking to the page,
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:02.840]   the higher the rank of the page.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:05.560]   If you just do that, that's purely algorithical
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:07.400]   without human intervention.
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:09.160]   And it is completely objective.
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:11.160]   And there's no editorial advertising.
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:14.680]   - So the editorial happened when someone decided
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:17.000]   that PageRank equaled important.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.400]   Like the word rank is a human value that says
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:23.720]   a page is important because of this algorithmic definition
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:25.920]   of inbound, outbound links, et cetera.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:28.800]   So the peer doesn't belong in this discussion.
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:31.520]   There's no idea of purity here
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:33.400]   because someone created that.
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:38.400]   It's like saying a test, an academic test measures intelligence.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:41.040]   It measures a certain type of intelligence.
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:43.560]   PageRank measures a certain type of importance,
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:46.680]   but it can be argued that there are other relevant factors
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:49.680]   for the position of a webpage
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:51.480]   and the result for a certain term
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:53.880]   that PageRank doesn't capture at all.
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:56.840]   So PageRank is very limited, human value
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:59.480]   imposed from the source, like the code itself
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:01.640]   has values imposed by thinking--
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:02.840]   - Well, it may not be perfect,
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:05.920]   but it's better than having a human decide.
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:09.880]   But Leo, you so, okay, if you're gonna say it's not perfect,
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:12.240]   but it's better than having a human decide,
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:15.560]   what I would say is it's better to have a human decide
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:18.360]   to not include revenge porn than to not.
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:20.720]   I mean, the point of the fact of the matter is,
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:23.240]   once you've established it's not perfect,
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:25.200]   then you're making judgment calls.
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.600]   And once you're making judgment calls, I--
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:29.480]   - Well, that's why I say you want a certain level of--
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:32.780]   - I agree with you, revenge porn is obviously wrong,
[00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:34.040]   but the point is as soon as you,
[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:36.400]   this is the slippery slope argument, you hate so much,
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:37.840]   but as soon as you say a band
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:41.160]   in the completely computer-based algorithm
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:44.120]   and start saying, well, except this isn't so good
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.760]   and this isn't so good, that's very risky
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:49.280]   because that's a judgment call.
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:54.280]   - But the problem is that argument only holds moral water
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:57.400]   if you start with the assumption
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.560]   that the original judgment is perfect.
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:00.640]   - Yeah, it is perfect.
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:03.280]   If it merely reflects the--
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:06.200]   - No, it's perfect according to certain parameters.
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:07.360]   - I mean, perfect.
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:08.200]   - Right.
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:10.440]   - There's no, like, achieving that is a problem.
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:12.840]   - I think PageRank is pretty amazing.
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:14.800]   - You, so that's--
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:15.640]   - You're not gonna get any--
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:17.520]   - I understand Google's abandoning that, by the way.
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:18.360]   - I'm not telling you what you think,
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:20.680]   but I just, I can't imagine a world where you think
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:24.400]   that they happen to stumble into the absolute
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:28.920]   across all time best and most perfect way
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:30.800]   to determine the original page results.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.280]   - Oh, no, maybe there's a better way to do it,
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:33.240]   but I would say--
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:35.240]   - But then it can't be perfect.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:37.800]   If there's something better, then this is not perfect.
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:39.720]   - But I would say what's absolutely imperfect
[00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:43.640]   is imposing some sort of moral judgment or moral compass
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:44.720]   because that changes.
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:49.720]   That is highly subjective, whereas you can pick an algorithm.
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:52.480]   Doesn't matter if it's PageRank,
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:55.440]   but there is some method that I'm using that is,
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:58.400]   you know, the point of PageRank is to try to determine
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:00.160]   which pages are the most important,
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:01.360]   which pages are the least important,
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:04.800]   and then give it in order according to your search term.
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:07.200]   So let's, we wanna perfect that.
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:08.320]   We wanna make that better and better,
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:12.040]   but the minute you say, "Except, let's take these results out,
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:13.560]   "and let's take these results out."
[00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:15.960]   Now your search algorithm isn't showing
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:18.680]   an accurate picture of the web.
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:22.120]   - Well, if the web has full crap, which it is, by the way,
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:24.920]   who's gonna decide what to take out?
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:25.760]   - Well, the exception-- - Except--
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:28.360]   - That started the moment that they pulled out link farms.
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:30.600]   They said, "That's not a valuable result,
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:34.400]   "and PageRank was making a mistake by ranking those,
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:35.760]   "so we have to tweak."
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.320]   Then they pulled out bank account numbers
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:39.640]   and child pornography and now revenge porn.
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:42.200]   So really, the conversation to me
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:45.160]   isn't about whether there should be human intervention
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:46.720]   in the algorithm 'cause there has been
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.720]   all the way back to the beginning.
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:52.560]   The question is, are they intervening in the right places?
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:53.920]   So-- - Exactly.
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.160]   - I think you hit the nail on the head when you said,
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:59.160]   are you making a moral judgment? - Right.
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:03.880]   - And is revenge porn or child pornography a moral judgment
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:05.240]   or just a class that they say,
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:06.080]   "You know what?
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:07.200]   "If we had the perfect algorithm,
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:09.880]   "it would eliminate that on its own."
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:11.280]   - Yeah, I mean, oh, correct.
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:14.440]   Look, algorithms are made of people like everything else,
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:17.840]   but there is the goal that you're trying to achieve
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:19.960]   with the algorithm, and one would be
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:23.840]   to try to accurately reflect, however we do it,
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:25.800]   the actual state of the net.
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:27.560]   That to me seems the right and good way
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:29.200]   to create a search engine.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.520]   The other would be to say,
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:34.320]   "Let's show the results on the net of stuff
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:36.720]   "we don't disagree with."
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:38.800]   Whatever that is that you don't disagree with,
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:39.920]   the fact that we can all agree
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:43.040]   revenge porn is bad does not mean
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:45.120]   that it should be abandoned because that is,
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:47.040]   just 'cause we all agree about it,
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:50.400]   we might all agree that African American people
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:53.040]   are all bad and that has happened in time.
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:55.440]   Should the algorithm be adjusted?
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:58.960]   No, it should not be based on that kind of judgment.
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:02.520]   What you're trying to do is mathematically accurately
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:06.440]   reflect that data pool that is the net.
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:11.320]   However creepy it is, let's have an accurate search result.
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:12.680]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:14.520]   We haven't had that for years.
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:15.360]   (laughing)
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:16.680]   - Well, I'm not saying that.
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:17.520]   - Right?
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:21.600]   - There's a world where there was a great TED talk
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:26.600]   that came out this year about our whole perception
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:29.040]   of anything is imperfect, it's incomplete.
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:32.720]   We don't see infrared without some extra tools.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:38.680]   The idea that we could accurately reflect the net,
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:40.640]   like the word accurate and the word net
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:44.960]   are both very subjective and hard to wrap
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:47.280]   some comprehensive case around.
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:51.120]   And I think a pure quote unquote pure search engine
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:53.200]   can exist, but to Tom's point,
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:55.760]   it would actually be a pile of crap.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:57.800]   - Yes, 'cause that's what's on the net.
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:57:59.480]   But then we should fix what's on the net,
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:00.520]   not what's the search algorithm?
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:02.000]   - No, no, but Leo, it's not just because
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.240]   that's what's on the net,
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:05.560]   it's because people would intervene
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:10.560]   to manipulate and get, like the top result would be coupons
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:13.480]   and porn sites and discount movies.
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:15.400]   - Well then let's fix the net.
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:18.480]   - But you, okay, yeah, I would vote
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:19.920]   that we move on on the subject.
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:21.920]   - Okay, I think we've all made our points,
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:22.760]   exactly right.
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:24.080]   - Yeah, exactly right.
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:25.760]   - 'Cause you can find it all in Bing.
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:28.920]   - You pushed me into it, I wasn't gonna push so hard.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:31.480]   It is all in Bing, right?
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:33.480]   - Well you did, you pushed, it was good
[00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:34.880]   because I think you pushed hard enough
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:36.480]   that you ended up in an absurd place.
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:37.480]   And I think we were on that.
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:39.240]   - I disagree entirely.
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:40.640]   - Which is what's the...
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:41.480]   - Actually.
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:43.120]   - I think what you really,
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:45.640]   you Leo accurately reflected the internet right now.
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:49.880]   - Let's take a break, there's lots more to talk about,
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:52.560]   including an article on the Wall Street Journal
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:55.720]   that said Apple should abandon the Mac.
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:58.920]   I'd like to know if you agree, especially you Ben.
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:58:59.760]   - See that, Arta?
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:02.760]   - Arta, they brought you by Gazelle.
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:06.680]   A great way if you are in, is this Gazelle time?
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:07.560]   - I think it is, isn't it?
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:08.400]   - Yeah.
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:10.440]   A great way if you are into gadgets,
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:12.720]   to get new gadgets without breaking the bank.
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:14.800]   You see, when you're done with a phone
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:17.520]   or a tablet or a computer or a screen,
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:19.280]   do you just kinda throw it in a pile somewhere,
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:20.240]   maybe stick it in a drawer?
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:21.880]   That'd be like taking $100 bills and saying,
[00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:24.600]   "I don't need this anymore," and just putting it in the drawer.
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:27.200]   Instead, go to Gazelle.com, at least.
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:30.400]   Do yourself a favor, get a quote for,
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.560]   "Well, how much is that old iPhone 5 worth?"
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:35.160]   And then, when you see it's worth 100 bucks,
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:36.280]   maybe you won't throw it in the drawer,
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:37.400]   maybe you'll send it to Gazelle.
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:39.080]   The point is you can get that quote,
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:44.080]   no obligation, no cost to you, $175, okay.
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:47.200]   And now we're talking.
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:49.960]   It's good for 30 days, so you don't have to decide right away.
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:51.720]   In fact, if there's a new thing coming
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:55.520]   and you wanna get it, it's a great idea to go to Gazelle now
[00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:57.560]   and get that quote so you can lock it in.
[00:59:57.560 --> 01:00:00.000]   Then when you get the new thing, transfer the data off,
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.800]   the old thing and send it to Gazelle.
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:04.360]   They pay the postage on anything worth more than a buck.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.160]   You might ask, I know many have,
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:10.720]   well, what happens to the good stuff that Gazelle gets?
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.600]   Well, the stuff that's in the best shape,
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.200]   they actually will turn around and sell,
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.200]   pre-owned certified from Gazelle.
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:21.040]   Devices are available from Gazelle in two conditions,
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:23.160]   certified like new, nothing more to say about that,
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:26.080]   they're as good as new, certified good,
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.440]   they show some gentle signs of where,
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.480]   but you're gonna get even more savings.
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.760]   The thing to know is everything's been put through
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:34.080]   Gazelle's rigorous 30 point inspection,
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:36.560]   so they're fully functional and you have
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:39.480]   a 30 day risk free return.
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:42.320]   So it's great, if you lose your phone,
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.600]   this is the place to go.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.880]   If your kids break their phone or their tablet,
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:47.200]   this is the place to go.
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:50.360]   Gazelle, you get paid in cash, payment is fast,
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:53.360]   it's risk free, they'll wipe your data if you forget.
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:55.360]   Gazelle's paid out over $200 million now
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.440]   to over a million customers, very happy.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:00.080]   Me, I'm one of them, I love Gazelle,
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:03.680]   and now you can buy from Gazelle too, to buy or sell.
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:08.680]   Remember Gazelle, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E,
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:11.880]   Gazelle.com, we thank them for their support.
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:17.120]   I don't know what Sick Game Christopher Mims is up to
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.320]   in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:21.160]   What's Sick Game?
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:23.120]   Why Apple should kill off the Mac?
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:28.120]   Actually, I guess from a purely business point of view,
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:29.360]   it might make sense to, I mean,
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.240]   the Mac is such a small part of their business,
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:33.200]   they make so much money on the iPhone,
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.080]   it might make sense to kill off the computer
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:38.000]   that really put Apple on the map after the Apple II.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.040]   - Unless they put it on the Apple Maps,
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.440]   in which case it might be hard to find.
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:44.440]   (laughing)
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:47.640]   - Is this guy nuts?
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:49.640]   Ben, you do a lot of this kind of analysis.
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.920]   Is anybody really, I hope nobody's taking the deal.
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:57.120]   - I resent that comment that I do a lot of this kind of analysis.
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:00.800]   - No, you do, no, but you do, no, not this kind.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:04.400]   But you look at numbers, you understand what the business is,
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:05.720]   and you've said some interesting,
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:08.440]   maybe even provocative things, Google, for instance,
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:12.440]   no longer a top of their game.
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:15.440]   Do you think this is a reasonable strategy for Apple?
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.280]   - Well, for the record, I think the issue with Google
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:20.040]   is the advertising market shifting,
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.440]   or the addition of branded advertising, they're not strong.
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:27.440]   But that aside, no, it's a ridiculous article.
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.480]   - Okay, thank you.
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:33.760]   - As far as I can ascertain,
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:37.720]   MIMS argument is that Apple needs more focus.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:43.600]   But it's just a, I don't know,
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:46.280]   just a really poorly thought out idea,
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:47.200]   I mean, for lots of reasons.
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.480]   I mean, the most obvious one is one,
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:53.680]   well, from a business perspective, it's still a very successful,
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:55.440]   large and profitable business.
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.000]   I mean, anything compared to the iPhone is small.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.160]   The Mac compared to any other PC manufacturer is very,
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.400]   very strong and very, very good.
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.200]   - Oh, in it? - And very, very profitable.
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.200]   Relatively what else?
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:10.440]   Two, it kind of raised the question like,
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.480]   well, how are you gonna make apps for the iPhone
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:13.840]   and for the iPad?
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:17.720]   And MIMS, the answer to a follow-up column is like,
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:19.320]   well, you have a really decked out iPad.
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:20.840]   And then Michael, why don't you just change the name?
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.520]   And call it a Mac. - It'll be called a Mac.
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:23.360]   Yeah.
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:24.200]   (laughing)
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.120]   - And then the third point though is
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:32.120]   the big reason why iOS was able to start a fresh,
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:36.520]   why it's able to have a simpler approach
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:39.160]   is because it didn't need to do everything
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:40.440]   'cause there was already something
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.440]   that did everything and that was the Mac.
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:46.440]   The iPad and the iPhone, particularly at the beginning,
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:48.680]   before we knew what these categories were,
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:52.400]   make sense in a world where there already is
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:55.840]   a fully capable, fully thought out tool on one side
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:59.840]   and we can distill the essence into a new product
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:00.760]   on the other.
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.240]   And that need hasn't gone away.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:05.400]   I mean, we're all sitting on Macs right now
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.360]   because to record a podcast on an iPad,
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.280]   well, theoretically possible doesn't make sense.
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.480]   I'm not sure you probably can do a multi-headed recording.
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.480]   That's, or-- - Well, maybe--
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:14.800]   - Okay. - But the reality is,
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.520]   let me mention that this is being recorded
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.520]   on a Windows 7 machine, it'll be edited
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:19.520]   on Windows 8 machine.
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.320]   - Fair enough. - No, fair enough.
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:24.280]   But I mean, the, well, so then the question is,
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.280]   oh, so should Apple use Windows?
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.160]   - Yes. (laughs)
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:31.560]   Why, it's a waste of energy to have both Mac and Windows.
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:32.560]   Let's just pick one.
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:34.880]   - Well, I mean, that's fine.
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:35.880]   You can read that. - Art is coming up
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:38.280]   and it's being stupid. - I'm just being dumb.
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:41.560]   - I'd say that's a slippery slope to a bad idea.
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:42.720]   (laughs)
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:44.520]   - See, some slopes are slippery.
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.320]   You should standardize on arch.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:48.720]   - Hey, yeah, I don't know, I just don't know
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.160]   how much there's to say about this.
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.160]   - No, it's just goofy.
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.960]   Okay, I just, I wanna make sure there's--
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:55.200]   - There's a point, if I could try to make an attempt
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:58.280]   to draw a point out of here, he, I think is major,
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:00.760]   and honestly, I think he's trying to write an article
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:02.320]   that people will click and read.
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:06.240]   - Yeah, let's click that. - But his major premise here
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:07.760]   is that the PC market is dying,
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:11.120]   and I think it's taken, I think he exaggerates that too much.
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:13.960]   If Apple should focus, they should get rid of the iPod,
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:16.040]   which is definitely a dying market.
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:18.360]   - Yeah, there's a good-- - Before they get rid of PCs.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.680]   - Yeah, all right, kill the iPod.
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:23.080]   - But do you think Apple has lost focus?
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.920]   I mean, you could argue that the Apple launch
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:25.840]   should be got rid of.
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.680]   - Well, I mean, I think in a way,
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.920]   the underlying truth of what he's saying is that Apple's
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:33.440]   no longer a technology company, they're a fashion company,
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:36.560]   and that the technology is secondary.
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:37.840]   - I didn't get that from it.
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:40.160]   What I got was the loss of focus argument,
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:42.680]   and I read it during the Gazelle ad, sorry, Gazelle.
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:44.360]   (laughs)
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:45.920]   - That was Google real fast. - That's what we do, yeah.
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:49.000]   - And give you a chance to-- - Yeah, relevant search result,
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.160]   despite being imperfect.
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:55.280]   The loss of focus and the fact that they're trying to do TVs,
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:59.240]   watches, pads and phones, and this desktop device
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:01.960]   that the representation of their revenue is like 9%,
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:04.000]   which he argues they don't need,
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.960]   and they could have kind of redirected all the labor
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:08.600]   going into that 9% to some of these other areas
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:10.600]   they want to master.
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.200]   I would just be happy if they didn't change
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:15.800]   all of our connecting ports all the damn time
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:18.960]   for no particular reason and make ops lead all of my accessories.
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.440]   That'd be really nice if they would do that.
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:23.680]   I don't want them to shut down a whole business unit,
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:27.280]   just have a bit more mercy when you're jumping from USB,
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:30.800]   whatever, the new thing that makes me feel like an idiot.
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:34.120]   - Tom, do you do the movie draft still?
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:34.960]   - Yeah.
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.480]   - Who do you have in the summer movie draft?
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.440]   Did you have Jurassic?
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:42.040]   - No, that was Milongo and Kristi Kate.
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:46.120]   - We had Jurassic World and we, Team DTS was favored to win
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:48.520]   because we did a buy late strategy where we bought
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:50.680]   like seven movies and we thought we'd just win in bulk
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:52.600]   and then Jurassic World came along and screwed everything up.
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:54.800]   - Half a billion dollars?
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.360]   - I got a movie for you.
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:57.200]   - What?
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.000]   - Speaking of slippery slope, that phrase comes up
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.240]   in a new movie called Dope, D-O-P-E.
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:02.080]   - Yeah?
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:06.320]   - It is, it hasn't been marketed like this, I don't think,
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.560]   but I think it's a movie that this audience,
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:10.240]   the toy audience especially would love.
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:15.240]   It is a very geeky, techy movie under the guise
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:18.360]   of these high schoolers who were obsessed with 1990s hip hop
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:21.640]   who find themselves in some tricky situations
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:23.200]   that they have to get themselves out of.
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:26.120]   It's very funny, it's very sharp, satire,
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:29.320]   but it's one of the best uses of tech
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:30.520]   in a very pop culture movie.
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:33.320]   It's not like a deep dive into any aspect of tech,
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:36.280]   it's not about technology, but it integrates it so naturally
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.400]   and it's about how young people are using it
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:39.840]   that I just, when I saw it, I was like, yo,
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.320]   Twit would love this, I have to mention it.
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.040]   So I have no relationship to the movie,
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:44.640]   except that I saw and love it.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:47.360]   - 90% on the Rotten Tomato.
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:50.880]   - It's, I mean, it deserves all the percents that it's got.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:51.720]   - Yeah.
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:52.560]   - Yeah.
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:54.600]   - That should be their model, all the percents.
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:57.840]   - Present day in LA, the problem is they're building it
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.960]   as a teen movie, like a high school movie,
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.560]   but you think it's better than that?
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:06.560]   - I mean, it's about teenagers, but it scales much, much farther.
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:08.920]   I mean, it's basically, it's a music movie
[01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:11.240]   'cause the soundtrack is just killer.
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:14.440]   It is a coming of age, this is about a kid
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:19.000]   trying to get into college and some obstacles
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.800]   that present themselves.
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:23.960]   It's about geeks versus popular kids,
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:26.120]   which I don't know, I just suspect.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:27.200]   - That's a university.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.960]   - We get into the community, I feel some affinity to hoard.
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:32.200]   I'm just hazzeting a crazy guest.
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:35.560]   So I wouldn't say it's a, but it's not a kids movie
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:38.280]   by any, it's a movie for grown people.
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:39.720]   - I'll have to see it.
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:41.360]   I don't even know about it.
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:42.800]   - Yeah, now you do, that's why I'm here.
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:43.640]   That's why I'm here.
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.760]   - Sarah told me about Straight Out Compton too,
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:48.280]   like I'm gonna get really hip and with it
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:50.240]   and down with the kids in the hood.
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:52.960]   - As long as you don't say that again,
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:53.960]   you stand with your hands.
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:55.480]   (laughing)
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:57.120]   - You're on fleek, Leo.
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:57.960]   - What?
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:58.800]   I don't understand.
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:03.560]   So, but the other movie is coming out this weekend,
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:04.840]   the Pixar movie, Inside Out.
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:05.880]   I hear that's pretty good too.
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.720]   Do you have that, Tom?
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:09.680]   - I don't, but I watched it.
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:10.560]   - And?
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:13.480]   - And it's not up to your jerker level, but it's--
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:14.640]   - Oh, I loved up.
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:17.200]   - It's near that and sort of like,
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:20.120]   it's more positive 'cause it's about a child growing up,
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:21.840]   so nobody dies.
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:22.680]   Spoiler alert.
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:25.040]   - I don't know how we got into movies.
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:27.400]   Oh, 'cause I was wondering if you still did the movie draft.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:29.240]   I always enjoyed that.
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:30.520]   Do you do that with Scott?
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:36.000]   - Yes, Scott, Brian, Justin, Brian Ibit,
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.240]   Guy from Queens, Andrew Zarian, they're all in it.
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:41.600]   - Wow, that's a cast of thousands.
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:42.440]   And where would we catch?
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:44.360]   - Inside Out is Brian and Justin's movie.
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:45.200]   - Where would we--
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:47.080]   - Inside Out, where would we catch
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:49.440]   the summer movie draft updates?
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:54.440]   - You could find the statistics at draught.diamondclub.tv.
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.320]   - There you go.
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:57.160]   - What, who's playing--
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:58.000]   - Do you want to talk about Jurassic World?
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.240]   - Is that you, Peritunde?
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:02.000]   Are you watching the dope trailer in the background there?
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.040]   - Sorry, I didn't know that audio was gonna come out
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:06.000]   through the monitor.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.840]   Am I boring you?
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:10.120]   No, I was just trying to share the URL with the chat.
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.600]   - Oh, thank you.
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:15.680]   Let's see what else here.
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:19.280]   You might know a little bit this, Tom,
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.680]   and I don't know if you want to recuse yourself
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:21.960]   'cause of course, Eileen, your wife works
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:24.880]   at the YouTube space in Los Angeles.
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:26.840]   YouTube is building a Twitch killer.
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:30.160]   We hear the YouTube gaming service.
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:33.680]   They tried to buy Twitch, lost out to Amazon,
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:36.440]   which paid a lot for the service.
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:40.040]   YouTube's Twitch killer.
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:42.120]   In fact, here's some pictures of it
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:45.780]   from Ron Amadio at Ours Technica.
[01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:49.360]   So is this, let's play videos?
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.520]   Is that, it seems like that's what this is.
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:52.880]   - Yeah, it's interesting.
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:55.480]   My wife doesn't work on this particular project.
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:56.920]   Omar Wilson was at the launch event.
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:00.120]   We had him on Daily Tech News Show to talk about it.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:04.000]   Basically, YouTube is trying to leverage their advantage
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.120]   of having lots of gameplay footage archived, right?
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:08.960]   - Right, that's where it started, right?
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:09.800]   - That's where it started, right?
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:10.640]   - Yeah.
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.480]   - And they have live streaming for YouTube
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.360]   that is powered through Hangouts,
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.120]   but you can also go directly.
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:18.000]   You don't have to use Hangouts to stream.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.400]   And so they're creating an app.
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:21.120]   It's in beta now, you have to be invited in,
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.840]   but it's gonna launch later this summer
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:25.520]   that will allow you to not only live stream your games,
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:27.360]   but automatically archive them.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.160]   And then the app, as a viewer,
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:32.200]   will let you just drill down by the player.
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:34.520]   You wanna see all the Trump's videos if he's on there.
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:36.280]   You can find them, you can go buy a game,
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:38.440]   if you wanna see all the Hearthstone videos,
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:40.440]   or by publisher if you're into the publisher,
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.440]   so they get some branded money that way too.
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:45.160]   - Donald Trump has, let's play videos?
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:47.240]   - A different Trump, not the one running for president.
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:48.720]   (laughing)
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:53.720]   - Yeah, I've never actually done a full session on Twitch.
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:57.320]   I did visit a friend in Chicago
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.200]   and his young kid showed me Minecraft
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.360]   up close in person for the first time.
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:01.440]   - Oh, that's cool. - It's very exciting.
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:03.920]   I felt hip and cool and what the kids are into.
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:06.440]   Very much on fleek likely to report.
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.560]   But I did like this article is worth reading.
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:11.920]   One, it looked like the best looking interface
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.520]   maybe that Google's ever made.
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:16.920]   It is so not-- - It's seriously better
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:18.080]   than the YouTube interface.
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:21.400]   - Yeah, YouTube is pretty garbage actually.
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:24.560]   And I have lots of love for YouTube,
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.400]   I feel like I have to do a Taylor Swift apology,
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.600]   but this looks so much better than anything YouTube
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:31.960]   has ever done and I was into it for that reason.
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:33.520]   And then yeah, the thing you talk about Tom,
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:36.200]   the way they mind their archives to just populate the system
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:38.800]   was something only Google could do.
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:41.040]   Because they've been indexing information for so long
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.840]   and that was just a very, I don't even know if they thought
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:46.960]   that when they started, when they acquired YouTube
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:49.280]   in the beginning, like eight years from now,
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:50.640]   however many years it's been,
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.920]   we'll be able to launch a service based on what people
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:55.880]   have already shared with us and recontextualize it.
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.680]   That's pretty intelligent.
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:59.480]   - It reminds me a little of Apple Music
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:01.040]   trying to take it away from Spotify.
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:04.080]   You have an incumbent that is very strong.
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:06.920]   - Well, it's actually worse than Spotify.
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:09.360]   I mean, at the end of the day, Spotify--
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:10.320]   - Financially.
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:12.560]   - Yeah, well, one Spotify doesn't have that many users
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:14.360]   in the grand scheme of things.
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:15.360]   Seven million users. - Which has more,
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.960]   I mean, Spotify's got what they said, 75 million.
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.560]   - But I think it's just 20 that they pay.
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:20.880]   - 25 pay.
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:22.440]   - But the issue with Spotify though,
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:26.320]   is in any sort of content you have two sides.
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:27.280]   You have the content production,
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.920]   you have the content consumption.
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:34.720]   Apple will have the same production side as Spotify.
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:37.480]   I think I missed Apple Music discussion, sorry.
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:40.960]   But the whole point why Apple's hands are relatively tight
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:43.640]   here is because music is utterly and completely controlled
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:45.160]   by the labels. - Right.
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:47.880]   - The positive side of that is that Apple immediately
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:49.560]   has the same library that Spotify does.
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:50.400]   - Right.
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:52.360]   - So the production side is the same,
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:55.160]   and then they can do battle for the consumption side.
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:56.600]   And again, Apple has big advantages here.
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:59.680]   They have a built-in, their default,
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:00.840]   but Spotify has big advantages too.
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:02.640]   They have a freeware that Apple doesn't.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:06.160]   And actually, the real kind of important player
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:07.280]   in the room is YouTube,
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:08.920]   which is where, speaking of all the kids,
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:10.760]   that's where they're getting their music.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:13.000]   - All my, both my 20 and 23 year old,
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.240]   that's all they do is watch YouTube.
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.160]   - Unless you're on my Snapchat channel, of course.
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:19.480]   - Yeah, and that's Napa Tunde and YouTube.
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:20.480]   That's all they do.
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:24.280]   - So the issue with YouTube gaming in Twitch
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:26.920]   is that Twitch has a two-sided network going on.
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:29.120]   They have the people who are doing the playing
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:31.080]   and the people who are doing the watching.
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:34.600]   And it's much harder to break into a two-sided network
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:37.720]   'cause you need to get both sides to switch at the same time.
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:40.920]   And a nice interface will help,
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:42.920]   but it's only gonna get you so far.
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:44.800]   So that's why there's been talking about them paying
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.320]   some players, doing some various stuff
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.560]   to give people a switch over,
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:50.240]   which they will need to do.
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:52.600]   Frankly, the big screw up was not buying Twitch.
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:53.680]   It wasn't that expensive.
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:55.240]   It was like 900 million or something.
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:56.080]   - They should've wanted a lot of it.
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:56.920]   - Or something.
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:57.760]   - Yeah.
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:00.080]   - And frankly, this gets to a bigger problem with Google,
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:01.920]   which is they probably have the worst case
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:04.640]   of not invented here syndrome of anyone in the valley.
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:08.480]   And they bought YouTube and look how well
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:09.640]   that turned out for them.
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:11.360]   But for some reason, the lesson that took away
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:12.720]   is we shouldn't do big acquisitions.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:15.400]   We should just copy the weir and try to build it ourselves,
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.120]   which hasn't succeeded at all.
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:19.000]   They should've bought Twitch.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.560]   - No, the social networks are tearing up the charts.
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:22.200]   What are you talking about, Ben?
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:23.720]   - That they should've bought Twitter.
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:25.040]   - They should still buy Twitch.
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:25.880]   - It's six years ago.
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:26.800]   - They should still buy Twitter.
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:28.680]   I think why not now?
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:30.200]   - Well, because when and if they do,
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:32.720]   they're paying 10x what they would've had to pay
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:33.560]   a few years ago.
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:34.600]   - Well, they should've bought it on a cheaper,
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:36.040]   but they can afford Twitter today.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.120]   - For product that Frankly hasn't evolved
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.760]   since they've considered buying it the first time.
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:40.800]   - Sure, I'm not sure what they're paying for.
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:45.720]   - But this is a consistent problem for Google
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:48.960]   and something that Facebook to its credit has learned about
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:51.960]   and done differently is that appreciating like,
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:53.840]   actually for big company,
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:55.160]   when you have your big product,
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:56.440]   your big breakthrough product,
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.280]   the best way you should actually pick through product
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:00.880]   is to use the profits from the first one to buy it.
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:03.960]   This whole bias towards we have to invent it
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:07.880]   and NIH not invented here syndrome is debilitating
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:09.720]   and it's a problem for Google
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:12.200]   and you're seeing it play out right here.
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:13.680]   - Excellent point.
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:18.080]   So really what we're saying is Google gaming
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:22.880]   is compared to a Twitch as maybe Yahoo video
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:24.240]   would be compared to YouTube.
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:26.000]   It's like, it's too late.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.560]   All the creators are at Twitch.
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:29.840]   - Well, except for the better example
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:32.000]   is Google video compared to YouTube.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:32.840]   - Yeah.
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:35.160]   - And there was a non-starter wasn't it?
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:38.720]   - What in Google to their credit figured out recognized?
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:39.640]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:42.720]   And so they went by YouTube and killed Google video.
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:44.560]   - Yeah.
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:49.120]   - The question is whether live streaming e-sports
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:50.560]   is solidified at Twitch.
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:53.920]   If it is, then Ben's absolutely right.
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:56.040]   And what YouTube is gambling on is,
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:59.560]   we are the hard drive that Twitch streamers store to.
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:02.440]   We have PewDiePie and a few other people.
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:05.960]   If we can pay the publishers and the e-sports organizations
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:08.760]   and wrench them away, maybe we have a shot.
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:10.440]   It is still a tall ask though.
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:11.840]   Ben's absolutely right.
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:12.680]   - Right.
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:14.520]   They may succeed, you're right.
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:18.000]   The point is though, I don't think that changes the fact
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.960]   they were wrong to not pay 1.2 billion for Twitch
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:22.360]   or over what you would have taken.
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:23.960]   - What is Amazon gonna do with Twitch?
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:26.040]   Is that a sensible acquisition for Amazon?
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:30.360]   - From what I know of what I've heard,
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:33.640]   it was, let's say Amazon has a,
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:35.400]   and a pair of lot of this is Amazon right this way.
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:37.640]   It was, let's say Amazon has a grand strategic plan
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:41.320]   and like, hey, potential next to the SPN 900 billion,
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:42.160]   sure we'll buy it.
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:43.000]   - We'll take it.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.400]   - Yeah.
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:47.080]   And so I think, as I understand it,
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.200]   that was the primary driver.
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:52.880]   That said, now they're to Tom's point,
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:55.320]   certainly if Twitch needs help building up
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:58.640]   their infrastructure and their hard drive capability,
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.560]   you could hardly ask for a better partner.
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:02.200]   So.
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.000]   - Yeah, I'm surprised we haven't seen more
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.120]   along that lines already.
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:06.720]   But I'm sure we will.
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:09.160]   - And do you think that this whole concept
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.160]   of watching people play video games,
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:13.440]   which I just don't do, I got.
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:14.920]   - You're too old.
[01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:16.520]   - Time allocated to others.
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:18.480]   - No, no, you're too old, man.
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:22.360]   - But it doesn't seem like it's a mature market at all,
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:26.120]   just based on how young the whole idea of it is.
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:26.960]   So the idea that Twitch.
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:28.400]   - But does everybody want millennials?
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:29.960]   Isn't that where all the millennials are?
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:31.560]   - I'm not saying yes or no to that,
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:33.480]   but I just think the idea that Twitch somehow
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:36.640]   has locked it up just doesn't seem sound to me.
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:37.480]   - Oh, you know what?
[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:38.320]   - How young the whole--
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:39.160]   - You're asking the issue.
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:40.520]   - Again, I'm not saying I'm asking that at all.
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:41.360]   - I'm not saying I'm asking that at all.
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:43.160]   - Twitch is my space or Facebook.
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:44.560]   Where in that time?
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:48.400]   - Yeah, like, you know, the challenge that Google will have
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:52.400]   with luring the game broadcasters over feels real
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:54.360]   and very different from the one that Apple has
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:55.360]   of luring musicians over,
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:57.280]   'cause to your point, Ben, it's the same players
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:00.000]   on one side and they're much more portable.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:00.840]   But I just--
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:01.680]   - Yeah, what's true.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:05.560]   - I suspect that the streaming gaming e-sports universe
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:08.640]   is so young that in 15 years, you could be like,
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:09.600]   what was Twitch?
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:10.880]   - Yeah, you might be right.
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:11.720]   'Cause I think about--
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:12.800]   - You might be right.
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:14.280]   - If I think about all the 12 year olds,
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:17.440]   I know every one of them wants to do YouTube Minecraft videos,
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:20.200]   not Twitch, YouTube Minecraft videos.
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:21.400]   - And then they might also,
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:23.120]   I mean, ESPN can come in and buy the whole thing
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.200]   and be like, we have all the sports.
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:27.000]   They'll change their names to all the sports.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:27.840]   - And--
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:29.880]   - Did you guys follow E3 this week?
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.160]   - I feel like E3 is not where a lot of news gets made.
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:34.160]   It's where a lot of game cut scenes for games
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:36.960]   that will be coming out in eight months get seen.
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:38.640]   - It was this year, for sure.
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:40.920]   We didn't have any big hardware announcements.
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:43.600]   In fact, everybody thought we were gonna get more hardware
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.560]   announcements around the virtual reality sets.
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:48.880]   Oculus made their announcement last week.
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:51.280]   And Project Morpheus, they didn't say a whole lot about
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:52.760]   in the Sony announcement.
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:54.680]   The biggest announcement to me is not what everybody else
[01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:56.000]   thinks was the biggest announcement,
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.760]   but it was the project, or Sony's PlayStation View,
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:01.920]   Television Service came to LA in San Francisco,
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:02.840]   so I could finally sign up.
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:03.840]   - Can you see it?
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:05.000]   Are you watching it?
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.680]   - Yeah, yeah, it's an interesting interface.
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:09.840]   It misses all the ABC Disney channels,
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:12.320]   but otherwise it looks like a regular cable service
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:16.400]   with lots of cable channels, and it works really well.
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:19.520]   - In fact, of course, Apple's gonna get all the Disney stuff.
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:21.600]   - Yeah, but the Disney TV has a bunch
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.320]   of the ABC Disney stuff, so if you come,
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:24.360]   we'll just do it together.
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:28.000]   Problem is, Sling TV isn't on Sony, PlayStation 4,
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.840]   so you have to have two devices.
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:32.960]   - So Sony, it's interesting, did kind of beat Apple
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:34.840]   to the punch with this live streaming thing.
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:39.840]   Apple didn't release the new Apple TV at WWDC,
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:43.640]   as everybody thought, and come E3 a week later,
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:47.800]   Sony steals the attention.
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:49.040]   - How about Steam VR?
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:51.800]   I thought a lot of people were very interested in
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:56.280]   this combination between HTC's Vive VR headset
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:59.840]   and Steam, and people I've talked to
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:02.040]   who've tried all of the different VR headsets
[01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:03.480]   are saying this is the one.
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:06.480]   Any thoughts about that?
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:08.440]   Time to do, have you tried the VS team?
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:10.520]   - Haven't tried the Vive, but you're right.
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:12.040]   Everybody I know who's tried it, say--
[01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:13.040]   - They're called crazy.
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:14.400]   - It's great.
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.920]   Everybody likes the new Oculus as well.
[01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.880]   The Vive is gonna beat the Oculus to market
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:21.400]   if they hit their date, and that might give them
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:23.320]   a little bit of an advantage there.
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:25.040]   But they didn't make any big announcements.
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:26.880]   The biggest announcements around the Steam VR
[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:28.960]   was that Microsoft said they would support it,
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:31.080]   but of course Valve didn't really say much about it,
[01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:33.240]   and it ended up being more about,
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:34.840]   well, it'll work on Windows machines,
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:35.680]   is what it sounds like.
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:37.560]   - Microsoft showed once again,
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:39.840]   and they've done it now three times,
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:44.080]   a look at their augmented reality, HoloLens glasses,
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:47.040]   and again, the complaints that it's just a little slot
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:48.200]   you're looking through.
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:49.520]   In fact, some people were a little upset
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:52.000]   at the Microsoft video that they showed
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.800]   at the Xbox One press conference,
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:57.760]   because it implied that you had a much bigger field of view.
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:59.520]   They showed a guy looking at a table
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:03.200]   and his Minecraft castle is emerging from the table.
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:05.160]   They didn't show it the way the guy was seeing it,
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:07.240]   which is like looking through a cereal box.
[01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:11.680]   - Some of the people who played that Minecraft thing
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:13.200]   said it was still pretty cool even though
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:14.280]   it was a limited field of view.
[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:15.120]   - It seems cool.
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:16.440]   - It got mixed reviews.
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:17.280]   - Mixed.
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:18.280]   - All right.
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:19.120]   - Anything else?
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:21.040]   - The biggest thing about E3 was the Fallout shelter app
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.320]   for iOS.
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:23.880]   - That is an awesome app.
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:24.720]   - It's really good.
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:26.600]   - Bethesda's not dumb because of course
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:29.680]   they're marketing Fallout 4, which will come out
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:31.280]   not for a month or so, right?
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:32.280]   August, I think.
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:34.520]   Or is it not till next year?
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:36.000]   I can't, see this is the problem with E3.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.280]   You look at this stuff and it's like,
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:39.360]   oh, I got to wait eight months for this.
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:42.360]   Fallout 4 and the Pip Boy edition.
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:43.320]   - November 10th. - Just give 10th.
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:44.160]   - November.
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:48.640]   - I don't know, I mean, I think this is a little,
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:51.080]   the conversation is a little dismissive
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:54.280]   for an industry that is, I think, $92 billion.
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:55.120]   - Yikes.
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.520]   - Larger than movies and music combined,
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:58.360]   I believe. - Yikes.
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:00.560]   - Or at least it's close to it.
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:03.240]   And we don't have a problem with movies
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:05.120]   showing trailers a year in advance.
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:06.040]   - No, it happens all the time.
[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.680]   - Banana's about the Star Wars trailer.
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:08.840]   - Yep.
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:12.320]   - So, I guess, from my, I don't know,
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:15.280]   from my estimation, it seemed to be a pretty,
[01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:19.640]   a pretty positive E3 by and large.
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:22.640]   And the hardware is, I mean, the hardware is what it is.
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:25.000]   It's gonna come out every five, six, seven years.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000]   I think what's interesting is that,
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:33.560]   I think people in tech just have never really taken gaming
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:35.560]   probably as seriously as they should.
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:37.040]   And everyone, including me at one point,
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.680]   has been like prophesying its doom
[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.680]   in the face of phones and all this sort of stuff.
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:44.160]   And the reality is, is it provides,
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:46.440]   particularly this high-end sort of gaming that,
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:48.280]   again, we're all probably too old to figure out
[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:51.120]   the 47 buttons that you need to do it.
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:55.240]   It provides a very differentiated experience
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:58.800]   that people are deminocs to really willing to pay for,
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.520]   just as people are willing to pay for movies
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:02.640]   and willing to pay for high-quality TV.
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:05.400]   And I think once you view it through that lens,
[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:07.360]   the entire conference and industry
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:09.680]   starts to make a lot more sense.
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:10.760]   - Yeah, there were some big game on us,
[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:12.760]   but you're absolutely right, Ben.
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:15.200]   If there was a criticism, it was that we saw a lot of sequels
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:16.760]   and especially under Sony,
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:17.880]   a lot of those big names--
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:18.720]   - It's like a movie industry.
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:19.560]   - It's like a movie industry.
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:20.480]   - It's like the movie industry.
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:22.080]   - But yeah, it is very similar.
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:24.840]   I think, though, you should play Fallout Shelter on iOS.
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:25.680]   - It's awesome.
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:27.800]   - Because then I think you still might agree
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:29.640]   that that was the biggest thing to come out of.
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:31.440]   - Oh, how about Cuphead?
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:33.080]   Come on, you gotta love Cuphead, too.
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:34.560]   That's like-- - Cuphead looks pretty--
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:35.600]   - Cuphead looks awesome.
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:37.800]   It's like a night-- - It's like--
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:40.360]   - I've never played this Fallout-- - Oh, it's awesome.
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:41.720]   - Should I--
[01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:44.320]   Will I have to have played it on a console for the iOS game?
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:46.040]   - No, it's iPad. - It's not a label.
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:47.280]   - No, the whole idea is--
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:48.120]   - It's kind of a-- - It's kind of a--
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:51.120]   - It's a sim for your Fallout Shelter,
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:52.520]   and there's the prequel to Fallout 4,
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:54.480]   'cause the whole point of Fallout 4 is you've been
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:56.680]   in a Fallout Shelter for 100 years,
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:59.560]   and you come out and you emerge into this dystopian world,
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:02.440]   but at least until that happens in November,
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:06.000]   we can manage our Fallout Shelter by--
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.840]   And I love that Bethesda's really--
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:09.040]   - It was like a disaster prep app.
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:10.520]   I like that. - Yeah, disaster prep.
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:11.360]   Everything you need to know--
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:15.920]   - Is there a hurricane sandbag tossing app as well
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:16.920]   that we can get out there?
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:17.760]   - You're good.
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:19.280]   - By the way, I'm told now--
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:21.400]   - I'm just kidding. - Sorry, Leo, it's 200 years
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:22.720]   you're stuck in your Fallout Shelter,
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:25.120]   not 100 years, so don't get that straight.
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.040]   - So there you go.
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:26.880]   Here's--
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:28.560]   So you're playing this like crazy, Tom?
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:29.720]   - Yeah, I played it all weekend.
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:31.520]   (laughing)
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:33.200]   - I have to say, I've had it on my iPad for one.
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:34.040]   It's really fun.
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:36.280]   Unfortunately, I have to now log in the game center
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:38.040]   to get my game, so I'll just--
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:41.440]   I don't remember the code for my Fallout Shelter.
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:42.680]   Yeah.
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:43.520]   Let's take a break.
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:45.280]   We're gonna talk about the future of Twitter.
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:48.000]   It's a little bit up in the air,
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.720]   a little bit, little teeny-weeny bit up in the air,
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:54.480]   but first a word, from personal capital.
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:57.680]   If you are like a lot of people,
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:01.240]   you're putting, I hope, putting money aside
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:03.800]   for your future, for your rainy day fun,
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:07.440]   for your retirement, but if you're like a lot of geeks,
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:09.760]   you're probably doing one or two things either,
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:11.080]   and I think most geeks don't do this,
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:14.560]   but maybe you've hired an investment advisor
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:16.920]   and maybe you weren't really thinking about it,
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:20.520]   but often cases, that guy's really just a salesman.
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:23.600]   His whole goal is to get you to trade more to buy stocks
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:25.640]   so he can make more money.
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:27.680]   Or, see, this is what I did.
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:32.640]   Oh no, I'll do it all myself using a online service
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:34.760]   and I'll pay close attention then and you forget
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:36.920]   and you just pay no attention to your investment
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:38.680]   and you don't know what's happening.

[01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:59.000]   but where your investments are going
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.960]   and where years are being shaved off your retirement
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:06.000]   by hidden costs, brokerage fees,
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.600]   high load mutual funds, things like that.
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:10.480]   It'll also help you keep track of,
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:12.800]   and this is really important, your asset allocation,
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:16.880]   so that you make sure that as your portfolio works
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:18.800]   and you gain, you rebalance it,
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:21.640]   so you make sure that everything is properly done
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:25.280]   for your timeframe, for your, when you retire,
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:27.720]   your risk tolerance, what your goals are and all of that.
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:29.000]   It makes it easy to do that.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.320]   They have an Apple Watch app that'll give you alerts.
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:33.840]   They have an Android Wear app, same thing.
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:36.040]   It's available for desktop, for mobile, for tablet
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:37.880]   and this is free.
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:40.120]   And by the way, very secure, don't worry.
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:42.600]   It's absolutely secure to do this.
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:44.880]   You can open your free account, link your investments

[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:50.840]   in real time in one secure place.
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:52.160]   It's got, I think this is true,
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:54.880]   it's like a fitness tracker for your finances.
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:57.480]   Now, let's talk about the financial advisor side of it,
[01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:00.920]   because if you do have a salesman as a stockbroker,
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:04.000]   you're really getting terrible advice.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.320]   I'm gonna be honest.
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:08.280]   The financial advisors at Personal Capital
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:12.160]   have a fiduciary responsibility for your best interest.
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:14.560]   They do not work on commission.
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:16.280]   They work for you.
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:19.400]   They are set up carefully to avoid any conflict of interest.
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:21.920]   So in fact, you're getting great advice.
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:23.440]   You can even take advantage of it for free.
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:26.960]   If you put $100,000 or more into your assets
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:28.360]   on the Personal Capital Dashboard,
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:31.480]   and that's a lot easier than you think if you've been saving,
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:34.640]   you'll get a free 30 minute review of your financial goals,
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:37.560]   your risk tolerance, get to know a financial advisor.
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:38.760]   They'll help you with your time,
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:40.320]   horizon and your retirement planning.
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:43.280]   And that is absolutely free with no obligation,
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:46.880]   no pressure, nothing like that.
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:48.080]   And if you decide later,
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:49.600]   you can invest with Personal Capital,
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:51.480]   but we don't even have to talk about that.
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:52.880]   Do the free stuff now.
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:57.880]   Personalcapital.com/tuit,
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:28:59.680]   oh, what to yourself to do this?
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:01.000]   It does not take a lot of work.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.160]   I did it two years ago.
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:03.120]   I couldn't be happier.
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:05.280]   It really made a big difference for me.
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:08.360]   And if you'd put more than $100,000 of assets
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:10.600]   on the Dashboard, you can get that free,
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:13.680]   no obligation, no cost portfolio consultation as well.
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:18.040]   Personalcapital.com/tuit.
[01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:22.480]   It's been a great way to keep track of what's going on
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:23.320]   with my money.
[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:26.040]   And I'm very grateful to Bill Harris
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:27.360]   for telling me all about it.
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:31.080]   Moving on, Twitter, new CEO.
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:33.600]   Well, Jack Dorsey's in right now and his beard
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:37.480]   in charge of Twitter at the moment.
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:40.880]   Dick Costello will, actually not at the moment,
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:42.040]   Dick Costello will be stepping down
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:43.840]   at the end of the month.
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:46.880]   He will still be on the board with Jack Dorsey,
[01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:49.200]   and Evan Williams, those will be fun meetings.
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:50.880]   - See, it's the CEO club.
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:53.320]   - It's the club, all the guys.
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:55.760]   And if you've read Nick's book,
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:58.000]   they don't all get along, do they?
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.600]   - Well, when they're on the board, maybe they do.
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:01.240]   They equalize it at that point.
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:03.000]   - Yeah, they have a couple of whiskies.
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.960]   - Vodka, Vodka drink, they have a whiskey drink.
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:11.240]   Some of this comes from Chris Saka, right?
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:12.760]   And he's an investor in Twitter,
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:16.960]   and he wrote a kindly but strongly worded memorandum
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:19.160]   about what should happen.
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:22.480]   Twitter is responding to market pressures,
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:25.600]   'cause the market's been slowly beheading people
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:29.640]   at the sea level in the Twitter boardrooms
[01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:31.400]   and finally got to Dick Costello.
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:32.480]   Everybody likes, do you know Dick?
[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:34.440]   You must know Embarrant Sunday.
[01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:36.760]   - I have, I don't know him, I know of him.
[01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:38.320]   - Yeah, it really loves him.
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:41.000]   He's fun. - He's excited to have a comedian
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.560]   as the CEO of a major Silicon Valley company.
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:45.080]   - It's about time.
[01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:48.960]   - But I guess no more clowns in charge now.
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:49.960]   But yeah, I think he did good.
[01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:50.880]   And I like this tone.
[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:54.520]   I think when he came out publicly and said,
[01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:57.480]   we're doing a bad job as Twitter at dealing with--
[01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:58.800]   - And it's my fault.
[01:30:58.800 --> 01:30:59.800]   And it's my fault. - Right.
[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:00.640]   I loved it that he said that.
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:01.480]   - Don't see that.
[01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:02.880]   I mean, again, from whether it's business
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:05.160]   or political leaders, people usually try to dodge,
[01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:07.880]   they have scapegoats, they blame the machines.
[01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:09.960]   And I just think he owned it.
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:11.760]   And that was really great.
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:13.800]   But in his Q&A and the articles
[01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:15.640]   that you're starting to talk about,
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:17.680]   he also, I tend to believe him.
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:18.960]   Like he's like, look, I've been here six years.
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:20.400]   We want to keep this thing going.
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:21.840]   I'm not dead yet.
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:23.560]   He had a little kind of a Monty Python moment
[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:26.560]   in the interview saying I'll still be very much involved,
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:27.680]   still on the board.
[01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:30.120]   And let's see what comes next.
[01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:32.840]   I like the hints of what's coming next
[01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:37.840]   and I got a share of very strange personal connection
[01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:39.200]   to this story.
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:40.960]   I know I'm not the new CEO.
[01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:42.240]   - I know where you're going with this
[01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:44.240]   'cause even Jason loved this.
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:45.760]   Jason Calicannis wrote an article
[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:47.760]   on what he would do.
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:48.600]   - Yeah.
[01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:49.440]   - And for reasons I don't understand,
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:51.040]   you decided to record it.
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:53.040]   - So he wrote this essay, Jason said,
[01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:56.520]   what I would do if I were CEO of Twitter, a seven part plan.
[01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:59.000]   I got an email, he sends this out in his email newsletter.
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.400]   It happened to open, I rarely open email newsletters,
[01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:04.560]   but it was like one in the morning, I thought, why not?
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:05.880]   And I saw, I shared it.
[01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:08.680]   I liked it so much that I shared it out on Twitter.
[01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:11.240]   And someone responded to me and Jason saying,
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:12.960]   basically it's too long.
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:15.080]   Jason needs to make an audio book version.
[01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:17.160]   And so now it's maybe 1.20 AM
[01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:19.280]   and I decide what better to do with my time
[01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:22.320]   than to report aloud this article
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:25.320]   offering audio commentary along the way,
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:27.080]   basically an audio annotated version
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:29.840]   of me dramatically reenacting this essay
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:32.480]   on the hypothetical CEO of Twitter.
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:35.200]   Then that hit another chain in the link,
[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:38.600]   another link in the chain, a man named Mark Eglan
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:41.720]   created an app on product hunt
[01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:46.720]   to support the idea of getting audio versions of TechSH
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:47.560]   wanna read.
[01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:50.520]   So if you visit baritunde, but it's.de,
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:54.240]   so b-a-r-a-t-u-n.de,
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:57.600]   you can sign up to kind of be a little bit about this.
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:01.440]   - Future readings that I might do of other articles out there.
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:02.960]   And not just me, this is not just a certain--
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:04.360]   - Can I do one?
[01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:05.200]   - Of course you can.
[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:07.560]   I think we can turn this into a thing though.
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:08.960]   - No, did you-- - And I know so many people.
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:10.080]   - Did you do some comedy?
[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:11.200]   I mean, what did you do with this?
[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:12.080]   Did you read it straight?
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:13.360]   Did you read it in Jason's?
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:16.240]   - Like I said, I gave, I didn't do his voice,
[01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:20.480]   but I did mock him a bit for some of the commentary
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:21.800]   that he had in there.
[01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:23.720]   He just drops first names of CEOs like,
[01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:24.560]   - Oh yeah.
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:26.480]   - Like one club, I don't know who you're talking about, buddy.
[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:29.520]   So I would think of them as audio annotations.
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:31.360]   It was like a MST3000.
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:32.680]   (laughing)
[01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:34.800]   - We have a, are you hearing this?
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:36.000]   I think I'm playing it a little bit.
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.480]   - There's an entry to click to tweet.
[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:40.600]   And he lets you know you can edit the tweet
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:43.520]   before you send it, which is great,
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:45.000]   'cause it's not really click to tweet.
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000]   - I want this new beer attended, it take off.
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.760]   B-A-R-A-N. - I like that.
[01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:49.600]   That's very--
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:52.560]   - B-A-R-A-T-U-N.de.
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:54.400]   - Back to that.
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.480]   - Big, big love to Mark Eglin.
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:57.320]   - I love this.
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:33:59.640]   - He actually launched all this without talking to me
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:01.320]   initially, and he emailed me, he was like,
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:02.840]   "Rik, will you okay with this?"
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:04.400]   And I just kinda think about it.
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:07.400]   I think the service's name will likely change,
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:10.600]   but I'm happy to co-incubate the concept.
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:12.240]   And I like reading.
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:14.560]   I have a Frederick Douglass talk.
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:15.440]   I did my fast company,
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:16.280]   - Oh, I'm saying.
[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:18.040]   - I'm plugging all my soundcloud.
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:19.920]   To help again see the service and see where this goes.
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:23.480]   I know so many people who insta paper long reads
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:24.800]   and never get to them.
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:27.160]   And so, nice to be able to kinda take it.
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:28.560]   And speech to the text.
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:30.680]   I'm sorry, text to speech isn't sexy.
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:32.640]   Like I used it a lot 'cause my eyes were all messed up
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:33.840]   from the surgery. - No.
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:36.120]   - And those voices, even the ones that you download
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:38.280]   that are like a gig on your phone,
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:40.000]   they're nothing like what you can get
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.280]   from an impassioned actual human voice.
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:44.840]   - But I think there really is something to be said
[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:46.800]   for reading Jason out loud.
[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:48.600]   (laughing)
[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:49.680]   He gives you a lot of material.
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:51.160]   - It gives you a lot.
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:53.320]   - You know, I would be mad at this,
[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:56.160]   'cause you should have registered baratun.de.
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:57.600]   - Oh, well, so there's a history there.
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:59.800]   And this is why I'm actually very happy with Mark.
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:01.160]   I used to own that domain name.
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:02.000]   - Oh.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.680]   - When Bitly started offering custom short URLs,
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:07.680]   I created baratun.de as my short URL
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:09.480]   for anything I wanted. - Oh.
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:12.320]   - I lapsed and let the domain expire.
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:16.520]   Some German spam harassing a horrible company got it.
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:17.920]   And I was like, well, I don't care
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:20.120]   but once you lose something, you justify.
[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:21.800]   Like I didn't care about that anyway.
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:24.400]   And then he basically brought it back into orbit.
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:26.200]   So it's like in the family again.
[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:30.240]   And again, he's marked with a C, egg-lun.
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:31.400]   He's been great.
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:33.960]   And I think people should check it out.
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:36.240]   I hope he continues to run with it.
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:39.560]   - Instead of auto-tune the news, it's baratun.de news.
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:41.820]   (laughing)
[01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:45.000]   - Oh, so, so, baratun. - Baratun.de news.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.600]   - Baratun.de news.
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:48.600]   That is the jam.
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:49.640]   - Damn.
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:50.480]   - I really liked that.
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:51.320]   I really liked that.
[01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:53.120]   - I mean, it comes with a word Smith.
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:54.640]   (laughing)
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:56.920]   - Baratun the news.
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:58.280]   - So, we're back to Twitter though.
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:01.760]   I mean, the substance of what they're starting to talk about
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:04.920]   with this idea of, what are they calling it, lightning?
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:06.120]   - Lightning.
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:08.200]   - The idea of packaging up live events.
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:10.640]   I mean, Twitter is where so many of us go.
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:12.560]   I mean, the whole idea of tweeting about your sandwich
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:15.040]   really is not what it's been about for a very long time.
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:16.920]   Though it's so easily mocked for all that.
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:18.760]   But when the NBA finals are happening,
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:19.600]   when there's a shooting.
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:21.360]   - That's when you go to Twitter.
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:24.080]   - When the World Cup is up or the Super Bowl,
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:25.880]   you wanna go to that water cooler.
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:28.840]   And they're basically saying that they're gonna take
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:32.200]   an editorial role in packaging up that event
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:35.360]   from Vine, Periscope, and Twitter,
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:39.280]   and creating a stream almost like a Snapchat story.
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:41.680]   This is my first thought when I started reading about it.
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:45.080]   That will be viable whether you're logged in or not.
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:47.280]   I'll work in a Twitter app or the website
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:50.640]   and can be embedded ultimately in other people's sites.
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:53.120]   And then they'll let that publishing tool open
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:54.760]   so that folks can make their own.
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:56.160]   I love this.
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:58.880]   It basically takes storeify, turns it up,
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:02.960]   5,000 notches, and you have a different window
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:06.080]   into an experience that only a tool like Twitter
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:06.920]   could be mining.
[01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:09.320]   And the way that Google minded videos on YouTube
[01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:11.560]   to create this game streaming service, Twitter's kind of--
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:15.520]   - Credit to Matt Honan for the scoop in Buzzfeed
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:18.080]   of lightning, which is not out yet,
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:19.080]   but makes a lot of sense.
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:20.680]   Anybody's been following Twitter realizes
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:21.960]   that's where Twitter's strength is.
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:25.600]   You think this is the right thing for Twitter to do, Ben?
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:29.600]   - It's the right thing to do, but it's the wrong timing,
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:30.600]   the wrong delivery.
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:34.440]   I agree with the earlier comments
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:37.640]   that Costell Dessert's credit for his comments
[01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:40.680]   about how Twitter's handled abuse.
[01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:42.200]   I would ask why it took so long.
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:46.920]   - Or, and whether they've done enough even yet.
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:49.680]   - Yeah, I mean, the current tool is pretty rough
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:50.800]   that they released, even if they--
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:53.440]   - Yeah, there's still a lot of abuse on Twitter.
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:55.760]   - Yeah, well, the big problem for Twitter though,
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:58.920]   I mean, not to say that's not a problem,
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:00.700]   but the big problem for Twitter and for
[01:38:00.700 --> 01:38:03.480]   Dick Costell specifically, and I actually wrote,
[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:06.560]   I don't like doing this, but I wrote a piece
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:11.560]   at being amazing that Twitter needed to change its leadership.
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:15.280]   And the reason I said they needed to do that was because
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:18.240]   Dick Costell had lost credibility,
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:20.320]   and he'd lost credibility long since
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:23.120]   with third party developers, that's well documented.
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:24.160]   - Well, that's not Dick's fault,
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:26.640]   they lost them before Dick came along, didn't he?
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:28.720]   - No, Dick's been charged in 2010.
[01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:31.960]   - So he's the guy who stripped away the third party.
[01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:33.160]   - Yes, yes.
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:35.920]   - Seems like that was Twitter strategy for some time.
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:37.960]   - But he's not.
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:39.920]   - It changed under him.
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:43.040]   - Okay, two, you say that Wall Street's been chasing
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:47.000]   after executives, Wall Street hasn't been causing
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:52.000]   the carousel of executives that has happened under Costello,
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:55.360]   most damagingly when it comes to the head of product,
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:57.320]   which has been cycled through regularly.
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:01.440]   They hired someone last year who had tweeted 72 times ever
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:03.840]   the format of Google Maps.
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:06.680]   And finally, I think they found someone good
[01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:09.280]   with Kevin Will, who I think has been doing a good job,
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:12.320]   but the reality is there had been a loss of credibility
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:15.480]   when it comes to just the day to day management
[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:17.600]   of the company, and I think you saw that reflected
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:18.760]   in Twitter, all this turmoil.
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:20.800]   I mean, Twitter has had a history of turmoil,
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:24.600]   and to some degree, Costello settled that down,
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:27.280]   but the fact that there is is there was wholesale changes
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:29.600]   in the executive suite every year still.
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:32.760]   And the third thing though, the most damaging one,
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:35.920]   at least for him specifically was with the last
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:38.400]   earnings report, they lost credibility with Wall Street,
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:43.080]   and they had sold this story that our slow user numbers
[01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:45.760]   are okay because we're growing revenue like crazy,
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:47.600]   but then the revenue slowed.
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:52.600]   And the problem is you can do a pivot in a turnaround
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:57.400]   as a public company, sorry,
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:00.360]   that's the most recent analysis as the item of luck.
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:01.360]   I get the new link.
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:03.240]   - I should just subscribe, that's what it is.
[01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:05.920]   I should just pay for the newsletter.
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:08.320]   It's only $100 a year for crying out loudly.
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:09.400]   Don't be so cheap.
[01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:16.600]   The problem though is, as long as Costello was in charge,
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:19.120]   they weren't gonna have the room and freedom
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:22.480]   to do the sort of innovations and product changes
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:24.880]   that they need to do.
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:29.880]   And so the weird thing though is this is all a timing thing.
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:32.960]   When it comes to building technology,
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:36.320]   we all know it takes years before you actually see
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:38.440]   the finished product and it come out.
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:40.680]   And so the stuff that's happening,
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:43.400]   so the problem though is that works on the other side.
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:46.000]   The problems that Costello had with the last earnings report
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.520]   and over the last several months,
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:51.360]   those seeds were sown a couple years ago
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:52.800]   and he's just reaping them now.
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:55.440]   Now it may be the case that Twitter's already
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:57.720]   turned the corner and that they turned the corner
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:01.440]   under Costello and in that respect,
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:03.920]   it's not fair that he has to go now
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:06.480]   and Twitter is now making the source of changes
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:08.560]   and releasing products they need to do.
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:10.120]   Unfortunately, life isn't fair.
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:15.120]   He's reaping kind of the perception matters
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:19.560]   and the perception is that Twitter is struggling now.
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:21.720]   Again, even if the struggles now are manifestations
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:23.920]   of struggles from two years ago internally.
[01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:26.360]   And so I think it was right for him to go.
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:30.600]   And my problem with this lightning release now
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:33.480]   is it's not even gonna be ready for a few months.
[01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:36.960]   So why not hold off on it, let the new CEO come in
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:40.200]   whoever it may be and then release all these new products?
[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:41.360]   Like, wow, it's fantastic.
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:43.560]   And of course we all know all those products were started
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:45.640]   before the new CEO came on board.
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:49.040]   But like the story you tell matters, perception matters
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:53.000]   and I would love to have seen them usher in the new CEO
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.440]   with the sense of momentum and things are going forward
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:57.960]   and extend the grace period that any new CEO gets
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:00.120]   by a few months, by a few quarters.
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:02.640]   And so I'm a little, like I think in general,
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:04.240]   there's lots of stuff going in the right direction
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:08.640]   for Twitter, but as usual, it's just kind of a jumbled mess.
[01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:09.640]   I now have the other one.
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:10.840]   - I have the entire log.
[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:11.720]   - No, that's good.
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:13.680]   I think you make actually an excellent point.
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:15.640]   I didn't realize that Costello had been running
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:18.520]   the place since 2010.
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:20.080]   - Yeah, he came out as a COO in 2009
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:21.200]   and took over a CEO in 2010.
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:25.840]   - And so it's entirely his doing to abandon
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:27.960]   the third party developers, the developers that made
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:31.760]   Twitter the success they were and pull it back in.
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:32.840]   I understand why they did it.
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:34.520]   They wanted to monetize the website
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:36.200]   and monetize their own apps.
[01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:39.760]   - And you see a lot of other companies doing the same thing.
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:43.240]   So there's no guarantee other executives wouldn't have done
[01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:46.040]   the same thing, but yeah, that's really interesting insights,
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:47.880]   Ben, because from the outside, it always looks like
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:49.400]   Twitter's fairly stable.
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:52.520]   It's not burning up the charts, but it's got, you know,
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:53.720]   some monthly active users.
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:56.040]   It seems to be finding interesting ways to make revenue.
[01:42:56.040 --> 01:42:58.720]   And then you hear about all of these things going on inside,
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:00.400]   which are just utter turmoil.
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:02.480]   I think if you get the right person in charge
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:06.560]   that can actually stabilize that personality aspect
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:10.320]   of running the business, Twitter is in really good health.
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:11.880]   Otherwise, no?
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:13.440]   - Yeah, I mean, to a degree they are.
[01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:16.640]   I mean, again, their revenue continues to grow
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:18.480]   even with the shortfall last quarter.
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:20.080]   It could use to grow very, very well.
[01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:22.360]   And they're a $2 billion company.
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:25.440]   The struggle, the challenge for Twitter is
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:28.800]   there's a question as to what's the ceiling on that
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:33.000]   in particular because their user growth numbers have stalled
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.920]   and or slowed down significantly.
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:38.640]   And the concern for that is there are close to,
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:40.080]   at least according to Chris Saka's post,
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:42.400]   last week, no publicly, it's 700 million.
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:45.640]   Chris Saka said close to a billion abandoned accounts.
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:48.240]   And the reason why that's so challenging
[01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:51.280]   is usually the struggle for a company
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:55.200]   is to make themselves, make users aware of their product
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:56.760]   and get them to try it.
[01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:58.320]   Twitter doesn't have that problem.
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:00.080]   Everyone knows about Twitter.
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:03.000]   And by the numbers, everyone has tried Twitter
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.880]   and the vast majority of people decided it's not for me.
[01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:08.040]   And the challenge is it's much harder
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:09.760]   to get someone to give you a second chance
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:12.680]   than it is to get them to give you a first chance.
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:14.160]   And that's why Twitter spends a lot of time
[01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:15.520]   talking about logged out users
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:17.760]   and all the other users we reach
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:19.960]   because there is real concern.
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:22.560]   They may have missed the boat when it comes to
[01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:25.720]   getting everyone on the service regularly.
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:29.040]   But if Twitter is becoming more of,
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:30.280]   the direction that they're going with,
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:31.280]   with the lightning thing,
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:33.400]   and honestly with what Jason proposed,
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:36.280]   they focus on in his piece that I most identified with,
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:39.840]   which was video and more of a broadcast service.
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:41.320]   Twitter is full of lurkers.
[01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:44.440]   And there's basically a read-only mode
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:47.200]   that the majority of people engage with.
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:50.920]   And so they don't need people to come back as users
[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:53.960]   in the same way that the TV network,
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:57.160]   just any viewers more so if they're really
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:44:59.800]   becoming your window on what's happening right now,
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:02.440]   or your window on the key events and trends of the world.
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:05.760]   So that relationship is not the Facebook user
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:07.880]   uploading all of their baby photos
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:11.400]   and personal information to be shared with a close network.
[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:13.560]   It is the television viewer, it's the film goer,
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:14.400]   it's the music listener.
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:15.240]   - That's an excellent point.
[01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:17.560]   Those billion people might come back as viewers,
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:19.160]   as consumers, not as creators,
[01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:20.840]   and you don't care if they're creators.
[01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:22.560]   - Yeah, but the problem is those viewers
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:24.880]   not logged in are worth a fraction of what they are
[01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:27.480]   if they're logged in because they can't be tracked
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:28.320]   and they can't be served.
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:29.160]   - They're seeing the ads.
[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:30.640]   - They're seeing the ads.
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:32.120]   No, it's fine.
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:34.320]   It's a perfectly fine business.
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:35.520]   The problem is it's a business
[01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:37.640]   that doesn't justify their current valuation.
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:39.480]   The current valuation is based on the idea
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:41.840]   they will have a large base of users
[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:44.760]   that they are logged in, that they understand.
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:46.640]   Twitter has a very fascinating insight
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:50.040]   onto its logged in users 'cause it understands your interests,
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:52.400]   which is even more compelling than the people
[01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:54.360]   that you know or the number of babies I have.
[01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:56.320]   The problem is that's what their valuation
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:58.000]   has primarily been based on,
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:02.560]   and the reality is they may be more of a broadcast network,
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:05.240]   which is a fine business, but that's the business Yahoo is in.
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:08.360]   And last I checked, Yahoo isn't worth $25 billion.
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:10.160]   - Although it's also the business YouTube is in,
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:12.920]   so it sounds to me like Twitter just needs to get on,
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:14.520]   figuring out how to get people to log in
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:16.920]   for reasons other than posting.
[01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:20.880]   - And maybe the answer is that Google absorbs its users
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:22.280]   and now you're always logged in
[01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:23.960]   'cause we're always logged into Google.
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:27.920]   And so they, Google now actually becomes Google now,
[01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:31.080]   which is Twitter, and whatever they're calling Google now
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:33.440]   is it becomes some other smart recommendation thing.
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:35.480]   But this is happening right now, check it out.
[01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:37.360]   - You know that if Google bought Twitter,
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:40.480]   it would be gone in five months.
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:41.480]   No, I don't think that's true.
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:43.440]   Well, first off, Yahoo is worth $25 billion,
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:44.520]   but that's 'cause of Alibaba.
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:46.240]   I was talking with you, Korea, who business.
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:48.120]   But two, yeah, you guys just said the point,
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:51.040]   YouTube, Google, the whole point of Google+
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:52.840]   and why Google+ was much more of a success
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:57.840]   than people realize is the big overarching thing
[01:46:57.840 --> 01:46:59.960]   was the architectural changes to Google sites
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:02.240]   to make them all have a shared common login
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:04.280]   and to make sure we're logged in all the time.
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:05.120]   - Right, right.
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:06.960]   - And shared data. - It actually turns out
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:10.120]   five years ago, most people weren't logged in most of the time.
[01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:13.280]   Now they all are, and so Google is building
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:18.280]   that profile of you that is super duper valuable.
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:24.200]   And so it's not like YouTube for that reason alone.
[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:25.760]   Very interesting.
[01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:29.880]   Boy, I'm glad I just paid $100 to get Stretecory.
[01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:31.480]   (laughing)
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:33.280]   Seriously, great insights.
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:35.920]   - And I should explain, especially to my fellow guests
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:38.840]   and hosts, I have sunglasses on now.
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:40.160]   - 'Cause of the PRK.
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:42.560]   - Because I'm cool. - Yeah.
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:45.160]   - And then second because of the surgery.
[01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:47.680]   - Yeah, I just turned up a monitor to get some light
[01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:50.040]   and that was causing discomfort.
[01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:51.800]   - You had me at cool.
[01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:55.440]   - Yeah, I'm trying to pull off a Terminator kind of look
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:57.320]   since we were talking about the future.
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:59.400]   - So it's cool and also bionic eyes.
[01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:00.640]   (laughing)
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:04.200]   - Yeah, I mean, they're basically the same term.
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:05.960]   - Speaking of Jason Calicanis, he's actually,
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:07.640]   I'm going on vacation for three,
[01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:08.880]   count 'em three weeks.
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:10.640]   - What? - Coming.
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:11.480]   - What? I know.
[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:12.320]   - That is awesome.
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:14.480]   - Next week, Becky Worley will host Ian Thompson
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:17.080]   and David Prager will join her.
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:18.680]   For the fourth of July weekend, July 5th,
[01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:20.600]   Jason Calicanis will host, we don't know
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:22.320]   who he's gonna invite.
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:24.560]   I hope it's not that Ross fellow,
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:27.800]   but we know he will be here hosting the show
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:30.040]   and Kevin Rose will be doing it on July 12th.
[01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:32.480]   You can ask him about his move to New York City.
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:35.040]   He's now the CEO of Haudinkey.
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:35.880]   - What?
[01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:37.960]   Why don't all his business have these weird names?
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:38.800]   What is going on?
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:39.960]   - Haudinkey. - Haudinkey.
[01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:41.720]   Haudinkey is a watch website.
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:44.680]   Kevin Rose is all in on designer watches now.
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:48.640]   His whole company, North and everything, merged with Haudinkey.
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:52.400]   I know it's a strange name.
[01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:53.400]   - I mean, I guess that's what happens
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:57.280]   when you sell your company and make all that money.
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:48:59.520]   - You know what, Haudinkey, we mock it.
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:01.720]   We mock the name, but it is actually--
[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:02.680]   - They made it in a mockable name.
[01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:06.000]   - The number one online wristwatch magazine in the world.
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:10.720]   But you remember the name, Haudinkey.
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:12.360]   Kevin explained it to me and I don't even,
[01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:13.440]   I can't even understand it.
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:15.440]   - He can explain it further when he's listening.
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:17.360]   - Even further when he hosts the show on Chilin12.
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:20.200]   - Maybe the first story is like, why is it called this?
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:21.800]   - He's moving though, he's moving New York here.
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:22.840]   He's gonna be in your neck of the woods.
[01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:25.160]   You got to chill with Kevin, he's kidding.
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:26.080]   - Yeah, I'll be happy to.
[01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:28.120]   I got nothing against, I've never met Kevin actually.
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:29.120]   - No, you'll love him.
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:30.360]   - Yeah, good.
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:31.720]   - If you missed anything--
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:33.320]   - The neighborhood, our prices are too high already.
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:37.240]   - Oh yeah, out there in Brooklyn, it's crazy.
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:38.800]   Actually, Kevin's gonna do the same thing
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:40.600]   to New York he did to San Francisco by the way.
[01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:41.680]   - No, don't bring those people with--
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:43.560]   - He's gonna ruin the place.
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:46.200]   - New York, we already have the Russian billionaires.
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:48.120]   I don't think New York can absorb Kevin Rose
[01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:50.640]   probably better than the Bay Area.
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:52.720]   - Well, we shall see, it's a real challenge.
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:54.760]   He's throwing down the gauntlet, all right.
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:57.600]   Kevin could ruin the San Francisco,
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:59.600]   he's ready for the new challenge.
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:00.880]   No, of course not.
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:03.640]   Hair Show today, brought to you by Harry's.
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:05.080]   I'm gonna talk about shaving in a second.
[01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:09.320]   Before we do that though, Tom Merritt has the weak ahead.
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:13.680]   - Okay, coming up on June 23rd, Blackberry Earnings.
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:15.840]   Also that day O'Reilly Solid kicks off,
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:17.800]   the Red Hat Summit kicks off that same day as well.
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:21.640]   In Boston, June 26th, an IPO for alarm.com.
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:23.200]   And then looking ahead to July 8th,
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:24.720]   this is for you, high tech egg pilot,
[01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:27.040]   the Ag Tech Summit in Salinas, California.
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:30.240]   - Holy cow, DailyTekneshow.com.
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:31.920]   That's where you'll see it all.
[01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:33.120]   - That was awesome.
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:36.200]   - It's amazing, it just is like falling off a bike, isn't it?
[01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:37.720]   - It all scraped up.
[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:38.840]   - Exactly.
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:41.200]   - You have to put that backteen stuff on it.
[01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:42.320]   - Terrible.
[01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:45.200]   Here's what you missed, if you missed anything this week,
[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:46.040]   on Twitch.
[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:48.120]   - Previously, on Twitch.
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:51.280]   - I'm not a 48 year old man, so I'm not on Twitch,
[01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:52.440]   but yeah. - I'm telling you,
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:56.000]   Leo plays cup boy, it's gonna be huge.
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:00.360]   It's the new MMORPG for people over 50.
[01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:01.560]   - This week in law.
[01:51:01.560 --> 01:51:05.040]   - One of the original patent rules appears to be
[01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:07.960]   going out of business, deciding to stop pursuing
[01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:09.400]   these kinds of cases.
[01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:12.400]   - This reflects patent reform occurring in the courts
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:15.520]   and patent reform occurring in Congress.
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:16.760]   - Security now.
[01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:19.520]   - Last pass is network breach.
[01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:21.960]   - Yeah, you know, of course the press went crazy.
[01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:23.080]   Is there a better solution?
[01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:26.200]   Is this, is this mean that we shouldn't be using Last pass?
[01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:29.000]   - I'm not leaving, I'm staying with them.
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.480]   - Android App Arena.
[01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:33.320]   - This week's big app isn't just a game, it's a movie.
[01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:36.240]   And a music video, starring David Hasselhoff.
[01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:39.320]   As Kung Fury, you travel back in time to battle it out
[01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:42.160]   with Kung Fury, aka Adolf Hitler,
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:45.000]   but I am poor fans of this era of gaming
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:48.000]   to play Kung Fury for five minutes without breaking a smile.
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.440]   - Twitch for justice.
[01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:51.520]   (laughing)
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:54.520]   - Here he comes, oh my, it's a giant carrot.
[01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:57.880]   If you remember Cab Callaway, you'll love Cuphead.
[01:51:57.880 --> 01:51:59.200]   - I can't wait to get this game.
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:00.280]   - Call me 27.
[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:02.920]   (laughing)
[01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:06.960]   - Is it really is David Hasselhoff in Kung Fury?
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:09.240]   - He wrote the theme song.
[01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:11.440]   It sings it, and it's super authentic,
[01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:13.600]   total 80s shtick, it's awesome.
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:16.320]   - Wow, can't wait to see that.
[01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:17.840]   Our show today brought to you by Harry's
[01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:19.840]   the best shave experience you'll ever have, guys.
[01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:23.680]   I know no one really enjoys shaving.
[01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:25.880]   Certainly not Jack Dorsey.
[01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:29.240]   But maybe if Jack Dorsey had found Harry's,
[01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:31.920]   well it'd be a whole different world today, huh?
[01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:32.880]   Harry's is amazing.
[01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:35.520]   These guys, actually one of them was a co-founder
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:38.040]   of Warby Parker.
[01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:40.680]   And there's a great article about Harry's,
[01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:41.760]   where was it, business insider?
[01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:43.160]   I'll have to see if I can find it.
[01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:45.800]   Where they talk about, so they wanted to do,
[01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:48.240]   razor blades direct, but they wanted to do it right.
[01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:49.400]   They did some investigation.
[01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:51.480]   They found out that there really only two factories
[01:52:51.480 --> 01:52:54.720]   in the whole world that make the best razor blades,
[01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:55.840]   and they bought one of them.
[01:52:55.840 --> 01:52:57.320]   That's what venture money will help you do.
[01:52:57.320 --> 01:53:00.680]   They bought the factory, and now,
[01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:02.760]   because they're selling direct to you from the factory,
[01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:06.760]   you get a great blade designed for performance,
[01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:09.160]   for sharpness, for durability,
[01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:11.440]   and you get it at a great price.
[01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:16.440]   About $4 a blade for the jet fillet fusion,
[01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:20.320]   half that for a Harry's blade, and it's better.
[01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:23.840]   Plus, Harry's will give you a,
[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:24.880]   it's too late for Father's Day,
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:28.440]   but if you forgot Father's Day, man, quickly,
[01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:31.200]   go to Harry's.com, get that Winston set.
[01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:33.880]   We can get it monogrammed with dad's initials,
[01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:36.520]   or the Truman, $15 for the Truman,
[01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:38.960]   and you get three blades, a razor handle,
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:41.160]   the incredible Harry's, either the shave cream
[01:53:41.160 --> 01:53:44.720]   or the foam gel, you get the travel holder for the Harry's,
[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:48.040]   which don't undersell that, that's really valuable.
[01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:51.120]   And you can take $5 off when you use the offer code TWIT5.
[01:53:51.120 --> 01:53:52.320]   So now we're talking 10 bucks,
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:55.240]   you don't have to tell dad that you only paid $10.
[01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:57.600]   You get a great razor, great handle,
[01:53:57.600 --> 01:54:00.280]   and then every month or every other month,
[01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:02.400]   you get blades from Harry's.
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:03.840]   It's just a more efficient company,
[01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:06.560]   which means you get a better price and a better blade,
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:10.320]   and of course Harry's guarantees your satisfaction.
[01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:14.640]   I shave every morning with my Harry's, I love 'em.
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:17.440]   In fact, I think we had to have three or four Harry's
[01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:19.600]   in the house, 'cause you know what, she likes 'em too.
[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:22.720]   Harry's.com, use the offer code TWIT5
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:26.320]   to get $5 off your first purchase,
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:29.600]   TWIT5@Harrys.com.
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:32.320]   Everybody sent me the Harry's article,
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:36.320]   and I'm trying to remember where I saw that.
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:39.440]   It sent me links and stuff.
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:43.080]   Oh well, it's a great story.
[01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:46.120]   They spent $100 million on the razor blade factory.
[01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:49.160]   All right.
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:52.880]   - I do think though, I mean, you made the kind of VC
[01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:56.280]   off-handed remark.
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:59.240]   It's interesting, 'cause I know you know this, Leo,
[01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:01.720]   but I think in general, there tends to be this perception
[01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:03.240]   that, oh, it's not fair.
[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:06.240]   They have VC money, blah, blah, blah, or, you know, oh,
[01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:09.960]   like there's this idea that it's this candy jar
[01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:11.360]   that you get to just dip into,
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:13.280]   and there's no consequences for it.
[01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:18.200]   I mean, the VC money has to be earned back, or--
[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:20.200]   - Anybody who is seeing Silicon Valley,
[01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:22.120]   do you get Silicon Valley in Taipei?
[01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:26.400]   - Well, I don't, oh, because we all know this,
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:27.920]   if you've watched that HBO show,
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:30.040]   which has now concluded its second season,
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:32.880]   we know the consequences of venture money.
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:34.680]   - Well, you're seeing it in Twitter right now.
[01:55:34.680 --> 01:55:37.800]   People are like, why doesn't Twitter do this,
[01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:40.480]   or why are they go public, or investors are so mean?
[01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:43.560]   And the reason why Twitter is a public company
[01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:46.520]   is because they had a ton of venture money
[01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:49.400]   that paid for Twitter to dink around for years,
[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:51.000]   will figure out what they wanted to do
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.760]   with this great product they had.
[01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:56.320]   And that venture company needs an exit,
[01:55:56.320 --> 01:55:57.920]   and so they went public, and now they have to deal
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:01.760]   with Wall Street, and like, all this is interconnected,
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:05.480]   and so it's just, it's funny on one hand, people will say,
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:07.400]   "Oh, they have venture money, it's so easy for them."
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:08.960]   I'm saying, again, I'm not saying you were saying that,
[01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:11.280]   but people do have that sort of attitude,
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:12.840]   and then the flip side, they'll be like,
[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:14.880]   oh, why are investors so mean to Twitter?
[01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:18.560]   I like, just let them be of a little business.
[01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:21.800]   And like, all this stuff is interconnected.
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:24.040]   You don't get one without the other.
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:26.480]   - Well, and there's reasons why you might wanna go out
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:28.280]   and raise $125 million.
[01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:30.200]   One of them would be that you see the best way
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:34.080]   to make your business work is to buy the factory,
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:36.160]   and then there's reasons why you don't.
[01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:38.680]   I don't want anybody to tell me what to do,
[01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:42.440]   and so we're very content to grow Twitter to slow pace,
[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:45.140]   and spend only the money we have.
[01:56:45.140 --> 01:56:48.360]   Yeah, sure, we could grow at a much faster pace.
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:51.160]   We could be like revision three, which had an exit
[01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:53.200]   and everything, and the investors got paid back.
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:56.480]   But I kinda prefer this model.
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:56:58.920]   And Tom, you got a great model.
[01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:01.920]   We should mention dtns at Patreon.
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:04.880]   It's patreon.com/astetect.
[01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:07.960]   - Yeah, you can go to dailytechnewshow.com/support
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:09.840]   as well, I'll take you to all different,
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:12.160]   'cause we take Bitcoin and stuff like that.
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:13.640]   - You've done really well.
[01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:16.360]   I think you're one of the real success stories there.
[01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:19.920]   You're sick with $16,000 a month now.
[01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:22.480]   - I feel like people who say,
[01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:23.560]   oh, they've got VC money,
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:26.360]   are just people saying they wish they had VC money.
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:27.920]   It's just a different way of--
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:30.360]   - I wish I had the money, I just don't want the VCs.
[01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:33.200]   - Right, exactly, and so that's the trade-off, right?
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:36.000]   And Patreon and Kickstarter and all of these companies
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.680]   are providing a really interesting experiment
[01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:43.800]   in how far can we go down the idea
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:45.240]   of cutting out business models?
[01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:48.280]   I think it's very similar to branded content as well,
[01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:49.440]   where people are trying to figure out,
[01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:52.520]   well, can we actually pay to make credible content
[01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:53.760]   directly on the advertisers?
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:56.360]   It's similar to ad reads like you've done
[01:57:56.360 --> 01:57:57.400]   for years in Twitch.
[01:57:57.400 --> 01:57:59.520]   These are all just different ways of figuring out,
[01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:02.240]   how can we fund what we're doing?
[01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:04.200]   And so, yeah, I'm lucky enough
[01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:05.920]   that it's worked out well for me on Patreon.
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:08.240]   - Where do you come down on somebody like Pebble Watch?
[01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:11.760]   So Pebble went to Kickstarter the first time,
[01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:13.120]   and they had one of the most successful
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:16.320]   Kickstarter of all time, created the company, really.
[01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:19.320]   But then after the companies of going concerned,
[01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:22.720]   they went back to Twitter to raise money again,
[01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:27.440]   this time $20 million to create Pebble Time.
[01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:30.720]   Is that kosher?
[01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:33.760]   - At least they were transparent about it.
[01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:36.080]   They said, "We don't need to do this, but this is where
[01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:38.720]   "we started, so we wanted to give people a chance
[01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:41.280]   "to pre-order, essentially."
[01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:43.520]   - But that's what Kickstarter says exactly what they are not.
[01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:45.000]   They are not a store.
[01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.160]   - No, I know, and Pebble had to be very careful
[01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:49.120]   about how they worded that.
[01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:52.960]   But I think Pebble honestly was trying to honor their roots.
[01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:55.520]   And you see a lot of, there was a video game
[01:58:55.520 --> 01:58:58.000]   announced at E3 in the Sony press conference,
[01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.720]   Shenmue, Shenmue 3, where they're using Kickstarter
[01:59:00.720 --> 01:59:03.400]   as sort of the launch pad for it
[01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:05.840]   to kind of collect some money at the beginning,
[01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:07.600]   but they certainly aren't getting all the money
[01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:08.760]   they would need to make it.
[01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:12.600]   And they wouldn't need to have to do it that way.
[01:59:12.600 --> 01:59:14.800]   It's just another way to get the word out
[01:59:14.800 --> 01:59:17.920]   and build a list of the most passionate fans.
[01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:19.720]   - That actually good conversation with Chris Hardwick
[01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:21.000]   who was on the Nerdist on Thursday,
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.760]   I think that shook his eyes in a few weeks.
[01:59:22.760 --> 01:59:26.040]   We talked about Veronica Mars.
[01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:29.640]   And that's an example of, really,
[01:59:29.640 --> 01:59:32.440]   the production company that made the original Veronica Mars
[01:59:32.440 --> 01:59:34.160]   said, "Nobody wants this.
[01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:35.960]   "We're not gonna make it."
[01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:37.680]   And then the guy behind it said,
[01:59:37.680 --> 01:59:40.640]   "Well, what if I went to Kickstarter and demonstrated,
[01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:42.520]   "Look, it's not gonna be raising enough money to make it,
[01:59:42.520 --> 01:59:44.800]   "but if I demonstrated a real interest,
[01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:47.600]   "people showing out actual money,
[01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:49.360]   "would you make it then?"
[01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:50.920]   And he did, well, I don't remember what he raised
[01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:52.120]   for Veronica Mars, a lot of money.
[01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:53.520]   - A couple million, yeah.
[01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:56.760]   - Wasn't enough, so Fox, or whoever made more,
[01:59:56.760 --> 01:59:58.320]   put more in, and it was a flop.
[01:59:58.320 --> 01:59:59.880]   (laughing)
[01:59:59.880 --> 02:00:01.280]   - So I don't know what to do.
[02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:02.120]   What do you get out of that?
[02:00:02.120 --> 02:00:03.520]   - It was the people's flop, Leo.
[02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:04.520]   The people were--
[02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:05.360]   - The people were wrong.
[02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:06.440]   - It's true that that flop.
[02:00:06.440 --> 02:00:07.280]   - What?
[02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:09.600]   I mean, I think it's fine.
[02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:12.400]   I mean, when you ask if it's not kosher,
[02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:15.640]   it's not kosher according to Kickstarter's own definition
[02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:17.640]   of what their site is about.
[02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:20.160]   To take this full circle, Kickstarter has $10 million
[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:21.680]   in venture capital, so if it turns out
[02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:24.800]   this is the best way to build a business around it,
[02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:26.640]   I'm sure they'll be happy to.
[02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:27.480]   - They'll do it.
[02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:28.320]   - To make it kosher.
[02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:29.240]   - They'll do it.
[02:00:29.240 --> 02:00:32.760]   - Rob Thomas raised, it turned out 5.7 million
[02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:34.880]   to make the Veronica Mars movie.
[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:36.760]   And that's about what it made.
[02:00:36.760 --> 02:00:38.720]   (laughing)
[02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:40.440]   There you go.
[02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:41.280]   There you go.
[02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:42.120]   - I broke even.
[02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:42.960]   - Ish.
[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:43.800]   - Yeah.
[02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:46.400]   But not every one of these is going to work, right?
[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:49.240]   We look at an individual case and we want to--
[02:00:49.240 --> 02:00:50.080]   - That's true.
[02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:51.000]   - Some of us want to be judgmental,
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.120]   but you need a lot of these kinds of flops
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:55.080]   to be able to find out what works and what doesn't.
[02:00:55.080 --> 02:00:57.960]   - So did anybody got the Pebble Time?
[02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:00.000]   Anybody seen it?
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:01.080]   - Brian Brushwood has it, he loves it.
[02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:02.080]   - He loves it?
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:02.920]   - Yeah.
[02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:05.000]   - Tristan.
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:05.920]   - He got the Apple Watch, I end the time.
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:08.040]   - Yeah, and he prefers it to the Apple Watch?
[02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:09.480]   - Yeah, I don't want to put words in his mouth there,
[02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:10.800]   but I know he loves the time.
[02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:12.280]   - Mm.
[02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:14.360]   - I've got the Apple Watch, I've got the Android Wear
[02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:15.840]   Watch, I don't have the time.
[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:17.640]   I was the original, I backed the original Pebble,
[02:01:17.640 --> 02:01:18.920]   gave it to you, Chris.
[02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:21.800]   Chris has now, no, I gave it to Chad, that's right.
[02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:24.720]   Chris, you had it, and now you're gonna Apple Watch.
[02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:27.560]   - We should have, you should put like tracking pixels
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:30.960]   of some kind, Leo, in all the devices you have seeded
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:32.760]   into the world over the years.
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:34.840]   I think it's a pretty significant path
[02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:37.160]   that you've created for the technology.
[02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:39.680]   - Johnny Apple's Seed for devices.
[02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:42.520]   - I think the Apple Watch is dopey,
[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:44.600]   I don't, it doesn't do anything for me at this point.
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:46.280]   - I wore it for a month,
[02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:48.440]   then gave it to my producer, Jenny Josephson,
[02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:50.560]   to wear for a month to see if I'd miss it,
[02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:53.040]   and I kind of forgot I got it to her.
[02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:54.880]   - But you're not a Watch Wearer.
[02:01:54.880 --> 02:01:56.440]   - No, I'm not, that's a good point.
[02:01:56.440 --> 02:01:58.120]   I wasn't wearing a watch before that.
[02:01:58.120 --> 02:01:58.960]   - Right.
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:02.080]   So, I don't know if it means anything, I guess,
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:03.400]   I don't know, I don't know.
[02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:05.760]   - It certainly didn't turn me into a Watch Wearer.
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:08.400]   - Yeah, yeah, not that compelling.
[02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:12.520]   - I think, I'm interested in that point, because I have it
[02:02:12.520 --> 02:02:14.720]   and like it and I have worn it every day since so I have.
[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:15.560]   - Oh, you have?
[02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:19.160]   - I have, but I was a Watch Wearer before,
[02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:22.600]   so to me, it's a watch that does more.
[02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:25.280]   It shows the time and it also shows,
[02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:27.120]   for me, my favorite is the temperature.
[02:02:27.120 --> 02:02:31.960]   And I like the notifications.
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:33.200]   Again, I had already taken a step
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:35.160]   to kind of curb my notifications on my phone
[02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:36.800]   long before then, so it was never,
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:40.040]   I didn't get the overwhelming notification issue
[02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:42.360]   that some people complained about.
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:44.200]   But I mean, I frankly think that's how Apple should have
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:48.200]   marketed it, it's like, it's a watch that does more.
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:50.760]   And then over time, let the additional functionality
[02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:52.800]   reveal itself, which, I mean, I think the most
[02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:55.480]   compelling functionality anyway is the way in which
[02:02:55.480 --> 02:02:57.800]   it might let you interact with your world, right?
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:02:59.160]   You can kind of see it with Apple Pay,
[02:02:59.160 --> 02:03:02.120]   but imagine if your car started with your watch
[02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:04.600]   or your house unlocked with your watch.
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:07.800]   And I think that's a realistic long-term vision,
[02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:09.560]   but there's no need to sell it that way now.
[02:03:09.560 --> 02:03:12.600]   It's like the iPhone, the iPhone was a phone that did more.
[02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:15.920]   And Apple didn't need to sell it in 2007
[02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:18.400]   as the most important computer in life.
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:20.640]   And we'll actually have people in the Wall Street Journal
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:23.080]   writing articles that Apple should discontinue to the Mac.
[02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:25.080]   Like, they didn't need to say that in 2007,
[02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:26.920]   even if that was the future.
[02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:30.240]   And it just feels like the company got a little ahead
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:32.640]   of itself, and the apps are all terrible
[02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:34.360]   because of the hybrid app thing.
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:39.520]   Like, why be a little patient and wait for the apps to be ready?
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:43.720]   You know, watch without apps is what I think they should have done.
[02:03:43.720 --> 02:03:48.680]   I think it would have really crystallized what the watch is
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:51.960]   and what it's not in a way that would have been
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:54.360]   beneficial to the product.
[02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:56.720]   2007, Ben, I don't know if you remember.
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:03:58.680]   It was a simpler time.
[02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:02.840]   It was a more innocent time for our industry, for our nation.
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:04.920]   And so we had to keep that in mind.
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:06.880]   They had to that they would launch without apps
[02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:07.840]   the way they did the phone.
[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:09.680]   I don't know if they could afford that again.
[02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:13.760]   I mean, they'd launch that phone without basic phone stuff, too.
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:16.120]   And they'd launch it without basic computer stuff,
[02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:19.080]   like cutting paste, and they were cut a lot of slack for that.
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:22.120]   But seeing how much they learned and earned from having
[02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:25.200]   an app marketplace, it feels like they wouldn't
[02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:28.560]   want to repeat that probation period of just native apps.
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:31.400]   Well, I understand you had a pretty credible competitor
[02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:33.880]   in Pebble and Android Wear.
[02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:35.480]   But credible, in what respect?
[02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:37.600]   Incredible as in they exist, but no one actually
[02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:39.400]   is wearing any of this stuff.
[02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:41.440]   I mean, the reality is, let's play it out.
[02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:42.880]   They launch without an app store.
[02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:47.800]   And every review is like, oh, instead of saying it's slow
[02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:50.560]   and frustrating, because all the built-in apps
[02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:52.560]   are speedy and snappy.
[02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:54.640]   And like, oh, it's great.
[02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:55.640]   I mean, you need it.
[02:04:55.640 --> 02:04:56.560]   Of course you don't need it.
[02:04:56.560 --> 02:04:57.240]   You don't need to watch.
[02:04:57.240 --> 02:05:00.640]   But boy, it's really handy to have this extra stuff
[02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:02.320]   on your wrist when you need to see it.
[02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:06.360]   Look down and see the temperature, see my next appointment.
[02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:07.640]   And then the apps are banned.
[02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:09.520]   Won't it be great once they have apps?
[02:05:09.520 --> 02:05:12.600]   It gets a ding because they aren't there.
[02:05:12.600 --> 02:05:14.880]   But it's an optimistic ding.
[02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:17.920]   It's like, imagine how great it's going to be when they arrive.
[02:05:17.920 --> 02:05:22.680]   Instead, they watch these hybrid half-ass apps--
[02:05:22.680 --> 02:05:23.800]   sorry, I don't know if you can say that on the show.
[02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:24.800]   No, that's true, though.
[02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:26.640]   You can say it if it's true.
[02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:30.120]   But the net result is to make it a worse experience.
[02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:30.760]   Right.
[02:05:30.760 --> 02:05:34.040]   And to make the perception of the watch worse than it ought to be.
[02:05:34.040 --> 02:05:39.040]   And frankly, I think it's troubling.
[02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:43.360]   What makes Apple great is its ability
[02:05:43.360 --> 02:05:48.160]   to focus on delivering the best possible experience
[02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:50.240]   at the expense of features.
[02:05:50.240 --> 02:05:51.880]   And then what they do is they iterate.
[02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:52.440]   They iterate.
[02:05:52.440 --> 02:05:53.080]   They iterate.
[02:05:53.080 --> 02:05:54.160]   This is what Apple does.
[02:05:54.160 --> 02:05:57.080]   Every product they watch launches with missing something
[02:05:57.080 --> 02:06:00.600]   important, but what is there works perfectly.
[02:06:00.600 --> 02:06:02.880]   That's not what happened with the watch.
[02:06:02.880 --> 02:06:06.240]   What is there does not work perfectly because the apps stink.
[02:06:06.240 --> 02:06:08.040]   And they stink because Apple have the patience.
[02:06:08.040 --> 02:06:09.080]   You think they were afraid that the people would look at the watch
[02:06:09.080 --> 02:06:12.200]   and say, it just doesn't do enough.
[02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:14.160]   Since when is Apple afraid?
[02:06:14.160 --> 02:06:15.160]   Yeah.
[02:06:15.160 --> 02:06:17.000]   That's what worries me.
[02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:21.960]   Sure, let people say that and deliver something that is great,
[02:06:21.960 --> 02:06:25.920]   that works great, which, again, I think the watch works great
[02:06:25.920 --> 02:06:27.360]   except for the apps.
[02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:31.480]   Like all the other stuff works very well and deliver that
[02:06:31.480 --> 02:06:35.680]   and let people be frustrated that it's not good enough yet.
[02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:38.440]   I don't think they have trouble with the UI as well.
[02:06:38.440 --> 02:06:40.520]   I feel like the UI is not good.
[02:06:40.520 --> 02:06:43.560]   And the stem and the button and the twiddle and the fiddle.
[02:06:43.560 --> 02:06:45.880]   It takes a lot of learning to catch on to it.
[02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:47.360]   But once it's just not a good UI.
[02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:49.440]   Once the whole app part is gone, though,
[02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:52.200]   the UI simplifies considerably because you don't have--
[02:06:52.200 --> 02:06:54.800]   because a big problem is almost these two modes, right?
[02:06:54.800 --> 02:06:58.400]   There's the app mode and then there's the watch face mode.
[02:06:58.400 --> 02:07:02.240]   Once there's only one mode, all that stuff gets a lot simpler.
[02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:06.400]   And so it actually solves multiple problems with it.
[02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:08.560]   I agree with you that, especially at the beginning,
[02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:12.400]   it's confusing, which, again, I think begs the question,
[02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:15.440]   why make it confusing so we can deliver half-assed apps?
[02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:18.800]   When we know we can deliver full apps in six months.
[02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:20.760]   Well, and also, there's a consideration.
[02:07:20.760 --> 02:07:24.480]   I don't think they're going to update the hardware yearly
[02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:27.280]   as they have with the phone and the pad.
[02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:30.960]   I feel like there's a risk to coming out with another one
[02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:32.560]   in the spring.
[02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:35.000]   And they're probably much more likely to go a two-year cycle
[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.360]   or a three-year cycle, right?
[02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:40.120]   Well, I mean, Mark Herman released a report this week,
[02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:41.920]   giving details about the next one that's
[02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:43.960]   supposed to come next year.
[02:07:43.960 --> 02:07:45.520]   I would expect them--
[02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:48.040]   I see your point, but I think it will be your list.
[02:07:48.040 --> 02:07:51.160]   Especially if you sold $17,000 once.
[02:07:51.160 --> 02:07:55.240]   If you bought a $17,000 watch, you're going to buy it
[02:07:55.240 --> 02:07:57.080]   for another one next year.
[02:07:57.080 --> 02:08:00.280]   I mean, the reality is $70,000 watch--
[02:08:00.280 --> 02:08:02.080]   It's college tuition.
[02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:03.440]   Oh, man.
[02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:04.800]   That's a harsh thing to say.
[02:08:04.800 --> 02:08:06.440]   Wow.
[02:08:06.440 --> 02:08:10.080]   Who is buying $70,000 Apple Watch with their kids' college
[02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:10.600]   tuition?
[02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:11.360]   No, I hope not.
[02:08:11.360 --> 02:08:14.120]   I'm not sure that's a whole problem.
[02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:17.240]   The reality is I calculated this up before,
[02:08:17.240 --> 02:08:18.680]   but I can't remember what it was.
[02:08:18.680 --> 02:08:23.720]   So $17,000 divided by 350 equals 40--
[02:08:23.720 --> 02:08:28.680]   So the $70,000 watch is 48 times the entry-level watch.
[02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:30.360]   Last I checked, there are a lot of people in the world
[02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:32.960]   making more than 48 times the amount of money I make.
[02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:36.400]   So on a relative basis, the people buying the $70,000 watch
[02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:39.520]   are actually spending less than I am buying--
[02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:41.640]   Actually, I bought the stainless steel one.
[02:08:41.640 --> 02:08:41.960]   But--
[02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:44.200]   Well, OK, that's interesting.
[02:08:44.200 --> 02:08:46.720]   I mean, one of the things they said in one of the earnings
[02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:48.360]   calls, I think last year about the iPad,
[02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:51.920]   is we just didn't know what the update cycle would be for people.
[02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:53.440]   We were guessing, because it was a new product.
[02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:55.280]   And I think they're doing the same thing with the watch.
[02:08:55.280 --> 02:08:58.280]   They don't know when the markets--
[02:08:58.280 --> 02:09:00.120]   Am I willing to buy a new watch every year?
[02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:01.720]   We don't know that.
[02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:02.480]   Yeah.
[02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:04.280]   That's a very fair question.
[02:09:04.280 --> 02:09:08.120]   And it's a reason why I think, particularly in the short term,
[02:09:08.120 --> 02:09:10.840]   the impact of the watch and their financial results
[02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:12.800]   will be modest.
[02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:14.840]   And I think that's a great point.
[02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:18.840]   And I would expect their bills--
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:21.480]   I mean, they are supporting the iPad all the way back
[02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:23.280]   multiple generations.
[02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:24.920]   I would expect to do the same for the watch.
[02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:28.000]   Then again, you'd expect to watch any product
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:28.920]   in its first few years.
[02:09:28.920 --> 02:09:29.360]   That's when it--
[02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:30.720]   To get better than us.
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:32.120]   Yeah, so it'll be interesting.
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:33.960]   I mean--
[02:09:33.960 --> 02:09:37.160]   FC, we're going to move on, because we're almost at a time.
[02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:40.120]   And I just want to quickly-- a few things get in here.
[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:44.160]   FCC, levying, its biggest fine ever
[02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:48.920]   on AT&T, $100 million for misleading people
[02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:51.400]   saying you have an unlimited data plan when, in fact,
[02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:55.000]   it was going to be throttled.
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:56.920]   It really comes down to-- and if you ask me,
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:10:00.880]   what's your definition of unlimited?
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:02.320]   Without limit.
[02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:04.520]   Yeah, but without what kind of limit?
[02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:07.120]   Yeah, and the FCC is proposing the fine.
[02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:09.120]   AT&T's got 30 days to respond to it.
[02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:11.560]   And what they're saying is, you weren't clear enough
[02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:13.920]   about the implications of the throttled.
[02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:17.960]   There was a limit on speed, but not a limit on data.
[02:10:17.960 --> 02:10:20.440]   And they don't communicate that at the point of sale.
[02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:21.920]   Yeah, they need to be more clear about that.
[02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:26.360]   I actually got a text message last week for the first time.
[02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:29.200]   My iPhone is powered by AT&T.
[02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:32.440]   The iPad is on Verizon, so I get to lower it.
[02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:33.240]   Backup thing.
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:37.920]   But this is a text message that came in on June 14th, 11.46am.
[02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:41.640]   AT&T free message that didn't charge me for this rebuke.
[02:10:41.640 --> 02:10:45.880]   Your data has reached 75% by 5 gigabyte.
[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:46.320]   You hate that.
[02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:47.920]   Management threshold.
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:49.560]   The network management, which is nothing
[02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:50.920]   I've ever heard of before.
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:53.640]   If you exceed 5 gigabytes this month,
[02:10:53.640 --> 02:10:56.920]   you may experience reduced data speeds at times
[02:10:56.920 --> 02:10:59.760]   and in areas that are experiencing networks' congestion.
[02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:03.320]   Wi-Fi helps you avoid reduced speeds, AKA get off.
[02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:04.400]   Get off my network.
[02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:06.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:09.120]   Get off my network, parent today!
[02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:10.120]   Snap into today!
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:11.720]   I'm a grandfather, man.
[02:11:11.720 --> 02:11:12.720]   They do it.
[02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:13.720]   I'm a grandfather.
[02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:15.560]   This is unlimited feedback in the day.
[02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:17.480]   And they want to get you off of that, man.
[02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:18.480]   They do.
[02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:21.080]   And I'm like 10 down 10 gigs a month.
[02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:22.360]   This last month, I was at 13.
[02:11:22.360 --> 02:11:24.360]   They keep offering me that 10 gig deal.
[02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:26.480]   They say, hey, you could save a couple hundred bucks a year
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:29.360]   if you would just switch off this unlimited plan.
[02:11:29.360 --> 02:11:31.160]   And I say, no way, especially since you're
[02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:33.760]   going to be paying a big fine.
[02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:34.280]   Yeah.
[02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:35.280]   The rough--
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:37.000]   Is that big fine for AT&T, though?
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:37.880]   100 million.
[02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:38.360]   I don't know.
[02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:40.240]   I mean, it's a big fine in the FCC's history,
[02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:42.120]   but how much of a percentage of AT&T's--
[02:11:42.120 --> 02:11:43.600]   How many Apple watches is that?
[02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:46.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:48.160]   Huge loss for free speech in Europe,
[02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:52.040]   Mike Masnick at Tech Dirt writing about the European Court
[02:11:52.040 --> 02:11:57.240]   of Human Rights, Delphi versus Estonia.
[02:11:57.240 --> 02:12:02.080]   Delphi is a news site in Estonia, Russian and Estonian
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:07.800]   a news site in which commenters were saying bad things.
[02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:12.360]   The court said that even if a website took down comments
[02:12:12.360 --> 02:12:15.480]   after people complained, it could still be held liable,
[02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:17.880]   it should have anticipated bad comments.
[02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:24.360]   Yeah, T2T2 runs our chat room as Estonian.
[02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:27.840]   And he made a point of emailing us at Daily Tech News Show
[02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:32.280]   and saying, this is only the European court determining
[02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:35.840]   whether the Estonian court applied its own rules properly.
[02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:38.720]   This only applies to Estonia.
[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:41.760]   So it has a more limited impact than you might think.
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:45.000]   And Estonian laws are different than the rest of Europe
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:45.920]   on this sort of thing.
[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:48.120]   The comments were deemed by the courts in Estonia
[02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:52.120]   to be unlawful because they were vicious--
[02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:53.280]   There were hate speech.
[02:12:53.280 --> 02:12:57.680]   Yeah, and because of the way in which the comments section
[02:12:57.680 --> 02:13:00.840]   was set up, essentially, there's still some troubling things
[02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:03.080]   in how the Estonian courts determined this,
[02:13:03.080 --> 02:13:06.440]   saying the Delphi should have known ahead of time
[02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:08.920]   that people might post these types of comments.
[02:13:08.920 --> 02:13:11.280]   But that's good to know that it really only applies
[02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:12.240]   to Estonia.
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:15.600]   It's the European court ruling on Estonian law, essentially.
[02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:16.040]   Yeah.
[02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:17.800]   OK, that's good to know.
[02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:20.200]   Here's another one that's not clear.
[02:13:20.200 --> 02:13:26.440]   Windows 10 will be free not only to Windows 7 and 8 users,
[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:29.560]   but to anybody who's signed up for the beta program, which,
[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:33.200]   by the way, is still open if you go to insider.window.com,
[02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:36.360]   window-- or microsoft.com.
[02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:38.120]   It's not-- this is so confusing.
[02:13:38.120 --> 02:13:41.880]   Gable saying, you know, I'm going to have to ask Paul
[02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:44.760]   Thorett and Mary Jo Foley what the hell this means.
[02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:47.040]   Because we've seen this before, but Microsoft
[02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:49.000]   implying that pirates, for instance,
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.920]   would get to upgrade to Windows 10 and no longer be pirates.
[02:13:51.920 --> 02:13:54.640]   They clarified later, no, that's not the case.
[02:13:54.640 --> 02:13:55.560]   So I don't know.
[02:13:55.560 --> 02:13:57.320]   But if this is true, it's basically
[02:13:57.320 --> 02:14:00.520]   saying anybody who wants to can get Windows 10 for free
[02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:01.600]   and a real Windows 10.
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:05.240]   You know, like you install it, you get updates, you're licensed.
[02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:11.320]   The reality is it doesn't really matter.
[02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:14.360]   Something like 90% or 85% of Windows revenue
[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:17.680]   comes from Windows that's installed on new PCs.
[02:14:17.680 --> 02:14:20.800]   So the upgrade revenue stream has always
[02:14:20.800 --> 02:14:23.840]   been a relatively meaningless one.
[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:26.480]   And over the last few releases, they've
[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:29.160]   been moving in this general direction.
[02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:35.240]   It's just another sign of how the world has shifted
[02:14:35.240 --> 02:14:37.160]   previously under Microsoft's feet.
[02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:39.640]   And now they're a little more-- much more aware
[02:14:39.640 --> 02:14:41.240]   that it's happening and moving forward.
[02:14:41.240 --> 02:14:42.760]   I think the other thing that's interesting
[02:14:42.760 --> 02:14:46.720]   is Microsoft didn't know that rework this week, which really
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:51.440]   undid Balmer's rework at the end of his time there, which
[02:14:51.440 --> 02:14:52.280]   was--
[02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:55.440]   I wrote the time-- but that was disastrous even then.
[02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:57.720]   And it's a very smart one.
[02:14:57.720 --> 02:14:58.920]   But I think it's most interesting.
[02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:03.000]   It's Windows is in its own kind of corner in all the hardware
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:04.960]   stuck there, including Xbox.
[02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:06.520]   And I think the way--
[02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:09.000]   Terry Meyers, who created Windows 10,
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.040]   is running the whole division now.
[02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:11.440]   Right.
[02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:12.800]   But I think the way to think about it
[02:15:12.800 --> 02:15:16.120]   is Microsoft has placed their bets on the cloud.
[02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:17.920]   That's one division and cloud enterprise.
[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:21.280]   And kind of apps and productivity--
[02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:23.720]   that's not the name of it, but it's the other division.
[02:15:23.720 --> 02:15:26.200]   And those are the ones that matter.
[02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:28.920]   And everything else is in this Windows division.
[02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:31.480]   And I don't think that--
[02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:34.040]   I think that's-- there's a clear delineation between future
[02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:36.240]   and past in this reorganization.
[02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:37.920]   And I think that's interesting.
[02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:38.280]   It is.
[02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:39.720]   It says-- boy, is it changed.
[02:15:39.720 --> 02:15:42.040]   Stephen E. Lopf, who was a Microsoft employee,
[02:15:42.040 --> 02:15:44.960]   went to run Nokia, was acquired with the Nokia
[02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:47.360]   acquisition now out.
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:50.160]   Mark Penn, the pollster who was fired from Hillary Clinton's
[02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:51.720]   campaign last time around.
[02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:53.960]   And it was the guy who created the screw-googled campaign
[02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:55.960]   for Microsoft out.
[02:15:55.960 --> 02:15:59.920]   He was in charge of vision, I think, in Microsoft, which
[02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:02.040]   sounds like they just kind of put him in a room and said,
[02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:03.920]   go think about things.
[02:16:03.920 --> 02:16:05.480]   Chilu was sending.
[02:16:05.480 --> 02:16:08.560]   He was the search genius who came from Yahoo to Microsoft.
[02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:09.800]   He now is in charge of apps.
[02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:11.360]   So it's a-- yeah, it is a shakeup,
[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:15.040]   but it's Satya Nadella finishing kind of the transition.
[02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:15.320]   Right.
[02:16:15.320 --> 02:16:15.920]   I think so.
[02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:17.240]   Yeah.
[02:16:17.240 --> 02:16:18.640]   I'm sorry.
[02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:19.600]   Tom?
[02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:21.880]   No, I was just going to mention that win beta article that you
[02:16:21.880 --> 02:16:22.640]   have in the lineup.
[02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:23.160]   Yeah.
[02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:25.920]   There's a tweet from Gabe All that says,
[02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:28.760]   they can upgrade from a Windows 7 or 8.1 system
[02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:31.640]   or from a system they clean installed with Prevo ISO
[02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:34.640]   as long as they're using a registered MSA.
[02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:37.120]   But that means a registered MSA is what a Microsoft account.
[02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:37.920]   Or what is it?
[02:16:37.920 --> 02:16:38.280]   Yeah.
[02:16:38.280 --> 02:16:40.800]   And so that's where you've got to talk to Paul and Mary
[02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:41.480]   Joey, you're absolutely right.
[02:16:41.480 --> 02:16:42.640]   What the hell does that mean?
[02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:43.120]   Yeah.
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:45.080]   We might even have to talk to Gabe.
[02:16:45.080 --> 02:16:46.680]   Hey, we launched our new website this week.
[02:16:46.680 --> 02:16:49.720]   I hope you are enjoying the new Twitch.
[02:16:49.720 --> 02:16:52.000]   I think we'll probably have to do a special where we describe
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.040]   some of the features and so forth.
[02:16:54.040 --> 02:16:55.680]   One of the first things people told us
[02:16:55.680 --> 02:16:58.800]   is we don't like the way your download button works.
[02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:01.360]   So we work very quickly.
[02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:02.960]   That's the new screen savers.
[02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:04.960]   I don't know what's going on there.
[02:17:04.960 --> 02:17:07.080]   Work very quickly to make the download button work
[02:17:07.080 --> 02:17:08.080]   more like you'd expect.
[02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:10.320]   In fact, if you're-- it comes from the fact
[02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:16.160]   that the MIME type coming from cash fly, our provider,
[02:17:16.160 --> 02:17:19.120]   tells your browser, stream it as you download it.
[02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:20.800]   And most people did not want that.
[02:17:20.800 --> 02:17:22.080]   There is a new download.
[02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:24.680]   HTML5 has a new download attribute, which we're using.
[02:17:24.680 --> 02:17:27.200]   So if you're using Chrome and you click one of the buttons,
[02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:29.640]   it will just start downloading, as you'd expect.
[02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:33.600]   If you're using Safari or maybe Firefox,
[02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:36.120]   one of the browsers that doesn't support that new HTML5
[02:17:36.120 --> 02:17:38.360]   command, just right click and download,
[02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:40.160]   as you used to do on the old site.
[02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:42.520]   And we're working with cash fly on a new way of doing this.
[02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:45.200]   And I think we'll be able to make this work for everybody.
[02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:48.720]   But we do appreciate hearing from you about the new site,
[02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:49.720]   getting a lot of comments.
[02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:52.680]   If you want to understand what we were trying to accomplish,
[02:17:52.680 --> 02:17:55.040]   click the yellow button at the top where it says, learn more.
[02:17:55.040 --> 02:17:57.680]   And there's kind of a description of the planning
[02:17:57.680 --> 02:17:59.360]   and what went into this.
[02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:01.400]   It's really much more than you see.
[02:18:01.400 --> 02:18:04.680]   It's an API driven by Drupal that will be--
[02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:06.560]   we are already 30 people have asked
[02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:10.040]   to get a key to the developer's API, which excites me.
[02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:11.160]   It means that people are going to be
[02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:12.400]   start looking and making apps.
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:13.480]   You can make your own website.
[02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:15.040]   Everything you need is there.
[02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:18.760]   We also know that the CODI and Plex apps have stopped working.
[02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:21.760]   They were relying on a feed that was never an official feed
[02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:23.320]   that came from our old Drupal site.
[02:18:23.320 --> 02:18:26.400]   When we took the Drupal site offline, that stopped working.
[02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:30.440]   If you are one of the developers of the CODI or XBMC or Plex
[02:18:30.440 --> 02:18:32.440]   app, contact me.
[02:18:32.440 --> 02:18:33.640]   There's a much better way to do it.
[02:18:33.640 --> 02:18:34.720]   We've got an API now.
[02:18:34.720 --> 02:18:38.520]   You can actually do a really nice app a lot more easily
[02:18:38.520 --> 02:18:40.760]   than using the old RSS feeds.
[02:18:40.760 --> 02:18:43.000]   We'd like to help you and make that work again.
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:44.440]   But please let us know.
[02:18:44.440 --> 02:18:48.280]   Bugs@twit.tv if you find a bug, or just email me Leo@leo.com.
[02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:49.600]   I appreciate hearing from you.
[02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:52.520]   Tom Merritt, so great to have you back.
[02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:53.360]   Love seeing you.
[02:18:53.360 --> 02:18:55.560]   Everybody in the chat room is so happy.
[02:18:55.560 --> 02:18:57.080]   Please come back soon.
[02:18:57.080 --> 02:18:59.520]   Well, thank Lisa for inviting me.
[02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:00.800]   And thanks for having me on.
[02:19:00.800 --> 02:19:03.600]   And it was good talking tech, man.
[02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:07.000]   Dailytechnewsshow.com.
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:10.080]   And don't forget/support if you want to help out
[02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:10.920]   in the production of it.
[02:19:10.920 --> 02:19:11.960]   You're getting close to video.
[02:19:11.960 --> 02:19:14.640]   I want to see them push you into video.
[02:19:14.640 --> 02:19:16.080]   That's cruel of you.
[02:19:16.080 --> 02:19:18.040]   But yes, that is where we chose you.
[02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:19.760]   We just suffered together.
[02:19:19.760 --> 02:19:20.520]   Yeah.
[02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:22.280]   So yeah, now I'm looking forward to it.
[02:19:22.280 --> 02:19:23.840]   We've got a great crew over there.
[02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:25.680]   And thanks to everybody who supports us there as well.
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:26.360]   You're doing great.
[02:19:26.360 --> 02:19:28.520]   Great to see the beard of Merritt.
[02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:29.960]   Thank you so much, Baratunde.
[02:19:29.960 --> 02:19:32.360]   You're looking so hip, so cool.
[02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:34.880]   Sunglass has become you, my friend.
[02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:36.080]   Thank you, man.
[02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:37.200]   I served you as the greatest.
[02:19:37.200 --> 02:19:39.200]   And it's really nice to be back.
[02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:44.360]   I feel like this was a really intellectual and industry
[02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:48.040]   deep show I'd never been on with been before and honored
[02:19:48.040 --> 02:19:49.360]   to share with you.
[02:19:49.360 --> 02:19:51.400]   I believe I've been on with Tom Wei in the past.
[02:19:51.400 --> 02:19:53.320]   And glad to see you're doing so well.
[02:19:53.320 --> 02:19:55.080]   Tell us about Cultivated WIT.
[02:19:55.080 --> 02:19:56.280]   Cultivated WIT.
[02:19:56.280 --> 02:19:58.560]   That's the company I co-founded after leaving the onion
[02:19:58.560 --> 02:19:59.840]   a few years ago.
[02:19:59.840 --> 02:20:02.960]   We are where comedy meets technology.
[02:20:02.960 --> 02:20:04.520]   And the principal thing we're up to
[02:20:04.520 --> 02:20:08.680]   is our comedy Hack Day event series and universe.
[02:20:08.680 --> 02:20:10.120]   We take hackathons.
[02:20:10.120 --> 02:20:12.440]   We add comedians and designers to them.
[02:20:12.440 --> 02:20:16.320]   And people intentionally come up with useful and useless
[02:20:16.320 --> 02:20:18.200]   and hilarious things.
[02:20:18.200 --> 02:20:19.440]   We're coming to LA next.
[02:20:19.440 --> 02:20:22.240]   We just wrapped in New York City where the winner is an app
[02:20:22.240 --> 02:20:24.280]   called Got This Thing.
[02:20:24.280 --> 02:20:27.560]   It's a calendar app that they call a no-ductivity app.
[02:20:27.560 --> 02:20:30.640]   And it allows you to have an instant excuse to not help
[02:20:30.640 --> 02:20:33.960]   your friends by auto filling your calendar
[02:20:33.960 --> 02:20:36.480]   with real events from your local area.
[02:20:36.480 --> 02:20:38.680]   And then just share it with them and say, you see I'm busy.
[02:20:38.680 --> 02:20:39.080]   I'm very busy.
[02:20:39.080 --> 02:20:39.960]   Yeah, and you open it up.
[02:20:39.960 --> 02:20:40.720]   They're all sold out.
[02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:41.640]   They can't tag along.
[02:20:41.640 --> 02:20:43.040]   So that's got this thing.
[02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:46.120]   But our next comedy Hack Day is coming up in Los Angeles.
[02:20:46.120 --> 02:20:48.560]   Maybe-- actually, Tom, it'd be great to get you involved.
[02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:51.320]   It'll be a location to be determined
[02:20:51.320 --> 02:20:53.600]   at the weekend of August 21.
[02:20:53.600 --> 02:20:55.960]   We had Michael Ian Black as one of our judges
[02:20:55.960 --> 02:20:56.800]   the last time around.
[02:20:56.800 --> 02:20:59.120]   Anil Dash, Christina Warren from Mashable,
[02:20:59.120 --> 02:21:00.760]   and Aparna Non-Charola.
[02:21:00.760 --> 02:21:01.960]   The community's growing.
[02:21:01.960 --> 02:21:03.160]   The apps are getting better.
[02:21:03.160 --> 02:21:05.360]   The laughs are getting laughier.
[02:21:05.360 --> 02:21:09.000]   So please check us at accultivatedwitt.com
[02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:10.800]   and enjoy the comedy Hack Day.
[02:21:10.800 --> 02:21:13.200]   And this is the last plug for baritoon.de
[02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:14.600]   that Mark Eglin put together.
[02:21:14.600 --> 02:21:15.600]   Love it.
[02:21:15.600 --> 02:21:17.520]   The audio service that reads TechSA,
[02:21:17.520 --> 02:21:19.640]   so you don't have to--
[02:21:19.640 --> 02:21:22.880]   that I'm helping temporarily seed by using my name.
[02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:24.200]   Is he looking for more readers?
[02:21:24.200 --> 02:21:25.000]   I'd love to do that.
[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:25.360]   That'd be so--
[02:21:25.360 --> 02:21:26.000]   I'm sure we are.
[02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.840]   And I'll put someone in touch with your people.
[02:21:28.840 --> 02:21:30.080]   Have my people.
[02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:31.640]   You and email don't--
[02:21:31.640 --> 02:21:32.760]   No, I don't read that.
[02:21:32.760 --> 02:21:32.760]   --you're a--
[02:21:32.760 --> 02:21:33.240]   I don't read that.
[02:21:33.240 --> 02:21:34.120]   --asian, which is terrible.
[02:21:34.120 --> 02:21:35.160]   I don't want to read that.
[02:21:35.160 --> 02:21:36.600]   Thank you for the volunteering.
[02:21:36.600 --> 02:21:39.240]   It's a joint movement for sound.
[02:21:39.240 --> 02:21:40.280]   It's a sound plan.
[02:21:40.280 --> 02:21:41.840]   And don't forget, Snap-a-Tunday.
[02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:44.880]   If you're on SnapChat, all the kids are doing it.
[02:21:44.880 --> 02:21:45.760]   Crazy stories.
[02:21:45.760 --> 02:21:47.280]   I'm loving that platform.
[02:21:47.280 --> 02:21:47.840]   It's playful.
[02:21:47.840 --> 02:21:48.680]   It's goofy.
[02:21:48.680 --> 02:21:51.880]   And my Snap art, for those who are listening live,
[02:21:51.880 --> 02:21:54.000]   will be up for another two hours.
[02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:57.440]   I'll export it and put it on probably my YouTube channel.
[02:21:57.440 --> 02:21:59.680]   So I'm baritooneday everywhere,
[02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:01.760]   except SnapChat, or I'm Snap-a-Tunday.
[02:22:01.760 --> 02:22:03.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:06.960]   And my baritooneday, the feeling is likewise.
[02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:09.760]   And obviously, anyone whose background
[02:22:09.760 --> 02:22:12.400]   includes the onion, I'm from Madison, Wisconsin.
[02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:14.960]   So I feel--
[02:22:14.960 --> 02:22:18.400]   --one onion pride very, very deeply.
[02:22:18.400 --> 02:22:21.880]   So no, it is great to meet you and was thrilled to be on with you
[02:22:21.880 --> 02:22:22.360]   as well.
[02:22:22.360 --> 02:22:23.800]   The onion pride.
[02:22:23.800 --> 02:22:25.640]   Ben and Tom and Leo, of course, as well.
[02:22:25.640 --> 02:22:26.400]   That we love you.
[02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:27.360]   Yeah, you too, Ben.
[02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:29.280]   Ben's insights, as you can tell,
[02:22:29.280 --> 02:22:32.080]   are deep and profound and must-read
[02:22:32.080 --> 02:22:34.080]   at stratecory.com.
[02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:35.360]   There's a lot of free stuff there.
[02:22:35.360 --> 02:22:38.200]   But do as I just did, literally, moments ago,
[02:22:38.200 --> 02:22:42.040]   and pay $100 to get it all year long at the newsletter,
[02:22:42.040 --> 02:22:44.240]   because it's since such great insights.
[02:22:44.240 --> 02:22:45.120]   You do a great job, Ben.
[02:22:45.120 --> 02:22:45.960]   It's great to see you again.
[02:22:45.960 --> 02:22:49.120]   Thanks for spending your early morning hours with us.
[02:22:49.120 --> 02:22:52.440]   I didn't realize it was Dragon Boat Festival weekend.
[02:22:52.440 --> 02:22:52.960]   It was.
[02:22:52.960 --> 02:22:56.160]   Yes, Saturday was Dragon Boat Festival.
[02:22:56.160 --> 02:22:59.800]   So there are still the races and stuff like that.
[02:22:59.800 --> 02:23:01.560]   What it entails for me is mostly eating
[02:23:01.560 --> 02:23:05.680]   a tremendous amount of food, which is always a plus.
[02:23:05.680 --> 02:23:06.560]   Love it.
[02:23:06.560 --> 02:23:07.400]   Thank you, Ben.
[02:23:07.400 --> 02:23:08.360]   Thank you, Barretunde.
[02:23:08.360 --> 02:23:08.960]   Thank you, Tom.
[02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:10.000]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.200]   We do Twitch Sunday afternoons, 3 p.m.
[02:23:12.200 --> 02:23:15.280]   Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern Time, 2,200 UTC.
[02:23:15.280 --> 02:23:16.120]   Would you tune in live?
[02:23:16.120 --> 02:23:16.960]   Watch us.
[02:23:16.960 --> 02:23:17.840]   Join us in the chatroom.
[02:23:17.840 --> 02:23:18.600]   We love having you.
[02:23:18.600 --> 02:23:21.360]   But if you can't, we always make on demand audio and video
[02:23:21.360 --> 02:23:24.520]   of all of our shows available at twit.tv, the website,
[02:23:24.520 --> 02:23:27.480]   but also wherever you get your podcast, your podcast app,
[02:23:27.480 --> 02:23:31.280]   on your phone, iTunes, Xbox, music, all those places.
[02:23:31.280 --> 02:23:32.000]   Please subscribe.
[02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.240]   That way you'll get it each and every week.
[02:23:34.240 --> 02:23:35.040]   Thanks for being here.
[02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:36.360]   Thanks to our producer, Jason Health,
[02:23:36.360 --> 02:23:37.880]   putting together a great show.
[02:23:37.880 --> 02:23:40.120]   Our bookers, Tanya Hall.
[02:23:40.120 --> 02:23:42.920]   Tomorrow, who is on triangulation tomorrow?
[02:23:42.920 --> 02:23:47.400]   I feel like it might be a great show.
[02:23:47.400 --> 02:23:50.840]   I should quickly check.
[02:23:50.840 --> 02:23:52.800]   I'll be back at tomorrow morning 11 a.m.
[02:23:52.800 --> 02:23:55.720]   We've got iOS today, of course, at 1230.
[02:23:55.720 --> 02:23:58.280]   And triangulation tomorrow, if I could quickly
[02:23:58.280 --> 02:24:02.760]   open the document, will be Jackie McNish.
[02:24:02.760 --> 02:24:03.160]   Is that right?
[02:24:03.160 --> 02:24:05.880]   Jackie McNish, author of "Losing the Signal."
[02:24:05.880 --> 02:24:08.960]   I, Justine, will be joining us at the end of July.
[02:24:08.960 --> 02:24:10.960]   And then you are doing, while I'm
[02:24:10.960 --> 02:24:15.200]   going to triangulation, Jason, about music recording
[02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:17.560]   with Dave Pensado and Herbert Trauwick.
[02:24:17.560 --> 02:24:18.800]   Yeah, Herb Trauwick.
[02:24:18.800 --> 02:24:22.520]   They do Pensado's place, a pretty fantastic show.
[02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:25.840]   But Dave Pensado is a Grammy award-winning mixing engineer.
[02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:27.040]   I'm really looking forward to it.
[02:24:27.040 --> 02:24:30.600]   So we're getting each of our co-hosts here
[02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:32.120]   to do a triangulation while I'm gone.
[02:24:32.120 --> 02:24:34.720]   Tanya and Jason and Padre will all host.
[02:24:34.720 --> 02:24:35.640]   So that's exciting.
[02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:36.400]   Thanks for being here.
[02:24:36.400 --> 02:24:37.160]   We'll see you next week.
[02:24:37.160 --> 02:24:38.680]   Another tweet.
[02:24:38.680 --> 02:24:39.480]   It's in the can.
[02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:40.880]   Bye-bye, everybody.
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:42.720]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:44.560]   This is a great studio audience.
[02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:45.120]   Doing the tweet.
[02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:48.160]   Very patient to two hour and 22 minute tweet.
[02:24:48.160 --> 02:24:49.160]   Doing the tweet.
[02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:51.520]   Doing the tweet, baby.
[02:24:51.520 --> 02:24:52.320]   Doing the tweet.
[02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:53.320]   All right.
[02:24:53.320 --> 02:24:55.240]   Doing the tweet, baby.
[02:24:55.240 --> 02:24:57.000]   Doing the tweet.
