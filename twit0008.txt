[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   This is Twit, this week in tech, for Sunday, June 5th, 2005.
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.240]   Episode number eight.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.800]   The BBC would like to announce that the next scene is not considered suitable for family viewing.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.320]   And it looks as though we're in for a splendid afternoon sport.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.080]   On this beat, 127th, up in class, with a beat.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.400]   And now for number three, completely different.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.920]   We are all Twits now.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.400]   Well done! Great!
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.400]   Twit!
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.400]   Excellent.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:41.480]   Alright, here we are once again.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.800]   Seems like we just did this.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.800]   God!
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.040]   By the way, I want to apologize to everybody who's trying to get the Twitcast.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.840]   We're all trying to get it at once.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.720]   That's really the fundamental problem.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.680]   And you'll get it eventually.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.320]   It's just trying to get it all in the same day.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.760]   It's going to be a real traffic jam because people are still getting number seven.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.760]   And now number eight is going to come out and it's just going to be forget it.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.240]   What do we do?
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.080]   Kevin, we need more bandwidth!
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.520]   I got it really fast actually.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.680]   I was using BitTorrent and it came down in just a couple minutes.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.400]   I think the best way to get it is BitTorrent.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.040]   But apparently people don't...
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.520]   I don't know.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.240]   Maybe they don't understand how to use BitTorrent or something.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.680]   Real simply, get Azurious.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.440]   A-Z-U-R-E-U-S.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.840]   It's free, it's job-of-the-fraid-of-the-law suits.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.240]   Nah, there's no need-can't-be-suit for BitTorrent.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.480]   Well, it's a... I know that and you know that.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.840]   But I think a lot of people...
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.840]   I've run into three people in the last two weeks and be like, "Ah, I'm not going to use BitTorrent."
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.920]   Because I'm going to get surreal today.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.560]   The critical thing is to leave the...
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.560]   Once you're done downloading it, it is to simply leave it running so that people can continue to upload or use your upload.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.560]   So our listeners, the ones who use BitTorrent, really know that there's about 1,300 seeds right now for episode 7.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.960]   So the good news is with all those seeds, it does. It comes down really quickly.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.360]   That's awesome.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.160]   So let's remind everyone, as long as you're not downloading copyrighted material, you won't get in trouble using BitTorrent.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.760]   Even if you are downloading copyrighted material, you probably never get caught.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.160]   It's when you're hosting or directing the copyrighted material that you might get sued by a large organization.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.160]   So it's an amazing tool. Those day of patches that come out for games or in May.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.160]   It's amazing.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.360]   And some games that you download nowadays are months for games running into the hundreds of megabytes.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.360]   And it's simply the easiest way to get it.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.760]   You want somebody email me the other day saying that they couldn't download an episode of System
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.760]   because their parents wouldn't allow BitTorrent to be installed.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.960]   Right. Well, actually...
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.160]   I can understand that because I've cleaned up some systems where kids haven't stopped downloading stuff
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.160]   and they've been trashed. I mean, just nasty, nasty stuff.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.160]   Well, I've seen adults do this spot where...
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.160]   You've certainly not limited to children. I've seen fewer children do that.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.160]   Yeah, kids are smarter than that.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.160]   The key on this is...
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.160]   It uses it. It's safe. You're only downloading legal stuff when you're downloading the Twitcast.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.160]   There are some businesses, soldiers in Iraq, and we have, by the way, guys, I don't know if you know it.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.160]   We have a number of listeners who are on active duty in Iraq.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.160]   They can't get MP3 files. That's blocked by the even military.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:32.160]   And they...
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.160]   ...they can't get MP3 files. That's blocked by the even military.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.160]   And they...
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.160]   ...they can't...
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160]   ...they can't get MP3 files.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160]   I just think it works.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.160]   And you could...
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.160]   There's an RSS plugin for it so you could make it work just like a podcast client.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.160]   You're exactly.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.160]   So you could...
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.160]   That is really handy.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.160]   Yeah. So it's A-Z-U-R-E-U-S.SourceForge.net. It's a free download.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.160]   Install it. I...
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.160]   Somebody said I'm there having trouble with the RSS client. I don't know.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:10.160]   But all you have to do is you have to go to the Twit site, Twit.TV/...
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.160]   ...is the BitTorrent site. H-I-B. That's for high quality BitTorrent version.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:23.160]   So that's, again, TWIT.TV/H-B. Of course you all have it now.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160]   So I don't know what I'm telling this to.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.160]   And then if you have a Zurious, download the .Torrent file.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.160]   Just right click on it and save it. And then double click it.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.160]   It'll be a blue frog. That's the default icon.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.160]   Download it. And double click it.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.160]   And then this will launch. And you'll get it in like three minutes.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.160]   You'll get it really quickly and then leave it open so that other people can get it.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:52.160]   There right now as I'm looking at this 1,557 seeds of the seventh episode, the last episode.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.160]   And 322 people are downloading it. And I guarantee you because there's so many seeds,
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.160]   they're all getting it as fast as their bandwidth can handle it.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.160]   It's just the easiest way to get it. So that's enough of that.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.160]   And, you know, as I've said a few times, it's just taken some time, but we do have a...
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.160]   We now have two big players, two really big media companies that want to distribute TWIT.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.160]   And we're going to let them do it because it's not exclusive.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.160]   They're not going to use advertising or anything. So this will all be moot soon.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.160]   There'll be plenty of ways to get TWIT. We know you want to get it.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.160]   Back now to the news, boys and girls.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.160]   Oh, let me introduce you all. First of all, Kevin Rose.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.160]   Yes, hello. Beautiful Los Angeles. Things going well for you, sir.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:42.160]   Yeah, yes indeed. Calm down after the system. Are you... Are you... Are you typing a new system you're working on?
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.160]   Yeah, new system comes out this week, actually. Oh, wow. Yeah, another episode.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.160]   Are you wasting no time? That's great. Robert Herron is here, the lab man, the lab mister.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.160]   Hello, hello. He works at PC Magazine, right? Yes, for their website.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.160]   I run their HDTV lab. Check out the latest and greatest.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.160]   That's his favorite topic, but he talks about everything.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.160]   We, of course, welcome David Prager. Hasn't been with us too many times.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.160]   This is his second TWIT cast, third if you include the pilot.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.160]   And David is still at... Right. TV.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.160]   I work for a cable television network.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.160]   A small cable television network devoted to games, gear, gadgets, and G-jaws.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.160]   What is the fourth G? Gigabytes? Gigabytes, I think. Not anymore.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.160]   That was girls. Girls. Games, gear... What is the big show now on G4?
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.160]   It's Attack of the Show or is it X-Play? The X-Play and Attack of the Show are the two main shows.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.160]   What about the Donut Show, the driving donuts? What's it called?
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:47.160]   You know what? That's another show that is turning a lot of heads, just because I guess it's just cars and girls, so...
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.160]   Can't go wrong. I guess not.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.160]   And he's a producer there. He's the guy who put the web server up to the guys, but...
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.160]   Oh, geez.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.160]   You actually didn't do that by hand. You had a surgeon.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.160]   No, we got a doctor. He had some tools and...
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.160]   That was your idea, though, right, David? No, it was absolutely not my idea.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.160]   He implemented it. It wasn't his idea.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.160]   Hey, how about we do this?
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.160]   He was a guy who figured out how you could do it.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.160]   And, of course, ladies and gentlemen, let's not forget the star of our show,
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.160]   the chairman of the board of Slam Dance Industries, Mr. Patrick Norton.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.160]   I'm still trying to get up my head away from that whole web server butt thing.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.160]   Sorry, buddy.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.160]   I'm so sorry.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.160]   Hey, at least I didn't use a sledgehammer to do it.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.160]   Is there a white tracker in there?
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.160]   So, we're now log files.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.160]   This is the...
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.160]   We're taping this in the evening of Sunday, June 5th, tomorrow, June 6th.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.160]   Steve Jobs gets up on the stage at the World Wide Developer Conference.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.160]   And if the Wall Street Journal is to be believed, if seen it is to be believed,
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:56.160]   he will announce that future Max will not have power PC chips in them,
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.160]   but will have instead Intel chips.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:04.160]   That, to me, is a huge story.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.160]   Huge story.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.160]   You know, frankly, I've been saying this is the end of the world for Apple,
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.160]   that Apple is, you know, this is Apple shooting itself in the foot,
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.160]   committing Harry Carrey.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.160]   It's Steve Jobs' ultimate act of arrogance.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.160]   And the first person I thought up to call was John C. de Vorac,
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:26.160]   another member of the Twit team who hasn't been here because his Skype is still not working.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.160]   But so I actually use this technology.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:35.160]   They called a telephone and called John, and I asked him what he thought about all this.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:40.160]   So you should make this sound dour. I have just the opposite take that you have on this.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.160]   I mean, you're making it sound like, first of all, let's go over this.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.160]   And I did have this, and I've been rooting up in 2003,
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.160]   and I expected it to happen last year in 2004, based on what I heard that was going on.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.160]   It's possible that it took longer to do the middleware part,
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.160]   which is going to be the things that allow some of the software to run on the new platform,
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:03.160]   much the same way the power PC made its transition.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.160]   Now take a look at the timing on this, though.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:10.160]   We had a 10-year period of the 68,000, then a 10-year period of the power PC,
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.160]   and now we're going to have a 10-year Intel period.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.160]   I don't see that. This is such a big deal in terms of the progress that the company has been making.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:23.160]   I think this is going to be one of the greatest benefits for Apple that the company could ever imagine.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.160]   Well, what do they stand again?
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:31.160]   Well, what they stand again, first of all, is to -- and I've been arguing that they should be doing this day
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.160]   or they should have started doing this maybe 10 years ago,
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:40.160]   which is that they can bring out a standardized Intel platform running this BSD Unix that they have.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.160]   Oh, I'm sorry, it's OSX.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:51.160]   Running on a kind of a standardized PC platform, they can also manufacture standard PCs
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:56.160]   for people who want to maybe still use Windows, even though I think that they're actually maybe a swing toward OSX
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.160]   for Intel, or which I call a Mac Intel.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.160]   So you think they're going to make a dual boot system that runs both Windows and Apple?
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:10.160]   I think it's doable, and I think also if I had a choice and I think I could speak for most PC users,
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.160]   even though you've abandoned the platform, I could say for most PC users,
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.160]   and I've just written this up for PC magazine, it'll be running tomorrow.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.160]   I think most of these computers that we have on our desktop are PC users,
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.160]   or we have all the appeal of a 1977 Plymouth.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.160]   I agree with you.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.160]   People will spend a few extra dollars to have a good-looking computer.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:34.160]   That means Apple can sell against Dell and HP, the same machine with a premium price,
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:40.160]   getting the margins that those other guys will never get, and pretty much decimate the market.
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:45.160]   I think this is probably the biggest possible, possibly the biggest thing Apple could have ever done
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.160]   in terms of potentially becoming a dominant computer.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.160]   But what about the Adobe's and the Microsoft's?
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.160]   How are they going to rewrite their software?
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.160]   What are they going to do?
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.160]   Well, they've done it before, and in fact Adobe seems to rewrite it's software
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.160]   every two years, or every year for that matter.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.160]   I mean, anyway, I mean, they're all constant.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.160]   This is a recompilation thing anyway.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.160]   Adobe already has this software running on the X80 system.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.160]   How difficult can it be?
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.160]   Oh, it could be very difficult because their Windows version relies on Windows API,
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.160]   which is not the-
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.160]   Well, there's a middleware company that Apple's involved with right now,
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:23.160]   and I have their name somewhere, but it's going to take care of that issue.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.160]   This is not going to be as big a deal as you make it out to be.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.160]   So the middleware company I think you're thinking of is-
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.160]   Oh, I had the name here.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.160]   Yeah, it's a forgettable name.
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.160]   It's not a memorable name.
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.160]   Is it transitive?
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.160]   Something like that.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:44.160]   In the change from 68,000 to power PC, these were very similar chips.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.160]   They were able to make it possible for the operating system to run both
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.160]   with something called FAT binaries.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.160]   They had- the program could run in both modes,
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.160]   and there was a transitional period.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.160]   It wasn't a very happy period.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.160]   No, of course, and this won't be either.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.160]   And in fact, one of the other things that Apple did was bring out that
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.160]   Power Macintosh upgrade card, which they can do again,
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:10.160]   so people can use the old machines and then put this card in and make a transition slowly.
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.160]   My argument is this, is that Apple- this is the time for Apple to do it.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.160]   They can suffer through a transition like this, which- I agree with that part.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.160]   It's not going to be easy.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.160]   But with the iPod iTunes thing making tons of money for them,
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:28.160]   this is the time to make this move, because this long term is a fantastic idea.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.160]   Well, I think it's gutsy.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.160]   I think it's- we're going to look at tomorrow as the day Apple committed suicide,
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.160]   and here's what I think the exact opposite, John.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.160]   First of all, they're on a platform that is far from Moribund.
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:45.160]   I think that the cell chip, which is a power PC-based chip, is a very exciting future chip.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.160]   I think the Intel platform, on the other hand, has run out of steam.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:52.160]   I think they're moving to a processor platform that is seeing the end of its long-term
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.160]   and the end of its line.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.160]   Well, there's a couple of things there.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:00.160]   One is that apparently the story has it that Steve was like,
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.160]   skipped by IBM concerning the cell chip and kind of put it back in place.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.160]   Well, that, I believe, I can see this being an arrogant move on Steve's part,
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.160]   an ego move, but I think it's going to be suicide.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.160]   I, again, disagree.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.160]   The other thing is about the cell chip.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.160]   Both jobs have been poo-pooing it as lousy.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.160]   And the other guy who, of course, doing both of this is, you know,
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.160]   they're questionable sources for criticism.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.160]   I mean, Steve says this chip is no good.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:32.160]   And then also Bill Gates has, you know, again, I agree that this doesn't, you know,
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.160]   this is coming from a guy who's got a competitive product.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.160]   But at the same time, Gates is complaining about this chip.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.160]   And some of the people with an Intel have some issues with this chip.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:46.160]   So you think I knew multi-threaded, multi-core Intel chips are nothing to be sneezed at?
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:50.160]   No, I agree, the new, the Pentium D and the Hyperthreading and then dual cores.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:56.160]   They're trying to keep this chip's family alive, but it's not a long-term solution.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:01.160]   You think the G5 is the end of the line for PowerPC from IBM?
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:07.160]   Well, I mean, they probably will continue to upgrade the chip for their own internal uses,
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:11.160]   but what about the notion of Intel maybe doing something new for Apple?
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.160]   You think that's credible?
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.160]   No.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.160]   It's going to be an Intel X86 chip.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.160]   I have to be.
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:22.160]   I mean, if they did something like what you just described, which nobody said, I mean,
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.160]   that's purely just off.
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.160]   Highly speculative, yeah.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.160]   Yeah, totally.
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.160]   I mean, there's no evidence of this.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.160]   I mean, you know, long, you know, of course you never know.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.160]   But we would have known about something.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:40.160]   I mean, when my original piece, when I first stumbled onto the meetings, I had, you know,
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.160]   thought what might happen that would be interesting.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.160]   And I thought it would be kind of interesting if Apple went to the I-Tanium because they
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.160]   could use it for the servers and it would be different.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.160]   And Intel's begging for people to buy the thing.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.160]   Well, that at least has a future.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:58.160]   The X86 on their Intel is an end of line product.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.160]   Well, I mean, I'm not in agreement with that because, I mean, I know where you're coming
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:07.160]   from saying that, but in fact, you know, with the legacy out there and the fact that this
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.160]   chip is just getting faster and faster with the multi-core is like--
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.160]   But Intel says no 4Ghz.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.160]   No, nobody wants to do 4Ghz.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.160]   They'd rather do more cores.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.160]   I mean, you can double the performance by doubling the number of cores on the same die
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.160]   because I think there's shrink in my--
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.160]   I have two cores in my G5 right now.
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.160]   I have two problems.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.160]   Well, you're ahead of me.
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.160]   But most people do.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:31.160]   We're talking to John C. Devorah at columnist for PC Magazine and certainly a guy who, if anybody
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.160]   knows what's going on.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.160]   So you does.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.160]   You believe the CNET report.
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.160]   You think this will happen tomorrow?
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.160]   Yeah, I do.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.160]   And the Wall Street Journal is also kind of--
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.160]   You know, saying it's a done deal.
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:47.160]   I mean, then there's a blog right there which I link to in my blog if you go to devork.org/blog
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:53.160]   who made this observation that-- he found the language observation.
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:58.160]   He looked at the articles and noticed that they weren't neither CNET nor the Wall Street Journal
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.160]   were-- had any weasel words in their story.
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.160]   They seem adamant, yeah.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.160]   You know, I mean, it was like, you know, we got this on good authority.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:12.160]   Newspapers now a days or so gun shy about not weaseling out of, you know, some of these
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.160]   assertions that when they don't have them in there, that's actually a signal.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:20.160]   Well, especially with Steve Jobs, you don't want to be a rumor monger with Steve Jobs.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.160]   Yeah, well, you have to wonder if somebody from Apple is actually feeding this story to
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.160]   the Journal and to the CNET.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:31.160]   Well, you know, he's done that before because he's-- you know, CNET looks like it's picking
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.160]   the story up from the Journal.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:38.160]   You know, Jobs plays favorites with the high-end media and most of the people are irked with
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:42.160]   them about it because he'll, you know, put everybody on an embargo to a certain date and
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.160]   give the story to Newsweek so they can run it the day before.
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.160]   Or Mossberg.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:50.160]   Yeah, Mossberg's a big-- he's like a kind of a stooge for Apple.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.160]   And he's at the Journal and I could easily see them feeding this to Mossberg and him
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.160]   feeding it upstairs.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.160]   Yeah, yeah, actually that's a good point to be excellent.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.160]   You know, I just-- it scares the heck out of me.
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.160]   It doesn't seem like it's necessary to think Apple's in a good position right now.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.160]   It is a very gutsy move.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:11.160]   I mean, your scenario is attractive if they could start shipping computers that would
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:15.160]   run both Windows and OS X. I think there's a big market for that.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.160]   I think it's a huge market for it.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.160]   And I think the other up site for Apple would be that they get one of the problems they're
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.160]   always going to have with only selling one million computers a quarter compared to the
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.160]   hundred and two hundred and seventy five million machines that are sold every year.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.160]   This is a ridiculously low number.
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:36.160]   It's that you can't get the developer interest that you can to a market that has a hundred
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.160]   million.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:41.160]   So you think that's the carrot they're going to offer these guys for rewriting all of their
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.160]   software?
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.160]   You think Microsoft's going to play along?
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.160]   Office is critical.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:49.160]   I think Microsoft-- Microsoft-- no, I don't think it's as critical as you think it is anymore.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.160]   And besides that, if you bring out a dual-boot machine, who cares?
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:57.160]   But the point is that I think Apple's been trying to get out from underneath Microsoft.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.160]   I mean, that's why they've been bringing out products that kind of compete with Microsoft
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.160]   products.
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:08.160]   And ever since Microsoft-- or Macintosh Basic, the product that was killed by Microsoft,
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:13.160]   the people in the Mac community would love to just ditch Microsoft and go off and do their own thing.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:17.160]   And there's a lot of good stuff out there that runs on Unix machines.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:21.160]   I mean, some of it has crappy menuing systems, unfortunately, because the Unix can't do
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.160]   that because the Unix guys, they think weird.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:29.160]   But, you know, except for that Piccadillo, I think most of this stuff, I think you can
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:36.160]   outfit an OSX machine with no Microsoft material on it at all and do very well for yourself.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.160]   Would you get in line to buy one of these machines?
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:43.160]   I was asking me about buying stuff.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.160]   I know you don't have to.
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:51.160]   But if for some reason you didn't get one, would you?
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:58.160]   This is the kind of machine that if I was like a computer buyer, which I'm not, I'm a writer
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.160]   about computers, I don't go out.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.160]   I just be testing stuff all the time, so don't worry about buying stuff.
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:09.160]   But if I was a computer buyer and I had the lineup of different machines out there,
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:13.160]   and Apple, which has already developed this name as a kind of-- like I mentioned in the
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:21.160]   channel, kind of the Lexus compared to the Ford's and Chevy's, Dell and HP, I think I would
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.160]   buy the Lexus.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.160]   I have a Lexus.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.160]   I would buy a Lexus computer.
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.160]   I mean, something that's a little nicer.
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:33.160]   Maybe you might think it's better made it probably the same company in China making them all,
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:38.160]   but definitely a better looking machine with a lot of cache.
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.160]   I would get the Macintosh in a minute.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.160]   Well, there you have it, John.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.160]   Thank you for caught on such short notice for coming on the show.
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.160]   No, any time, Leo, you know me.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.160]   So there you have it, John C. Devorek.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:53.160]   He says, "It's a done deal, and it's a great idea."
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.160]   You know, you heard me.
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.160]   I just don't buy it.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.160]   Why do you think it's a bad deal, Leo?
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.160]   Here, I'll give you the three reasons.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:06.160]   Reason number one, all your software has to be rewritten, and it is non-trivial.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.160]   I know everybody's going crazy.
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.160]   Oh, no, the drivers are already there.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:14.160]   Believe me, just because Adobe makes a Windows version of Photoshop and a power PC version
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:21.160]   of Photoshop doesn't mean it's easy at all to make an Intel X version of Photoshop.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.160]   That's just a whole new kettle of fish.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.160]   And no matter what, you know, you don't just recompile.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.160]   You rewrite, and it's a lot of work.
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.160]   And, you know, they went through this 10 years ago.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.160]   I don't know if they're going to go through it again.
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.160]   The only thing that might convince them is maybe there's a giant market, so maybe we will.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:38.160]   Secondly, why X86?
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.160]   Why not Athlon?
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.160]   Why not Optoron?
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.160]   Why saddle yourself with a company that's at the end of the line?
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.160]   It's just, I mean, it doesn't make any sense.
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.160]   Roger?
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:54.160]   I'm just wondering, did he mean end of the line for Intel or just for the X86 family?
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.160]   Well, and in the line for X86, I mean, you've got to make a decision.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.160]   Are you going, uh, I-Tanium?
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.160]   Are you going, I mean, do you think it'll be an I-Tanium?
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:04.160]   By the way, let me introduce Roger Chang, who's somehow taken the place of David Prager.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.160]   I don't know how it happened, but it's magic.
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.160]   Roger is writing it about games for GameSpot over at CNET.
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.160]   And by the way, Roger, maybe you have some insight.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.160]   How did CNET get this story?
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:22.160]   Well, actually, I worked for GameSpot in the way CNET actually separates its vision to-
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.160]   to keep it pretty much behind closed words.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.160]   Let's go- so let's go back.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:32.160]   So anyway, those are two points, and I'm sure there's a third, but address those, if you will, gentlemen.
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.160]   You think it's a good idea, Patrick?
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:39.160]   I- I just think in terms of the, uh, in terms of the sheer volume of the chips and the fact that they're-
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.160]   they've got to be able to get the chips cheaper.
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.160]   They've got to have access to better chips.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:48.160]   That's, you know, it's- it just seems like from- Dvorak had a really good point.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:52.160]   I mean, if they're tapping into an architecture that's going out to, you know, a hundred and twenty-five,
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:56.160]   a hundred and seventy-five million PCs a year, it's a lot easier to get deals.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.160]   So you're saying- you're thinking they had to for economic reasons?
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:05.160]   And it's probably getting really difficult to compete, uh, you know, with- there's still-
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:11.160]   you know, the reason Intel always held onto the Megahertz numbers on the- on the processors is because the-
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:16.160]   the marketing people always said, people went in and they go for the biggest number of Megahertz,
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.160]   even if the performance is unrelated.
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:25.160]   You know, that's why Cyrix did branding that sort of upsold their, you know, from their clock speed up to what their actual performance was.
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.160]   AMD's done that.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:34.160]   You think Microsoft's going to rewrite Microsoft Office for- and this is exactly the moment Microsoft's been waiting for to dump Apple.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.160]   Well, you know, like, how important is Microsoft Office?
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:40.160]   It's the number one selling application on Macintosh.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.160]   What percentage- I mean, but what percentage of the users actually use it?
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:48.160]   Well, I mean, you have to have it if you want to live in a Windows world and you want to use a Mac.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.160]   By the way, here's my third- and I don't use a Mac.
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:56.160]   I use Open Office. I don't live on Microsoft Office.
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.160]   And you can use Open Office on Mac, but you have to run X-Window.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.160]   Here's the third reason I think it's a very compelling reason.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.160]   It's the Osborne effect.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:11.160]   They're announcing now that in six months the mini will be based on Intel and in 18 months, all of their products are based on Intel.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:15.160]   They're not going to sell one more Mac for 18 months.
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.160]   That's it.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.160]   Who would buy a Mac now knowing you're going Intel?
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.160]   And every bit of software you buy is obsolete.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.160]   This is a stupid move.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:28.160]   I'm telling you, we're going to look back at this and say this is when Steve Jobs fell on his sword.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.160]   No, I don't know about that.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.160]   All right, Kevin, you've explained it to me.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.160]   This is so exciting.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.160]   I mean, I have two Macs.
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:44.160]   I have three PCs and the only reason I don't just have one computer is because I want OS X and I also want to be able to play my games.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:50.160]   I do like a dual boot. I do like in the Dvorak brought that up, a dual boot PC Mac is attractive.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.160]   But that's a total fantasy.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.160]   You don't think that will happen?
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.160]   It can happen if it's based on Intel chips.
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.160]   And the other thing is you don't have to do a boot at all.
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:01.160]   They can run a nice little emulator that runs inside the OS X.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.160]   That will be native on the X86-based processors.
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:08.160]   So you really won't see the slowdown that you would if you're running it in a processor emulation type mode.
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.160]   You could do, you're exactly right.
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.160]   You don't have to do a dual boat.
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.160]   You could just have dual inputs.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:18.160]   Oh, by modalatable or hackable, but I don't see Steve ever signing off on doing a dual boot, you know, Macintosh system.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.160]   Why are you so stoked about this, then, Kevin?
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.160]   Let's say you can only buy a Mac Intel.
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:27.160]   Is it a dual boot that gets you excited?
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:32.160]   Well, the main thing that gets me excited is that I've always been a huge fan of Apple hardware.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:36.160]   I mean, the way they design things, the computer, if you take part of G5, open it up, play with it.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.160]   It's beautiful.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.160]   It's beautiful inside.
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.160]   Everything is laid out so clean and so well.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:47.160]   The power supply, every piece of that computer is so well engineered, it blew me away.
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:55.160]   And I would love to have, I would pay a few extra hundred dollars for a nice Apple that could run my, you know, not only my Mac applications, but my Windows as well.
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.160]   Robert Herron, what do you think?
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:04.160]   I see this maybe as a first stage for Apple in terms of creating competition for Microsoft and the operating systems.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.160]   Sweet, down the road.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:17.160]   If their software suddenly is x86 compatible, then wants to keep them from, you know, maybe making it better operating system for, and possibly throw more competition to Windows.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:23.160]   That's a great question, Robert, because are they going to release OS 10 as a standalone product that you can install?
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.160]   You need, you don't think so.
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.160]   Apple's a hardware company.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.160]   It's true.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.160]   They are not a software company.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:35.160]   Also, there's a nightmare in terms of legacy coverage for hardware on the Windows side.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:39.160]   They've never had to address on the, and all of a sudden they would have to address that.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.160]   You're right.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.160]   I mean, they own the hardware.
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.160]   They don't have to worry about it.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.160]   They know exactly what they're running on.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:51.160]   I think what you do at that point is you do like what BOS did, and that is when you start to release it, you only select, you know, here's 15 motherboards that we're compatible with.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.160]   Here's 10 different chips.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.160]   That's yours.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.160]   10 different video cards.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.160]   Very limited hardware support.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.160]   So it's totally fixed.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:01.160]   Like, no, it's 10 certified motherboard, OS 10 certified video card.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:07.160]   I mean, you know, it's interesting because Apple has a lot of the content creation software.
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.160]   I mean, they have Shake.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.160]   They have a few other 3D rendering.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.160]   Motion live.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.160]   Oh, they've got a rule of video space.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:25.160]   So, I mean, it would be feasible that Steve could be thinking that, you know, there's so many people kind of already invested in that, so often that technology and that kind of stuff.
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:36.160]   Learning that they had to do for it, that though they'll want to switch over, you know, down the road when they require more power when they acquire, you know, updated stuff and run it.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:44.160]   It's like we granted it's running on the architecture, but from their point of view, it should still feel and look like an OS 10 Macintosh.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:49.160]   I could see this if, you know, PowerPC was dead.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:58.160]   If IBM wasn't innovating, if it were kind of a moribund, you know, processor family, and I can see making the move, but IBM is an innovator.
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.160]   They're the first to use copper.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.160]   They're doing this cell chip.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:06.160]   I know Steve Jobs poo poo's this cell chip, but I think it's going to be the...
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.160]   What's the... but what's the software transition?
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.160]   It's like, what's worse?
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:17.160]   The software transition from the G5 to the cell processor or the software transition from the G5 to the Intel.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.160]   It's not that easily.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.160]   The cell processor has a power PC controller chip.
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.160]   It's a...
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:28.160]   I mean, now I'm speculating, but because it's a power PC controller chip, it's power PC family.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.160]   I think it's going to be an easier transition, a much easier transition.
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.160]   Look what happened.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:36.160]   Microsoft has gone to power PC for Xbox.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.160]   PlayStation has gone to sell for the PlayStation 3.
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.160]   Apple is going upstream.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.160]   They're going the wrong direction.
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:48.160]   Those are also relatively closed platforms and they're primarily looking at gaming performance.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:53.160]   But they're going to sell millions and gaming performance is very similar to 3D rendering,
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:56.160]   to MP3 conversion, to digital video.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.160]   It's the stuff we do.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:02.160]   I think they're going against the trend in processors right now.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:12.160]   They may be bucking in the trend in processors, but I think what they're really going after here is they've realized that people won't switch unless they have that, you know, certain application of that.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.160]   That certain game that can run on their Mac.
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:21.160]   And the true way to do this, the best way to do it would be to run native, x86, base where you wouldn't have to have a crazy emulator.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.160]   It could just run right inside of OS X.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:28.160]   But remember that most of these games are written to a Windows API, to a DirectX API.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:31.160]   They're more tied to Windows than they are tied to Intel.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.160]   So you still have to run Windows.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.160]   Right.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.160]   You would have to have the kernel running with inside there.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.160]   But there's just like the way a virtual PC operates right now.
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:42.160]   You can launch a Windows based application directly from the task bar.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.160]   It would be the same thing, but without the emulation.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.160]   So what does Microsoft's take on this?
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:49.160]   Is this good for Microsoft or bad for Microsoft?
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.160]   Does Bill Gates support this?
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:58.160]   Because if Bill Gates says there's no way they're going to be able to run Windows on this thing, they're not going to run Windows on it.
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.160]   And do you think Bill Gates is going to say that?
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.160]   Or is he going to say, "Oh good, another chance to make some money."
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.160]   I don't think so.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.160]   Well, why would he say there's no way though?
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.160]   I mean, if he's a threat.
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.160]   First of all, it's a threat.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:12.160]   If this works, it's a threat to Windows.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:15.160]   And I think inherently he doesn't like this whole idea.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.160]   It's Apple saying, "Hey, we're going to move over to your side."
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.160]   Oh, I think he hates the idea.
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.160]   But the thing is that he can't stop it.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.160]   If it's x86 based, anyone can put Windows on there.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.160]   As long as Apple allows it.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.160]   I know Apple could stop it if they wanted to.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.160]   Yeah.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:36.160]   And I just think that if normal users are going to do it, it has to be with the cooperation of Microsoft.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.160]   Because they, well, they own for one thing.
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.160]   They own the emulator, the emulator, the soft PC.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.160]   Would you buy one, Leo?
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.160]   Oh, of course.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.160]   If I buy a dual boot Windows Mac machine, I guess I would.
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:51.160]   I mean, you know, most of us, all of us live in a dual processor world.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.160]   We have Windows and Macs.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:57.160]   And that's a satisfactory solution for me right now.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.160]   I do most of my work on Macs, but you know, this tablet PC is great.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:05.160]   I mean, I'm using it for, you know, as a date book, $2,000 date timer.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.160]   That's a date book.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.160]   It is, but it's great.
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.160]   Big breakable and it won't fit.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.160]   I get in a bucket way.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.160]   It'll last a half a day.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:16.160]   It's almost as small as my date timer.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:20.160]   You know, it only costs 10 times more.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.160]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:30.160]   I noticed that somebody was commenting on one of the issues Apple had with the cell processor was that there was no VMX-out effect.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.160]   Or there wasn't a sophisticated, it doesn't need it.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.160]   It's sophisticated out of it.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.160]   Doesn't need it.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.160]   Yeah.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:39.160]   I mean, the whole machine is an out of it machine.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.160]   It's SIMD, it's SIMD in hardware.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:44.160]   I mean, but they'd have to redo all of the code that was made for AltoE.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.160]   Well, that's true.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.160]   Well, they're going to redo code no matter what now.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.160]   I mean, I, you know, there's no question.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.160]   You've got OS X in the lab running on Intel.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.160]   I mean, they've had that all along.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.160]   Yeah, Mark-Warp project is what they call the.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.160]   I mean, that's, there's no, that's easy.
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.160]   I'm not worried about the operating system.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.160]   I'm not worried about drivers.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.160]   I'm just application developers.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.160]   You know, you're going to leave behind.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:07.160]   Maybe you won't leave macro media behind or Adobe behind.
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:11.160]   Although neither of these, none of these companies have much love for Apple anymore.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.160]   Because I'm-
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:17.160]   It'd be interesting to know just what percentage of either, you know, especially macro media
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:23.160]   or, or, or Adobe, what percentage of their sales are still to the back-and-tosh platform.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:27.160]   It's telling that Steve's making this announcement at the developers conference.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:33.160]   Clearly the announcement is to, he's going to have to really kiss some butt over there.
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:38.160]   And tell, and tell the ISVs, the software vendors, we love you.
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.160]   We, you know, we're going to support you.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.160]   You've got to develop for this.
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:45.160]   He went through this in '94 when they went from power piece to power PC.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.160]   This is even worse.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:49.160]   Now, maybe it's easier in some respects because they know Intel.
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:53.160]   But, you know, I mean, you don't, nowadays you don't write to the processor.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.160]   You write to the operating system.
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.160]   You write to the API.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:01.160]   So do you think the key here is going to be a suite that he announces saying,
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:04.160]   "Hey, this is the one suite where you'll be able to develop your application
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.160]   and easily port it to Windows if you want to?"
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.160]   Kind of selling them on that.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.160]   He has to do something.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.160]   You know what, Kevin? You hit the nail on the head.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.160]   I hadn't thought of that.
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.160]   But that's exactly what he has to do.
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.160]   He has to say, "We have tools that will develop.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.160]   You want right once it runs on both.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.160]   You're exactly right, Kevin.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.160]   That's what he has to do.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.160]   They may be able to do that.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:26.160]   Then that's compelling."
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:31.160]   So will I be able to get a G5 in like a shuttle case in like three years?
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:35.160]   I don't think anybody will be getting a G5 in three years if this keeps up.
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.160]   You'll have to get an Xbox.
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.160]   All right.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.160]   I think we've done this to death.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.160]   Let's just go round the horn and cast a thumbs up or thumbs down.
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.160]   Good for Apple. Bad for Apple. Kevin Rose.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.160]   Thumbs up.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.160]   Robert Herron.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:51.160]   I'd say thumbs down from the hardware side.
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.160]   Roger Chang.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:56.160]   Thumbs up for software and thumbs down for the hardware.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.160]   You will.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.160]   Weasel.
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.160]   Patrick Norton.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:03.160]   Hey, if it makes for a cheaper Mac, great.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.160]   I still don't believe it's going to happen.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:09.160]   I believe it's going to happen and I think it's going to be the end of the line for Apple.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.160]   I'm very disappointed.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.160]   Item two.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.160]   YMAX.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:16.160]   Patrick, you talked with Intel about YMAX this week.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.160]   What's the latest?
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.160]   Remember the idea that YMAX was mostly hype?
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.160]   Well, it's still mostly hype.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.160]   It's hype that's going to be in...
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.160]   It's hype.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:30.160]   They're actually claiming there's some interesting stuff online.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:37.160]   Basically, YMAX is a microwave replacement for cable or DSL distribution of broadband.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:40.160]   It's going to be capped at about one megabit per second.
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.160]   People are excited mostly because they have this vision of being able to go anywhere in
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:47.160]   the metropolitan area and connect to the net.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.840]   Let me just correct something.
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.160]   You said one megabit per second.
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.160]   One megabyte per second?
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.160]   One megabit.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:57.160]   No, no, no.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.160]   It must be one megabits.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.160]   That's like the old home connect.
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.160]   I mean, what are you talking about here?
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.160]   It's 11 megabits right now for 802.11b.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.160]   If they can guarantee a one megabit, that's still not that bad.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:12.160]   If that's like a solid guaranteed up and down.
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:13.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.160]   That's absolutely good.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.160]   Not for down.
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.660]   Well, I mean, think about...
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:19.920]   I have the three megabit right now and it's...
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.920]   I don't even hit one megabyte when I'm downloading certain things.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.920]   This is like more along the lines of the...
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.160]   So you think if it's an ISP kind of a...
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.160]   Is YMAX line of sight?
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.160]   No.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:31.880]   It is definitely that line of sight.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:32.880]   That's exciting.
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:33.880]   So you're right.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:38.800]   Typical end user YMAX bandwidth is expected to be in a range of 512 kilobits to 2 megabits.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.160]   So you're right.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:44.400]   So really it's competing not with Wi-Fi.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.000]   It's competing with...
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   It's an ISP solution.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   It's competing...
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   That's what I said.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   DSL.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   All right.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   Okay.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   So this is guaranteed.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   So every single person is going to get one megabit.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   Well, anyway.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.160]   Well, I mean, I'm curious.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.160]   This is...
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:03.360]   It comes across like a utility, something that would be provided, you know, rather than
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.280]   dealing with relatively slow modem speeds.
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.280]   Right.
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.160]   So you're just playing on a telephone service.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:14.360]   You can at least have a megabit anywhere that's as free as water per se.
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:17.600]   Well, I don't know about free as water because there's definitely...
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.120]   What's interesting is in the...
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:25.240]   Basically this summer they're going to start doing YMAX as a fixed YMAX test.
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:30.920]   They're going to start this summer and they expect it to start rolling out in the late,
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:36.480]   very late winter or early spring of 2006.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:40.400]   And the idea is it's basically fixed to your house or fixed to your businesses as a competitor
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.400]   to Capular DSL.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.720]   The next day it's going to take about another year or about a year behind it's going to
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:52.040]   be mobile YMAX, which is going to be urban metropolis is primarily being covered.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.240]   The Wi-Fi distribution is kind of...
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.960]   I mean, it's an interesting idea.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:01.480]   And I think for smaller towns it works pretty well, but it's definitely been up in arms.
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:04.480]   It's a wireless distribution anywhere other than Philly, I think.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.480]   Right.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:10.520]   Do you see this is something like maybe a second generation of what Ricochet was trying to
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.480]   do or is it what cities...
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:20.480]   Well, I think the true second generation of Ricochet is going to be 3G and 4G coming
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.480]   over itself.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:22.480]   Yeah, that's RF.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.480]   This is at microwave frequencies.
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.480]   So it's...
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.480]   So...
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:34.480]   Well, there's going to be, I mean, between 3G, YMAX, existing YMAX, the same thing.
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.480]   Existing Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi hotspots.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:40.480]   I mean, Sprint's talking about taking advantage of Wi-Fi.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:45.480]   Wi-MAX, because basically you can cover more territory with fewer cells.
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.480]   You know what I mean?
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:50.480]   You don't have to roll as many trucks to get the net running or you can create...
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:55.480]   You can take what is essentially a whole lot of Wi-Fi cells and reduce the number of them.
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:37:00.480]   So essentially it's kind of an intermediate technology between Wi-Fi and 3G.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.480]   No, it's a competitor.
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.480]   It's a competitor to 3G.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:04.480]   Guys, remember, the idea that...
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.480]   It's cheaper than 3G.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.480]   It's much cheaper than 3G, but 3G is also regular...
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:17.080]   3G is restricted and how it can be distributed based on having to be associated with a cell
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:22.480]   phone network and basically having to deal with the idea of this is it's a pure data
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:25.480]   technology where it's not designed...
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:28.480]   It's not a voice technology.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.480]   Voice technology is being repurposed for data.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.480]   Right.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:36.480]   So this is one of the issues that's coming up with 3G, because certainly sprints...
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:40.480]   I mean all of the networks have played games here and there with whether or not you can
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:44.480]   actually access their network over particular cell phones or how you can.
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.480]   Right.
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:49.480]   By shutting off Bluetooth or trying to get on or allowing USB connections.
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.480]   And Wi-MAX is...
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:54.480]   And the other thing that Intel says is they're investing more money in 3G than they are in
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:57.480]   Wi-MAX and they're pretty heavily invested in Wi-MAX.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.480]   But I think both of those...
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:03.480]   I think there's going to be a lot of competing technologies in probably about two years to
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.480]   bring broadband, at least in the major market.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.480]   And that's great.
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.480]   I mean just the whole point is who cares?
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.480]   Co-op...
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.480]   A...
