[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.560]   have a very good Twit to you.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.640]   We didn't do it last week, so that means we have twice the
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.400]   news, twice the hot air.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.400]   Hi John.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.400]   Hey!
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.400]   Also, Jason Calicanis of Mahalo.

[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.400]   It's happening.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.400]   With the bong back up the wrong way, what happened to this?
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.200]   I just swallowed a cashew down the wrong chute.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.200]   Aha!
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.200]   I think he's hanging out with Adam Curry.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.200]   We're trying to get Adam on.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.200]   We call him once.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.600]   We have a box of cashews and macadamia right here.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.800]   You know, they say nuts are good for you, except for cashews
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.760]   and macadamia, which are pretty much heart attacks in a can.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.760]   Are they?
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.760]   Oh yeah.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.760]   Sure fact.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.400]   Eat some almonds, some walnuts.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.400]   I better get some water.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.840]   You can't eat those while you're talking though, because if it
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.800]   goes down the wrong pipe, it's going to be hacking the whole
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.800]   show.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.800]   You're terrible.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.280]   He's dying here.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.280]   This is terrible.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.280]   This is terrible.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.080]   No, I get some water.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.680]   I'll edit it all out.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.520]   Whole white bother.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.920]   Note to Dane, whatever you do, don't edit this part.

[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.640]   The night John C. de Vorek died.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.640]   Exactly.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.160]   You know, this is today is the 60th anniversary of the transistor
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.920]   invented by that Nazi William Shockley in 1947, on December 16th.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.520]   You want a Nobel Prize for it?
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.200]   John is really out.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.200]   John is gone.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   He's not down.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.200]   It's terrible.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.200]   All right.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.000]   You know, the funny thing is I thought it was the 50th.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   It's the 60th.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.680]   Yeah, you know, I didn't do the math right.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.920]   I don't know what I was thinking.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.920]   1947, that's kind of amazing.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.000]   So how come it wasn't a big deal like 10 years ago when it was the 50th?
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.240]   They didn't do nothing, did they?
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.480]   Except they do the same thing every time.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.320]   They ask more, Gordon Moore, if there's Moore's law running out of steam
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.960]   and he says, "Not yet."
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.960]   And that's it.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.680]   Reporters have no imagination.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.640]   Not yet.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.640]   Maybe someday soon.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:07.360]   Yeah, with the bio stuff coming out, it's going to probably even increase, right?
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.440]   Oh, isn't that interesting?
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.440]   Maybe that's where we'll break the wall.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.040]   Plutgians and stuff like that are going to start getting video cards that are going to
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.520]   be like protein based someday.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.120]   Like your kids are going to be like growing stuff in their laboratory.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.800]   Like, "Oh, I'm just building a Pentium chip like in my lab class in eighth grade."
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.800]   You know?
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.800]   It's probably true.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.800]   Out of proteins.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.640]   What do you guys, you guys up on a new mentor, Jeff Hawkins, a company to kind of reinvent
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.640]   artificial intelligence?
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.640]   Have you been, did you read Jeff Hawkins book?
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.640]   It's really interesting.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.640]   I don't know.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.040]   I just wonder if you guys think it's a crock or if there's some legitimacy there.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.280]   His idea is that you can never have artificial intelligence with the von Neumann machine,
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.600]   that the current processor is.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.600]   It's too linear.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.600]   It doesn't work like a human brain.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.680]   He wants to build chips that work more like a human brain.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.160]   You know, the problem I always have with this, when these guys come up with this stuff,
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.400]   is generally, what's my motivation?
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.400]   One of the things about the healing.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.240]   What's my motivation?
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.760]   What's my motivation?
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.480]   It's like all living things have motivation.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.240]   They try to avoid pain.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.560]   It's all survival.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.520]   There's no way chips can ever get that.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.920]   They don't want to be unplugged.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.360]   I mean, it was just not happening.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.840]   There's no motivation so they can never really be genuine thinking on a long run.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.840]   I don't know.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.560]   Have you seen this new documentary Blade Runner?
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.560]   Are you a replicant?
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.040]   I knew you were a replicant.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.560]   I thought you were from Brooklyn, but you're a replicant.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.160]   All I want is more time.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.080]   Yeah, see, that's a perfect example.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.000]   There's a maybe Ridley Scott knew this ahead of time.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Ever have an itch?
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   You can't scratch.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Have you seen?
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   You must have just seen the new.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.880]   It is so gorgeous.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.280]   The new, I saw at the opening night and then I went back like five nights later.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.280]   I saw it twice.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.280]   It's my favorite film of all time.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.280]   The final, what I call the final cut?
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.280]   Final cut.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.280]   It is so beautiful.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.200]   I saw it at the landmark theater, which is one of Mark Cubans.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:12.320]   It's in LA and it's the one with a massive DLP, like double the projection, you know,
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.280]   lumares or whatever, however they, however they rate them.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.480]   The scenes when they are flying through the city or flying in the big opening scene when
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.000]   they're flying over Los Angeles and it's all smog and whatever, it's so clear that you
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.680]   can see the details on the buildings and the ships and you can see the console when they're
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.840]   inside the flying car, when they're inside Terrell Corporation, you can see like the details
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.840]   on the walls.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.960]   They're in Decker's apartment.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.480]   You can see that great, you know, architecture when he looks out on the city from his, you
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.720]   know, Terrell's, it's phenomenal.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.400]   It's like seeing a new movie.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.680]   I want to see now.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.120]   Now he's done like 50 recuts of this thing.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.120]   He can't, he can't see.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.840]   It's been like three or four official things.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.080]   There's a couple of other history.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.080]   Apologies.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.480]   Now is the only one that's been recut more often than Bill of Blade Runner.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.280]   I think the reason was because it was so ahead of its time.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.080]   I mean, people first thing he's just getting you.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.280]   First thing he's to start, he dropped the narration, right?
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.720]   Because the studio made him do the narration because they thought, yeah, it made him do
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.080]   narration because people were too stupid to understand it.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.000]   And then I think what happened was because the film got such a cold following that he
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.240]   just sort of, as opposed to George Lucas, which sort of dumped the remakes down, he
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.440]   made the more complex and more ambiguous, you know, and sort of listened to the fan.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.880]   So, you know, putting in the unicorn shot and, you know, is Decker a replicant or not?
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.880]   He's a replicant.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.280]   He's a great story on that, don't we?
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.280]   It's pretty clear.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.280]   It's up.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.320]   I mean, the question is, was he originally a replicant in the original film?
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.440]   And of course, Harrison Ford says that that was never brought up to him by Ridley Scott.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.720]   And of course, Ridley Scott says, well, I'm a brilliant director.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.720]   I wouldn't tell him.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.680]   I'm trying to have him play, you know, a replicant.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.680]   Who does it know he's a replicant?
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.480]   I haven't told you guys.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.480]   I'm what I'm a replicant.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.480]   I'm a replicant.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.480]   I can tell you.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.040]   Well, now here's an interesting replicant.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.640]   Cyberlover.ru.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:13.160]   This is one of those hacker sites that has created a hot, sexy bot that people can buy,
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.680]   put it on their website or whatever.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.880]   It's got 10 different personalities that are, quote, so lifelike, the victims will hand
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.920]   over photos, phone numbers and more just to kind of get it a like them better.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.920]   Oh, please.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.880]   Actually, it could be either gender.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.480]   So I have yet to see a bot that works well.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.440]   It's like how many, you know, it's like a game you can play with these guys who invent
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.440]   these things.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.240]   How many clicks does it take before you figure out this is a bunch of bull?
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.560]   All you have to do is misspell one word and the thing stops working.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.560]   Remember these poor guys, lonely guys in the internet, they don't want to believe
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.560]   it's a bot.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.560]   I mean, that's the difference.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.560]   They're not trying to figure it out.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.240]   They want to believe it's a her.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.240]   Absolutely.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.240]   It's wish fulfillment.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.240]   No, they don't.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.040]   You just insulted half your listeners.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.960]   They want to believe I'm a her when I go on a second life dress.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.840]   Well, that's a different story.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.840]   Wait a second.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:01.840]   You go ahead and second.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.600]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.440]   I'm looking at your Skype avatar right now.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.200]   Leona is Leona Leport.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.760]   Look for Leona Leport.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.400]   You'll find Leona Leport.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.160]   Hi, big boy.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.080]   Want to come to my secret 2D layer?
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.920]   How about a nice game of chess?
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:18.920]   Yes.
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.920]   Thermal linear warfare?
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.280]   No, how about chess?
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.280]   Anyway.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:29.240]   No, the more interesting thing I think is using the technology to actually use humans
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.240]   to game other humans.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.640]   So like, you know the ketchup thing?
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.480]   Spammers who want to create like a lot of accounts on Yahoo are putting ketchupas on
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.840]   porn sites.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:44.320]   What they do is in real time, they have one bot go to Yahoo to get a--
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.320]   Like, they get the ketchup.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.920]   Because they're trying to sign up for Yahoo.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.320]   They get the ketchup and then put it on their side.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.320]   Exactly.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.320]   Put it on the porn site.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:56.360]   So a human trying to get porn types in the ketchupa and gets them their Yahoo account.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.360]   That is genius.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.360]   That's smart.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:04.000]   So what you do is you get two-- you pretend it's a bot, but it's a really human talking
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   to a human.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Absolutely.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.200]   But they have no idea.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.200]   It's like-- and one is doing the task of the other.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:16.040]   That's when like all this mechanical turf and stuff that Bezos is doing at Amazon gets
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.120]   really interesting, which is why even bother with artificial intelligence when you have
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.760]   potentially will have billions of people on the internet with billions of hours of spare
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:31.000]   cycles just send out these massively massive tasks to the hundreds of millions of people
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.880]   out there and let them either do it through a play simulation where they actually think
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.520]   they're playing a game, but they're solving a problem.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:42.120]   Or incentivize them with a small amount of cash.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.120]   Is that what my--
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.480]   You know, it seems to me that these spammers, if they can come up with some of these creative
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.560]   notions that they could find better ways to make money.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.280]   I know, but they wouldn't be as nefarious and they wouldn't feel like outlaws.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.400]   I mean, part of the reason people do this stuff is because they want to be--
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.400]   Really?
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.400]   You know, outlaws.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.400]   Absolutely.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.400]   They like it.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.400]   That explains why they go--
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.520]   That's why so many of them go public.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.520]   I mean, why do people, you know, smart people try to do heists?
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.840]   I mean, it's like they could much easier go work for the man and make $100,000 or $200,000
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:18.920]   a year as a programmer or they can send 10 million spams and try to make $100 in affiliate
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:19.920]   links or something.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.120]   You take out, Candace, you are the man.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.120]   He's the man.
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.120]   Wait a sec.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.120]   I thought you worked for the man.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.120]   Isn't the man Adam Curry?
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.120]   He's another one of the man's.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.120]   One of the--
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.120]   Okay, good.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.120]   I'd like to stick it to the man and I just want to know who to stick it to.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.880]   Stick it to-- you're the one of the man too.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.880]   Leo, you stick it to yourself.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:37.880]   Damn it.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.560]   You're so fun sticking it to yourself.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:44.880]   So do you see the Microsoft Robosanna that asked for oral sex?
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:45.880]   Whoa.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:46.880]   Whoa.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.640]   Microsoft actually pulled this product.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.120]   Not about changing the subject.
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.120]   Well, no, it's related.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.120]   It's like the bot.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.120]   It's like the bot.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.120]   No, no.
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.280]   This was an MSN.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:01.360]   If you-- MSN messaged North Pole at live.com and it was from Microsoft and they admit this.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.360]   You could add this as a bot.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.440]   It was a Santa bot.
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.800]   And if you go to the register-- actually, we have a link on the delicious page.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.360]   If you go to the register, you could get this bot.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.600]   Some programmer, you could get this bot to say, "Well, let me see.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.800]   Is it something like oral sex?
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.800]   Who's fun?"
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.800]   Whoa.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.800]   That's a lot.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.800]   Wait a minute.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.800]   Here it is.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.800]   It's right.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.800]   It's funny.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.800]   It was a guy.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.800]   So, but I'll chat about something else.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:27.800]   Whatever you said that it doesn't--
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.800]   Well, no, listen.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.800]   Now, you tell me.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.800]   You tell me.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:31.800]   So, this is the dialogue.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.800]   The register says, "Pizza?"
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.800]   Santa says, "Yum.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.600]   What do you want for Christmas, El Ridge?"
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.800]   El Ridge says, "Maybe you shouldn't eat so much.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:38.800]   You're quite large."
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.920]   Santa says, "My elves will get right on that.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.120]   And what else are you wishing for this year, El Ridge?"
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.040]   Maybe you shouldn't eat it.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.240]   See if you could get someone else to eat it.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.240]   Eat it.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.240]   No, thank you.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.240]   Don't eat things.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.240]   Eat it.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.240]   See if you could get someone else to eat it.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.240]   Eat it.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.600]   You want me to eat what?
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.680]   It's fun to talk about oral sex, but I want to chat about something else.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.360]   You dirty bastard!
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.360]   I think you're a dirty bastard.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.360]   This is an actual transcript.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.680]   Wait, you're playing a tape or were you acting that out?
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.680]   I was acting that out.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:16.200]   No, Leo's got the man of a million voices that has not been exploited.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.920]   I always wanted to be a dirty Santa.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:19.920]   Henry.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:20.920]   You've always wanted to be Henry.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.440]   Kind of like Henry.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:27.440]   So it's Microsoft actually admitted this and pulled this guy.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.080]   And now when you ask about pizzas, it says, "If you need a break to go eat, I'll be right
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.080]   there when you come back."
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.720]   I like your Santa voice.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.880]   Oh, well, it comes to my love, Jason.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.880]   So...
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:40.880]   Oh, no, Santa.
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.960]   I feel like very uncomfortable right now.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.400]   You know what Santa's going to be given this year?
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.280]   Actually not going to be given two things.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.680]   Weas and Kindles.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.640]   You can't go for $1,500.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.520]   $1,500 on eBay.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.520]   I get to do what?
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.760]   For the Kindle, the Amazon Kindle, the thing that we do.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.760]   Well, what in many?
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:03.320]   It's been $1,500 for a white elephant.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.440]   I bought one, but I paid the normal price for it.
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.960]   I think that's a PR company doing their thing.
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.960]   Oh, interesting.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:09.960]   It's got to be.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.960]   Come on.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.600]   I'm not on me to be cynical, but I am on the call with John DeBorack.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.360]   No, that's interesting.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.880]   I say that's how the PR companies do it.
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.880]   They get a product.
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:20.880]   They don't take enough.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.880]   They sell it out.
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:26.080]   They put it on eBay for four times in March and then they smock the buy it later on.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.000]   Ah, DeBorack/Warg.Warg.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.480]   That's pretty good.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.480]   No, it's not.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.480]   He sounds like somebody.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.920]   He does sound like somebody, but doesn't sound like me.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:34.920]   It's his Edward G. Robinson.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.920]   No, no, no.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.920]   It's a little bit like the cop on the Simpsons.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.920]   That's what it is.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.920]   It's a frog for Minimouse.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.920]   Oh, look at this.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:44.920]   I got the...
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.920]   I got Minimouse.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:54.080]   But the thing is both Chief Wigam and Minimouse are actually doing Edward G. Robinson impressions.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.560]   That's what you don't know.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.240]   Ah, there you go.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:03.000]   No, actually, I wanted to forget who the guy does Wigams, but he came on Leno one time.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.640]   He says, "All of his voices that he does on the Simpsons are bad impressions."
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.640]   Right.
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.120]   He does the bad Jerry Lewis, the bad Edward G. Robinson.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.280]   So he's a professor.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.880]   That's the Jerry Lewis.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.880]   And then he does a bad...
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.240]   What's the name of that actor who always played...
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.120]   He was an easy writer, played the stoner.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.120]   He does that guy.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.120]   That's all the...
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:29.520]   Oh, that was the bus driver, dude.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.520]   Anyway, 14...
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.520]   Yeah, there.
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.520]   That's good.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.520]   1,400 bucks.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.120]   Actually, one Kindle sold for $880, $830.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.840]   You know, I like my guy.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:39.840]   I actually got a Kindle.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.840]   I kind of like it.
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.400]   I don't use it all the time, but it's better than the Sony.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:47.040]   I applaud the making it because I think that it's the...
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.040]   They're getting closer.
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:51.160]   I mean, we've seen this for a decade now at the e-book stuff.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.520]   And from what I understand, people who are actually reading it...
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:57.720]   If you took the price out of it, people reading it say it's a nice reading experience.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.720]   It is.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.720]   It is.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:05.360]   So if you take out the player haters with the nonsensical issues like price, Fdo, and
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:10.280]   all these other things, like paying for blogs, if you assume that it'll be free, the device
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.240]   itself will be free at some point because they'll make them out in the books or the device
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.600]   will be free with five books a year or something like that or a subscription model.
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.560]   We'll give it to you for free if you subscribe for two years, 20 bucks.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.120]   It's a little bit messed up making them by the time the scheme of yours even comes to
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.120]   fruition.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.120]   Here's the deal.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.560]   You pay a hundred bucks more than you do for the Sony, but the books are a lot cheaper.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.680]   And you get lifetime EVDO from Sprint.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.520]   I mean, I think it's cool.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.120]   You buy a book and you got it in like 30 seconds.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.120]   It's right there.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.120]   I haven't hooked it up to the computer once.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.120]   And you don't have to have the computer.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.000]   I was talking to Ev Williams from Twitter.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.960]   We were both in Paris for this low web conference and he had one, which his wife stepped on
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.920]   and broke, but that's a couple of sides.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.240]   That never happens to a paperback.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.520]   And done, but broken, gone.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.520]   That's terrible.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.520]   Fruidal.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.000]   And he has no books to read on the way home, but...
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   Oh, no.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   He doesn't have to read the magazines.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   Exactly.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Exactly.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.680]   So the interesting thing though is like, what is version two going to look like?
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:06.680]   What is version three going to look like?
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.360]   And what does the price point, you know?
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.920]   I just disagree with crippling it though because why not allow it to be one of the
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.760]   Wi-Fi enabled?
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:19.160]   Why not allow it to have Safari browser or Opera and just let people go to town with
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:24.080]   it because then people can then start coming up with their own uses for it, which is very
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:30.280]   unlike Jeff Bezos, who is very much a platform guy with S3 and everything.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.320]   He's like, let the street do what they want with this technology.
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.720]   He's not doing that here, which I find weird.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.120]   Wonder how much of that is the publishers that are keeping him from doing that?
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.080]   There's also piracy.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.240]   There's battery life issues too.
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.240]   I mean, if you put Wi-Fi in it, you don't allow it.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.240]   That's true.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.240]   It'll die in eight hours.
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.560]   You want it to last as long as you can.
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.560]   This is a jerky.
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.560]   Come on.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.560]   It's pretty light.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.640]   It's easy to hold in your hand.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.000]   I've done a lot of reading on it.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.280]   I bought books on it.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.280]   It does have a browser.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.800]   It just doesn't do the formatting properly.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.800]   So you can't...
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.120]   Is it lighter than a book?
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:07.000]   So if it's lighter than a book, then for me, that's one of the problems I have with these
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.720]   book things is that they're heavy.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.720]   Yeah.
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:10.720]   I'm like, I'm...
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:11.720]   Well, it's not just lighter than one book.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.720]   I got 50 books in it.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.720]   Right.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.720]   We only have one at a time.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.320]   Gosh, it's definitely lighter than 50 books.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.320]   It's not...
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:19.320]   I don't just read one of the time I have the Chronicle.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:20.320]   I have the Examiner...
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.320]   Or not the Examiner.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.960]   In a related news story, the iPod is lighter than 3,000 albums.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:24.960]   That's true.
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.520]   No, but that's the same model.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.520]   That's the same model, though.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.040]   Your iPod is your whole record collection.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.720]   This could be your whole library.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.720]   This is the...
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.280]   You remember the Rio MP3 player, the first one that came out?
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.480]   I got one right here.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.040]   And it was like, what, 128K?
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.040]   You could feel like 10 songs off?
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.040]   Nothing.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.040]   I don't want it.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.040]   Right.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.080]   And it was horribly flawed, but it showed the promise.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.400]   And I think this thing may have flaws, but I think it shows a lot of promise.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.360]   Which means Apple's going to come along and make a better one.
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.360]   Well, wait.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.240]   There's a leap of faith here with that assertion.
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:01.400]   One is that people were clamoring for MP3 technology.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.400]   They loved it.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.400]   It was...
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.400]   They were...
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.400]   This college kids were all over it.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.400]   Everybody was jumping on anything they could.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.400]   That was MP3.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.480]   I don't see that happening with eBooks.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.600]   I said my initial reaction to the Kindle was that, that it was built around a business
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.600]   model, not about around customer need.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.680]   Yeah, there could be something to that.
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.360]   I mean, here's an idea.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.520]   Why doesn't the thing support MP3s or does it?
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.520]   It does.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.520]   Okay.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.520]   So you can put your music library...
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.520]   And Audible books.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:28.520]   Well, I love Audible.
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.520]   Hey, so do I.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.520]   Although, I...
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.520]   Here's your opportunity.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.520]   You can go for it.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:37.240]   I'd like your business advice here real quick before I go into that.
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:41.160]   So ever since we've been taking Audible ads and I love them and certainly we need the
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.080]   money to keep this thing coming, but the audience has been going down.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.560]   And what I'm realizing is these ads are so good.
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.480]   People are going out and getting audiobooks and they're stopping.
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.760]   They're no longer listening to us.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.760]   That is...
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.280]   Audible is that good.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.760]   Audible is that good.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.480]   I have to tell you, because Audible is so good that it will make you...
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.200]   It will go right to the top of your podcast list.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.200]   This is good.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.120]   You're making up for Corey Doctoral last time.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.120]   Audible is great.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:13.000]   I mean, you know what I like about Audible is that they protect all that content for you.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   Yes.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.040]   You don't have to worry about the authors having their work stolen.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.040]   Exactly.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.040]   My thoughts.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:23.160]   You can have a business model that scales and grows, assuring that artists are compensated.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.160]   So it's a win-win.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.840]   The artist gets to make money, the user gets to agree with the want.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:27.840]   Who could be against that?
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.920]   I mean, you'd have to be a communist, to be against that.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:35.960]   You know, when Corey was on complaining about their DRM, they played that cut.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.600]   You know, they brought it to the boardroom and played it for everybody.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.600]   I hope they do the same for this cut.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.400]   I think you're absolutely right, Jason Calicanis.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.400]   There you go.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:46.400]   Duh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-n
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:20:00.120]   My changes.
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:05.280]   John Bardeen, Walter Bratton, and William Shockley and the invention of the transistor
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.280]   in 1947.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.400]   So it's the full story.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.640]   It's the birth of the information age Michael Reardon and Lillian Hodson.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.440]   And it is available on audiobook.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.640]   They have some really interesting books about computer history.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.880]   There's one on Eniac.
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.800]   All the Silicon Valley history books are there.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:25.320]   But Crystal Fire, it's the story of the team at Bell Labs that invented the transistor
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.320]   in 1947.
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.880]   And it's really quite dramatic.
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:28.880]   Highly recommended.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.880]   It's available.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.360]   If you go right now to audible.com/twit, that can be your book.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.760]   Actually, picked from 45,000 plus books.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.480]   They're all great.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.240]   And all protecting the rights of the authors who wrote them, incidentally.
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.840]   And audible.com/twit.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.200]   And we do actually love Audible.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.240]   I really am glad to have them along.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:51.720]   But I just ask if you listen to audiobooks, and of course you will because they're great,
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.200]   please keep listening to the Twit.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.280]   But wait a minute.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.360]   The person who's doing that is not listening anymore.
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:57.360]   Damn.
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.960]   Right after Twit finishes, or you can multitask if you're at your desk.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:01.960]   Listen to both.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.360]   You put them into your queue and you're all set.
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.360]   Audible.com/twit.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:10.240]   We thank them so much for their continued support despite Corey Doctorow.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.960]   So you know what you can get on there too?
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.680]   They have Chris Anderson's The Long Tail.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.680]   It's a very good list.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.680]   Must read him.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.680]   Yes.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.760]   And John Patel, the search is up there.
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:26.480]   So listen, Corey Doctorow may feel that authors shouldn't get paid.
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:31.040]   But hey, some other great authors like John Patel and Chris Anderson also very respect
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.040]   the technology industry.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.760]   Would like to see people get paid.
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:35.760]   I could tell you two people.
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.840]   Actually, three people will not be on this show together.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.960]   Jerry Poornell, Corey Doctorow, and now Chris and Calick and the three of you will never
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.280]   appear together.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.280]   You and Jerry.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:47.240]   That would be a great show.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.880]   Here's my rebuttal to Corey Doctorow.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.280]   If he's so into a free culture and everything like that, why doesn't he waive his like $10,
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:58.360]   $15,000 speaking gigs for the next 10 years?
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.880]   You know, it's like he makes money off the speaking gigs, right?
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.120]   And he, but he gives the books away for free.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:07.360]   But if you're an author who can't do speaking gigs like Jerry Pernell, maybe he doesn't get
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.680]   $10,000 speaking gigs.
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:13.440]   You can't talk about, you know, whatever, but maybe he wants to make one of his books.
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.240]   I mean, is this so wrong?
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.080]   I understand that.
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.920]   But I think that is the issue that we, that with the Kindle in a way is that, well, you
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.360]   know, I was talking about this last night.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.200]   I was talking about a great book I had just read.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:29.720]   And I said, Oh, I'd love to lend it to you, but it's on the Kindle and I can't.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.720]   And what about that?
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:31.920]   Do you guys do that?
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.920]   Do you lend books to friends?
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.440]   Cause that's a big part of the culture.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.440]   Give it away.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.440]   Give them book.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.440]   You can't do that anymore.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.440]   Hmm.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.480]   But these cost a lot less than the print books.
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:45.000]   And that's the, that's exactly what I said is, yeah, but for, you know, for nine bucks,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   you could buy it.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   Less to make too.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.640]   They should cut anything to make.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.640]   Right.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:54.520]   But in terms of the user experience, if I paid seven, eight, nine bucks, but there's something
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.640]   about me lending you a book, don't you think like, Oh, this, you got to read this is a
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.640]   great book.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.640]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.720]   There's that pass around thing that goes around with books.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.760]   They should, they should let you send the first three chapters to another person so they
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:06.760]   could try it.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.600]   You could squirt it to them.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.920]   Like the zoom.
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.000]   Some about that phrase just.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.960]   This show has got some weird sexual undertones.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:21.520]   We got oral Santa, oral sex Santa.
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:24.680]   We have the Russian artificial intelligence.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:28.440]   I mean, it's, I know I'm going to raise the level right now.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:36.240]   According to English gamers, the we attracts cockroaches.
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.240]   What?
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.040]   Actually, it's Japanese.
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:47.440]   The Japanese language gaming site barks claims the we gives off a cockroach friendly frequency
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.360]   that attracts the pests.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:54.000]   Have you seen cockroaches around your we?
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.920]   You mean John about the Nintendo we know you.
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:57.920]   Yes.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.600]   It's not back in the gutter with John.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.600]   What?
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.600]   Yes.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:06.520]   I'm talking about the Nintendo we not the other one.
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.520]   Actually no.
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.920]   I want to whether that's.
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.000]   Do you have a we?
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   You have a we.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Yeah, of course.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.600]   And but you know, I'll give you a thousand bucks for it.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.600]   Okay.
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.600]   Do you have a we Jason?
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.280]   I have a couple of them.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.280]   We have at the office.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.280]   I go on a call.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.800]   I played it for like no more than an hour.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.480]   I like that rock band.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.480]   That is the most fun.
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.440]   I've had on a video game system since Defender.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:38.400]   Did you see that Activision has it won't let rock band work with a guitar hero guitar?
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.800]   I just don't.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:45.400]   You can't just bring your you can't bring your acts from another game over here, man.
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.800]   Wasn't the whole idea of a software bug?
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:48.800]   What wasn't?
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:52.200]   Was that just folklore that the bug was actually a bug that crawled into a computer and got
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.200]   fried on the table?
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.280]   So that actually goes back to great hopper days.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:01.000]   But now see, and there is a very famous page in her notebook where she's taped the moth
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.360]   and she said the first software bug.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.160]   But as it turns out, I think it was a hardware bug.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.160]   Okay.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.160]   Yes, you're right.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.160]   The first hardware bug.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:16.040]   But as it turns out, according to my research, textile workers in 19th century Britain, when
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:21.120]   they had problems with their jacquard looms would also say there's a bug.
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.240]   So it goes way back.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.240]   That makes sense.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.240]   Does it really?
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:29.800]   Well, I mean, those rooms would have a lot of, you know, there's a lot of insects in that
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:30.800]   fiber.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:31.800]   Exactly.
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.560]   So that's what anyways, she's kind of credited Grace Hopper with creating bugs.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.120]   But apparently, no, she didn't.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.600]   She in fact, she knew of it.
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.720]   She was making a little play on words.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.720]   It was a little joke.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.720]   This is a bug.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.680]   Anyway, I don't know if that's true or not.
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:49.360]   And I'm sure that the bugs in those jacquard looms probably actually did affect the performance
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:53.200]   as opposed to some dead moth next to a tube or a cockroach in your we.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.280]   Hey, I got us plug a couple of guys, please.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:02.120]   Robert Phipps, IT lecturer at West Virginia and Chris Kooling, who does cool tidbits.net.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:06.360]   They both sent me a West Virginia hoodie, which doesn't do me any good anymore because
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.520]   they'd lost the one game they needed to win.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.680]   So then I, you know, I feel bad about it.
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:18.320]   But meanwhile, my team, the Appalachian state mountaineers, one, three in a row.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:22.960]   Now I need a three-peat sweat shirt or something from somebody.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.680]   Jason, you don't realize that I used the show to solicit clothes.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.040]   I could give you a Yale cap.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.040]   That what it's come to?
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.040]   Wow.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.200]   I've never said you lost that PC magazine column.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.200]   Thanks for that.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.200]   Wait a minute.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.200]   Aren't you still in PC mag?
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.360]   Of course, he doesn't keep up with anything.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.360]   I'm joking.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.360]   PC Mag still publishes.
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.360]   Oh my God.
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.680]   I am on eBay right now.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.680]   I am not kidding.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.840]   The buy at price for a Kindle.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:46.840]   2,990.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.840]   That's the scanner.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.840]   Yeah, that's the sucker.
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.480]   Some guy selling it to himself.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.240]   I think it's a publicity stunt.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.920]   Question is what it would have been.
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:57.560]   Yeah, what are the real bid prices so far on that?
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:58.560]   I see.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:59.560]   Let's see.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:01.400]   You guys don't like football, apparently.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.400]   No.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.360]   No, no, Jason's a basketball guy.
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.360]   Ask him about the Knicks.
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.360]   He'll go on for hours.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.360]   Oh, the Knicks.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.680]   I mean, this is that's typical of a guy like that.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.680]   Guy like what?
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.280]   You'd like the Knicks.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.120]   Well endowed gentleman of us.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.120]   What?
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.120]   What's he like?
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.120]   What do you mean?
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.120]   The Knicks.
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.120]   He's a Knicks.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.120]   He's a Knicks.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.120]   He's from Brooklyn.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.680]   That's his problem.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.680]   No.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.680]   I'm sorry to hear that.
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.240]   There was a really great blog posting.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:32.040]   I got to find it because I want to give the guy credit.
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.920]   Talking about the latest version of Windows and everything that went wrong with Vista
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.080]   has been fixed in this new version of Windows.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.840]   It's faster, more reliable.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.360]   All the problems have gone.
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:48.280]   For those of you who really put down Microsoft's development team, these guys know what they're
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.280]   doing.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.280]   It's amazing.
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.280]   New Microsoft.
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.280]   I loved it.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.480]   And when you read it, you go, "It actually makes sense.
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.440]   It is an improvement.
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.240]   The upgrade is XP."
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.240]   Yeah.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:06.400]   The guy was like, "Yeah, and it's got very cute, soft, bubbly retro."
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.400]   Really?
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.400]   I like this.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.160]   I just installed the new Mac operating system.
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.400]   I always wait a couple of weeks and they have the patches out.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.400]   It's really nice.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.400]   It feels more stable.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.400]   I like the library.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.440]   Although I think Apple has the same problem Microsoft does, which is essentially there's
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:25.480]   nothing much new you can do.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:29.080]   So you end up screwing stuff up just because for the sake of change.
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.840]   You just change for the sake of change.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.600]   You guys, you can stop now XP.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.640]   I like the desktop spaces is probably the best feature.
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.480]   We can switch between different window configurations.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.280]   I mean, that's existed in third party apps.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.280]   I can't.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:47.080]   But give it a chance because it gets confused and you start losing Windows.
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.800]   You know, I don't use that feature.
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:53.760]   I just find if you have enough monitors, you don't need to use it.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.120]   How many monitors do you have, John?
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:58.120]   I only have two, but that's all you need to make.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.120]   What size?
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.240]   Instead of four spaces, he just has four thirty inch displays.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.920]   Who needs spaces?
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.480]   They're not thirty inch, but they're big.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:10.240]   Because I have two thirty inch at home and a thirty and two twenty fours are warm.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:13.960]   So what would you need to swap your desktop for if you got all that space?
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.960]   But it's just nice to have the app.
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.200]   So do you have the thirty in the middle and the two twenty fours like wings?
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.200]   Exactly.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.920]   And I turn them landscape, like, you know, whatever, flip them.
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.880]   So they have the long pages so I can profile.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.800]   Yeah, I put IRC chat on there.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.400]   I put, you know, my iTunes up there or whatever.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.880]   But I have three thirty inches, but it's too much.
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:32.880]   It's too wide.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.400]   We have three thirty inches.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:38.000]   So you, you can't see the second half of the wingmen.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.080]   So sort of a waste.
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.360]   What I want them to make is your peripheral vision doesn't go far enough.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.360]   You can't.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.360]   Right.
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:46.560]   What I want them to make is the curved monitor.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:51.040]   So if they can take the thirty inch monitor and make it, I don't know, another couple
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.880]   of inches on each side, eight inches and then have a curve a little bit, that would be
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.400]   the five thousand dollar monitor.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.600]   I don't know why they don't have like five dollars.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:03.360]   There's a monitor made by some guys that that that you go into.
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.680]   You sit in this and it's like a it's like you're in a dome.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.160]   Have you ever been seeing this thing?
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.040]   It's actually quite interesting.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:13.160]   I've done a lot of research into this stuff and it's sort of like ever since the thirty
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.840]   inch monitor came out, they stopped advancing it.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.640]   Well, you can't get any bigger.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.640]   Can you get any bigger?
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.640]   Could you reasonably get any bigger?
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.640]   Of course.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.200]   I mean, if people are having two thirty inch monitors or Al Gore's got three, of course,
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.200]   you can get bigger.
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.200]   That's right.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.920]   So I'm sitting in front of a thirty and a twenty four, but I do need another twenty four
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:31.920]   on the left.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.520]   You got to go to twenty four.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.320]   Isn't that a global warming thing?
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.160]   That's a lousy carbon footprint.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.160]   I'll tell you right now.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.160]   No kidding.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.200]   Well, I need more.
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:45.920]   I think he lives in like an eight thousand square foot house or something like just him
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.000]   and his wife.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.280]   And you know, it's some problems there.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:53.720]   But I don't want to knock out because he's easily doing everything he can for the world.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.720]   I'm doing my part.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.040]   I ordered a Tesla.
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.040]   Did you?
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.040]   Yup.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.800]   The one the hundred thousand dollar Tesla?
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.520]   A hundred ten plus tax.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.240]   Oh, who's counting after the first hundred?
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.240]   It's all.
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.440]   And this is the one that goes zero to sixty in like three seconds, right?
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.440]   It goes four seconds.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.680]   Four four really?
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.680]   Wow.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:14.680]   It's as fast as a one.
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.680]   When you're going to get delivery?
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:19.320]   I think they're going to start in the second quarter.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:23.520]   I got the inside dope on the whole thing and they just basically wanted to get the best
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.000]   possible transmission in it.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.960]   And so they went through three transmissions.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.280]   And the first one would have been good enough.
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:31.000]   It's just they're kind of being kind of obsessive about it.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.160]   I thought it's electric.
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.520]   It still has a transmission though.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:38.760]   And the transmission is very important because it uses the transmission to I think, you know,
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.880]   conserve the batteries, you know, optimize the batteries.
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.880]   So this is a awesome car.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.840]   I would love to see this.
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:49.040]   You're going to pin your head to the back of the seat though.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.000]   Well, I have a Corvette right now.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.880]   So it's the same speed from zero to sixty as the Corvette and the Ferrari F430.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:32:03.480]   So it's all the same speed, but one of them, you know, has no noise when you do it and it
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:09.800]   gets 250 mile range and it costs nothing because you're doing it off of electrical.
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:14.560]   And you can put a, I'm going to put some solar panels on the garage.
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.720]   And so I will be 100% off the grid.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.120]   No, you can't get enough juice out of the solar panels.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.520]   Yes, I only drive like 10, 15 miles a day.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.640]   I drive to my office and back.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.640]   It's four miles away.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:28.240]   So I will be 100% off the grid because they put a battery pack and you charge your battery
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.240]   pack in your house.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:31.480]   The battery pack in your house is charging all day long.
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.240]   Oh, so you just swap it in?
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.240]   Yeah.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.440]   When you plug it in, you plug into the battery pack, which has been charging all day.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.440]   So I'll get home at night.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.440]   I'll get a battery charge from the sun.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:43.440]   And then there's also these little windmills you can get that cost like 30 grand.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:48.160]   And then I'll wind it from driving zero to 64 seconds.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.800]   Let me get this saved.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:50.800]   Let me get this straight.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.560]   $110,000 car, $30,000 windmill.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:55.000]   Solar panels, probably 10 grand.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.840]   But you say, you know, I don't know if my, my, my 66 dots and counts, but it only cost
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:03.960]   me $4 a week to run.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.640]   Hey, Moore's law, baby.
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.840]   It basically means that this car is going to, they're going to pay you $7 to take this car
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:10.840]   in another four years.
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:14.120]   I'm just glad you're buying this so that you're making it possible for the rest of
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:17.440]   us, Jason, because you're funding this, you're moving it forward.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.080]   And then I think that's the, yeah, also I just want to have the car that is, you know,
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.560]   not available to anybody else.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:23.560]   Yeah.
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.960]   Did you, did you put down a deposit?
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:27.960]   Five grand.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:28.960]   How much?
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:29.960]   Five grand, baby.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:30.960]   So it's five grand.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:31.960]   It's only five grand right now.
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:37.120]   I let them know that if one of the people on the 100 list or the first 200 who paid full
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:40.320]   fare drops out, I want their spot and I'll pay the full fare.
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:43.520]   I don't know if they'll do it or not, but, you know, I doubt it.
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.800]   They'll be giving you a call.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:48.240]   I think, I think you'll be hearing from Mr. Tesla.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.520]   His hair may be sticking straight up, but you'll be hearing from him.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.960]   I think it's, you know, this is why I'm sort of very optimistic.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:58.520]   I think the whole global warming thing is going to be solved like in the next 10 years
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.880]   because of free markets.
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.920]   Everybody wants to drive an electric car.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.160]   Everybody wants to have a solar panel on their roof.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.600]   Everybody wants to live in a clean city with great air, but then we'll be all be dead
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:10.360]   from staff infections that can't be cured from penicillin.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.560]   You got to go to Duluth once in a while and hang out.
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:14.560]   Get out of the valley.
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:15.560]   Why?
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:16.560]   I'm not in the valley.
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:17.560]   I'm a Los Angeles.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:18.560]   Worse.
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:19.560]   It's, it is worse.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:20.560]   You're correct on that one.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:21.960]   Yo, man, go to Shanghai, man.
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.640]   You can't even breathe in that town.
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:25.840]   You're saying real people won't do this.
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.280]   John, is that what you're saying?
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:31.880]   I don't think the average person living in the Midwest cares about that.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:36.240]   The Tesla or the electric car or solar panels, to be honest about it.
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:39.400]   They, you know, they care about, well, they don't care about that.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.600]   I mean, they care about what they care about.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:41.600]   They care about their family.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.120]   Maybe they care about their neighbors.
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.120]   That's what this is.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.120]   We care about the job they have.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.440]   Save the world for your kids.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:50.880]   I don't think there's, I think that they, a lot of people believe that saving the world
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:57.040]   and stuff is a, you know, save yourself.
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:01.840]   I think that I agree that that is how people in our generation and your generation,
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:08.500]   think, but I think this younger generation has a very like obsessive environmental bent
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.500]   to them.
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:14.340]   And I think like if you drive, you know, an SUV or a Hummer, where our generation thought
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.880]   that was kind of cool, they're like, not cool, you know.
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:21.280]   And I think that's what generation thought it was cool to drive a Hummer to be honest
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.280]   about it.
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.280]   Well, again, it's a truck.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:28.320]   Somebody sent me a YouTube video.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:34.760]   A YouTube video, somebody using a Tesla coil to protect their cars.
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:39.840]   You know, if you could do that, if somebody touches your Tesla car, their Tesla coil
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:42.840]   goes off and that'd be cool.
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.520]   Isn't it thinks fiberglass?
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:47.000]   Oh, must be real light, right?
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   All right.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   Let's talk about.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   All right.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   You want to talk speculative future?
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   Alexander Zait.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   No, thanks.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   Alexander Zait.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   I've got some news stories.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   This is a news story.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   Alexander Zait.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.960]   Chief scientist at the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Radio Engineering and
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:09.640]   Electronics has dumped something very controversial.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:13.360]   He has access to one of the most powerful radio transmitters on earth and he's sending
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:18.360]   message to aliens saying, come on, we're over here.
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.040]   Look over here.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:24.640]   Now this is kind of what they call active SETI instead of waiting and seeing electronic
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:31.440]   signals and people are up at arms because they saw Independence Day once too often.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:37.000]   They read a little too much sci-fi, but also some people say, well, how dare this guy,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.520]   you know, speak for us and announce the Earth's existence or existence?
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.920]   We don't know what's out there.
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:45.920]   You know, there's any kind of style.
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:46.920]   It salts people.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.080]   They could come over and, you know, do an Independence Day.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.080]   He's speaking for us.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:54.320]   Let's get Bobby Slaton up there to make some commentary.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:57.120]   So your wife, I slept with her.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:01.800]   One of the things that has always fascinated me about this whole concept is that if there's
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:05.520]   some technology or there's some species or something that flies around and we don't even
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:09.520]   know what the size of ants, but whatever the case is, what's the likelihood of them to
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:12.960]   develop the exact same radio technologies that we have?
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.480]   Well, they wouldn't, but they would be monitoring those spectrums.
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.760]   Yeah, but it could pattern.
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:22.520]   There is actually a limited amount of spectrum out there, so it would make sense.
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:23.520]   It's not a hard thing to do.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.520]   We're doing that too.
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:25.760]   We're running out of spectrum, right?
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:26.760]   You're not looking for it.
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:27.760]   I love Lucy.
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.080]   You're just looking for organization.
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:33.720]   One of the things that's interesting, I was at this EG conference, which is sort of like
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:38.200]   a head type conference out here, and they were saying that our radio wave technology,
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:44.080]   whatever we look out into space with, was not really able to see planets like Earth at
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.280]   a distance that well.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:49.880]   So but the technology is getting better in that soon we're going to be able to actually
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:56.680]   see planets that match our distance from a sun and you know the last planets.
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:58.680]   Right.
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:00.480]   So when that happens, we're going to actually know where they all are so we could actually
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:03.920]   do things like target them or listen to them and tune in to what they are.
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:04.920]   That's what this guy's doing.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:10.080]   He's aiming it at where it seems likely that there'd be an Earth-like planet.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.640]   That's definitely got to be something out there.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:12.640]   I mean, it's...
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:13.880]   Well, that's the Fermi paradox.
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.400]   Now you're right up against here.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.400]   Fermi...
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.400]   I think it's...
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:23.160]   Fermi's physicist said that clearly the probability is there's intelligent life out there, but
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.200]   where the hell's the evidence?
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.200]   Where are they?
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.200]   The other thing...
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.200]   Well, I mean, we're the evidence, but the...
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.200]   Well, besides us.
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.200]   Besides us.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:37.640]   But if we can exist in an infinite world of infinite possibilities, it's going to happen.
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.520]   The question is, would we ever connect?
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.880]   And the answer to that may be never.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.600]   So then it becomes moot.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.400]   If it does exist and you can never connect with it, what's the point?
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.720]   I mean, what if our relationship with this foreign planet is that we can send messages
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.120]   back and forth and we're basically got pen pals?
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:54.120]   Yeah.
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.120]   I mean, it's...
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.120]   They might tell us something.
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.320]   They might say, "Hey, you know, that Tesla car?
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:59.480]   That's going to blow up."
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:01.720]   They might say something of use.
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:04.960]   I think that'd be dead by the time the message even got there.
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:05.960]   Oh, that's true.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:10.000]   If you got one going back and forth in one iteration, it's ridiculous.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.720]   It'd be great if they started sending us wisdom.
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:17.600]   That was just like, you know, conventional wisdom, you know?
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:18.600]   Fired.
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:19.600]   Investigate fire.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:20.600]   You can't...
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:21.600]   Stitch in time saves nine.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:25.200]   This thing is called the wheel.
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.760]   Do you have one?
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:29.760]   So let your daughter marry a musician.
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.920]   All right.
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:35.960]   I see a great science fiction book here where you go all this trouble.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:36.960]   You got the...
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:40.680]   What if we have like all 10 planets all talking to each other, but they can never make context.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:44.720]   All we do is send like the best jokes around and becomes like an IRC channel.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:47.000]   We're on the Alien mailing list.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.680]   The Alien joke mailing list.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:51.080]   It becomes like we come like Usenet.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:56.520]   It could be like the best use we come up with for interstellar communications.
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:00.440]   It's like a Usenet group.
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.920]   The word of the year for 2007, according to the...
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:04.920]   Thank you.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:13.600]   "The revolutionary gurus at Merriam-Webster."
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:16.040]   How many years has this been around?
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.040]   A couple.
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.440]   Like I think I first heard it two or three years ago.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.440]   A lot more than that.
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:21.440]   Four years ago.
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.440]   I think I...
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.440]   Four-Doch-Pro-Heritage.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:27.040]   It seems fairly recent.
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.040]   Really?
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.320]   Somebody sent me an email explaining where the...
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.880]   Or at least what he thought was the origins because he was listening to some gamers.
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:37.040]   It was a podcast.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:43.960]   It stems from the common reference to "wow" when you find somebody drops something in
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:44.960]   a...
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:45.960]   Wow, loot.
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:46.960]   You get loot.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:47.960]   Wow, loot.
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.640]   But then where did the two zeros come from?
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.200]   It's Leopatra speed.
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.200]   Leopatra speed.
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.040]   Or some say it's wheat.
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:57.040]   Yeah, hack source.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.200]   We owned the other team.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.200]   I don't know.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.000]   Corey uses "woot" all the time.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.360]   Well, there's "w-h-o-o-t" which is like, "woot."
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:07.640]   There it is, but that's different.
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:08.640]   Where did you...
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:09.640]   Who uses that?
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:10.640]   That's that song.
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:11.640]   There it is.
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:12.640]   There is.
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:13.640]   There is something like basketball songs or something.
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:14.640]   Oh, right, right, right.
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:19.040]   Yeah, there's some old pre-rapper song or something that was, yeah.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.720]   And it's used in games, right?
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.720]   Right.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.120]   So I think that might have been a precursor to it.
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.120]   Interesting.
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:27.120]   Huh.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:30.320]   So, well anyway, Miriam Webster obviously has decided this...
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:31.320]   They're bored.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.320]   They've got nothing better to do.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.320]   Great press release.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.080]   You know you're going to get coverage.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:36.640]   People are going to write about it.
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.280]   And they have to appeal to that next internet generation.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.280]   Right.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:43.280]   Because they're going to need a solution for their encyclopedic needs.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.120]   Number two, word of the year.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.120]   Any guesses?
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.120]   Facebook.
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.120]   As a verb.
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.960]   Nobody uses Facebook as a verb.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:53.960]   I'll Facebook that.
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:54.960]   I know they don't.
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:55.960]   That's what I say.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:56.960]   I fact they did a 10-5.
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:57.960]   Never heard any of Facebook me.
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:58.960]   No.
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:41:59.960]   Google, yes.
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:00.960]   I'll Google it.
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.560]   My reference is like, "How would you use it?"
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:06.760]   It's like, "Yeah, hey, I got a hold of Jill the other day and I Facebooked her."
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:07.760]   That sounds awful.
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:08.760]   It does.
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:09.760]   It doesn't sound right.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.760]   That sounds terrible.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:13.360]   The show is again going in the wrong direction.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.960]   Can we hear the ship?
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:16.960]   No.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.080]   It's because you're on it.
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.080]   This is your fault, Jason.
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:20.080]   It clearly is.
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:23.120]   We've always run a clean ship here.
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.120]   I didn't suggest any of the stories.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:26.720]   It is all of a sudden.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.720]   I don't know what happened.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:28.720]   It must be you, Jason.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:29.720]   Because it's...
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:30.720]   Must be.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:31.720]   John and I.
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:32.720]   Other...
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:34.240]   Well, wait until you see the title for this show.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:39.080]   I'm going back and forth between John's nuts and Jason's 30 inches.
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.440]   It's one of the other.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.800]   I keep track of this.
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:46.440]   As the show goes by, I consider titles as we go.
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.680]   Those are two of the two top contenders.
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:50.880]   There's his nuts again.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.880]   Those are the nuts.
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:53.880]   Woot, Facebook.
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:57.840]   Now, I don't know where these other top 10 words come from.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:00.000]   I don't know why conundrum is the third.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.760]   Why would conundrum be the word of the other?
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.440]   I thought no truth was the third one.
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.080]   I'm at Merriam-Webster's site.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:07.080]   Conundrum.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.080]   Quixotic.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:09.080]   Blame storm.
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:10.080]   I like that.
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:11.080]   Have you ever heard that blamest?
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:12.640]   That sounds like an internet word.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:15.320]   I thought surge was one of the big words.
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.720]   Surge should be a big word.
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:17.720]   Wait, does it...
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:19.320]   The word have to be a new word?
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.320]   No, no.
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:23.680]   It just has to be the word of the year people are using a lot.
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:24.520]   The words...
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:25.520]   Let's see.
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:28.160]   I guess it's a vote.
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:31.400]   It's based on votes from visitors to the Merriam-Webster website.
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:34.320]   No, the Woot people must have gotten the idea.
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:35.320]   That's what happened.
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.320]   The Woot people got the game.
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:38.320]   They've been gay.
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:39.320]   That's game.
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:40.320]   Now, there's the word of the year.
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:41.320]   Here's another one.
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:44.320]   Number six is Sardudldum.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:45.320]   Sardudldum.
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.320]   Sardudldum.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:47.720]   I never even heard of this word.
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:50.320]   That's some Harry Potter reference or something, I'm guessing.
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:54.520]   Mechanically contrived plot structure and stereotyped or unrealistic characterization
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:55.520]   in drama.
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:56.520]   What?
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:58.760]   I didn't go to graduate school.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:43:59.760]   I never heard of it.
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:01.760]   It's a great word, Sardudldum.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:02.760]   Sardudldum.
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:03.760]   Like Sardonic?
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.760]   Because it sounds funny.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.120]   Yeah, well, that makes it a good word.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:08.440]   Pec sniffian, you wouldn't know that, John.
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:09.440]   No.
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:12.640]   After Seth Pec sniff the character in Martin Chuzzlewit.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:15.080]   Oh, yes, right.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.080]   Dickens.
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:17.640]   Oh, of course.
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:18.640]   Dickens.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:19.640]   Of course.
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:20.640]   Aren't you a great Dickensian scholar?
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.640]   I thought you were.
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:22.640]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:23.640]   That's Spengler.
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:24.640]   Eh.
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.640]   Yeah.
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:29.320]   I know I read Spengler, you think it makes me up with--
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:31.120]   Spengler, mixing it with--
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:35.600]   I do read a lot of Dickens only for a structure because it's like a kind of writing.
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:36.600]   Nobody can do anymore.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:37.600]   Oh, amazing.
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.840]   At least not over 4,000 pages like he did.
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:46.520]   So Pennsylvania man brought his computer in 2004, brought his computer to a circuit
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:52.200]   city store in Wyoming, Pennsylvania, and asked them to install a DVD burner.
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:56.600]   And by the way, didn't take the child porn off his hard drive.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.600]   No.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.600]   Technicians.
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:44:59.600]   Oh, my God.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:00.600]   Okay.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:01.600]   Whoops.
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:02.600]   Technicians were testing-- now this is where it gets a little weird.
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:08.080]   The technicians at Circuit City wanted to test the DVD burner's new software by searching
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.800]   for video files to play back.
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.800]   This makes no sense, by the way.
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.800]   Why wouldn't they have their own DVD folder?
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:15.800]   Yeah, they would have tested it.
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:16.800]   Exactly.
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.280]   Why would they just burn a DVD of anything?
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:23.960]   So they searched for video files and they found some files that according to the name
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:26.960]   appeared to be pornographic in nature.
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:27.960]   Yes.
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:30.720]   And the guy got arrested.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:31.720]   Wow.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.560]   The guy got arrested.
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:34.560]   But now I think--
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.960]   You know, I think-- is there any evidence?
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:39.840]   I mean, this kind of thing is really a problem because it seems to me that those guys could
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:43.920]   have just as easily because they had full control of the machine planted that stuff.
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.280]   Well, exactly.
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:46.280]   So it's now--
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:49.120]   Also, the guy's machine could have been a slave, you know, by, you know, some--
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:55.400]   Adware or spyware could have-- and then also, people are now using this peer-to-peer backup
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.400]   system for unlimited storage.
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:57.400]   Good question.
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:58.400]   You heard about this?
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.400]   No.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.400]   So there's this new peer-to-peer thing.
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:04.680]   And so if you don't want to spend $50 on Moxie and have like a secure connection and
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:09.400]   back up yourself securely with a third party, you can back it up on other people's--
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.400]   Somebody else's drives.
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:12.680]   And yeah, which I think is crazy.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:13.680]   Basically, no.
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:15.200]   Not going to do it.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.200]   But it's encrypted, right?
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.280]   Because we know encryption is impossible to break.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:19.280]   And yeah.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.280]   So--
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:23.280]   So you could be back-- you could be storing all sorts of crap for somebody.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:25.280]   I mean, who's going to use these kind of systems?
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:28.200]   I mean, the people who use these systems are people with something to hide and who want
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:29.840]   to be anonymous, so--
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:31.880]   He appealed it to the Superior Court of Pennsylvania.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:33.360]   They overturned.
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:35.000]   They said, well, they overturned the appeal.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   They said, no.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.040]   No, this is a legitimate.
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:43.120]   The court ruled the technicians weren't randomly pursuing-- perusing the drive for a contraband.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:47.600]   But we're testing its functioning in a commercially accepted manner they were searching for.
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:48.600]   This is the best part.
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:51.360]   CodeX, C-O-D-E, SpaceX.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:53.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:54.360]   You know what?
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.000]   These guys are explaining how they found it a little bit too much.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   No.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   We were looking for CodeX.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   No.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.240]   They should have just said, we were going to burn a DVD.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:04.720]   And we went into my videos file.
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:06.400]   Just the test to make sure it's working.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:07.720]   And boom, what are we finding?
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:08.720]   Things with the weird--
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:09.720]   Oh, that's--
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:14.400]   I-- it's so funny how little the courts seem to understand technology.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:15.400]   And then they show up.
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:16.400]   It's frightening.
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.400]   It's really frightening.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.400]   95%--
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:21.000]   That's the people who actually get to make the laws.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   You know, are involved in--
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   That's right.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   That's right.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.400]   Let me-- I have an anecdote.
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:36.800]   So, you know, I was an expert witness in a case where the haze modem code was under attack
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.800]   or there was some licensing.
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:39.800]   The ATTT?
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:45.840]   ATTT was-- the AT-- anyway, there's some timing issues involved with the space.
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:48.560]   What happened was, haze didn't patent it correctly.
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:50.960]   And they did it after the fact it was late.
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:52.560]   And, you know, there was all these issues.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:57.640]   So anyway, they went through a big rigmarole in this case.
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:03.640]   And it ended up-- they found the party that was trying to get, you know, not be sued by
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.040]   haze for stealing the patent.
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:07.760]   They lost the haze one.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:12.480]   And then when they grilled the jury over it, it had nothing to-- it's the reason that they
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:14.840]   all chose in favor of haze.
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:21.080]   And this is the thing that the lawyers found hilarious was because on the haze modem plastic
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:27.280]   box, it said patent pending, which was a patent specifically to the plastic that made
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.280]   the modem.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.600]   Nothing to do with the AT command said at all.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:36.320]   But because that was on the box and said patent pending, they lost the case because of
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:37.320]   this kind of idiocy.
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:38.320]   Oh, my God.
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:41.040]   It's just the kind of thing that goes on is really pathetic.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.040]   So get this.
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:44.800]   When Sprint and Nextel merged, they had to-- you know, they had a merge.
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:45.800]   They're billing.
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:49.520]   They had merge all the stuff they charge.
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:50.760]   I didn't know-- I didn't realize this.
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:56.440]   You probably have noticed on your bill something called the Federal Programs Cost Recovery fee,
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:59.720]   which sounds like it's something mandated by the government.
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:03.360]   Turns out it says, you know, they're just charging you for the taxes they have to pay.
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:05.720]   So they just put that on there.
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:09.320]   And Nextel was charging a customer as about 55 a month.
[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:13.560]   And Sprint was charging customers 55 cents a month.
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:17.200]   So what do you think Sprint did?
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:18.200]   Raised the price.
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:19.200]   Of course.
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:24.920]   They renamed it to an administrative charge, 75 cent administrative charge and a 20 cent
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:29.840]   regulatory charge, none of which is required by the government.
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:35.200]   It's just-- he says the Sprint spokesman, John Taylor, "These fees are offset the high
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.400]   tax burden the industry faces."
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:42.840]   I think it put anything they want on there and people will just pay it.
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:45.160]   I think I should start doing that.
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:49.120]   Just put a federal-- I'm going to put a Federal Programs Cost Recovery fee on everything I
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:50.120]   do.
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.120]   Right, that's the tax.
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:52.120]   That's what it's called.
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.120]   This is the tax I have to pay.
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:54.120]   So pay me more.
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:55.880]   So I don't have to pay the tax.
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:58.120]   How did the-- how did the self-help companies get away with this?
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:03.120]   I'm very excited by-- I hope Verizon, when they say they want to open their network, really
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:04.120]   does begin something.
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:05.120]   And not just--
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:10.560]   You know, it's not going to-- these guys are going to continue to gouge the public as
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:11.640]   long as they can.
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:14.520]   All these promises are going to go nowhere.
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:16.080]   This is why I use burners.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.880]   Yeah, no, I don't blame you.
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:19.400]   That is because it's cool.
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:24.520]   When I was in Paris last week, I was Twittering and I'm with-- and I'm like, "My Twitter's
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:25.520]   not working.
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:26.520]   What's wrong with the system?"
[00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:28.240]   He's like, "No, no, that's not us.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:29.640]   That's the message from your provider."
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:32.000]   And I was like, "This is both."
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.640]   And so then I started using-- there's a BlackBerry Twitter application called Twitter
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:37.640]   Berry, which is awesome.
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:39.280]   So it uses the web to do it.
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:40.280]   You have it?
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:41.280]   Yeah, I use it.
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:42.760]   So you don't have to get SMS charges.
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:44.720]   I'm like, "Okay, fine."
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:49.440]   Then I get online the other day and it turns out T-Mobile turned off Twitter.
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:50.440]   Yep, right.
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:51.440]   And so--
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:52.440]   It's a big news item.
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:54.000]   Now they're just blocking the short code.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.760]   They're blocking the 404 short code, the Twitter short code, right?
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:58.960]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:50:59.960]   But I mean--
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:05.120]   So you could still use a T-Mobile phone as I am with Twitter-- with Twitter Berry.
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:06.120]   I know.
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:09.600]   It's just like-- but probably a third of what I use my phone for is Twitter.
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:13.680]   So if they're going to start screwing with it, I'm going to switch providers.
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:14.760]   I'm just getting so tired.
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:16.080]   I just want an IP-based phone.
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:18.000]   And I want to be done with these people.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.840]   Well, just be glad you're not Piorter Stanazik.
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:27.600]   He's a 22-year-old oil and gas well tester in northern Alberta.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:31.640]   He was using his new cell phone as a modem for his computer.
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:37.360]   He has a $10 unlimited browser plan from Bell Mobility, which is the Canadian cell phone
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:38.360]   company.
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:44.400]   He got a bill for $85,000.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:46.240]   He was downloading big files.
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:49.440]   That unlimited is as unlimited as it used to be.
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:50.440]   No.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:52.520]   He complained to the phone company.
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:57.320]   They said, look, for goodwill reasons, we're not going to charge you $85,000 because--
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:58.320]   $85,000.
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:51:59.320]   $8500 for you?
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:00.320]   $8500.
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:01.320]   That's basically--
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:02.320]   Stop it zero.
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:03.320]   $3,400.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:04.320]   That's all.
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:05.320]   $3,400.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:09.560]   Get your fiber to his house.
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:10.560]   Shh.
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:16.640]   Well, and I guess he's to be-- I mean, I guess he didn't realize that using his cell phone
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:21.240]   as a modem would be using minutes, but must have been using it, like, not stop to get
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:22.240]   that kind of a bill.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:25.480]   It's just ridiculous.
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:27.040]   I'm so glad.
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:29.800]   It's actually worse in Canada that they don't have any flat rate data plans.
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:32.320]   You just can't do it.
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:39.360]   I was in Europe one time, and I was trying to download some stuff that was large in size.
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:40.360]   It kept stopping.
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.320]   So I'm like, what the heck is going-- why is it stopping?
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.800]   And I called up the support line.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:44.800]   I'm in Germany.
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:48.600]   And she's like, ah, you know, it's 250 meg download limit.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:49.960]   I'm like, what's this?
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:50.960]   $24.95 a day.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:54.280]   And she's like, yeah, did you read the user agreement?
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:59.600]   I'm like, the eight page user agreement of minus one font.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:04.440]   So a lot of times I've been in Europe and I've had to buy-- you buy a card or something
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:06.000]   in some of these places, and you use it.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.800]   You know, it's supposed to be for the whole day, and then craps out in about an hour.
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:10.320]   You got to use another card.
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:16.040]   But anyway, since you were at the low web, can you give us a little report on what happened
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:20.920]   there, what was going on, and was it worth going to?
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:23.760]   Well, this is the fourth one they've had.
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:25.520]   And explain what it is, by the way.
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:27.320]   Does it look web-sound like a joke?
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:28.320]   The web-three.
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:30.320]   It's like a low web?
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:32.200]   Yeah, low web.
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:34.240]   It's basically like the Web 2.0 conference here.
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:35.240]   So--
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:37.560]   But they're French, so it has to be 3.0 there.
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:42.440]   But it's for all of Europe, so it really is probably 5% or 10% French-based, but it's
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:43.600]   really all of Europe comes to it.
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:45.760]   They had like 2,000 or 3,000 people at this thing.
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:46.760]   Wow.
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:47.760]   It was huge.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:54.960]   And so they brought in like Scoble, Ev Williams, Dave Weiner, O-Malik, you know, Mike Arrington.
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:58.000]   The usual suspects, Jason Calicanis.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:04.400]   And it was like a mini rock tour or something like that, because what's happened over the
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:05.400]   last couple of years, I guess--
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:07.280]   It's like those Motown concerts.
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:13.040]   It's exactly what it's like because of the like ValleyWeg, you know, blogging, Ving,
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:14.600]   TechMeeam.
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:17.200]   People in Europe are, you know, sit there and re-tech me and ValleyWeg.
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:18.200]   Wow.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:19.200]   And they get to know like--
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:20.200]   There's celebrities.
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:21.200]   --30 personalities.
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:24.040]   And then when you get there, they're, you know, like, oh yeah, you remember your thing on
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:27.000]   ValleyWeg where they said that your dog did, you know this?
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.640]   Well, it's wild, but it was--
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:35.200]   Would anything come of it more than just, you know, the celebrity jock sniffing?
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:39.800]   It was like, I'm sure there's business going on there now because people are paying a lot
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:40.800]   of money to go there.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:44.480]   So I think the European market, there's a lot of business going on there, like people
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:47.840]   buying advertising, people buying software, syndicating stuff.
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:55.000]   So it's sort of like, you know, when PCs became a big industry, what was the big PC event?
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   PCExpo?
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   And it was like--
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   Well, Comdex was the big--
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   Comdex, right.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   It's a certain point.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.320]   It just becomes like a trade show where a bunch of salespeople show up and trade business
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:05.320]   cards.
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:06.760]   And it seems like it's getting to that point.
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:11.160]   So sort of like when internet world jumped the shark, it feels like it's getting to the
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:14.440]   point where it's a business event, you know, it's a trade show.
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:16.240]   There were like 30 booths.
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:17.240]   It's a trade show, which is good.
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:19.800]   I mean, I mean, there's a business there.
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:22.960]   But when I went three years ago, there were like 400 people, you know?
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:23.960]   It's 10 times a bit.
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:24.960]   Did you get anything out of it?
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:29.200]   Did there anything that you can report on that would interest anyone that listens to
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:30.200]   this?
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:31.200]   There was no breaking news.
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:36.160]   We broke a little news from Mahalo, but nothing, you know, major got broken there.
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:41.000]   It's not like it was Web 2.0 or the TechCrunch event where we had specific items breaking
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   at it.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   No, it's like a place where all the people--
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   Okay, that's it.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   --are to get together.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   Yes.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   Moving on.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   Yeah, it's really drinking club.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   Drinking club.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   Drinking and sniffing.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   It's fine.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   It's good.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   I just saw an article that said that in Britain anyway, text messaging to break up with your
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:05.120]   girl is becoming very popular.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:09.000]   We saw it happen with Kevin Federline when Brittany broke up with him on television in
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.520]   Canada.
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:17.920]   But according to a survey, 15% of the 2,194 Brits surveyed said they had been dumped by
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:18.920]   text or email.
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:22.640]   Yeah, well, I mean, I was about to say, can we replace text with email and do this story
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:23.640]   in '97?
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:24.640]   Yeah.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:29.120]   Well, I remember this story the first time I learned.
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:30.120]   I think that's cold.
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:31.760]   Of course it's cold.
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:33.920]   I took your advice the last time you were on Jason.
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:37.040]   You said you should add everybody on Facebook.
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:39.920]   So I have, and I have some, I don't know, some like 3,000 friends now on Facebook.
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:44.000]   But what's fun is to read the news feed and watch people break up, get them hook up.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   That is weird.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   Half the news feed.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.760]   Roland is now single.
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:50.040]   Max and Dolly ended their relationship.
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:51.200]   I'm reading my feed.
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:53.120]   Jason is now single.
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:57.720]   Drew went from being single to it's complicated.
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:58.720]   Margie is now married.
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:56:59.720]   That is weird stuff.
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:00.720]   That's weird stuff.
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:01.720]   Nick was funny.
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:02.720]   It was fun.
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:03.720]   Katie ended their relationship.
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:04.720]   I mean, there's tons of this.
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:05.720]   This is one page.
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:07.200]   I have a friend who's been married for like over 10 years.
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.440]   He's got kids a whole bit.
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:10.640]   And like, I guess his wife just got on Facebook.
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:14.640]   So it said like, you know, this person, you know, Jim and Cindy are now married.
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:16.800]   So I had to be screaming grab up and I sent it to him.
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:17.800]   I was like, congratulations.
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:22.480]   I was waiting for you to make an honorable, you know, late out of her.
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:26.920]   So it's really gets to be an interesting village when you have lots of Facebook friends.
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:28.240]   Something weird happens.
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:29.840]   It's just a community.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:30.840]   And there's a lot.
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:34.080]   This feed becomes very fascinating to see all the people breaking up alone.
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:35.920]   These were all real.
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.640]   I wasn't making them up.
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:38.640]   It's all marketing.
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:43.080]   I'm convinced that all these social networks are like a way to market yourself to your
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:44.360]   friends and associates.
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:45.440]   Oh, interesting.
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:47.240]   But you see everything as marketing.
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:48.240]   That might be my bias.
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:53.200]   Like when you go out with your friends and you know, like market to your friends, Jason.
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:54.200]   You don't.
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.200]   But there, no, but think about this way.
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:56.720]   You say, what have you been up to?
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:58.200]   And your friend tells you what they've been up to.
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:59.720]   And they say, Oh, well, what have you been up to?
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:00.720]   And they do that, right?
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:03.280]   So that's just, you know, chitchat is what we would call it.
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:04.520]   It's called relationship.
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:06.000]   It's not marketing.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   Exactly.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:11.160]   However, when you start having thousands of people hooked up together and it starts going
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:14.080]   by on a daily basis, it starts to feel like marketing.
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:18.280]   And you can ask specifically because you don't know, you know, but 20 of them.
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:20.000]   Well, that's what Twitter feels like to me now.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.040]   That's funny because I took a Twitter hiatus.
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:24.480]   I stopped in April and went came back last month.
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:28.000]   And all of a sudden everything on Twitter is marketing.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.680]   It's all read my articles.
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:30.680]   You know, this is what I'm doing.
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:32.400]   I'm here doing this.
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:37.240]   Although, you know, I did the first Twitter narrative this week.
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:43.640]   I left my passport passport and like $3,000 in my safe in.
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:44.640]   And I'm at the airport.
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:46.440]   I'm like, you get that sinking feeling when you check in.
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:48.480]   And I'm like, oh my God.
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:49.480]   So I call the hotel.
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:50.600]   I give them the code.
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:51.600]   They grab the money.
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:52.720]   They grab the passport.
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:56.120]   I put them on the phone with the person in the agent at the desk and they I say, whatever
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:59.680]   it takes, hire a motor hire a motorcycle and have them get to the airport.
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:00.960]   They hire a motorcycle.
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:01.960]   Wow.
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:02.960]   Messenger.
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:06.240]   And like they're holding the gate for me and the messenger is coming on bicycle.
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:09.920]   And the guys like you have six minutes left and the I'm called the bike messenger is
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:10.920]   through minutes.
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:14.680]   And the bike messenger comes flying up on the sidewalk and I was Twittering the whole thing.
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:15.680]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:18.320]   Twittering going through security and I was taking pictures and emailing them to my Flickr
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:19.320]   account.
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:21.560]   So we got my Flickr account, Jason Calicana is one word.
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:24.920]   No spaces, no dashes, no.org.
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:29.200]   And you look at it, you'll see pictures of me of the bicycle coming up and there were
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:31.280]   like, I think that's kind of interesting.
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:35.000]   Dozens of people living the drama with me and it was, it sort of made it fun, you know,
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:38.280]   and the sinking feeling went away, which was like, you know, and then everybody starts
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:40.880]   like, Oh, well, if you have to stay in Paris another light, let me take you to dinner.
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:41.880]   And that's what I do.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:45.080]   That's what I use Twitter for now is when I'm in a different city, I'm like, and everybody
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:46.160]   want to go get Chinese food.
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:49.600]   Boom, I get like a hundred emails and I just go to dinner with random people.
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:50.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:51.600]   I missed this whole thing.
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:52.600]   I'm reading it right now.
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:53.600]   It was all December 14.
[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:55.280]   So I have a question.
[00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:56.280]   Yeah.
[00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:59.200]   What, what do you carry $3,000 in cash with you?
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:02.880]   I knew you, I knew you'd pick that up, John.
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.120]   That's just how I change.
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:07.120]   That's just how I roll.
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.120]   Yeah.
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:09.120]   Yeah.
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:10.800]   I was like, Oh, I think I was 20,000.
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:11.800]   What's three is nothing.
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:17.120]   But I grew up Brooklyn like, carry a role, you know, with the rubber band around it.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.120]   Sorry.
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.120]   I always had to roll.
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.120]   I always carry a role.
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.120]   I feel naked.
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:23.400]   If I go out without a role in my pocket, it's just my dad was like, you have to have
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:24.400]   some cash with you.
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.200]   So they wonder if you're happy to see him or is that a role in your pocket?
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.640]   So do you, you don't use a money clip?
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:29.640]   You use a rubber band?
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:33.120]   Well, no, cause that was when I grew up in Brooklyn, you always knew a fake gangster from
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:36.160]   a real gangster based on their, their role.
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:38.200]   Like what, what bills are on top?
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.600]   What bills are on top?
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:44.400]   If they're using a rubber band or some Tiffany, you know, you know, a silly thing, you know,
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:49.200]   if you're a real gangster, you cannot, there's no money clip that's going to hold your role.
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.200]   Right.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:53.320]   You know, and real gangsters, they, you know, they start at twenties.
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:55.640]   If they have singles and stuff like that, they keep that in another pocket.
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:56.640]   They just throw that away.
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:57.640]   Right.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:58.640]   You start with twenties and move up.
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:03.080]   So if you're, you got a nice size role, it's, you know, basically starts at the size of like,
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:05.800]   if you put two golf balls in your hand, that'd be like it.
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:07.240]   That's a decent size knot.
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:08.640]   They call it a knot too.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:13.240]   So I always like to have a decent size knot and I basically weigh it against my blackberry.
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:16.000]   It's got to weigh the same as my blackberry because I keep one in one pocket, one on the
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   other.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.560]   So you're telling us that you're a gangster.
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:19.560]   I'm not getting this.
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:20.560]   She's a gangster.
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:21.640]   That's just gangster style.
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:25.880]   Jason's decent size knot.
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:28.680]   Even all my life, I want it to be a gangster.
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:31.680]   Well, it's true in the sopranos and all those movies, they do.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:34.600]   They, they, they take out the role, they peel off a couple of hundreds and they give it
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.600]   to the.
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:36.600]   Yeah.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:37.600]   I love that.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.000]   I piece people off all the time.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.680]   I think that's a very nice.
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:43.680]   There's something about that.
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:44.680]   What do you call it?
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:45.680]   Peace people off.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:46.680]   Peace.
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:47.680]   Like a piece.
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:48.680]   You give them a piece.
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:49.680]   I give you a piece.
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:50.680]   Peace people off.
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:51.680]   I tip everybody in Los Angeles.
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:52.680]   Nobody gets tipped.
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:53.680]   It's unbelievable.
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:56.600]   People are so cheap because celebrity is the tip out here, you know, like, oh, you got
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:00.320]   to open the door for, you know, whoever and that's the tip.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.880]   Huh.
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.280]   So you like to share the wealth.
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.280]   You like to spread around.
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:08.280]   Big, Jason, you're a big tipper.
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:09.760]   Absurd tipper.
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:10.760]   Like literally absurd.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.680]   My wife is like, that's so unnecessary.
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:14.840]   But I grew up as a waiter.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:15.840]   I could dig it.
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:16.840]   I do the same thing.
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:17.840]   I over tip to a lot to charity.
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.640]   I mean, I do give some to charities, but what I do is I just give huge tips because I grew
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:21.640]   up as a waiter.
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:22.640]   I was broke my whole life.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:23.640]   Yeah.
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:26.080]   I was a lot of people that worked in the restaurant business seem to be big tippers.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:28.080]   Cause we know this life.
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:29.080]   50% 50 50.
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.080]   I'm a hunter.
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.080]   50.
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.080]   Wow.
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:35.480]   Yeah, like 30 40 50.
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:36.480]   Yeah, I'm 30.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:37.480]   That's going down.
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:38.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.640]   I'm saying like I could see if the service wasn't good.
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:42.600]   I wouldn't get 50, but it's really good service.
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:47.160]   If it's a hundred dollars, I get under 50, 140, something like that.
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:48.160]   What's the difference?
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:49.160]   I hate to go back to the tech.
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.160]   I like that.
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.160]   I like a big tipper.
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:52.160]   I think that's great.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:55.440]   I just think, you know, like people are like, oh, the working man is always the person
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:56.920]   who gets squeezed, you know?
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:57.920]   Yeah.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:00.640]   And it's like, if you give a good tip, it like makes somebody's day because I was a
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:03.240]   waiter, I got to school and whatever.
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:08.240]   And when I was a kid, it's like somebody gives you a 50% tip instead of a 20% tip.
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:11.640]   It makes your night and it only happens once every 10 nights.
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:12.640]   Right.
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:13.640]   Right.
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.080]   So why not be a gangster?
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:16.080]   What are you?
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:17.080]   Are you a big tipper, John?
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:18.080]   No.
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:19.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.080]   You have to ask that question.
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:21.080]   Doesn't seem like you.
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.480]   I don't usually pick up the tab.
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:25.720]   I mean, I would be a big tipper, but you know, mostly because since I'm a starving
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:29.840]   writer, I have to like require other people to pay for the whole damn thing.
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:33.240]   And I hope that they're big tippers, which is why I like Jason.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:38.040]   I like going to buy a Mac.
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:41.640]   I'm going to tip you into some piece of crap.
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.440]   I hate that day.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.880]   Don't buy a Mac.
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:47.560]   I think we should just wrap this up.
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:50.480]   There's other news, but I hardly even want to go on because I think this is much more
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:51.480]   interesting.
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:52.480]   I got a tip for you.
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.840]   The iPhone, the piece of crap.
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:58.800]   Online ad spending by 2011 seat.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:01.960]   Now Jason would have some some stories.
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.880]   I can give some insight on the start.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.920]   This is a e-marketing, right?
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:09.480]   The thing is they're like, oh, online ad spending is slowing.
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:12.320]   Yeah, but but okay.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.640]   It's slowing because the numbers are getting so huge.
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:20.360]   It's going to increase, they say 29% next year by 20 growth is slowing, but the numbers
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:21.360]   are going exactly.
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:24.880]   Yeah, it's a big difference between slowing and growth is slowing.
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:25.880]   No, it's growing.
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:27.760]   It's going to continue to grow by 2011.
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:33.440]   E-marketers says 42 billion in online advertising.
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:36.800]   Oh, but that'll only be a 12% increase or 2010.
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:40.760]   And by the way, I have no idea how they could possibly know this.
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:44.000]   We're talking five years from now.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.040]   They all come up with different, what they do is I think they talk to marketers and they
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:52.360]   look at how they've shifted spending and where they anticipate shifting spending.
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:56.120]   And then they talk to the people who are selling ads so they can look at like AOL and Yahoo
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:01.040]   and Google and look at their historic rates and say, okay, Google grows 50% as fast and
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:04.280]   Yahoo grows 7% and AOL grows 3%.
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:06.880]   And then they do it from both the buy and the sell side.
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:09.560]   You can get pretty close to the number if you do enough work.
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:14.920]   So I guess the question is, would you be nuts to launch an on a paper magazine or a mainstream
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:17.480]   media property at this point?
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:18.480]   Absolutely.
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:19.480]   All the ads moving away.
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:20.480]   What's 42 billion?
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:21.480]   What does that mean?
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:22.480]   What does that mean?
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:23.480]   What does that mean?
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:24.480]   That's still a bit in the bucket compared to the big numbers.
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.480]   Well, it's more than you get.
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:27.480]   There are people launching magazines and doing fine.
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:28.480]   Really?
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:33.720]   Well, there's always room for a great, great product, but they're not launching magazines
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:34.720]   like they used to.
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:41.480]   I mean, Conde Nes with Portfolio, most people consider that the last great magazine launch
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:45.880]   was these to launch $20, $30, $40 million magazines on a pretty regular basis a couple
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:46.880]   of years.
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:47.880]   They're just not doing that anymore.
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:49.640]   Nobody's going to launch a new TV network.
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:54.600]   Nobody's going to, I mean, mainstream media doesn't seem like it's in too good shape,
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:58.080]   especially if you get this kind of advertising money moving away.
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:03.200]   I mean, I presume if it's growing and online, it's growing because it's shrinking somewhere
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.200]   else.
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.200]   Yeah.
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:10.560]   I mean, most people think that radio is down, TV is down, outdoor is flat, TV, some people
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:16.880]   argue is flat, but the growth in online is so great that on a percentage basis, I think
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.880]   it's going to keep taking share.
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.320]   And where's it going to be Jason?
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:21.320]   Is it going to be banner ads?
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:23.720]   Is it going to be podcast ads?
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:24.720]   What kind of advertising?
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:28.720]   Well, video advertising is huge growth because it hasn't previously existed.
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.880]   So on a percentage basis, it's going to seem huge.
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:37.360]   But the most effective advertising online is direct marketing style, which means text
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:39.760]   ads, which means typically search Google.
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:43.880]   Yeah, text ads are the most effective for marketers because they can track them and
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:48.040]   they can see them through to a transaction and they only pay by click.
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:51.000]   So it's really easy for advertisers to spend money there.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.360]   As a matter of fact, what's hard is for them to spend a lot of money there because there's
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:55.760]   a limited amount of inventory.
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:03.960]   There's only so many people who type in Volvo S430 or something per day and everybody's
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:05.160]   fighting over those same people.
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:08.400]   So now they don't want to pay for click, they want to pay for action.
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.400]   Yeah.
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:15.640]   So it's just arbitrage because if you move to that model, then that's affiliate revenue
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:18.440]   and you can basically then charge more.
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:22.720]   And if you sell a Kindle, I think you make 50 bucks or 40 bucks or something in the Amazon
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:23.720]   affiliate program.
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:25.520]   39 bucks, I think it is.
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:26.520]   Yeah.
[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:30.320]   So if you make 39 and you can sell one every thousand out of every thousand clicks, well
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:32.120]   then you're making a $39 CPM.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.120]   It's incredible.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:37.120]   If you sell one out of every $2,000 to $20 CPM, it's still very respectable.
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:40.200]   It's a challenge somebody to get those numbers.
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:44.720]   Well, when we did WebLogs Inc and I was at AOL, we were RPMing.
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:46.000]   You know what I'm talking about?
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   Those numbers on the Kindle.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   Oh, on the Kindle.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   Yeah.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   Maybe not the Kindle.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   Yeah.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.640]   But I certainly do all the associate links I can.
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:55.560]   I mean, I think that's a very lucrative model actually.
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:58.760]   Affiliate links work and comparison shopping engines work.
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:05.120]   I mean, basically, when every time there is a recession, that's when the TV and the radio
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:08.560]   and those people, magazines are going to feel it because what happens is there's a flight
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:09.560]   to quality.
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:12.520]   There's a flight to being able to track the stuff and that's online.
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:16.000]   So actually people say, oh, a downturn is going to be terrible for the internet.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.760]   Downturn is actually better for the internet because when you're cutting budget, you start
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:24.040]   with magazines, then you outdoor, you know, the things that are the least trackable, the
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.600]   ones that are cut first.
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:26.840]   That's why I got out of the magazine business.
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:28.000]   So I was like, this is a disaster.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   Makes sense.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.240]   Well, it's all, well, they're metrics are based on lies, you know, like pass along in
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:35.120]   a magazine, like, oh, five people.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:40.240]   I mean, what they try to convince you is like 100 million people got PC magazine.
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.840]   Each PC magazine was seen by five people.
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:46.080]   And that means five million people saw the ad on a page page 128.
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.080]   Right.
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:48.640]   You know, it's like, that's a lot of leaps.
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:54.760]   Whereas you're like, oh, here's your, you know, HP, you know, ad on Engadget or CNET.
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:57.720]   You can tell exactly how many people saw it, how many people clicked on it.
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:59.600]   Now you can tell if people were hovering over it.
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:00.600]   Right.
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:04.920]   It's to the point at which I think some people are getting too much data and it's almost
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:07.400]   like they don't want the data anymore.
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:09.160]   They're like, we get, we get the idea.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:12.960]   You can tell us a lot, you know, just give us more ads, give them for this price.
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:16.600]   And because everything sold in an auction format, it's very efficient.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:21.040]   You know, it's not like you're, you know, that the price per click is going to be 19
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:23.240]   cents or 60 cents or whatever.
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.040]   It's the market corrects.
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:29.280]   So people are not going to overspend if they, if they gets up to $3 a click for a Kindle,
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:31.160]   maybe people are not going to pay it.
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:32.160]   Right.
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.040]   I got to have you on more often, Jason.
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:35.400]   That was very, I understood that.
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:36.640]   It made a lot of sense.
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:38.880]   You didn't ask about the Google Noel project.
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:40.880]   I thought that was going to be like, I had Noel's on the list.
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:42.120]   You want to talk about Noel?
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:45.000]   Google's Noel is an attack on Wikipedia.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.960]   What a joke this is.
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:49.240]   This is why we probably shouldn't have talked about it.
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.240]   Why is it a joke?
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:51.800]   I mean, I mean, I mean, it's frustrating to me.
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:54.800]   It's got 2.5, some like 2.5 million pages.
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.480]   Why do they want to do this?
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:00.360]   They got 75,000 people already that are committed to it.
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:01.360]   So what's the point?
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:02.840]   Where is this going to go?
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:04.880]   Well, I think that's the question.
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:06.480]   It's like, why did they do this now?
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:10.480]   And there was an interesting thing I read on Danny Sullivan, who's really great, who
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:14.240]   did search engine watch and now he's doing search engine land.
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:19.200]   And he does the daily searchcast, which is one of the best podcasts after Twit.
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:24.520]   And he is, he said when he talked to him that they were saying, this is an experiment.
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:25.600]   It might not even launch.
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:30.360]   So what I think is they were testing the waters and they've gotten such a brutal response
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:32.360]   back.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:35.640]   People thinking it's competitive, that I think they're not going to launch it or they're
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:41.120]   going to go slow in terms of launching it because if you think about it, what does it
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.400]   mean to publish?
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:49.640]   It means to find a writer, pay the writer and get them distribution, right?
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:52.960]   And if you look at what they're saying they're going to do here, they're going to find writers,
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:56.000]   they're going to pay them and they're going to give them distribution.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.080]   And the only piece that's different than them versus, you know, thy maink or Conde Nast or
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:06.840]   Ziff Davis is that they are not owning the rights to the words.
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:08.680]   Well, that's a very small difference.
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:13.400]   And I think all the clients that Google has for their amazing ad business are going to
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.720]   take this the wrong way.
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:18.140]   And they're going to feel like Google's overreaching, which has been a couple of good
[01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:21.680]   blog posts saying like, this is too much.
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:27.000]   And even if Google doesn't, you know, attack people with this or they don't do it too hard,
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.680]   it feels like they cross some imaginary line in people's minds between being a platform
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:33.160]   and being a content producer.
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:34.840]   And I don't think they're going to be able to.
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:36.280]   They don't want to be in that position.
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:37.280]   That's the last thing they want.
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:41.120]   No, I mean, if you look at the last time they did this was when they did Google news and
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:46.400]   they allowed people who were subjects in the stories to then comment afterwards.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:47.400]   They lasted three seconds.
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:48.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:49.880]   Holy cow, the news people were like, what?
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:51.880]   You're talking to the subjects of the stories we're writing.
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:52.880]   Right.
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:53.880]   You're in competition with us.
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:56.240]   Maybe we should reconsider running Google ads and websites.
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:00.560]   And that's the balance when I went to know, you know, I think maybe can't talk in this
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:02.240]   as a Wikipedia competitor.
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.880]   I think is maybe misunderstanding it.
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:07.320]   It sounds more like they just want to give experts pages.
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:10.680]   In fact, they even say there could be competing pages from the same.
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:11.680]   Yeah.
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:12.680]   On the same.
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:16.440]   But I mean, then, you know, the same way, in gadgets stole writers from CNET, right?
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:17.440]   Right.
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:18.440]   Or curated talent.
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:21.520]   Now they could say to the Engadget writers, like, why write for Engadget or gizmodo?
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:23.400]   Why don't you come here and we'll pay you directly?
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:27.520]   And if your story is good, it gets to the top and, you know, cut out the middleman.
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:31.080]   And it's that, you know, does Google proposing to pay these guys?
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:35.080]   There's going to be headsets on it and they're going to give them the lion's share of the
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:36.080]   ad sense.
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:39.240]   So then it's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a second.
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:42.160]   If you're competing for talent with Engadget, right?
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:45.800]   Like if I was running web blogs, I would be like, whoa, hold on.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:48.040]   But how is this different from Mahalo in a way?
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:49.520]   It sounds kind of like your model.
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:53.000]   Well, I mean, they're, we're not writing full articles.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.160]   That's what Wikipedia does.
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:57.920]   And we'll write like a little box on each search result on each guide, but we're not
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:58.920]   writing full articles.
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:01.280]   So we would probably link to this stuff.
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:02.720]   You're paying people?
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:04.120]   Yeah, we pay people.
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.120]   Yeah.
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:07.600]   It's actually it's actually sounds more like it's going after you.
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:08.600]   It is Wikipedia.
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.520]   Doesn't feel like it's going after me.
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:14.560]   And I'm not really worried about, you know, everybody in the valley is like, Oh my God,
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:15.560]   Google's going to compete with us.
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:17.320]   I'm not really worried about competing with Google.
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:19.040]   I mean, I'm not scared of Google.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.480]   I mean, they're competitors.
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:23.600]   And so if they compete with us, that means they validate our market.
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:26.520]   It means I can raise more money and I can go head to head with them.
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:29.200]   And, you know, the, it means there's a market there.
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:30.880]   So it means it's flattery.
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:31.880]   Right.
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:37.720]   But I do think that, you know, when I went to Yahoo and I went to Google when I was running
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:42.520]   web blogs, Inc, Google would say to me, you know, you might not want to work with Yahoo
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:45.840]   because they're competing with you on these blogs, you know, and they would point it
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:46.840]   out.
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:49.440]   Like I'm talking about the Google reps, you know, we're not in the content business.
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:50.440]   Yahoo is.
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:53.760]   So if you're partners with Yahoo, you're basically funding their content efforts with compete
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:54.760]   with you.
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:57.760]   Like me putting ads for audible on my show.
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:00.120]   And what yourself right now, I'd be like, yeah, that makes sense.
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:02.440]   And then I go to Yahoo and I'd say like, are you guys in the content business?
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:05.960]   Like, no, I'm like, well, what about like all these game sites you have?
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:06.960]   Are they compete with joystick?
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:11.200]   And I heard that you offered three of our joystick bloggers jobs and like, Oh, yeah,
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:14.960]   no, those are, that's just aggregating stuff in a, we're just doing like a
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.600]   aggressive, a small thing.
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:17.760]   It's not really a big thing.
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.320]   And I'm like, well, it's sort of a big thing.
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:22.840]   If it's the same content and the same writers and you're going after my writers.
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:23.840]   Right.
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:26.880]   So I told Yahoo, I wouldn't work with them because they were trying to, uh,
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:27.880]   poach our writers.
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:32.320]   Well, now Google, if this, depending on how this is executed, they might be going after
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:33.480]   New York Times writers, right?
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:36.560]   What if the science writer from the New York Times says, I could write science articles
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:41.160]   all day long, put them on Google and I'll make a hundred to $300 per article.
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:45.320]   And, you know, I have this library of articles that I'll own and I'll be able to write books
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:46.320]   based on it.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:49.200]   You know, this is when people get nervous about Google.
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:50.200]   It would be the same.
[01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:52.960]   Right now the New York Times science writers making more than that already.
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:57.600]   And he probably has the rights to most of those articles to produce in books.
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:59.160]   So they're going to have to go online.
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:01.440]   So, you know, but I mean, pick a writer.
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:05.400]   So maybe the New York Times is the highest end, you know, and Engage it certainly didn't,
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.880]   you know, pull New York Times writers onto Engage.
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:11.480]   So maybe it's, you know, Engage it they're going after and see it see that because Engage
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:15.400]   is certainly interfered with CNET's business or as if Davis's business.
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:21.600]   So maybe all three of those people could see writers leave, you know, to go work on this.
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:23.920]   But I think honestly, Google's a good company.
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.240]   I think it's good people there.
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:26.240]   And I think they're smart.
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:29.520]   And I think they're not going to use this in any kind of heavy handed way.
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:34.600]   I want to wrap this to, you know, they're good people and they don't do things to destroy
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:35.600]   other companies.
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:38.400]   Well, it's interesting also how protected people are of Jimmy Wales.
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:42.240]   I mean, I think that's part of the other side of the reaction to this is don't Wikipedia
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:43.240]   is sacrosanct.
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.520]   Don't don't go against Wikipedia.
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:46.520]   They're there.
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:47.520]   Jimmy Jesus Wells.
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:48.520]   Yeah.
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:51.160]   It's I got a couple of fights with him and I was like, this is like fighting Christ.
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:52.160]   You can't win.
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:53.160]   You can't win.
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:54.160]   You know, everybody loves Christ.
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:55.160]   Yep.
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:56.960]   You know, while the sudden I'm like, who fought Christ?
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:57.960]   I don't know.
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:58.960]   You're the bad guy.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:15:59.960]   I'm the bad son.
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:00.960]   I'm the bad guy.
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:01.960]   Hey, he's Jimbo.
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:02.960]   You can't mess with Jimbo.
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:03.960]   He's got a role in his pocket.
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:04.960]   He's got a role, man.
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:06.800]   Oh, and Jimbo's got the rival.
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:10.560]   Did you hear about the CEO of Wikipedia?
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:11.560]   No, what happened?
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:16.280]   Was a felt shot her ex-boyfriend in the chest and was writing bad checks?
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.280]   Yeah.
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.280]   That was a big story.
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:19.280]   We missed that one.
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.280]   We missed that one.
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:21.280]   We missed that one.
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.280]   We missed that one.
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:23.280]   We missed that one.
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:24.280]   We missed that one.
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.280]   We missed that one.
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:26.280]   We missed that one.
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:29.400]   We haven't covered the Riser trial either, which is another.
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:33.120]   I mean, if we really wanted to be the gossip column, I don't know why Valley WAG does it
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:34.520]   cover the Riser trial more.
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:36.600]   That's a gossipy story.
[01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:39.800]   Yeah, but this Wikipedia thing is off the charts.
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:45.920]   I mean, the person was the C.O.L.O. and was running the books of Wikipedia and had previously
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:50.360]   been arrested like a half dozen times or something once for shooting her boyfriend in
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:52.240]   the chest with a shotgun or something.
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.000]   And then also for passing checks.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.280]   And they hired her as a C.O.O. and didn't do a background check.
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:00.520]   And the woman who's running it, who lives in France, was like, "Oh, well, we don't do
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:01.920]   background checks in France."
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:02.920]   You know?
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:05.320]   Well, dude, you brought the head to bed.
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.920]   We have low web.
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:07.920]   Whatever.
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:11.320]   It's just like, they're really truly incompetent.
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:17.640]   I mean, to hire a C.O.L. with like, and supposedly the stories were in the Washington
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:18.640]   Post.
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:21.920]   So if you Google the person's name, you would have found out about it.
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:24.240]   Yeah, you didn't tell anybody that.
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.920]   What does it take to Google a name if you're going to hire somebody?
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:27.920]   Yeah.
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:28.920]   I mean, come on.
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:32.720]   I mean, for a C.O.O. position, I mean, this is not, this is like one of the third
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:34.960]   top position of the company.
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:37.680]   And then I'm profit.
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:39.000]   It's nuts.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.400]   We also want to wish a happy birthday, 90th birthday today to Arthur C. Clark, the last
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:45.960]   of the great triumphant of sci-fi writers.
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:49.560]   In fact, I should have made it Arthur C. Clark, our Audible pick.
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:51.640]   There's some really good Arthur C. Clark stuff on Audible.com.
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:53.360]   Yeah, he lives in Sri Lanka.
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:54.360]   Sri Lanka.
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:55.360]   Mm-hmm, Audible.
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:56.840]   I love what I'm doing.
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:58.360]   Ninety years old.
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:17:59.360]   I love Jason.
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.120]   Thank you for giving, for making up for a last ad, Audible.
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:04.120]   I appreciate it.
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:07.120]   Jason Callicannis is at Mahalo, M-A-H-O-L-O.
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:09.280]   Did I say that right?
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:10.920]   M-A-H-A-L-O.
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:12.680]   I always spell it wrong.
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:13.680]   Mahalo.
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:14.680]   M-A-H-A-L-O.
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:15.680]   Mahalo.
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:19.960]   Every time I put a link to Victoria, I spell it wrong.
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:21.520]   I don't know why that is.
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:26.120]   Veronica, you're a sexy at showing today.
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:28.800]   It's a good thing that you listen to Audible books and don't read books.
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:29.800]   Now you know why.
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:32.120]   You can't mispronounce the words or anything.
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:34.280]   It's go right into Audible, you browse through.
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:36.280]   They got their best of 2007.
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:39.880]   Wow, you look at the best of 2007 right on their site.
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:40.880]   It's a good year.
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:42.440]   I could download five of these right now.
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:43.440]   I might download a lot of them.
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:44.440]   It's good stuff on there.
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:48.400]   You go running, you're on a plane, you could just have this stuff ready to go.
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:49.400]   In your car.
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:51.040]   Don't sell them too much.
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:52.040]   I think they're under a lot of their options.
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:53.040]   Yee, they're all the subway.
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:55.440]   They're going to take their business over to him.
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:56.440]   Maybe that's the thing.
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:58.760]   There's no him, but I'm saying like if you were on the subway, you were on the subway.
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:02.440]   You could be reading the New York Post or listening to some radiohead or whatever.
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:05.960]   Or you could be bettering yourself and becoming a more worldly person.
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:07.200]   Get on some of the classics.
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:10.760]   Maybe catch up on some of those science fiction books that you were supposed to read in Dinnett.
[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:15.200]   It's a very efficient way to broaden your horizons and maybe become a little more intelligent
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:16.200]   and enlightened.
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:17.920]   Audible, Audible, Audible.
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:18.920]   We love you.
[01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:19.920]   Audible.
[01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:20.920]   Audible.
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:21.920]   Audible.
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:23.520]   They got two spots of today's show.
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:24.880]   Thank you very much, Jason.
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:25.880]   Chodible.
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:28.480]   Chod, see them four eggs.
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:34.880]   We have to cut these out for AOL because when the podcast runs on AOL's podcast channel,
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:36.240]   it's a non-commercial channel.
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:37.920]   So how am I going to edit out this?
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:38.920]   I have no idea.
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:39.920]   No, that was a personal idea.
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:40.920]   That was a personal.
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:42.720]   That was my personal feelings on Audible.
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:44.240]   We're talking about a technology coming up.
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:45.240]   That's editorial.
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:46.240]   That's editorial.
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:47.240]   All right, baby.
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:48.240]   I get nothing from that, Ed.
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:51.080]   I'm just giving feedback on I love Audible.
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:54.000]   So it's on us, heartfelt.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000]   You know what I love?
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.000]   Devorect.org/blog.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.600]   Yes, everybody does.
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:00.400]   They've got kindles there for $5.
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:01.400]   Amazing.
[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:02.400]   Amazing.
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:03.400]   And they have keys.
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:05.600]   They sell them keys at half price.
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:06.600]   Weaves at half price.
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:08.600]   Weaves at half price.
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:09.920]   I'm a limit three per person.
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:11.120]   That would be a good promotion.
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:12.120]   Half price weaves.
[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:13.120]   Devorect.org/blog.
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:18.720]   He's actually got a video on the front page of, and you thought the Wii Mot was only good
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:20.520]   for games on a Wii.
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:22.400]   I don't know what that is.
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:24.200]   Oh, you can use it like a touch screen.
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:25.200]   Yeah, that's cool.
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:28.000]   All right, thanks, everybody.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.800]   We'll see it.
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:32.920]   Our next tweet will be our last tweet of the year.
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:35.280]   We'll do a kind of year-end roundup.
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:39.360]   Don't forget we've still got that 20% off coupon for Scott Evess goodies.
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:44.440]   If you go to scottevest.com, when you check out at the end there, use my name Leo.
[01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:48.480]   As the coupon code, you'll get 20% off anything that does not include the Twitch merchandize
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:49.480]   on ThinkGeek.
[01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:51.400]   That's a separate system.
[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:56.240]   So if you are on scottevest.com, use Leo as the coupon code to get 20% off.
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:58.280]   Thanks, Scott Evess, for that.
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:20:59.280]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.280]   We'll see you next time.
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:01.280]   Another tweet.
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:02.280]   This is amazing.
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:03.280]   Is in the can.
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:03.280]   [MUSIC]

[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:28.800]   I should have paid attention.
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:30.280]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:31.280]   Too much work.
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:32.680]   The problem is, there's no limit.
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:33.680]   My server is completely collapsed.
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:34.680]   So here's the deal.
[01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:39.680]   I'm just trying to get the thing off, but I have a hell of a time when blue screens forget
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:40.680]   it.
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:42.680]   I'm killing you.
