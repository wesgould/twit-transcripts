[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.040]   It's time for Twit. This week in Tech. Our Tech News round table which is actually really
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.240]   a hemisphere, a semi-circle of a table with rounded corners. So I don't know what you
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.280]   call it. But fortunately around this table we have a wonderful panel joining us now from
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.240]   the Tech meme ride home. Internet historian Brian McCullough. Good to see you Brian.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.960]   Good to see you Leo. Yes sir. You can tell he's an internet historian because he has a
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:49.440]   collection of Time magazine covers featuring the internet. The only excuse for that would
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:58.920]   be that's your internet historian and action. I also have 10 shares of US steel.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:06.160]   US steel? Well that'll be worth something someday. Yeah my mom when her mother died got
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:15.840]   a lot of like those like physical shares of you know things like Union Carbide and you
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.440]   know we just companies that I think are long gone and she's never cash them and we don't
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.800]   know what the value the basis is on them or anything. They're just paper on the wall.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:35.360]   Are those shares good? I mean like the date on it is 1903. Wow. And it's canceled. Yeah
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.760]   probably all. Okay. I don't know it's one of those things where you always hear those
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:47.160]   stories about the old ladies that you know had a company that got folded into this that
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.280]   got folded into that that got folded into Pfizer and then you know when you guys they
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.360]   it turns out that she's only a million dollars on the cap. Yeah. You'd be better off buying
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:03.280]   some Bitcoin these days. Also with this dogecoin also with us the master of dogecoin. He got
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:11.200]   in at the bottom got out at the bottom father Robert Bell is there the digital Jesuit.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.360]   I actually don't have any stock certificates from US steel or from Union Carbide. However
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:22.480]   today I did find after a lot of looking one of my lost dogecoin wallets that has about
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.760]   probably 150, 200,000 doge on it. Oh that's good. They're up to and but it will take
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.160]   nickel take up to a month. It will take up to a month to sink the wallet because that
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.800]   particular blockchain network is slow. Yeah. I you know every time I open my Bitcoin core
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.440]   wallet and have to sink it it's more than a hundred gigabytes of data that you have to
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.840]   download. Yeah it takes a while. It takes a while. Crazy that blockchain is crazy big.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.120]   Oh good. I'm glad you have a little left. How much did you say? About so in this particular
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:00.400]   wallet probably between 150 to 250,000. I haven't had a total I mined a total of two million.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.360]   But I traded some of that in to get some Bitcoin. So I'm not exactly sure how much I have left.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.480]   There are like four outstanding wallets I have to find. That's awesome.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:15.840]   At least you know the password to yours. Probably Bitcoin is almost 50,000. Let me see what it
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.720]   is right now. It's going up all the time. And while I'm doing that let's say hello. Yeah. 49,191
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.720]   dollars as we record. Let's say hello to Wesley Faulkner who is a developer advocate for the
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.800]   daily.co. Hi. Good to see you. I am always down for a bromance.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.480]   Bromance. That's it. This is the bromance episode Valentine's Day bromance.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:45.760]   It's good to have you all. I don't know where to begin. This is sometimes the tech stories have a
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:52.800]   kind of coherent thread to them. Sometimes it's just a tossed salad. This is a tossed salad edition.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:01.600]   So I don't know. I mean any point I begin it will fear wildly. I guess as we're talking about
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:08.480]   Bitcoin we should mention and maybe you can explain that Elon Musk's Tesla bought one and a half billion
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:15.280]   dollars worth of Bitcoin. What? Why? And they say they're going to let you pay for your next Tesla
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:22.880]   in Bitcoin, which makes me want to find my wallet. Yeah. Well, I mean they had the cash in on what
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.040]   happened to the market. The fact that they said that they were going to accept Bitcoin,
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:38.400]   it kicked up Bitcoin from running into 36 to 47,000 range to the 46 to 47,000 range. So I mean,
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.920]   it was a major kick up. So them buying all that Bitcoin already earned them quite a bit of money.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.240]   But also the way to make it. Do they time it? So they bought the Bitcoin then made the announcement?
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:55.360]   Well, I mean, I think they understood that once they started doing these block purchases of Bitcoin,
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.360]   the market was going to explode. It's an S&P filing Leo. They had to announce that they did it.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.880]   Yeah, because they're publicly held company. You can't spend a billion and a half on anything.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:10.240]   Because their cash on hand is I can't remember what it was. Let's call it 10 million dollars. So
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.080]   whatever 10 billion dollars. So whatever it was, that was a meaningful amount of their cash on hand.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.880]   They had to report that. Yeah. He also, for reasons we don't fully understand,
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:25.040]   has been tweeting like crazy about your dogecoin there. He has that. I think is just him being a troll.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:31.200]   A good troll. It's a fantastic tool. It's good for you. But I mean, he did the same thing when
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:37.920]   the kids were going after GameStop. We're going after the hedge fund managers. So I think this is
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:44.640]   the malicious side of Elon coming out and saying, sure, with a tweet, I can create. He just flexed.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:49.600]   Millions of dollars of value in a meme currency. Because that's what dogecoin is.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:56.720]   It was a joke. Although is the math for it legit? I mean, it's a legit blockchain.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:02.960]   Actually, it's a far more legit blockchain than some of the altcoins that are currently running.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.520]   But when it was created, it was created because a bunch of people said, look, it's too hard to
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:13.760]   mine Bitcoin. This was five years ago, four or five years. You can't make anything on it,
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:20.160]   unless you had a specialized rig. So it was created for and by people like me who wanted to do something
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:26.320]   fun. We used it on Twitch to teach people how the blockchain worked. And the difference was,
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.880]   whereas there was a super limited number of Bitcoin, there was an almost infinite number of
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:37.520]   dogecoin that you could mine. And we never expected it to be worth anything. It was purely bragging
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:42.880]   rights. Brian and I were running the miners on our systems just so we could compete with each
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:48.480]   other of who had more dogecoin. And now, I think Brian Stash, he just cashed it in and made like
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:56.640]   $20,000. Holy cow. Yes, with Steve Gibson did his security now on Bitcoin, which was something
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:06.400]   like Episode 287. I mean, it was probably when, yeah, Episode 287, he explained how cryptocurrency
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:12.720]   worked. And he just as for fun, had set up a Bitcoin miner. And the next morning, it plopped out
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:19.200]   50 Bitcoin. This is back when no one was doing it, right? So the whole idea of these currencies
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.840]   is it gets harder and harder to mine until you mine a maximum amount. And then you've got all the
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:29.920]   coin you're going to create so that there is so that if you keep creating it, it's inflationary. So
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.240]   you want to have a static amount, but you don't want to dump it on the market all at once. So
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:39.440]   it's all part of the theory Satoshi Nakamoto published in his original Bitcoin paper.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.520]   So he was able to mine it very easily. Initially, it's now, of course, very costly to mine. It
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:50.080]   takes a lot of the math problems are harder and harder and harder. He erased the hard drive with
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:55.680]   the wallet on it. So he's got this point. He's gone. That's $2.5 million.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:02.400]   There are actually a huge amount of Bitcoin that are no longer viable. They're dark. They're
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:07.760]   forever lost. Yeah. And remember, there's there's only a maximum of 21 million Bitcoin that will
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.880]   ever be mined ever. Now you can do fractions of that.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.840]   Compare that to Dogecoin. Dogecoin has 100 billion Dogecoin.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:21.280]   That's why Elon Musk's Snoop Dogg and Gene Simmons are tweeting about.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:25.280]   Exactly. Why not? Why not?
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:32.720]   The thing is, whenever there's a story, this is a story from CNBC of all people on Dogecoin.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.400]   They show an image of the coin as if there is such a thing. There's no coin.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.840]   But if there were, it would have the doge on it would have that very cute little,
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.080]   what is that? Is that a corgi? It's a Shiba Inu.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.320]   Oh, a Shiba Inu. The reason that I know that is, and I know the exact timing,
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:56.960]   because it was February. It was as cold as it is right now. It was 2014. So Dogecoin had just
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:03.280]   come out and I went to some sort of crypto party down on Wall Street. They had rented out a thing
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:08.560]   at the end of Wall Street. People brought those dogs and people, at the end of the night, they all
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:15.840]   put a Shiba, whatever that dog's head is, the Doge head on the bull, the running bull behind Wall
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:21.520]   Street. I reached out to some of those people that I met that night, because Dogecoin was all
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:26.800]   the rage. A lot of them had sold out and stuff. It was 50/50. I'd say to the people I reached
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.320]   out to. They're like, "Yeah, I sold out of that a long time ago." One guy was like,
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:35.840]   "I sold out of that a month ago when it reached a quarter of a penny," or something. It
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.920]   had surged all the way to a quarter of a penny. Half of them were like, "Yeah, I don't know what
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.760]   I'm going to do now, but maybe I'll cash out now." It's almost $0.06. It was its peak, and now it's
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:50.160]   back down about a nickel. Put it this way, Leo. I was still at Twit, and I stopped mining.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:59.200]   The entirety of all of my wallets together, which was one to two million range, was worth about
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:07.040]   $1.40. If I had actually had it and been able to cash it out at the top, it would have been worth
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:16.640]   somewhere in the vicinity of $140,000. Holy moly! So, is this all just a pyramid scheme and a scam,
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:24.640]   or is this legit? No, it's not legit. I'm not talking about Dogecoin. I'm just cryptocurrency in
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:30.800]   general. I know, if you say it's not the next big thing, you're going to get flamed like crazy by
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:36.800]   the Bitcoin brows. There are people who've made a ton of money. I'm going to tell you somebody who's
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:43.920]   a Bitcoin billionaire in a second. But it's a fiat currency tied to nothing.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:51.920]   If you say that, all of the Bitcoin stands are going to point out the fact that the dollar
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.800]   is a fiat currency tied to the full faith and credit of the United States government,
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:03.760]   slightly different. But here's what I always say. It's not a scam in the sense that you actually
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:08.320]   can make a lot of money. If you've lost the market, if you converted into actual money,
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:13.520]   dollars, you can do something. You actually can. Here's the problem. It's a financial instrument.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:20.240]   It's like investing in a junk bond, where you can get a lot of money, and you can lose a lot of money.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:25.840]   It is great as a financial instrument. It is terrible as a currency. You don't want your
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:30.400]   currency to fuck with that. That's a very good point. There's a lot of problems with, at least with
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:36.720]   Bitcoin, of course, subsequent cryptocurrencies have attempted to solve them. One is the speed of
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:42.880]   transactions as the blockchain gets bigger and bigger, has really become slow. You could pay more
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:48.640]   to get the transaction up and faster, to get the miners to process it faster. But that's
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:55.280]   problematic. Then the volatility of the actual value is very problematic. If I buy a pizza for
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:01.520]   50 Bitcoin and it turns out later that that was worth $2.5 million, I'm going to be unhappy about
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.920]   that. Those are real issues with a currency. I see what you're saying, though. Not so much
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:11.840]   with a financial instrument. That might well happen. If you had a share of that US steel stock on Brian's
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:19.440]   wall, that fluctuates. I actually had a very long discussion on Twig a couple of weeks ago, which we
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:25.760]   actually cut out of the shipping version because it really was fruitless, in which I made the point
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:33.520]   that a stock isn't so very different. People in their mind tie the value of stock to the
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:39.760]   fundamentals of the company, but it isn't really tied to it. It's only tied to it because people
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:46.160]   say it's tied to it. Maybe you can't tell me anybody who knows this. Maybe Wesley,
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:52.640]   can I take those shares if they weren't canceled of US steel and go to US steel and say, I want to
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:57.280]   cash this in? I don't know the answer to that question. Does anybody know?
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:03.840]   Yeah, but Leo, if you're going all the way, but history had on, if you're going all the way back
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:09.600]   to the East India Company and stuff like that, when corporations were first formed, the idea was
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.920]   is you had a claim on those traditional-- Yes, you're buying a share of the company.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:20.960]   The thing that is the force in the market. The thing that's divorced in modern stocks is that
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:26.000]   most companies don't pay dividends. Even the best ones, your Verizon's or whatever, pay like
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.520]   3% or 3.5%. So you're not sharing in the success of the company?
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:35.760]   A lot of historically tech stocks, it's changing a little bit now, but Google doesn't pay dividends.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.800]   Apple for years didn't. Now they do. But like the British East India Company,
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:45.760]   you would get a dividend of 30% of whatever their net was every year.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:50.480]   That's a meaningful share of the company. Yeah, that means you really have a percentage of the
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:58.320]   company. Somehow, at some point, the stocks got kind of separated from the meaning of that.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:04.400]   When it's first issued, the cash you pay for it ultimately goes to the company.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:09.760]   But at that point, it just floats along. Depending on the whim of the market,
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:16.560]   somewhat divorced from the performance of the company. There's nothing actually tying it to
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:20.480]   the performance of the company. There's dividends. That's about it. Anyway.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.320]   And even in that case, because there's common stock and there's preferred stock,
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.800]   and common stock is what we used to think stocks were, where you're buying a share of the company,
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:33.440]   therefore you have a voice. That's a common stock. Preferred stock is you can get paid a
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.520]   dividend, but you've got no vote. Yeah, look at Facebook. It doesn't matter how much
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:41.920]   stock they issue, Mark Zuckerberg will always have the lion's share and always have control of the
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:47.840]   company. Period. They've been very smart that way. So anyway, the other point I'm making is
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:59.280]   a lot of what we do today in modern finance is fiat, is faith-based. I'm going to invest in
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:04.240]   this because I think it's going to go up. And so it's really silly to criticize Bitcoin for not
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.800]   being tied to anything when, frankly, a lot of stuff is not tied to anything either.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:16.080]   The truth is that the environments right now is like casinos are closed, a lot of gambling
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:20.640]   establishments are closed. The interest rate is really, really low and it's not expected to
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:27.680]   increase anytime soon. People are looking for ways to shuffle their money in places to try to
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:32.400]   get the strong ups that they would get other riskier investments like that.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:38.720]   And so it's not surprising that a lot of people are putting stuff in things that we wouldn't
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:45.040]   and other times do. Have you heard of rally and rallies? You're able to issue your own coin
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:49.200]   and say, hey, I want to thank people who love me. So I'm going to issue. I like to issue
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:54.640]   rally. It's a little coin. Yeah, Wesley coin. Wow. Have you heard of the hotness that is
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:18:01.680]   non-fungible tokens right now? And you can invest in, say, a digital video of an NBA highlight.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.800]   And if it's the right one, they're been selling for $30,000 right now.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:10.160]   Well, it's like, well, remember the crypto kitties? Right. Well, it's the same. It's the same people.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:16.000]   Crypto kitties started that. And then whatever, whoever is the company behind crypto kitties,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.040]   they have a partnership with the NBA. Non-fungible tokens and art on the blockchain and things
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.960]   like collectibles on the blockchain is absolutely exploding right now. But specifically, whatever
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.840]   the company behind crypto kitties is, they have a partnership with the NBA that that stuff has been
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:39.440]   exploding a lot recently. And all they do is you can own a digital video of an NBA highlight
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:46.080]   replay. And then if it gets played, do you get money? No, you essentially own it. You're the only
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:52.080]   one that owns that representation of the video. Just like owning an imaginary cat.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:58.000]   Well, owning a baseball card. Right. At least with a baseball card, you have a card. But no,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.360]   you know what? There's a long history of this, isn't it? And yes, but no.
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:09.200]   Here, for example, take XRP. Ripple. It's one of the cryptocurrencies.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:17.360]   One of my hobbies during the pandemic has been to invest in some cryptocurrencies.
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:25.520]   And I took some of the money that I got allowed to do that as long as it stays inside the cryptocurrency
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:31.280]   account, it's not as soon as it turned into Lira or dollars or euro or whatever, then you'd have to
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:36.960]   tie that. Do you tie the 100% exactly what everything? I don't have anything. You're not allowed to
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.720]   own it doesn't belong to me. But the moment you become money. Okay, by the way, I would take it as
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:47.200]   tacit proof from the church that this stuff is worthless. It's literally worthless because
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.600]   priests can have as much as they want to whatever you want, because it's worthless.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:58.400]   So I started with 200 that I turned from Doge into something that I could actually invest.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.760]   Currently sitting in this account is 11,531.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:09.200]   Something going back and forth. No, so I go back and forth between a cryptocurrency and then
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.640]   it's dollars, but it's not actually money yet. Are you doing arbitrage?
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:20.880]   No, no, no, no, it's all within a brokerage account, a cryptocurrency brokerage account.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:29.600]   But XRP, when I bought it, was running at about 10 cents. And then it got under a SEC investigation
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:34.320]   for running a unregistered security. Now that should have killed it. That should have killed
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:40.080]   any stock, any actual financial transaction tool. It is now running at 60 cents.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:46.640]   I mean, it's the market doesn't matter where you invest right now, as long as you hold on to
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.480]   it long enough, right now you're going to make money. It's irrational exuberance.
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:58.080]   Yeah. And I would submit it is one of the many things really wrong with society today.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:04.560]   But maybe I'm just my old fashioned Wesley, or does this feel to you like,
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:09.840]   I don't know, what does this seem like to you? You obviously are not playing in this domain.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.040]   Actually, I just sold my goods.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.840]   Son of a 20 got you 7.4.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.800]   Everyone.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.760]   You got 7.4 cents for your dogecoin.
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:24.880]   Yeah, actually, it's a message to Father Robert saying, hey, I'm now in the game. So,
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:30.960]   yeah, I decided to sell. I bought it at, I think, 3.5 cents. And then I nearly,
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:34.080]   so I more than doubled the money that I put in.
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.960]   Okay, I give up all he is a crazy.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:42.240]   Can you imagine what happens, Wesley, in 10 years, dogecoin is at $50,000.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:48.720]   Which sounds stupid, except I would have said the exact same thing when you told me that
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.560]   Bitcoin was at $50,000.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:57.040]   Yeah. So that's part of me that I think would be like one of those countries where the
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.280]   you have to bring like $70 million to buy a loaf of bread or something like that.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:06.960]   Yeah, I for inflation, like what's the economy so far that it wouldn't even be recognized.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.480]   Alex Lindsey brought me back from Zimbabwe a few years ago.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.360]   I think 5 million Zimbabwe dollars.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.800]   Well, that's nothing.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.360]   Which was nothing. You couldn't buy it was less than a nickel.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.560]   Did they?
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.320]   Did there be a trillion dollar bill?
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:26.880]   I shouldn't laugh because there's very real suffering and pain associated with that.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:27.360]   Oh, nice. Yes.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:32.960]   You know, if that happened in the United States, I would, I, all my retirement,
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:36.720]   everything that I plan to live on for the last, you know, a few decades in my life would be
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.640]   zip. And that would be devastating.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:48.880]   But in theory, Leo, that's the argument for Bitcoin specifically is it being a store of value
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.120]   that is a hedge against inflation.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:57.840]   And so the ultimate as, you know, the Padre would probably tell you the ultimate bull case for Bitcoin
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.960]   would be it replaces gold.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:07.600]   If Bitcoin had a market cap equal to gold market cap, then you'd have Bitcoin 1 million.
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.120]   Right.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.560]   Yeah, but okay.
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:16.320]   This would probably be who've me at this point to say.
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:22.000]   If you do not take advice on any financial advisor, this show ever.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.080]   Don't do it.
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:24.480]   Ever.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.600]   Ever.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.320]   Ever.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.280]   To me, and maybe I'm really, really, really old fashioned.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:36.320]   I mean, I didn't, I thought the gold standard was silly because there's the industrial value of gold
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:42.000]   is considerably below the dollar assigned to an ounce of gold, which is thousands of dollars.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.200]   Yeah, but that's, but when I'm talking about anything, really.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.840]   The use of gold as a hedge against inflation.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.920]   Yeah, but that's all imaginary, right?
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:50.880]   Right.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.560]   But all of money is imaginary.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.840]   Leo, let's, let's come on.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.280]   Let's go back to the dorm right now.
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.440]   No, it is all imaginary.
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.480]   I understand.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:03.040]   It's all imaginary and that, I think that people don't really want to think about that
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.120]   because it would scare the hell out of them if they did.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.200]   All right.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:12.560]   More evidence that something's happening with Bitcoin, Jay Z and Jack Dorsey,
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:18.240]   which are two things you don't necessarily think of going together.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:27.840]   I've invested 500 Bitcoin, which is 20, what, $25 million to make it the currency of the internet.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:34.960]   It's an endowment called B Trust, but the B is the Bitcoin B with little stuff.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.360]   It's a blind irrevocable trust.
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:45.280]   So neither Jay Z nor Jack Dorsey can say what happens to it.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:50.480]   They're going to hire three board members and the mission of this new $25 million fund
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.680]   is to make the Bitcoin, the internet's currency.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.120]   This is going to be an issue because it's going uphill against many governments.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:06.400]   Although, I have to point out, and this was a story from a month or two ago,
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:13.040]   that a number of governments have said we should have some sort of stable coin
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.840]   that is an intergovernmental currency.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.200]   Lira.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.880]   Tell me what a stock aches.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:23.360]   Okay.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.560]   What's a stable coin?
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.400]   Anybody want to take that one?
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:32.720]   You do not want your currency to be the volatile coin.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:39.120]   The volatile coin is fun and sometimes very profitable if you are investing.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:44.800]   But you do not want an announcement from a company like Tesla to suddenly drive the price
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.000]   of your currency up by 25%.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.960]   That should never be okay.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.720]   It's the down I'm worried about, right?
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:56.240]   Precisely. That's what so many of us are waiting for because you buy on the dip and then you
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:01.440]   make profit. We haven't really had a dip. We've been rising since November, and it's getting
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:06.000]   scarier and scarier and scarier. We broke 20,000, then 30,000, then 40,000.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:13.760]   Now we're breaking 50,000. In any other system, that is a clear sign of madness and a crash that's
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:19.920]   coming. But you need a stable coin where you can pull the money out of the volatile coin so it
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:24.080]   can sit. When you think it's overheated, when you think there's about to be a dip,
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:28.880]   you need a place to be able to pull the money out so that you don't ride the coin down.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.440]   This is the Wild West right now. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:40.000]   And as is often the case with these kind of very volatile situations, some people can make a lot of
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.800]   money. But I worry about the others. That money doesn't come from nowhere.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:51.200]   If I'm a billion dollars richer, it's because somebody bought a billion dollars of the Bitcoin.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:58.320]   Correct. Is it a zero-sum game? No, because the value can just go on forever, right?
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:04.160]   Not just that the environmental impact of Bitcoin specifically.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:09.920]   Well, that's another big story. It sucks so much power. And I said Lira, but I meant Libra,
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.840]   which is- I like Lira, though. I thought Lira-
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.960]   The Italians aren't using it. Might as well use it, right?
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:20.800]   No, Libra coin. Yeah, yeah. But it's supposed to be like a stable coin by Facebook and that was
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:26.000]   under scrutiny and they pulled back. But this sounds like it might be their time to reemerge
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   because if everyone's getting into it, why can you now target Facebook?
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.280]   Last month, the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, which is an 18th century title,
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:40.560]   if I ever heard one, issued a letter saying federally charted banks could use stable coin
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:46.480]   or any cryptocurrency with relatively stable prices for standard banking transactions
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:51.280]   like payment activities. And this is happening globally as well. National banks all over the
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:58.400]   world are doing this. So that's what I mean by it. We're in the Wild West because on the one hand,
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.680]   it's being embraced. The SEC is trying to figure out what to do with this.
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:06.480]   There are Bitcoin bros out there making a lot of money and very few people are facing the
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:12.320]   very real environmental impact. This is a study from the University of Cambridge
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:18.000]   where they're comparing the number of terawatt hours, terawatt hours
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:26.640]   that are used to create Bitcoin. Bitcoin is created by solving hard math problems.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:33.120]   And that means you have to have a very powerful computer eating a lot of energy,
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:38.080]   generating a lot of heat. It's actually not too bad. The total electricity consumption
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:47.680]   by Bitcoin is 20,000 terawatt hours. And that's only .56 of the total global consumption. Although
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:53.360]   it puts Bitcoin kind of on a par with Norway.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:58.160]   Norway, Finland, Ireland, Australia.
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:03.600]   121 terawatt hours per year. That's more than the Netherlands or the UAE,
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:08.160]   but just a little less than Norway and Argentina. It's right in the middle there.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:18.160]   Sorry, a status recently was that one transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:24.560]   is the equivalent energy use of 32,000 or maybe it was 320,000 on the Visa network.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:28.880]   So to do 32,000 transactions versus one transaction is the equivalent of it.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:33.760]   So it's not just mining. We're talking about transactional costs in power.
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:40.400]   If you do a credit card transaction, it's going to cost about .01 kilowatt hours.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:44.720]   You do something in the Ethereum blockchain, which is a bit more efficient and there's not
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:51.040]   as much running. It's about 37 kilowatt hours. Bitcoin is now breaking 200 kilowatt hours per
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:56.640]   transaction. So it's unsustainable. That's the other part of this, which is you can't have your
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:01.840]   currency use up more power than your industry. That would be a bad thing.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:06.800]   So this Cambridge study though kind of came up with some things that made me feel a little bit
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:14.080]   better anyway. For instance, the amount of electricity consumed by always on but inactive home devices
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:22.080]   in a year could power Bitcoin for 1.8 years. So if you want to look at inefficiencies,
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:29.040]   turn off your freaking microwave computer and TV because they're just suck their vampire power.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:33.120]   The amount of electricity consumed by Bitcoin in one year could power
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:40.640]   all the tea kettles in the United Kingdom for 27 years. That's just silly. That's a lot of tea.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:47.360]   That's just silly. I thought it was interesting, but it puts in perspective. In fact, if you really
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:52.160]   want to look and really put it in perspective, this little yellow bar here is a total consumption
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:31:02.560]   of Bitcoin ranked 31. The number one country China is using considerably more as is the United
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:11.040]   States. The United States uses 3,989 terawatt hours a year, almost 4,000 terawatt hours a year
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:18.640]   compared to the 121 that Bitcoin consumes. Yet we're using it to do stuff. Bitcoin is just
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:25.280]   using it to solve math problems. You get things like there's an old mining town up in the Arctic
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:31.120]   Circle in Russia that has become the new Bitcoin hub for them because
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:38.160]   wherever power is cheap. Cooling is so expensive to complete these rigs. The power
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:44.240]   is the way that they're getting the power because it's so remote is they're basically burning oil
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:49.920]   and coal. They're burning really dirty power sources in the Arctic Circle in order to mine
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:58.800]   Bitcoin. That's not going to end well. I want to take a break because we've spent half an hour
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:02.400]   talking about Bitcoin. I didn't plan on it, but there is certainly a lot to talk about.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:14.640]   Let's sum up. I feel like there's a huge economic risk. There's a huge bubble risk here
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:20.480]   that could bring the whole financial industry to its knees. This is another issues with Bitcoin.
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:28.240]   Is that what do you think? Is Bitcoin on its balance or are cryptocurrencies on balance
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:35.440]   a positive or a negative? Father Robert? Negative. I might enjoy them. I like the technology behind
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:40.880]   them. It's fascinating. It's fascinating. But how do you not look at this and think,
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:46.720]   immediately, oh, this is a tulip bubble? This is a tulip bubble beyond that. This could crash
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.840]   the world economy. That's the problem is it's not just that Bitcoin would crash.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:56.000]   It's that the economy itself could suffer as a result. Wesley, despite the huge proceeds you've
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.280]   reaped from your Dogecoin arbitrage, do you feel it's a positive or a negative?
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:08.400]   Honestly, I'm going to have to say it's pretty much an inconsequential.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.760]   Inconsequential. Personally, I think because of the people who have it,
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:17.120]   as just like the stock market, the stock market might go up and up with the percentage of Americans,
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:22.880]   or people who invest in the stock market is less than half. I think in terms of you look at the
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:28.720]   pull of money that's out there, it's inconsequential. That's a good point. Honestly,
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:37.200]   the problems in the United States have a lot more to do with minimum wage, the immense job
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:42.000]   loss thanks to the pandemic. Those things hit really hit home, whether somebody's spending
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.520]   a lot of money to generate Bitcoin in the Arctic Circle is probably a little less important.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:53.840]   It's just Wall Street speculation and people in the clergy that are in.
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:59.200]   Lot of frees. I'll go with that.
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:07.120]   All right, Brian McCullough. We got a tie here. It's the end of the world. It's inconsequential.
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.000]   I say it's the end of the world. What do you say?
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.240]   Net positive.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:13.680]   Net positive. Good for you.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:20.240]   One of the most interesting areas of tech and finance right now, and although we don't have time
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:28.080]   and I have no interest in defending it, I will hedge by saying not a single super valuable company
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:32.960]   has yet been created around this technology. Even crypto. There's been lots of interesting
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:38.560]   use cases, but there's been a lot of speculation. People have made billions of dollars speculating,
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:43.680]   but no one has made a meaningful, profitable, interesting company yet, and it's been around
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:44.640]   for more than a decade.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:52.080]   That's fair. In fact, if anything, it's mostly things like CryptoKitties and owning NBA.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:57.120]   Here's a guy who's made a little money. Last story before we take the break.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:06.800]   His handle is Joker's Stash, and he started a website for stolen credit cards back in,
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:13.200]   I think it was 2013. You could go in Joker's Stash 2014 and go in Joker's Stash and buy
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:20.000]   stolen credit card ranging in price from $1 to $150 for credit card that comes with not only the
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:27.040]   number, but the card holder's name, address, and social security number. It was where 2 million cards
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:34.800]   belonging to the buka de beppo, the infamous buka de beppo breach, were sold 5 million cards
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:41.280]   from Sax 5th Avenue were sold, and of course, the founder of Joker's Stash took a commission.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:47.440]   Every transaction on Joker's Stash was in Bitcoin because whether this is true or not,
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:53.280]   it's sort of true that Bitcoin is anonymous. I don't think it says anonymous as cash, but it's
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:59.200]   sort of anonymous. Since one of the ways you know it's not anonymous is because we know by looking at
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:06.480]   the wallet that $400 million in Bitcoin has gone through Joker's Stash wallet since 2015.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:11.600]   In 2018, it peaked at $139 million a year. Sales have dropped over the last couple of years.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:16.720]   That's the good news due to better security around credit cards, anti-fraud technology,
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:24.000]   people being more careful. Joker's Stash announced he's retiring. He notified customers in October,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.120]   he'd been hospitalized, or she'd been hospitalized with coronavirus. In December,
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:33.440]   Interpol and the FBI seized the domains used by the site. That didn't matter because they were
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:40.640]   able to keep going through onion.onions sites, but he's decided to retire the estimate. This is
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:50.800]   from elliptic.coa cryptocurrency site is that Joker's Stash based on their commission about 20%
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:37:00.000]   on sales. Less than Apple takes, I might add, is 60,000 Bitcoin. He's retiring with a nest egg of
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:08.480]   $2.5 billion. I'd retire too. That's nothing. I've got 2 million dogecoin.
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:17.200]   Darknet Crypto King Joker's Stash. This is actually not the... I was going through
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:24.800]   other retirements from ransomware and so forth. The number last year of hackers or sites
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:29.360]   decided to call it a day. Ransomware has a service site. A couple of them.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:34.160]   Maybe... I don't know if because it's less lucrative or they've made so much money,
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:40.560]   that it's time to take a break. Anyway, we will take a break. That is our Bitcoin segment for the
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:48.080]   day. Please, no emails. No emails. Our show today brought to you by a great...
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:52.480]   And by the way, I should thank you again, all of you for being here. Brian McCullough,
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:57.920]   the Tech meme, Ride Home, the best daily news podcast on the tech industry. You could find it
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:03.280]   at Techmeme.com, the Tech meme Ride Home podcast. Great to have you, Wesley Faulkner,
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:08.160]   who is always one of our favorites from Austin, Texas. How's the weather in Austin?
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:15.760]   Horrible. It is cold. I think the highs too on Monday.
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.280]   Two? Oh, that's pretty cold. I didn't think it got that cold.
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:28.240]   It's... Right now, since it's 22 degrees, I think it was like the 1920s. The 1920s was the last time
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:35.600]   it's been this cold. It's historic. I was out there earlier. There's ice everywhere because
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:39.520]   it's just rain, hits the ground, freezes. It's an ice rink out there.
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:43.920]   And you guys are not prepared for this kind of... No, no people are losing their minds.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:51.680]   I am so sorry. I was talking to a weatherman from Lincoln, Nebraska,
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:58.160]   this morning, and he said it got down to something like 30 below zero last night.
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:03.360]   So that's cold, but it depends what you're used to. In Nebraska, they're kind of used to it.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:07.360]   Father Robert Ballisare, how were the eggs this morning in the Vatican?
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:12.240]   We don't get eggs on a regular basis. We only get night. It's...
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:18.000]   Of course, breakfast for dinner. It's what the Vatican's famous for.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:26.320]   We had pins yesterday, which is kind of like flatbread pizza. Oh, it was okay, I guess.
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:29.280]   Yeah. They don't give you actual pizza there in Italy.
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:35.760]   No, no. You have to go out to get that. All the Napoli. Napoli has great pizza. I love... Anytime
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:41.440]   I'm in Napoli, that's what I mean. I love the pizza in Southern Italy, but I've had pizza in
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:45.200]   Napoli a couple of years ago. We had to do it. Lisa and I were there. We said, "I said we have to
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:49.840]   go have pizza." It's where it's famous. There you go. It's great to have all three of you.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:54.480]   Thank you for joining me this week on Valentine's Day. Our show today brought to you by podium.
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:03.200]   Do you know podium? This is... I talked to them a couple of weeks ago about podium. It is a way...
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:07.840]   Nowadays, this is going to be hard to describe what they do, but I'm telling you, if you're a
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:13.520]   small business, if you're a local retailer, you really want to know about podium. We have a little
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:22.880]   bagel shop. It's fantastic bagels down the road. They could use podium to create messages to their
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:32.480]   customers. Either through their website or through text messaging, that would allow them to do so much
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:41.360]   get reviews, chat with the customers, take podium payments, video chat, the podium inbox, and all of
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:47.520]   this is not coming from some faceless corporation. It's coming from your business. It's a way for
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:54.240]   you to talk with your customers easily, effectively, to build loyalty, to build your business.
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:41:01.120]   Nowadays, in quarantine, this is an incredible way to operate contact-free, encourage people to
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:07.840]   shop local, communicate with customers and teammates while working from home. Small businesses need
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:12.560]   to stay connected with their customers. Actually, I won't name the... There's an ice cream shop in
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:19.200]   town that uses podium, and I get coupons. It's very effective in my text saying, "Hey, you could save
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:26.000]   20% right now. Come on in." You can ask for reviews. You can send a text that makes it very easy for
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   your customers to leave. An online review, this is a huge tool for small businesses, for local
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.440]   businesses, improving their search rankings. Here's something you should know. 98% of all text
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:42.480]   messages get opened. There is no other way you could communicate with people that with a higher
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:47.680]   response rate. Phone calls, nobody answers the phone anymore. Even email, no more than 20%.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:54.960]   Text messages get opened. They're welcome. You could put it on your website, podium, web chat,
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:58.800]   let's website visitors, text with your team right from your homepage. Your team will love it
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:03.040]   because they don't have to be sitting anywhere to get those texts. It actually comes to their phone.
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:08.080]   So no matter where they are, they can interact with customers. If you're like me, many small
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:14.320]   businesses, owner, operator, this is gold. These are the customers you most want to keep.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:20.720]   podium video chat lets you meet with customers. podium supports payments so you can get paid fast
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:28.400]   over text. So if I can pay that for that bagel, go in and get it, get my dozen bagels,
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:35.680]   all in one text message, that's awesome. podium is quick to set up. You can be onboarded
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:39.680]   within a day. They've got a great team in place. I was, like I said, talking to the
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:44.160]   wonderful people. They can answer any questions, walk you through everything. Let me give you some
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:52.160]   examples from some local businesses that have benefited the bridal collection. Lynn,
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:56.720]   who's the owner of the bridal collection, we don't have to take credit cards in the store anymore.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:02.320]   We can do it completely remotely. They've processed over $200,000 in no contact payments.
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:09.280]   podium, she says, has been a godsend for us in this journey. America's car mart
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:16.320]   collected 21,000 leads through web chat before podium says TJ, who's in charge of digital experience
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:21.520]   at America's car and mart before podium, we had a contact us form. Could be days before anybody got
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:27.200]   back to that customer. Now, thanks to podium and this text messaging, our response time has been
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:36.320]   cut down to minutes. Great for a medical office. Remind your customers, they've got appointments.
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:40.320]   They can make appointments through the text messaging and then you're going to get reviews,
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:46.720]   South Tampa family and cosmetic dentistry. Perfect example. As the customer walks out the door,
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:51.600]   hey, I hope you had a great experience. Would you mind leaving us a review here? And they walk you
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:58.800]   through the review. It's very quick. That's how they got 1200 reviews, averaging 4.9 stars. Dr.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:04.080]   Wyatt, the dentist there said the number of walk-ins is a result of our reviews is skyrocketed
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:08.800]   before we were seeing 50 to 100 new patients a month. Now we're seeing closer to 200.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:13.920]   This really works. The problem is it does so many things. It's hard to explain. I want you to go

[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:09.440]   Did you see the information article Facebook is going to make a smart watch next year?
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:16.560]   There's this battle going on and I don't know how serious it is, but I really do feel like
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:24.160]   there's a battle between Facebook and Apple. Facebook's taken out full-page ads and major newspapers
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:27.920]   saying Apple's, they're smart. They're not saying Apple's trying to screw us
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:33.760]   with their app tracking technology, but they're saying Apple's trying to screw small business
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:41.920]   and us with ATT. And I think that this is almost like, remember the old days with Steve Jobs going
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:46.640]   after Google or Adobe? This is almost like that with Mark Zuckerberg saying, "Ah, I'm in a..."
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:52.080]   So Facebook, according to the information and four people with knowledge of the product,
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:59.040]   is planning to do a smart watch. I'm not wearing a Facebook smart watch. That sounds,
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:10.160]   that sounds like a recipe for incredible spying, but they see this as a way to kind of,
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:17.440]   I think they want to end around, frankly, they want to end around Apple. It would use an open-source
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:21.760]   version of Google's Android software, which makes it very easy for them to develop.
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:29.920]   I don't know if it'd be as expensive as an Apple smartwatch or even as a Fitbit,
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:38.400]   I imagine Facebook would subsidize it. This continues to always be the same thing also with Amazon
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:44.640]   is we're all paying for the fact that they were never able to make a phone. They're trying to find
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:53.120]   all the orthogonal ways to get that information. Or to be a little, I don't know, whatever towards
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:58.880]   them to have security, to have a platform, it's platform and security.
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:04.480]   They can't take that away from me. That makes sense.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:10.640]   I see two parts here. The first part is, Facebook wants something to leverage against Apple,
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:16.480]   because they see the coming battle with Apple. Now it's still shots across the bow, but eventually
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:19.680]   those two giants are going to go at each other because they both want the same thing.
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:25.680]   Apple really wants a view into customer habits that Facebook wants, and
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:30.960]   Facebook wants the screens that Apple has. That's one side. I'm not too concerned about that.
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:36.080]   What I'm concerned about is the other part, which is in many parts of the world, maybe not the
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:40.480]   United States, but definitely in Asia, definitely in Africa and parts of Europe,
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:46.960]   Facebook is the Internet. There's no Internet that has Facebook. They get the Internet through
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:53.280]   Facebook. That was their Internet plan, wasn't it? India turned it down. They said, "We don't need
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:58.800]   more colonialism." But you're saying that it's already launched in other places in Africa.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:03.280]   Well, it's not the service. You might get your service, your connection to the
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:08.720]   Internet from someplace else. But people think of the Internet in terms of where is it on Facebook.
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:15.280]   I have, part of my job is to reach these people, and I have to be reminded constantly,
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:18.400]   because I am so anti-Facebook. I hate using the platform.
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:22.960]   Then I have my advisors who come in and say, "You don't understand. If it's not on Facebook,
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.680]   it is the platform." You won't get them.
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:33.360]   It is the Internet. This is the Internet.org by Facebook, which is terrifying to me.
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:40.800]   It's brilliant. If you're Facebook, there are lots of places in the world where you can't get
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:45.440]   the Internet or it's so expensive, you can't afford the Internet that they basically offer
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:51.040]   free. I'm going to put Internet in air quotes here, because as you said, Robert, there's some
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:57.680]   stuff like Wikipedia, but really it's Facebook. It's a way to get Facebook onto these smartphones
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:03.040]   all over the world. Let me just, I'm just not curious. I see they have their mission statement.
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:08.480]   The Internet is essential to growing the knowledge we have and sharing it with others.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:12.720]   For many of us, it's a huge part of everyday lives. Most of the world does not have access
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:17.920]   to the Internet.org is a Facebook-led initiative with the goal of bringing Internet access
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:21.920]   and the benefits of connectivity to the portion of the world that doesn't happen. That seems all
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:29.680]   well and good. India said no, because they said, "We have plenty of experience with colonialism.
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:35.920]   Thanks. We've shaken off the yoke of our British overlords. We're not about to accept Mark Zuckerberg,
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:43.920]   as our new overlord." Interesting. This is the Wall Street Journal article,
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:50.720]   which I think is a little manufactured. Facebook meets Apple in a clash of the tech
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:58.560]   titans. We need to inflict pain. It's got a picture of Tim Cook with a smoking pointing finger emoji
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:06.160]   shooting at Mark Zuckerberg with a smoking-like emoji or thumbs up emoji. Maybe that's the
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:12.640]   poke emoji. I don't know. First of all, I don't think it's Mark Zuckerberg versus Tim Cook.
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:17.200]   That makes for good copy in a newspaper, but I don't think it's that personal.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:26.640]   Also, this quote they use from Mark Zuckerberg, "We need to inflict pain," something he told his team,
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:34.400]   but it comes from 2018. It's not breaking news here. That's clickbait. It seems to me.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:40.160]   Although it's... It seems like this is more towards Google than Apple getting into space when you
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:45.120]   think about the acquisition and how Google has pledged that they will not sell that data for
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:51.440]   advertising. I'm guessing Facebook will not have such a restriction. Being able to tap into people's
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:57.920]   health information for advertising is something that's extremely advantageous for them,
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:02.240]   because you won't get that with Apple. You won't get that with Google. Facebook can fill in the gap
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:08.560]   for people advertisers looking to put money around health. You're absolutely right. The
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:14.320]   competition for Facebook is not Apple. Apple may be throwing speed bumps at Facebook,
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:19.520]   but that's not the competition. It's Google. If you combine Apple and Google,
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:26.000]   they dominate 90% of all online advertising. That's what I was saying about the...
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.520]   We're paying for the fact that we never bought a Facebook phone when they tried to launch one.
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:36.800]   Google always has their moonshots because they're like, "We know we're a one-trick pony of this
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:41.440]   advertising game. We need something else." If you think about Facebook's thing,
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:47.600]   remember, Steve Jobs famously said he doesn't like working through orifices, which he met the
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:54.720]   telecom companies. Facebook has had to go through two orifices this entire time, which is Apple and
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:52:03.520]   Google. When you see Facebook investing $2 billion to buy Oculus, because VR or control labs,
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:09.680]   they spent $1 billion on that. That's a brain computer interface thing. Zuckerberg,
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:15.280]   he's tired of going through these orifices. He wants his own platform. You could say Facebook
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:19.680]   is a platform, except for the fact that he has to go through Apple, he has to go through iOS and
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:25.520]   Android to get to you. That's always what they're thinking. His moonshot is like, "I need the next,
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:32.000]   whatever the next computing platform is, I need to own that." That's why he owns, as you said,
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   Quest, Oculus Quest. You have to have a Facebook... That's one of the reasons I don't own an Oculus
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:43.280]   Quest because you have to have a Facebook account to use it. Everything you do on that device is
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:48.000]   immediately piped into Facebook. It's interesting because I think people are becoming more aware of
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:53.760]   this. This is probably where Facebook's really worried about Apple. Once Apple started showing
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:53:01.040]   the privacy information about WhatsApp, millions of people left WhatsApp and went to Signal and
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:11.440]   Telegram. You know how many times I've had to explain here to priests and bishops and cardinals
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:18.000]   why they should care about that. It always comes down to, "But everyone I know is on WhatsApp."
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:23.680]   Even when we've sat down and have great conversations about, "Well, this is what it means. These are
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:28.240]   the privacy concerns. It's not just about you. It's about the people you're connected to. You're
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:34.560]   potentially becoming a security risk for them." Even then, they say, "Okay, well, I'll download
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:38.320]   Signal, but I'm still going to use WhatsApp." It is so specific.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:45.040]   Everybody I want to talk to is. Facebook has done amazingly. They have rebuilt
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:50.000]   the old AOL walled garden except they've done it without walls. They've created a
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:56.400]   platform, a virtual platform, just a combination of services that is so sticky, that is so addictive
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:54:02.640]   that once you're in it, you really have no reason to go out. Even if someone explains to you all the
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:10.160]   reasons why it's so bad, everything that you want is in there. That's why I say that in many places,
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:14.880]   Facebook is the Internet. It doesn't matter what else you have. Everything they want is there.
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:21.680]   Wesley, do you use Facebook? Absolutely.
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:25.840]   Do you use WhatsApp?
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:28.480]   No, not as much.
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:35.760]   Used in the US because we historically just didn't adopt it the way. Do you use Facebook Messenger?
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.760]   Yes.
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:47.520]   I'm not concerned as much about the security and reasons of not using it because I'm careful,
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:52.560]   as careful as it can be. There's also a little bit of safety in numbers.
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:55:00.560]   If there's a compromise, there will be a big stink and hopefully it will be cleared up pretty
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:05.760]   quickly. But a lot of my friends and family who aren't Aztec Savvy are still on the platforms.
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:13.600]   And it's almost a universal connector if I need to talk to someone. I might not have their new
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:19.200]   number. They may not be on Twitter, but you know your connection on Facebook, I know I can go there
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:25.120]   to send them a message, which is just really efficient. If there was a way to decouple
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:33.840]   kind of like a Windows phone, all of that into its own Rolodex, I wish that that was a thing that
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:40.160]   we could make portable. But right now, there's no good alternatives to unify all the people that
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:44.560]   I know from various networks. And I really don't want to lose touch with all those people.
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:52.320]   What would you say, Wesley, to Congress, the FTC, the federal government that's looking at ways to
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:58.320]   kind of rein in the big tech companies and Facebook in particular is a big, long
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:05.280]   indictment of Facebook? Do you think that that's a good thing? That maybe that's the solution is to get
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:06.560]   regulation?
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:22.160]   I've been thinking about this. And I think on balance, no. Because social networks,
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:30.880]   like I mentioned, if there was a data breach, if people find out that there's enough public pressure
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:39.680]   to get people to change and to make movements to make those changes. And if, for instance,
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:46.240]   if there is a large company that is being regulated by the government and they're being handcuffed,
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:52.400]   then a smaller company will step into that place who doesn't have those same restrictions
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:58.720]   until they get big. And then they fall into those regulations and then they get
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:02.480]   capped at a certain amount of people. And then another one, it'll just be a wave
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:07.120]   where we all have to keep switching over to different networks in order to find the one where
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:11.600]   everyone has migrated to. I think the best thing that the government can do,
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:22.800]   and this is an extremely unpopular opinion, but to allow some sort of public option
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:31.760]   for some of these tech solutions. I agree 100%, but I have a suggestion in
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:39.040]   an apostle solution that's coming from Jack Dorsey. He's suggesting he's working on,
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:47.920]   he's looking at ways to create a decentralized Twitter. And they call it blue sky. They've been
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:55.040]   doing hiring around this. There was an article in the Verge this week. Twitter's Jack Dorsey
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:58:00.160]   wants to build an app store for social media algorithms. Now I'm reading a little bit into
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:06.000]   what Dorsey has said and what the plans are. But what if, and this also comes from other people
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:12.320]   who have suggested what you need to do, what Facebook needs to do is open their APIs.
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:19.680]   But what if instead of a monolithic silo of information called Twitter, called YouTube,
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:26.640]   called Facebook, these were federated networks where there were many Facebooks and you could
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:30.720]   come, it wouldn't hurt your ability to talk to your family members or your friends,
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:36.640]   because they would be connected through the federation. They could be in Facebook South or
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:41.520]   Facebook West or Facebook East or whatever you call it, Facebook green, Facebook blue.
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:46.960]   There's their Facebook with people, you know, with maybe communities of interest,
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:52.000]   but you can federate so that you can communicate across these barriers. And in fact, eliminating
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:58.960]   the walls that divide these. The question of course is, well, why would anybody, why would Facebook,
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:05.440]   Twitter or Google do this? Because they make their money by being the unique one and only place to
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:10.160]   go. In fact, Twitter is continually moved towards pushing people away from third party apps towards
[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:17.120]   websites. But I'm hopeful that maybe Dorsey sees this as a way forward, especially given the
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:25.120]   threat of regulation from the government. He says we could make money selling our unique
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:32.480]   algorithm. So there's a pool of information owned by a lot of people on a lot of sites.
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:38.960]   What he wants to do is build an app store that is, and maybe other people have apps in there too,
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:44.160]   that says, here's Wesley's app for following the most interesting stories on the
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:50.800]   giant universe of Twitter information. This is where I'm going to gloat a little bit.
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:57.520]   The last time I was on Twitch, you suggested this. This was my, I called it the Tom Hanks algorithm
[00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:03.360]   or whatever nice guy algorithm. Yes. This is, this is my idea. And this is not the first time
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:07.760]   that I've made a prediction on Twitter and this come true. I talked about when the iPad came out,
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:14.560]   how that is going to be. I'm going to keep track of this platform for the next, the ARM base max.
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:21.120]   And it came true. I'm just saying that. So you like this idea? This is a winning idea. You invented
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:28.640]   it. Yeah. Absolutely. Can I play devil's advocate? Okay. All right. So obviously, I love that idea.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:33.200]   I love the idea of a federation. I love the idea of companies doing something that's good for society.
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:37.680]   But unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to legislate.
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:44.480]   Telling a company, you can make less money. You can't do it. No, no. And that's why I'm
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:49.040]   encouraged that Twitter is saying we want to do it. What's interesting is they're saying,
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:54.080]   I think in the response to the heat they've gotten with Section 230 reform and big tech
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:59.440]   investigations, I don't think they would go willingly. But I'm going to quote from the Verge article,
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:05.120]   Dorsey C's decentralization is a way to quote, address some of the problems around Section 230.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:13.040]   Twitter's been working on this for a year. This is there. I agree. You can't force or
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:16.960]   probably could force, but maybe it wouldn't be ideal to force a company to do something that's
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:22.960]   against their financial interest. But if he thinks he can find a way to monetize,
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:32.880]   I think you solve a lot of the problems that we'd have. And you know what? If you want to be a
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:40.880]   Nazi, you can go and use Nazi Facebook. And it takes the pressure off of Zuckerberg to find the
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:46.240]   Nazis. And if I don't want to see any of that stuff, I don't have to include them in my
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:54.640]   field, right? We can't shut up Nazis. We can't shut them up. We're seeing this as a tech problem.
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:02:01.680]   We're seeing that big tech has a problem with splitting other services. It's not a tech problem.
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:06.320]   This is a financial problem. The big tech giants are running by the financial rules.
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:11.040]   You have to show results every single quarter. The way that you do that is you make agreements
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:15.280]   with other networks in order to maximize the profits and the stickiness of your platform.
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:20.400]   So unless you change that and you change it so that I don't have to be looking over my shoulder
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:26.080]   every quarter, because I need to show quarter over quarter growth, then no tech company is going to
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:29.920]   take this seriously. They'll pay it lip service. They'll probably give a couple of executives to
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:34.080]   sit on a board to talk about it. But then when it comes down to quarterly earnings, they're going
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:39.440]   to say, I can't open up my algorithms to you because of course, that's what makes me special.
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:44.800]   But that's what Jack saying though is we have special algorithms and we think they're a value.
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:49.200]   And if we offer them for sale, that's where we make our mind because right now,
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:53.280]   Twitter doesn't charge anything. But what if Twitter charges five bucks a month to use that
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:59.600]   special secret sauce that Twitter has? And I got this amazing feed from the giant pool of information.
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:05.840]   Wouldn't they make money? Like I was saying, there needs to be a public option. There's going
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:13.360]   to be a USP version for us to store our data. If we like California's laws, we can choose to
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:19.520]   have it stored there. If we like Texas's laws, store it there, but have a government place
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:28.000]   that allows us not to participate in a Facebook, a Google or whatever, Twitter's way of communicating
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:35.120]   and storing information. If we want to say, just make sure that, hey, this will not be used and it's
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:42.400]   under the protection of the US government and we can pay them to store this, to do that as a
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:51.680]   public service, especially if we're talking about like e-records for health records. If we want
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:57.200]   to have that stored in a place that we don't want ever to have a question that it might be either
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:02.560]   compromised or used in a way that we didn't predict, we need some sort of... We need controls.
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:10.160]   If government wants to regulate something, regulate that new entity that they create,
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:15.520]   saying we will regulate this and this is what we'll guarantee will never happen.
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:20.720]   People don't trust government anymore. It might be at this point, Mark Zuckerberg is more trusted
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:24.960]   than the US Congress. I'm not saying be the only option. I'm saying just provide like
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:30.320]   option. People can still do whatever they want, tech can still do whatever they want, but if
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.440]   someone doesn't want to participate, there are no other options. It might be a good business for
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:40.400]   the post office to get into. Brian, do you think that Jack Dorsey is sincere in this thing he's
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:47.120]   floating this blue sky? It's federated Twitter. It's funny, Leo, you have pushed me tonight to be
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:53.280]   the one that stood up for crypto and Bitcoin, which I don't necessarily. Now I'm going to be the one
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:05:01.520]   that says this is 100% cynical because the irony is especially the social networking companies,
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:06.240]   but a lot of these big tech companies have made their billions and trillions of dollars
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:14.800]   by throwing fencing around the open web. Essentially what Jack is arguing and Zuckerberg said to
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:19.440]   Congress, please regulate us. We don't want to make these decisions. If you hadn't created these
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:24.320]   wall gardens around the free and open internet, you wouldn't have these section 230 problems.
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:29.760]   Essentially what they're trying to craft is a cover your ass way out of this, where,
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:35.600]   as a perfect example, it's podcasting. There have been articles recently about how do you
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:43.520]   deal with the Nazi podcasts that are out there? You can't because RSS is a free and open protocol.
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:48.960]   You can't. Apple, you might say Apple, you should not list certain podcasts in your
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:54.080]   directory. That's fine. The only reason it's an issue is because people want to put up silos
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:59.600]   around it like Spotify. I'm being cynical because I'm saying that's all Jack's doing here.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:03.200]   If they can create some sort of system where it's like, no, no, no, this is a,
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:07.200]   we're going back to free and open protocols. And yes, we have our special sauce on ours over here,
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:13.200]   but you can't yell at us for all the other Nazis. Yeah, exactly.
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:17.600]   Yeah. No, I think you're right. You know what this is? This is Twitter's version of Facebook
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:23.840]   diaspora. Yeah. This is this is saying, Oh, look, we tried to make something. But Facebook didn't do
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:29.280]   diaspora. That was designed to compete against Facebook, right? Right. But they released some
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:36.560]   of their information so that a could do it. Okay. And I mean, yeah, it gave, it gave Facebook some
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:40.960]   some coverage. They could say, look, we tried to encourage competition and it didn't take this.
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:45.120]   This will be the exact same thing. People should really remember is that these companies are so
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:51.680]   big and so profitable and so powerful at this point that a lot of what they propose, which protects
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:59.600]   them, but doesn't really hurt them will ultimately only hurt any upstarts. It will only hurt anybody
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:04.400]   else who wants to get into the business. They are now so entrenched that it's not going to affect
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:09.520]   them. And so they can, it's easy for them to propose solutions that maybe hurt them a little bit.
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:15.120]   Well, and one more thing to point out, Leo, not to be mean to Twitter here, but they're the worst
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:20.240]   run of these companies. That's right. Their revenues are infinitesimal. Well, that's
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:23.600]   hard to face. But that's why I think they might do it because they don't have a successful
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:27.520]   monetization strategy. Right. So it doesn't, it's no skin off of Jackson knows if you know,
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:32.640]   we could, we maybe he can make more money because he's not making us, but not doing that well.
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:37.440]   Anyway, yeah, that's right. So yeah, why not try this? Speaking of the public option, which,
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:41.840]   and I love that phrase, Wesley, I got to give you a credit for that. You know that Tim Berners
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:47.360]   Lee, the inventor of the worldwide web is actually proposed such a such a thing. It's not exactly
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:51.680]   a public option, but the idea that people should control their own data that he's got a startup
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:08:02.160]   called inrupt, I N R U P T. And the idea is to create a data silo that you control you own.
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:08.800]   That's yours that you then have. And you know, maybe it is the US Postal Service that runs the US
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:18.640]   version of this. Actually, Tim's concept is called solid a technology for organizing data
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:24.480]   applications and identities on the web. And that's the key. I don't, you know, this is so blue sky,
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:28.160]   and it's so hard for people to understand, but basically you create your own data pod.
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:35.120]   And then you have apps that can access from data from your data pod, but have to get permission.
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:41.680]   And then it can be shared with others, but only with your permission, you control which apps
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:47.440]   access your data. And yeah, maybe the postal, maybe I'll have instead of a postal box, I'll have a
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:55.840]   postal pod. But there's there's no guarantee this will be around forever. No, if this is
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:03.280]   somehow not financially viable, it'll die. And we see that with the other postal carriers like
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:09.600]   USPS, I'm sorry, like UPS FedEx, and rural, where it doesn't seem like it makes financial sense to
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:15.120]   have service there. Yeah, so it's some sort of backing by government entity that can guarantee
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:22.880]   that everyone has access to this. I agree. Let's take a little break. Wesley Faulkner's here.
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:29.120]   Father Robert Balisaire, Brian McCullough. It's good to have all three of you are
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:34.400]   showed today brought to you by my mattress as a happy Casper customer. In fact, I just bought
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:40.720]   a Casper for my daughter, celebrate her new apartment, got her the whole kit. I got her the
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:46.880]   frame, the box spring, they call it a foundation. The mattress, I got the sheets, I got the pillows.
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:52.160]   She's all said was less than a thousand bucks to set her up completely. She says, and I quote,
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:58.640]   this is the best mattress I've ever had. Dad, thank you. Casper is fantastic. Here I am with my
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:04.480]   Casper. This is my new Casper King size mattress. Look at that surprisingly compact box.
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:10.160]   That's another reason that I think it's a great choice for people starting out. It's easy to get
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:15.600]   upstairs. It's easy to move yourself. Best part is you get 100 nights to try it. If at any point,
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:21.040]   in your first 100 nights, you're not exactly happy. You're not thrilled with your Casper mattress.
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:26.560]   You can refund every penny. They'll come and get it. You don't have to fit it back in that box.
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:32.480]   But let me tell you, they can do that because they're the best mattresses ever. Casper is cool,
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:38.960]   supportive mattress is beautiful, super soft bedding. This is the year you should sleep better.
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:46.560]   Rest harder, sleep smarter with Casper. There's only Casper mattresses are made with 86
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:51.600]   supportive gel pods to align your spine, to eliminate aches and pains. It's the supportive
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:57.360]   comfort you need to wake up refreshed. Ready to go all year long. Look, even Sammy the cat loves
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:01.760]   our Casper. She sleeps on it every night. Get the wave hybrid. That's perfect for people with aches
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:06.400]   and pains and want to mattress with maximum support. As with all Casper mattresses,
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:11.520]   it sleeps cool. We know that's really important for a good night's sleep. For the most plush mattress,
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:16.320]   check out the Nova Hybrid for a plush feel that doesn't sacrifice support or the most popular
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:20.640]   original mattress. That's what I gave Abby, the one for sleepers who want both support and cooling.
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:29.200]   And I must say I will not go to bed without my original Casper pillow. King size. I love it
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:34.000]   made with a unique pillow and pillow design that's soft on the outside. Supportive on the inside for
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.560]   all night comfort. Casper makes everything you need to refresh your whole bedroom this year from
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:46.640]   their super soft percale sheets to their all season down duvets to their cozy calming weighted blanket.
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:54.800]   As sleep is so important, it really is to your state of mind, your well-being, your health.
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:12:01.600]   Don't sell yourself short. The good news is Casper is affordable. And as always,

[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:33.120]   your Casper. Everybody in my family loves their Casper. I think Father Robert needs a Casper and
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:41.920]   his little cell there in Vatican City. Casper, yes, I can only imagine. Hey, does not make the best
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:51.920]   mattresses. I'm just saying Casper, C-A-S-P-E-R.com/twit1. You're not a monk in a cell. You get to have a
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:57.120]   nice mattress, Casper.com/twit1. Don't forget the offer code "twit1" to save $100.
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:08.560]   Back we go. I was just curious, does that thirst trap of a Casper ad fly in Vatican?
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:18.160]   Well, look, the mattress I have was actually homemade. It's not a mass manufactured mattress.
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:23.920]   It's like a sack that stuff has been. Do the nuns make those for you? I have no idea who made
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:30.960]   them, but it's not good. It's really not good. But you can't complain, can you? You can't say,
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:38.880]   "Hey, can I get a Casper? What you can do is you could wait for someone to die and then quickly
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:44.720]   run to their room and take her to the house." That's awful. Oh my gosh.
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:52.240]   But you know what? I'm going to say this because I know it's true. You love your work. You love what
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:58.880]   you do. I do. I do. It's not a sacrifice. This is something that this is your calling. I think
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:03.600]   that's a great thing. We know that. I like to complain too, and it gives me something to complain
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:11.200]   about. It's a joke. We have some fun. Exactly. Let's see. Where else should we go?
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:16.480]   Apple is not going to do a deal with Hyundai. They are going to do a deal with Kia. They're
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:21.280]   not going to do a deal with Kia. Brian, you must have gone crazy covering this story over the last
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:28.000]   couple of weeks. It is. Between that, I'll tell you what's been happening these last couple of
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:33.280]   weeks is that I keep calling it smoke around fires. All of a sudden, there was a lot of
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:40.080]   smoke around the car. Then that got tamped down and they replaced it with smoke around the ARVR.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:48.400]   AR glasses. Yeah. Right now, the state of play, as of whatever time it is tonight,
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:56.560]   February 14th, there's more smoke around the ARVR thing. My take on the Hyundai thing is,
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:04.560]   I don't know Hyundai is a company, but it felt to me like they were slapped down by Apple for
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:10.320]   stuff getting out. That's what I thought. I would not be shocked at all if maybe not this
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:15.680]   month, but sometimes soon we see this deal announced. The first thing was Hyundai said,
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:20.400]   "Hey, we're talking to Apple." As soon as I saw that, Chills went down my spine, I thought,
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:27.040]   "Oh, this is not going to end well." Apple doesn't want you to say in that. It turned off three hours
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:32.880]   later. Forget we said that. I'm sure talking with everybody. We don't.
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:40.880]   Then a week or two later, Kia, which is a Hyundai subsidiary, and by the way, Hyundai has a very
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:48.320]   good EV platform. They've just announced some really nice design that would be very nice for
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:56.240]   an Apple car, but Kia, which has a factory in Georgia, which is whoever, if Apple's doing a car,
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:01.040]   whoever they work with has to have the ability to make 100,000 cars a year, that's the goal.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:05.600]   Let me give you three arguments in favor of this possibly going through.
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:14.320]   Apparently, they have a lot of capacity there. This would make sense because I read an article
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:18.320]   once where they're like, "Well, but Hyundai is this company that doesn't like to... We're not
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:22.400]   going to manufacture cars for some other company. We're an insular, but at the same time,
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:27.200]   that's not what they're asking you to do." Apple's saying, "Hey, you've got some spare capacity
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:32.560]   over here. Let's do this." Number two, and I got a credit M.G. Seagler for this one,
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:39.440]   but it kind of sounds like when Apple made the deal with Singular for the iPhone,
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:45.680]   which is they're not going to Tesla. They're not going to Mercedes. They're kind of going to
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:52.160]   somebody that maybe is a little hungry. That might be willing to be like, "Okay, it's your Apple car.
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:57.040]   We'll just manufacture it to your specs." We're fine with that because we're hungry.
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:02.160]   The number three, what you just mentioned about their platform, what you got to understand about
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:09.120]   their EV platform is because with these electric vehicles, you don't have all of the moving parts,
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:15.280]   the drive, train, all this stuff. These platforms, as you're calling them, are essentially the term
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:21.040]   for it is a skateboard. Essentially, it's just the battery and the wheels and whatever.
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:26.000]   Then you're able to do anything you want on top of it, and you can go crazy. That's one of the
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.640]   things I've done stories on this where people are talking about how car design is going to go
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:35.200]   crazy because if you get on one of these platforms, if you're Apple who loves to design,
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:40.560]   and Hyundai Kia has this skateboard platform that you can basically have cart blanche to do
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:45.280]   with whatever you want with, I can see that that would be very attractive to an Apple if they
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:50.000]   really are going to do a car. I agree. When I saw the Kia story, I said, "That makes a complete sense
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:58.560]   they've already got their plan to build 23 models on this single skateboard. It's got a huge range.
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:05.120]   It's really got some nice features, 300 mile range, 500 kilometers, which is about the same,
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:11.520]   on a single charge, fast charging. There's a lot of good. This is a very state-of-the-art
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:17.600]   skateboard. It's perfect for Apple. Whether Apple's going to do a car or an AR,
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:24.400]   Glasses is unknown. It's also important to point out that Apple, like any company,
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:28.080]   is developing a lot of different potential products. It doesn't mean they'll make it to market.
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:39.600]   Can I ask a question? I get why you'd want a car as a status symbol, but Apple is used to such
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:44.240]   high margins on their products. It won't be a cheap car, Father Robert. It's not going to be a cheap
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:49.920]   car, but you're not going to sell anywhere near the number of cars as you would iPads or
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:55.280]   wattens. What's in it for them? Other than the cache of being able to say,
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:59.760]   "We're also a car company." Most car companies don't make a lot of money.
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:05.280]   No. It's historically difficult business, isn't it? We had to bail out the big three.
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:12.640]   I did a whole episode on this. It makes sense if you look at it from this perspective. Yes,
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:20.400]   car companies usually have around 3% margins in the best of times. The best run car company in
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:27.680]   the world, Toyota, has 6% margins. That's nowhere. That's nothing. However, if you're Apple and
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:34.640]   you're rounding $2.5 trillion or whatever it is in market cap, the only way that you can move the needle
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:42.160]   to Wall Street is other large number of things. They have currently the best business in the world,
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:48.800]   which is selling $1,000 pocket computers to people every couple years. The previous best business
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:55.200]   in the world was selling people $30, $40, $50,000 vehicles every seven years, every household
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:20:02.480]   in the developed world. I'm not going to get the numbers exactly right, but the thing that I did in
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:08.240]   that segment was I quoted from some analysts that said, the transportation market, if you look at
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:13.840]   it as the global transportation market is something like $20 trillion or whatever.
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:21.520]   If all Apple does is come in at the top end even and get 2% of that, that's 10 times the size of the
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:31.920]   current iPhone business in terms of revenue. What else can Apple do that would be 10 times the size
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:37.920]   of the current iPhone business? Also, I agree with you. I would throw in another thing is
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:44.160]   to understand what Apple's business really is, because it isn't making computers, they even took
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:53.120]   computer out of the name. It isn't making pocket computers, it's not making health watches.
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:59.600]   I would submit, and I think Tim Cook has said things along this lines, that Apple is an
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:05.280]   experienced company. They're there to use digital technology to provide experiences for their
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:13.760]   customers. I think the real question to answer your question, Robert, is what is the future of
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:20.800]   personal ownership for automobiles? Honestly, I don't think in 10 or 20 years, you're going to
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:28.560]   see personal ownership of automobiles. A self-driving electric vehicle, if Apple were to make one,
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:35.360]   I don't think they're really going to be making one for you and me to buy. They might be making
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:44.160]   a business like Uber, where you get in the Apple car, a call on Apple car comes and gets you.
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:49.600]   And once you're inside, the experience is phenomenal. The music, the furniture,
[01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:53.840]   it's comfortable, it's got a little incense burner or whatever. I don't know what the
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:59.680]   experience is going to be, but that's what Apple would offer. I think that it's probably,
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:06.320]   you made a good argument, Brian, that maybe it is a good business to get into. But honestly,
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:11.920]   do you think in the next 10, 20 years, personal ownership of vehicles is a good business to get
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:19.520]   into? No, absolutely not. However, two counter arguments to that is, number one, what is Apple's
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:24.480]   current growth strategy? It's services. So if you have an all-in-class thing,
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:29.040]   I would rephrase that to its experiences, which is the same idea.
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:35.680]   If I'm paying an all-encompassing Apple subscription every month for my entertainment
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:44.400]   and my transportation and my computer and my X, Y, and Z, then yes, you have an entire all-encompeting
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:50.640]   Apple lifestyle. Thank you. But number two, and don't forget this, this comes back to the
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:55.200]   iPhone thing, what does Apple love to do? Go into a product category where there is deep
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:23:01.520]   consumer dissatisfaction. Again, analogy of when they entered the phone market, right?
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:09.680]   They love to go in and provide an experience, a product experience that you and I can't even
[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:16.720]   conceive of because we're so beaten down by the status quo. You can never get any better than this
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:23.520]   and it sucks. Another thing is, there's a story on the rundown about shortcoming
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:29.680]   computer chips to make cars. If you think about cars themselves, they are a platform for technology.
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:34.160]   You talk about the conversations about that. That's interesting. Talking about cars are using
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:40.880]   5G for navigation. We're talking about computer vision. We're talking about all these technology
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:46.000]   cutting of things that are going to be going into cars. Cars are rolling computers.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:52.160]   What are all these things converging? Apple's got LIDAR and iPhones. Apple's doing their own
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:57.600]   silicon now, their own chips. They're doing these ARM-based chips that are good for things like
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:04.240]   self-driving and algorithms and AI and all these things. You can see a scenario where everything
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:09.840]   this would tie into the AR/VR headset. All of the work that they're doing on the car
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:16.000]   could potentially be, even if it never creates a car, money well spent in terms of R&D for all
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.760]   of the other things and vice versa, doing an AR headset and learning about LIDAR and cameras.
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:25.040]   That's a good point. They don't need to make a car. The learnings from making the car
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:30.160]   might be sufficient to power other businesses. One of Apple's core beliefs.
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:39.040]   One of Apple's core beliefs has always been to own the core IP. They did it with their computers,
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:42.640]   they did it with their phone, they've just had a massive shift over their own processors.
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:48.800]   They don't want to be beholden to any other company for the core components and technologies
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:57.040]   that go into their products. When I start to see a massive stockup of human resources on the Apple
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:02.960]   side for the supply chain that's required to build a car, that's when I'll actually start to
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:09.920]   believe the stories. They may be hiring a lot of engineers, they may be happening under the covers.
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:16.880]   Engineers are one thing, but the telltale for Apple are the people who do procurement,
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:22.000]   because that's what's made their margins so incredibly. That's why Kia could be very interesting.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.520]   Isn't that a big part of it? Wouldn't that be a big supply chain deal? They would be the Fox
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:30.480]   con for this. But I mean, that's relying on another company to do their their performance.
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:37.520]   Fox con makes all the iPhones. That's 100% Apple style. Apple designs the stuff.
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:41.040]   Apple tells you they don't even make the chips.
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:47.680]   You're going to pay four cents for that to do hickey than eight cents that you want.
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:52.400]   They don't actually produce any of the doohickeys. All of those have been farmed out.
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:54.640]   Now they've got factories in India, Vietnam, China, all of that.
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:57.600]   If they're serious about cars, they're going to have a car company.
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:05.120]   Probably have multiple. Why would you just go with Hyundai? In fact, maybe that's what we're seeing
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:09.200]   is that they're going to announce sometime this summer something deals with everyone,
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:14.080]   including Volkswagen and whoever. It's just that Hyundai was maybe a little.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:18.160]   They got to learn like Fox kind of keep your mouth shut until the deal is actually signed.
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:21.120]   I would. Yes, I know they're denying it. Kia is now denying it.
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:25.600]   We don't know if they're denying it because Tim Cook said, "If you don't deny it, you're not
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:29.680]   going to do the deal." We'll wait and see. I think it's very interesting to watch.
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:36.160]   I was speculating out loud, but what if Apple got into Uber? What if Apple made an Uber
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:41.760]   where they made the whole thing, the cars, everything? If they're self-driving,
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:45.920]   you don't have drivers. That'd be an interesting business. That feels like a few steps ahead.
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:53.520]   That's the market. They wait for adoption. They try to move over and to have a lot of consolidation.
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:57.360]   I want to ask you, because you are a big on clubhouse, I want to talk a little bit about
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:02.960]   clubhouse and find out whether this is just a flash in the pan, another social network that as
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:07.200]   soon as everybody else arrives, it's going to go downhill or if there is really some value there.
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:12.080]   And maybe you don't have an opinion, but I'm going to put it on you, because I'm in there too.
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:14.160]   Strong opinion.
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:14.960]   No, good.
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:17.200]   Don't say it.
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:17.600]   I'm a social I-
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:18.160]   Save it.
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:18.800]   Save it.
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:19.200]   Save it.
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:20.160]   That's a tease.
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:20.720]   That's a break.
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:24.560]   He has a strong opinion. What could it be? We'll find out.
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:32.400]   But first, we've got a little mini movie we want to play for you, representing the events of the
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:34.080]   past week here on Twitch.
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:39.200]   "Wistaman swallows the air pod while sleeping and does not realize it."
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:42.880]   That headline is just so beautifully fake for it, especially that it does not realize it.
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:45.040]   The battery is probably going to dine it in a week anyway.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:48.960]   "Previously, on Twitch, all about Android."
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:51.440]   Dummy is flexing its latest concept.
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:55.920]   It's got an 88 degree quad curved waterfall.
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:56.720]   Disflowing.
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:59.360]   It's got no physical buttons or ports.
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:00.560]   This is bananas.
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:05.360]   "TLC taught me that it is important that you don't go chasing waterfalls."
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:05.840]   True.
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:09.520]   This week in Enterprise Tech, it may sound like a plot of a new movie.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:14.080]   Someone broke into the computer system of a water treatment plan and tried to poison drinking
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:15.440]   water for Florida town.
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:17.040]   Rookie League mistake, right?
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:19.680]   There's probably reasons why they needed Team Bure.
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:23.360]   But there are ways to do what they did in a secure fashion.
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:24.400]   Security now.
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:30.240]   Following on the heels of this chrome news, Windows Defender thinks chrome is malware.
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:31.120]   Holy kind of is.
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:34.160]   I'm going to be completely wrong.
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:38.320]   This week in Google, John Wentzworth's making his own COVID-19 vaccine.
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:38.720]   OK.
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:42.560]   All the materials and equipment to make the vaccine cost about $1,000.
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:45.840]   The largest benefit you've been wasting your time trying to make sound.
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:46.560]   I'm going to do it.
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:47.760]   Yeah, I might do this.
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:49.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:53.360]   I mean, if you do it, just also make sure you get the vaccine later.
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:54.160]   "Twit.
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:55.280]   Still essential."
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:57.520]   What if I did this for the whole company, John?
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:28:58.560]   Would you all do it?
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:28:59.440]   That would be new.
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:00.080]   No.
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:01.920]   I think this would be a great story.
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:03.680]   "Concast Company."
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:06.800]   Vaccines its entire staff using homemade vaccine.
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:07.600]   Amen.
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:09.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:10.880]   John says, "I'm in."
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:12.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:15.200]   I think the vaccine is going to get a little bit easier to get.
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:17.760]   And my prediction is it's going to start ramping up.
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:20.000]   It's like a locomotive moving out of the station.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.480]   It's starting very slow, but I think it's going to ramp up.
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:24.320]   What's the situation in Italy, Father Robert?
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:25.760]   Are you able to get US?
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:26.960]   Sorry?
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:29.360]   You have no idea how much better you are doing in the US.
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:30.240]   And we are over here.
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.400]   It's so much easier for you to get.
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.880]   It will actually be easier for me to fly back to the station
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:37.200]   and get it there than the wait for it here.
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:41.760]   We just announced that they bought another 400 million doses.
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:44.000]   So I think we're going to be in pretty good shape
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:44.960]   in about six months.
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:45.600]   My prediction.
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:46.000]   I don't know.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.520]   I hope so.
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:49.360]   I hope so.
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:53.120]   "Our Show Today" brought to you by Melissa.
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:54.560]   "Did you know?"
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:56.800]   This is a suppressing stat.
[01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:59.200]   "You ever forget to check the data on the carton of milk
[01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:02.240]   and then you put it in your Cheerios and, oh, I'm not going to eat that?"
[01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:04.480]   Like milk.
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:06.960]   "Your customer data goes bad.
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:09.840]   About 30% of it every year."
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:11.440]   You wouldn't want to put that in your Cheerios.
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:12.560]   Let me tell you.
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:15.520]   "Melissa, make sure your data is accurate and current
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:18.320]   so you reach the right customers."
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:21.280]   They've been doing this for 35 years.
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:23.120]   Melissa does it all.
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:27.280]   "Adresses, emails, phone numbers, names,
[01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:28.960]   and it can do it in real time."
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:30.640]   So they have a very nice API.
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:35.040]   So you don't have to use it, but you could add this with the API.
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:37.920]   You could add this to your customer service portal,
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:41.600]   or your websites, and when customers are entering.
[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:43.280]   You know, how often is it?
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:44.160]   I do it all the time.
[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:46.080]   I accidentally transpose numbers on my address.
[01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:47.440]   Things like that.
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:48.880]   I don't get shipments.
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:50.080]   You want to correct all that stuff.
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.680]   And if you've ever been on a website
[01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:53.120]   where it gets corrected automatically,
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:55.280]   you're probably looking at Melissa.
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:57.840]   Melissa's global address verification service
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:02.320]   verifies the addresses for 240 plus countries and territories
[01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:03.840]   right at the point of entry.
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:07.360]   So you only get valid billing and shipping addresses
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:08.640]   in your systems.
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:11.120]   But you can also use Melissa after the fact
[01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:12.640]   because they have secure FTP.
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:15.040]   So you can upload an address list
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:19.440]   and have it cleansed and downloaded in no time at all.
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:20.800]   They've got all sorts of ways.
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:24.160]   On-prem, in the cloud, software as a service.
[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:27.360]   This is absolutely what you need
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:29.600]   to make sure you're reaching the right customers.
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:32.800]   You can even add customer demographic information to your records,
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:35.520]   public information like property and mortgage data,
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:38.080]   marital status, even social media handles.
[01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:41.600]   Really create a rich record of your customers
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:44.400]   so that you can serve them better.
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:48.240]   And don't worry, your data is always secure with Melissa.
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:51.680]   They constantly undergo independent security audits
[01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:54.480]   because they're absolutely committed to your data security,
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:56.800]   privacy, and compliance requirements.
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:59.600]   They have the utmost dedication to your security.
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:02.240]   They implement strong controls and safeguards.
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:05.680]   There's SOC2 compliant HIPAA GDPR compliance.
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:07.200]   So you never have to worry about that.
[01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:10.080]   That's why over 10,000 businesses trust Melissa,
[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:12.000]   the address experts.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000]   They're also doing a nice thing.
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.200]   During COVID-19, they're supporting qualifying essential workers
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:19.920]   in communities with free service for six months.
[01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:23.360]   You can apply online, see if your organization qualifies.
[01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:28.720]   There's no reason to put up with sour customer contact data
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:31.840]   when Melissa can clean it up on the way in.
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:33.440]   While you're storing it on the way out,
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:34.080]   they can do it all.
[01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:36.720]   Try Melissa's APIs in the developer portal right now.
[01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:37.280]   Very easy.
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:40.480]   You can log on, sign up and start playing in the API sandbox
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:42.560]   anytime of the day or night 24/7.
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:45.600]   And they'll even clean 1,000 records for free.
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:48.560]   Send them your most spoiled data.
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:49.920]   See what they can do with it.

[01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:57.760]   There's the log in.
[01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:00.160]   Welcome to it, Army to the developer portal.
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:01.440]   I think you're going to be impressed.
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:05.200]   Melissa.com/twit.
[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:08.400]   We thank Melissa so much for their support of this week in tech.
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:11.200]   We thank you for supporting this week in tech
[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:12.960]   by using that address they know you saw it here.
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:16.320]   Melissa.com/twit.
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:18.880]   So last week we were talking about clubhouse.
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:22.080]   During the show, I said, you know, there's a lot of,
[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:22.880]   it's really interesting.
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:25.840]   A lot of Chinese nationals on clubhouse.
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:28.640]   There are a lot of expats on clubhouse
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:30.160]   talking about the Chinese government.
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:32.000]   I said, it's just going to be a matter of time
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.160]   before the China shuts them down.
[01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:35.520]   During the show, they shut them down.
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:38.240]   I don't want to take any responsibility for this.
[01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:41.360]   I'm sure that they were planning to do it anyway.
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:45.520]   We've also learned that there may be some issues with clubhouse
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:49.360]   pinging China when you use clubhouse.
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:51.600]   Clubhouse stepped up when that happened and said,
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:54.240]   immediately we are doing everything we can to prevent
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:57.920]   any of our information getting to Chinese authorities.
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:01.040]   So don't worry about that.
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:05.520]   Whatever company they use for their tech or whatever,
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:09.040]   actually I should look it up, but I know that the stock ticker is API.
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:10.400]   Which one?
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:10.960]   Zagora.
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:11.120]   Yeah.
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:12.160]   A gore, right.
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:15.120]   And that's gone up like 100% over the last two weeks.
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:16.480]   But they're a Chinese company, right?
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:17.680]   Yeah.
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:21.440]   So that's, but I mean, well, that'll be interesting to watch.
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:25.040]   Clubhouse is well-funded.
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:27.920]   They're an Andreessen Horowitz company.
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:30.480]   And of course they've been used by Andreessen Horowitz
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:33.120]   to promote other Andreessen Horowitz investments,
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:36.080]   including Elon Musk has appeared there,
[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:37.920]   Mark Zuckerberg has appeared there,
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:40.160]   Wesley Faulkner has appeared there.
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:41.280]   I've even appeared there.
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:44.400]   I got to invite a few weeks ago from my Justine.
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:51.120]   I think it's very cool, but Wesley, I figure as soon as it's not invite only,
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:52.560]   it's just going to go right downhill.
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:53.680]   What do you think?
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:57.600]   I think the whole space is blowing up.
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:00.160]   There was an announcement just last week,
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:07.040]   a company called Quilt, which is a self-care, focused audio-social network.
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:09.120]   They got $3.5 million.
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:10.800]   They're--
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:11.760]   Is it for audio?
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:12.640]   Is it like a--
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:13.040]   Yes.
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:13.840]   Like Clubhouse.
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:15.200]   Just like Clubhouse.
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:17.200]   Just a Clubhouse offshoot.
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:21.360]   Facebook is supposedly building their version of Clubhouse.
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:24.080]   Twitter has spaces that there's a whole thing.
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:25.760]   Twitter's spaces coming out any day now, right?
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:27.360]   Yeah, it's not--
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:27.920]   I've been on a--
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:30.560]   I wouldn't be surprised if there's a LinkedIn Clubhouse equivalent
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:32.880]   by the type of people that are on the network.
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:34.240]   There's a lot of LinkedIners.
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:36.560]   People are trying to--
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:37.360]   Like, yeah.
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:40.640]   Is this the new stories?
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:42.480]   Like everybody's going to have these--
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:42.960]   What?
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:46.240]   They're so weird because it's audio, which it seems to--
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:47.680]   So what is the appeal, Wesley?
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:48.880]   It's explained to me.
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:50.560]   Here's the appeal.
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:56.240]   If you are a loud talker, if you take up a lot of space in a room--
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:57.920]   Why are you looking at me when you say that?
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:35:58.880]   Why do you look at me?
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:35:59.840]   Why?
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:02.640]   As you enter, I'm joking.
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:04.000]   I'm joking.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:09.600]   If you are able to stand out by showcasing your work,
[01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:10.480]   it's almost--
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:14.560]   If you think about the TikTok stars or the people who are really good at their craft,
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:16.960]   there's a medium to showcase that.
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:19.360]   And I think there's not an equivalent for audio.
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:21.920]   For video, you can do video effects.
[01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:28.000]   Audio, you're able to be a public speaker to the public.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:28.480]   Video--
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:29.440]   You can get a wider audience.
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:30.240]   Video's hard.
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:34.080]   To compete against a Marques Brownlee on YouTube,
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:39.600]   you've got to spend a lot of time and energy and be really talented to do it,
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:42.080]   whereas at Clubhouse, you just talk.
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:50.640]   You talk and you are able to react and you're able to get questions from the audience.
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:53.600]   You're able to exercise power about who's a moderator.
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:56.160]   It's very powerful.
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:57.760]   One of those things like--
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:01.040]   You know, I'm a developer advocate for daily.
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:07.280]   Our API is used for WebRTC, which has the component of video and audio.
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:12.320]   People-- We've been seeing huge influx of people trying to build their own audio-social network
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:13.360]   on our platform.
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:13.920]   Interesting.
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:14.720]   So I guess I should--
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:17.360]   We have to scramble to create these blog posts.
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:19.280]   I think we're coming out with one next week.
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:20.880]   The details how to do that.
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:23.760]   But it's-- I feel that that's probably going across the board.
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:26.400]   People-- Like I mentioned, quilt before.
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:31.120]   There's a huge space just like what we're talking about,
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:37.040]   where people are shoveling money into Bitcoin because they need to shovel money into a big
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:38.960]   bet that they think is going to explode.
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:40.320]   Audio is a big bet.
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:45.120]   It's going to blow up, not necessarily because people are clamoring for it.
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:47.280]   It's because people are trying to make it happen.
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:55.040]   So it may not be big because people want it, but it's going to be big because investors want it.
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:55.520]   I hate this.
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:57.760]   I've been doing audio for 45 years.
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:00.640]   Leo, can I--
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:03.440]   I don't want anybody else to get in this business.
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:03.920]   Don't.
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:04.240]   Well--
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:04.560]   Go ahead.
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:07.840]   This is the good point, is that audio is hard too.
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:10.000]   Doing a good podcast is hard too.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.120]   Being interesting to listen to is hard.
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:19.760]   This is not me humble bragging, but I've been on there since June,
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:22.880]   and it was-- I've gone through a period with it, right?
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:27.040]   Where back in June, there were 2,000 people on there and we all knew each other,
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:30.480]   and so it was cool and fun and interesting, and then I forgot about it.
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:32.880]   So when it blew up again last month,
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:38.400]   I go on and it's literally like LinkedIn or whatever.
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:40.080]   It's everybody trying to impress everybody else.
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:45.760]   It's everybody trying to-- I don't know-- get jobs and impress famous and rich people.
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:52.640]   However, so potentially, what I'm waiting to see is, is it you let everyone in,
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:56.000]   it's not invite only, and is it just everyone trying to shout as loud as possible?
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:01.520]   However, my wife who back in June, when she would listen in when I was on there,
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:05.760]   dismissed it as there's-- oh, there's just a bunch of tech people on there.
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:07.200]   This is not for me or whatever.
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:09.680]   She's an architect, and now she leaves it on.
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:15.920]   There are multiple architect rooms every single day, and she leaves it on in the background
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:21.600]   like it's talk radio that it's just sort of-- and then maybe she pipes in if she is so moved or whatever,
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:23.760]   but I don't know.
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:29.040]   It's either going to be the thing, like my experience where, oh my god, it's kind of gross,
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:31.760]   and I don't want to do this anymore, or it's going to be like my wife's,
[01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:35.360]   where it's like, I just find my niche, and I'm happy.
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:40.160]   They're going to have to solve the discovery issue, so it's easy to find the stuff that you're
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:45.200]   interested in, because when you just go and explore, you see a lot of bro stuff, and how to make a
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:49.520]   million in Bitcoin and stuff. The truth is, they don't have to fix anything.
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:50.880]   Like I would-- It's already?
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:54.160]   OK. There's competitors, they're fixing these problems.
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:58.800]   There are people who are coming out with niche communities just for one thing.
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:04.080]   There are ones that for protected people or people who get online harassment.
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:08.320]   There are going to be so many different ways that people are going to approach this problem.
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:13.120]   Unfortunately, I think this is the time where your first-to-market doesn't mean you're going to be
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:18.320]   the market-dominated leader. They're just going to expose all the problems that people are going
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:20.240]   to fix when they come out with their own competitor.
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:24.480]   So the issue-- it's not about clubhouse at all. It's about the medium.
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:26.320]   Yes.
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:27.360]   That's what you like about it.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:34.800]   Yes. One thing off-- I, unfortunately, my coworker and I had a conversation.
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:39.360]   I'm not an iOS user. I do not use a couple devices.
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:41.280]   Oh, this is iOS open right now.
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:42.160]   I have an iPad.
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:48.240]   So I put it on my iPad, and I am surprised that no one's complaining about the privacy
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:52.800]   that is required to run clubhouse. You want to sit down and invite?
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:54.800]   You have to grant it access to your contacts.
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:58.880]   People are starting to complain, yes. Or at least ask questions about that.
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:04.240]   Yeah. You want to subscribe to an event that's coming up in these access to your calendar.
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:05.120]   Oh, that's not good.
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:10.960]   Vanilla Ice was on it last week, and I was like, "Oh."
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:16.000]   But now, clubhouse has Vanilla Ice's phone number because someone had to send him an invite.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.360]   Now, when he signed up for clubhouse, he sent it to a friend of his,
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:26.080]   then they now have every famous person Vanilla Ice's connected to.
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:30.960]   Elon Musk and so on might have better security, but someone who's not necessarily tech-sigh of
[01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:36.640]   savvy, like I saw Gil King's on there, all of these people that are probably in their
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:40.640]   roledexes now uploaded to clubhouse.
[01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:41.600]   Use a burner number.
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:46.640]   Yeah. I tried that. So like I said, I signed up with my Google Voice number,
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:50.960]   and when I tried to send an invite to someone who was the only person in my context was that
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:58.080]   no one on my iPad, it said, "Hey, this is not a valid number to send something out on."
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:01.920]   So it needed a real number in order to send out invites.
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:05.680]   I see a lot of Solairs. Adrian Grenair is on there right now.
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:08.880]   I see a lot of celebrities on here. It's not at all unusual.
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:12.720]   I've been in a room with Oprah. That was back in the summer again, but there's every-
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:13.760]   See, that's-
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:18.800]   One of the- part of the appeal is just like in a room with Oprah,
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:21.760]   and they just having a conversation is pretty amazing.
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:28.480]   I've also learned- Now, I think that the opportunity is also great for creating-
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:33.120]   giving people a voice who don't normally have a voice. I've listened to a lot of interesting
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:38.320]   clubhouse conversations about China from expats and so forth.
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:44.800]   And I think learned a lot about the mistaken idea I had about, for instance, the Chinese
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:48.240]   Communist government versus the Chinese people, things like that.
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:52.080]   It's really great to hear the actual voices of actual people.
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:58.480]   Speaking of famous people, Mark Zuckerberg also was on clubhouse.
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:03.440]   And this goes back to my previous point that this will be copied. Someone will do it better.
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:05.680]   Maybe Mark.
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:06.240]   It's just going to die.
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:12.240]   It's not clubhouse, but you're saying that this medium has some staying power.
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:16.080]   What do you have to solve, Wesley, in your opinion, to make this work?
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:22.240]   If Twitter's listening or Mark's listening, what should they do to make a perfect clubhouse?
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:26.880]   The moderation works well.
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:30.880]   The problem is that there's no signaling. You don't know once you're joined in.
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:34.240]   There's no signaling if there is someone that you want to talk to.
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:37.520]   There's no signaling who you should trust and who you should support.
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:42.560]   There's a lot of schemes and sent up for my free course.
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:46.800]   And I'll teach you to be a millionaire, rooms on clubhouse.
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:55.280]   The people who have speak with authority are able to amass a following.
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:59.280]   And the person with authority in terms of the way they speak may not
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:05.360]   be really true in terms of them being a really reputable person to follow.
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:13.200]   So it's a lot of people, because it is a velvet rope network, people are assuming that people have
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:16.960]   trust and reliability that they have not earned.
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:23.280]   So they need to work on that signaling of each individual person and what they stand for.
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:29.600]   If they can solve for that of who you can trust or who you are aligned with, it will be better.
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:36.320]   I wonder, I think we're thinking about this. If it wouldn't make more sense to do, you say,
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:40.320]   for instance, use Discord, you use Discord now, Father Robert, quite extensively.
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:40.720]   I do.
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:47.680]   And just create a community within Discord. You have a community for your Minecraft server, for instance.
[01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:54.240]   Yep. I use Discord for the Minecraft server. I've used Discord for Padre's Corner. I use Discord
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:56.800]   for Black Hat and DevCon.
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:59.280]   It's perfect for a podcast like Padre's Corner.
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:04.640]   Can people talk back to you and do you use the audio only or do you use video? They have it all,
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:04.880]   right?
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:09.920]   I use audio and video. And that's how I can bring people into the program.
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:18.720]   I use voice features. I use voice communities in Discord. It has nowhere near the sort of velvet
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:25.600]   rope feel of something like Clubhouse. And honestly, I understand the appeal of Clubhouse.
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:32.000]   Personally, it's not something I think I would ever want to do. It sounds like too much work
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.560]   to reach people that I don't really care about.
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:38.320]   And the funny thing is, it's not hard. I mean, Wesley has a good point.
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:44.160]   Creating an audio conversation like this is actually not hard given the right tools.
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:49.280]   And it seems like the solution to your problem, Wesley, would be for individual creators to
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:53.840]   create their own Clubhouses. It's easy enough to do. A Discord is a perfect example, because nothing
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:59.680]   to create your own. I would not be surprised if there would be a Clubhouse as a service where you
[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:04.400]   say, I love it. I love it in Clubhouse. And then now you have a closed door audio network that
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:09.200]   you can invite people to or just like people do to this Discord server.
[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:14.400]   The rumor is that the way that they're thinking of monetizing is maybe it's going to be Clubhouse
[01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:20.320]   that does that, where the sort of the Patreon or the sub stack model where it's like, you can own
[01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:25.920]   a certain Club and it's yours. And you can charge subscriptions for it. You can sell tickets for
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:30.640]   one off live events. You can do whatever and just give us a cut. That's one of the rumors of how
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:35.520]   they might be thinking about making this a business. Yeah, makes sense. But they don't have the right
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:40.400]   tools for the on the admin side for it to be worth it. You cannot control it. Even if you can
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:44.720]   just have people there, there are a lot more tools you'll need in order to manage a group.
[01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:51.200]   If you've ever run a community on Slack, you can understand all those boltons that were done just
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:58.480]   to make that go the same with any niche communities that I might have different needs. It makes sense
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:04.160]   to either build your own or use a turnkey solution that allow you to do that rather than use Clubhouse,
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:09.920]   which is limited. Right now they're iOS. If you use a mentioned web RTC, but if you use something
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:16.800]   like that, you could be a mobile desktop and be more able to reach more people rather than their
[01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:23.360]   limited release cycle. There's a lot of things that they need to fix in terms of max room size.
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:29.440]   And there's a whole bunch of things that if they were going to do that, they would have to
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:32.800]   a lot of pressure on the admin side to make sure the controls are there to be able to control that
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:37.760]   community. It feels like a Discord might have all those tools. Do you think Robert? They do,
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:45.280]   but adminning a Discord room is a nightmare. Because it's so granular, because I give you such
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:50.560]   control over every little permission, it's difficult to get everyone where you want them to be.
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:58.640]   It's legendary when we're trying to do something like a DevCon. To get the right people into the
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:01.200]   right rooms with the right permissions to be able to do what they're supposed to do.
[01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:07.840]   But yeah, you could do it. You absolutely could do it. You just would need to have some very decent
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:12.720]   admins. I need to talk to you because I think I really want to do something with this. I feel like
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:19.440]   a Twit Clubhouse would be kind of cool, given the personalities and the minds we have on our show.
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:22.640]   It's text, it's audio, it's video. It's kind of what we do.
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:28.320]   What Mark Cuban is doing apparently, sorry Dan Benjamin, Mark's decided to call his
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:34.640]   podcast app Fireside, which is unfortunately what Dan Benjamin causes, his podcast
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:42.240]   system. Hosts can talk to fans live and monetize their conversations. Wonder where you got that
[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:53.520]   idea, Mark Cuban. So yeah, at least there's Facebook, Twitter, Mark Cuban. There are a lot of people
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:49:00.000]   basically coming right at Clubhouse over the next few months, which will be interesting.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:09.760]   Let me take one more break because I want to bring up a story that I think is going to be
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:18.080]   interesting about, what was it, more than a year ago, Bloomberg published a story about a Super Micro
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:24.960]   hack, a rice sized chip that they claim China was installing on Super Micro motherboards
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:33.600]   to spy on the US military and others. Bloomberg has doubled down on the story. It's not gone.
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:38.880]   It's back, baby. We'll talk about that in just a little bit with Brian McCullough, the tech meme
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:47.040]   ride home and internet historian. Good to have you. Wesley Faulkner, developer advocate at daily.co
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:52.720]   at a web RTC platform to enable companies to stream audio and video, right?
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:58.320]   Yeah, it's a we give you the components. So you can do like a
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:06.720]   your own like a chat where like Clubhouse or you can do a web conferencing. You can make it a
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:12.160]   feature in your application. Like if you wanted to make a Skype competitor or a Zoom competitor
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:17.680]   or a Webex competitor, you can do that too. Or you can, you know, when you're in Slack and you can say,
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:24.400]   oh, let's move this over to a conversation, you can embed that feature into your applications.
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:24.880]   Nice.
[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:31.680]   So we kind of let you use any part of the Web RPC, but put it behind an API. So it's so we manage
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:36.480]   all of the network traffic to make sure that if you want to optimize for video or audio,
[01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:39.520]   quality, size, mobile, we allow you to do all that.
[01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:46.240]   Very cool. If people messaged you at Wesley 83 on Twitter, would you be able to help them get
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:54.800]   that going? Absolutely. Yes. Okay. You can reach me there. You could reach me at the email if you
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:51:00.480]   Wesley at daily.co. You can email me directly if that's your preferred method. I am. My job is to
[01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:05.840]   help people and to talk to you. Nice. If you have if you want to talk to me, I am 100% available.
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:10.320]   Everybody should want to talk to Wesley. I think it was Stacy Higginbotham who introduced me to you.
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:17.440]   She was an Austin, a fellow Austin at South by and I thank you, Stacy. It's really always a pleasure
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:26.640]   to have you on to ease in Wesley. W-E-S-L-E-Y at daily.co. And of course, my everybody's favorite Jesuit,
[01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:33.040]   Father Robert. I don't know why I laugh at that, but okay. Father Robert Ballis, I shouldn't laugh at
[01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:38.880]   that. But John McLaughlin used to be my favorite Jesuit. Now you are. So you're in good company.
[01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:42.880]   That's really good company. My father went to Jesuit schools. He went to Fordham
[01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:51.920]   and at Jesuit High School in New York City. So you guys are he used to call them God's Marines.
[01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:56.640]   Kind of that's why I'm here. You get told where to go and you go.
[01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:03.920]   Do you go hoorah or anything like that? Do you have a like a little Jesuit yell?
[01:52:03.920 --> 01:52:14.000]   Yes, it goes along the lines of, okay. Oi vay. It's always always a pleasure. Father Robert,
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:18.080]   great sense of humor. We love to love to razz him. Actually, I have a question for you.
[01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:24.240]   Who was Saint Valentine? And why do we sell it? Is this his saint's day? Is this his official
[01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:31.840]   saint's day, February 14th? This is his official saint's day and I don't do the
[01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:41.120]   martyrology. Was he the one with all the arrows? No. No. Yes? No. I don't know. Oh, he was beheaded
[01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:46.400]   on a sorry. He was beheaded. Never mind. We've got the calendar up on the wall and it's
[01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:52.480]   interesting because the stories of the martyrs are some of the most gruesome depictions of
[01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:55.760]   the death you've ever heard. Oh, I know. They are grim.
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:53:02.480]   So I just got to pass by that part on the bulletin board. Saint Valentine's Day or
[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:07.520]   officially Saint Valentine of Rome because there are a dozen Valentine saints.
[01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:16.000]   That's because the Latin word valentinus means worthy, strong, or powerful. So it's very popular.
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:21.200]   Back there in the second to eighth centuries, lots of the, lots of martyrs named to Valentinus.
[01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:28.880]   He, let's see, which Valentine, the same Valentine of Rome,
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:39.520]   he was a temple priest who was beheaded by the Emperor Claudius for helping Christian couples wed.
[01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:46.640]   They're in the romantic connection. Well, I mean, there are very few things that are more romantic
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:52.800]   than getting beheaded, especially for the cause of getting people married. There you go. Yeah.
[01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:58.800]   All right. There was a Pope Valentine. Yes. Little known about it. He was not beheaded.
[01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:04.560]   No, he only served 40 days back in age. But he did look like a little baby angel and shot arrows
[01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:10.880]   made out of chocolate. So there you go. Valentine is the patron saint of beekeepers and epilepsy,
[01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:17.360]   among other things. And I'm told that if you go to the Basilica of Santa Maria,
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:24.240]   yeah, you can see his right around the corner, his flower adorned skull is right there. Yes,
[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:30.080]   you can. Yes, you can. And actually there is right now there are three skulls in my house.
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:39.280]   So, okay. Anybody we would know? No. No. One is the proto martyr of Vietnam, a martyr.
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:45.040]   We have his skull in a display case. There's a room that has the relics. It's a special
[01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:50.400]   relic that's been locked up. It's a relic. It's a relic. But it is strange to know that there are
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:55.920]   just random body parts. Well, you'll find other bits of Saint Valentine's skeleton
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:55:00.000]   in the Czech Republic, Ireland, Scotland, England, and France.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:05.120]   If you if yeah, we really like to part them out. It was like the early cloud. We made sure that
[01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:10.960]   there was a piece everywhere. Just a little bit. A little bit distributed, distributed Sainthood.
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:16.480]   Our show today. Anyway, we just want to get that little historical note in the in the record
[01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:22.800]   for this Saint Valentine's Saint Valentine of Rome day. Our show today brought to you by
[01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:31.200]   Eset. You know, Russell Tammany, who is our official IT guy. He's a he is what's what do they call
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:36.560]   a Russell. He's a managed service provider and MSP. So he doesn't work for us. He's a contractor
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:41.280]   who works for wineries and other companies around the Bay Area. But we are so lucky to have him.
[01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:45.520]   Russell is kind of the heart and soul of our operation. And every time I see him when he stops
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:52.240]   by, I say Russell, are we safe? It's kind of like that scene with Sir Lawrence Olivier in the
[01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:58.400]   dental drill. Are we safe? And he says, yes, we're safe. But I but are you sure Russell?
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:04.480]   He says, Leo, we are safe. We don't have to worry. And I found out the other day why he says that
[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:10.640]   because we use ESET. We've been using ESET for years. E-S-E-T enterprise grade security.
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:16.000]   That's easy to manage. Russell likes it because he can manage it from the cloud.
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:22.000]   And we like it because it has such a light system footprint. ESET's always been famous
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:27.920]   for using few resources, not a lot of memory. They've just introduced something I'm sure Russell
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:33.920]   will want the Endpoint Security Management Platform. They call it ESET Protect. One of the main features
[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:39.280]   the new ESET Protect Cloud, which offers easy cloud-based management for businesses of all sizes.
[01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:44.160]   There's no restriction on seat size. So it doesn't matter if you grow or shrink. It's all the same.
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:50.160]   ESET Protect also takes security to a whole new level with a bunch of new bundled products
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:56.160]   featuring enhanced protection against ransomware. Are we safe? Yes, we're safe. Zero day threats,
[01:56:56.160 --> 01:57:03.520]   full disk data, encryption capabilities for Mac OS and Windows. And right now you can save 20%
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:07.760]   on these new bundles. You're not only getting the best in class cloud managed protection against
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:14.480]   advanced attacks. The same kind we use here at Twit. You're enjoying a significant discount 20% off.
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:21.360]   ESET Protect Advanced is fantastic for a small business like us for MSPs like Russell. It has
[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:28.480]   all the security you need. Russell loves the fact that he can be at a winery 50 miles away
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:32.720]   and check in on us to see how things are doing with his cloud-based management console.
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:36.560]   You get Endpoint Protection. That's really important now because all of our employees are
[01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:41.600]   working from home. You get cloud sandboxing. This is one of the things ESET pioneered. It's
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:48.400]   brilliant. Before an email attachment arrives in our inboxes here, ESET completely transparently,
[01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:55.840]   instantly takes the attachment, puts it in the cloud in a sandbox, executes it, watches its
[01:57:55.840 --> 01:58:02.080]   behavior in a completely safe way, and it can detect a threat even a zero day before anybody
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:07.920]   knows about it. ESET Protect Advanced. It's really great. If you want to go on-prem,
[01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:12.720]   we'll do that too. ESET Protect can be run on-prem. But either way, you're getting powerful,
[01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:17.840]   reliable security based on 30 years of research and innovation. We've got a free trial and
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:26.080]   interactive demo for you at business.eset.com/twit. ESET got top ratings and AV

[01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:36.000]   ESET not only got the highest combined prevention and response score on the test,
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:41.440]   but also demonstrated outstanding overall detection and reporting capabilities. They named
[01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:47.600]   them a strategic leader. That's their top rating signifying a product that has a very high return

[01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:30.080]   We're safe. We use ESET. I love ESET. Business.eset.com/twit. We thank them so much for keeping us safe.
[01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:40.320]   You know, when the original story from Bloomberg came out and was then immediately denied by
[01:59:40.880 --> 01:59:46.880]   many of the companies mentioned, this is the Super Micro hack, including Apple Super Micro
[01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:51.920]   Amazon, which uses the elemental hardware that uses Super Micro. A lot of people thought,
[01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:58.640]   Bloomberg, you got it wrong. Bloomberg never retracted. They said we have very good sources.
[01:59:58.640 --> 02:00:09.600]   They just on Friday put out another story, the long hack, how China exploited a US tech supplier
[02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:17.440]   for years. US investigators found tampering in products made by Super Micro. The company says
[02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:22.560]   it was never told they weren't doing it. Neither was the public. When that first story came out,
[02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:27.360]   I said true or not, it is a very important warning about the dangers of the supply chain. You've
[02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:33.200]   got to protect your supply chain. Bloomberg now has a lot more details. I think we now,
[02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:38.960]   I don't care what denials you hear, you cannot deny this story. In 2010, the US Department of
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:42.960]   Defense found thousands of its servers sending military network data to China.
[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:49.680]   The result of code hidden in chips that handled the machine's startup process. In 2014, Intel
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:54.960]   discovered an elite Chinese hacking group had breached its network through a single server
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:01:00.880]   that downloaded malware from a supplier's update site. In 2015, the FBI warned multiple
[02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:05.920]   companies that Chinese operatives had concealed an extra chip loaded with backdoor code and
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:12.480]   one manufacturer's servers. In each of these distinct attacks, two things in common, China
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:19.680]   and Super Micro, which is motherboard manufacturer in San Jose, they shared one other trade. US
[02:01:19.680 --> 02:01:25.600]   Spymasters discovered the manipulations but kept them largely secret as they tried to counter
[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:30.320]   each one and learn more about China's capabilities. I know, Father Robert, you cover hacking.
[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:38.480]   And I'm sure you had, did you, with the initial Super Micro report, what were your thoughts at the
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:46.480]   time? We did. So on both, quiet and know-how, we actually took a look at some of the supposedly
[02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:52.080]   affected motherboards from Super Micro. And we did our own set of tests on them. Really basic
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:58.560]   stuff, which is we let them run and we watched all the network traffic. Every single packet that
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:03.520]   was leaving the server for the course of a month, we saw nothing. We saw absolutely nothing. We
[02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:08.960]   actually went back to the traces to look for traces of chips that were added, absolutely nothing.
[02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:14.400]   Now, the answer, the response was, well, they didn't modify everything. And like you said,
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:18.960]   it wasn't Super Micro. I want to make that very clear. It was in the supply chain. The motherboards
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:24.320]   would be shipped. And then at some point between arriving, shipment and arriving at the end user,
[02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:29.760]   they were modified. In fact, Bloomberg says that neither Super Micro nor any of its employees has
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:34.080]   been accused of wrongdoing. Former US officials who provided information with the story emphasize
[02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:39.440]   the company itself has not been the target of any counterintelligence investigation. It's a supply
[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:45.440]   chain attack. Exactly. And as you mentioned, we know that that's a vulnerability. Everything that
[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:52.720]   we use from our networking equipment to our phones are manufactured in China. So unless you've got
[02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:57.440]   someone there watching every step of the process, there is no way to guarantee that there's nothing
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:03.280]   added to a motherboard that could be sending data back. Now, there are a few weird things in the
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:09.040]   story that the way that Bloomberg reported it, they were reporting that laptops and motherboards
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:14.560]   were being they had malware in the BIOS. And I'm thinking, wait a minute, these all all of these
[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:19.680]   machines use you EFI, which do check sums now, you shouldn't technically be able to do that.
[02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:24.560]   Sure, you can drop an extra chip. But if you're trying to tell me that China has developed a way
[02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:30.960]   to hack UEFI that is undetectable, I'm going to need more proof than you just bringing on a so-called
[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:38.000]   expert saying, Oh, yeah, they've totally done that. You've covered the story. I'm sure Brian,
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:42.320]   both in October 2018 when the original story came out, I was really surprised on Friday,
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:48.640]   see Bloomberg double down on this. What's your thought? Yeah, I actually, I actually hadn't seen
[02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:54.720]   that that happened probably posted after I posted my show. I mean, I always come back to these,
[02:03:54.720 --> 02:04:00.560]   when these things come up, or even like with the solar winds thing, don't we just always have to
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:06.880]   assume that every that Apple Facebook, there's there's spies from multiple countries working
[02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:13.360]   there actively. At every factory point for software, for hardware, for whatever, there are spies
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:18.560]   working in these factories to inject things like we just have to assume that that's been the case
[02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:24.960]   for years now. Right. Am I wrong? Yeah, that was my point is whether you believe or don't believe the
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:30.480]   original story from October of 2018, it's clear this is a potential problem. The supply chain
[02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:37.280]   attacks are happening. They've happened over and over again. And we may, you know, there's a real
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:41.680]   message that you've got to pay close attention to this stuff. And you can't assume that it because
[02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:49.120]   it's arriving in a sealed box it hasn't been tampered with. I, you know, I'm surprised to see this again
[02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:58.800]   in Bloomberg Business Week. They have more sources. Again, they claim sources in law enforcement in
[02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:06.080]   the US military. They if if if a story was that controversial, and you went back and reported more
[02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:11.520]   and invested more resources in it and then doubled down, like that's how many how many man hours if
[02:05:11.520 --> 02:05:17.520]   this is a year later, you got to figure that they really feel strongly about this one. Yeah.
[02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:22.720]   Yeah, I mean, and I get that. But what bothers me is they doubled down.
[02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:28.960]   And they brought in so-called experts, but the article that they wrote doesn't really provide
[02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:32.720]   any of the technical information we would need as a security
[02:05:32.720 --> 02:05:36.560]   community to verify that any of any of this is actually happening. Right. But I was wondering
[02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:42.960]   how do it must be happening with those things though? Are we getting into areas where there is
[02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:48.240]   national security things where like they can't name names, they can't specifically mention an
[02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:54.000]   incident because the NSA or the CIA or whoever, whomever it is is like, no, by the way, or the FBI,
[02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:58.240]   we're actively working on that or the fact that we know that this happened, we don't want people
[02:05:58.240 --> 02:06:03.920]   to know that we know that this happened. Yeah, I have a series because this is resurfaced.
[02:06:03.920 --> 02:06:10.320]   I'm a it looks to me like the original sources and by the by the way, at the time there was some
[02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:16.080]   concern that the original sources were motivated by President Trump's animus towards China that
[02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:23.040]   maybe this was a planted story because nobody was able to confirm it later. Here it is now,
[02:06:23.040 --> 02:06:29.280]   we are a couple of weeks into a new administration. It looks to me like the original sources of the
[02:06:29.280 --> 02:06:37.040]   story were concerned that nobody paid any attention and went back to Bloomberg and said,
[02:06:37.040 --> 02:06:44.640]   guys, we got to we got to get people to wake up. They're not paying attention. Is that not seem
[02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:52.080]   credible? I agree with you, Robert. They haven't provided, you know, come up with one motherboard
[02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:57.520]   with that with that chip on it. Right. Well, look, this is absolutely credible. I have no problem
[02:06:57.520 --> 02:07:03.280]   believing that the Chinese government or a state run organizations are using the supply chain to
[02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:12.400]   spy. I have seen it in person from a Chinese company from Huawei. Right. So that part is that's
[02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:18.800]   obvious. Yes, that's going to happen. Where I get frustrated is, okay, I hear you, give me something,
[02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:23.280]   point me in the right direction so I can do some independent verification. And to the point that
[02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:27.600]   it might be the NSA stepping in, if there was a security letter, they wouldn't have even let them
[02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:33.680]   print the article. So that's my that's what I think Brian saying what I'm saying is they don't
[02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:39.360]   want to go on record, really, but they want to send out send an alarm.
[02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:44.240]   There's somebody out there whose hair is on fire and they're trying to scream about their hair
[02:07:44.240 --> 02:07:51.440]   being on fire as loudly as they can without showing anybody the smoke. Right. Because maybe they can't.
[02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:57.520]   Yeah, they can't. They would they would be put in jail for revealing national security things.
[02:07:57.520 --> 02:08:04.080]   My guess is that the reason why this was allowed to happen is because these types of
[02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:10.800]   infiltration attacks are probably very low priority. If it's a nation state that's
[02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:17.440]   getting into your network, they at least know if they are going to use that information for mass
[02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:25.600]   like ill that we would have a target to retaliate. So those are more of a they're using it for
[02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:33.040]   economic benefits rather than attacking a city or a county or a state or even the nation.
[02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:37.440]   It is the actors that are the lone wolves. It's the actors that are
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:44.080]   that could just try to sow chaos because they know that the repercussions
[02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:51.760]   will not affect them or they're not projecting the harm to themselves that would cause because
[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:57.440]   of that. So my guess is that it was an insider that that's trying to say we should prioritize this
[02:08:57.440 --> 02:09:02.880]   and keeps leaking this information to the press so they get more resources internally
[02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:09.200]   to reprioritize these types of attack. As they should as they clearly should be. I mean,
[02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:13.440]   the solar winds attack is another supply chain attack and we know about that and we know there
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:18.560]   was a severe consequence to that. At the end of the article Bloomberg quotes Frank Fagluzi who was
[02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:26.320]   the FBI assistant director for counterintelligence until 2012. He's been a private citizen since
[02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:32.000]   then but he was willing to go on record with this quote Super Micro's Tale of Woe is a chilling
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:39.280]   wake-up call for the industry. Fagluzi declined to address specifics but agreed to speak publicly
[02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:44.960]   about the implications of Super Micro's history with Chinese tampering. If you think this story,
[02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:49.600]   and this is really the bottom line, if you think this story has been about only one company you're
[02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:56.000]   missing the point, this is a don't let this happen to you moment for anyone in the tech sector supply
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:01.920]   chain. I don't think anybody would disagree with that. There's an underlying story here and
[02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:08.880]   that is there's a sense of disillusion because we've got players including tech companies and
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:14.000]   news agencies and the government, the US government that are essentially saying you should be really
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:18.960]   worried about them spying on you but don't be worried when we spy on you. Facebook will sell
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:23.680]   all your information but China they're going to do something really bad with it. At this point,
[02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:27.520]   the average person, the reason why this is not getting more traction, the reason why it's been
[02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:34.960]   forgotten after the posting last year is people are so fatigued. They get it. Their privacy is
[02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:40.480]   being invaded. They're not exactly sure who's invading it this week but they just don't care
[02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:48.800]   anymore. Right. Somebody in the Charms, Peter Nat is counseling me not to say the Chinese are
[02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:55.040]   to blame but the CCP, the Chinese Communist Party and that is really an important distinction.
[02:10:56.160 --> 02:11:01.920]   I think that the people of China are really amazing people in an amazing country.
[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:07.680]   It's the CCP involved in this. And Belgium. We can always blame Belgium.
[02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:10.000]   It's all Belgium's fault. It's always Belgium.
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:15.520]   This article has many more names and many more quotes. A lot of more people willing to go on the
[02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:21.920]   record which I think makes it a little bit more substantive. A guy named Darren Mott who oversaw
[02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:28.080]   counterintelligence investigations in the FBI's Huntsville office. He said a well-placed FBI
[02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:34.000]   colleague described key details about the added chips for him. This is back in October 2018 when
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:39.760]   the original story came out. What I was told, this is a direct quote on the record from Darren Mott.
[02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:43.760]   What I was told was there was an additional little component on the Super Micro-Motherboards
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:48.320]   that were not supposed to be there. Mott has since retired. He emphasized the information
[02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:54.000]   was shared in an unclassified setting. The FBI knew the activity was being conducted by China,
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:59.280]   the CCP, knew it was concerning and alerted certain entities about it. Mott said at the time
[02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:02.400]   he advised companies that had asked him about the chips to take the issue seriously.
[02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:09.600]   I always thought it was puzzling that Bloomberg would go with his story. If it weren't true,
[02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:15.040]   I thought maybe they'd been played the fact that on Friday they came out with an even more
[02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:23.600]   detailed story. To me, says they want people to know this is legit and I think they're
[02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:28.960]   again the same takeaway. These things do happen. We know it from solar winds and others. These
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:36.640]   things do happen. From the US government perspective, if you control the information that is in your
[02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:41.920]   network or being exfiltrated from your network and you know it's there, you also can control the
[02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:48.160]   misinformation that you put through that pipe to the governments that are spying on you.
[02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:50.800]   Which may be why they don't want it to be widely known.
[02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:54.320]   Exactly. Yeah. Interesting.
[02:12:54.320 --> 02:13:00.480]   There are a lot more stories, but I've kept you guys long enough on Valentine's Day. I'm sure you
[02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:07.680]   have places to be and things to do. I know I do. It's 2am over here. For your father, Robert,
[02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:12.880]   it's no longer Valentine's Day in Italy. It is such a pleasure to see you, Robert. Thank you
[02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:18.800]   so much for being here. I'm glad we can do this. I know it's going to be a while before we get
[02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:23.120]   you back, but I'm glad we could do this. It's always great to see you. Father Robert Ballisare,
[02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:28.240]   the digital Jesuit at Padre S.J. How do I get on your Minecraft server, Father Robert?
[02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:39.600]   Oh, well, you just go over to is it Mc1 or Minecraft.digitaljazwood.com and point your
[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:43.200]   client there. And as long as you're part of our Discord, you automatically get in.
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:50.960]   You got a lot of press for running. My crafts are out of the Vatican. We did. We did. And a lot
[02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:55.040]   of attacks, but those have mostly gone away. And the community that's in there, they're just
[02:13:55.920 --> 02:14:02.080]   they know it's something special because everyone is not that everyone's nice. It's that everyone
[02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:07.520]   wants to build something. They don't just want to troll. We're not a troll server. I think we're
[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:12.640]   old enough now that we've kind of figured out our place in the Minecraft ecosystem. And now we're
[02:14:12.640 --> 02:14:18.640]   moving on to things like we've got a Rust server. We've got Team Fortress 2 running. So if you want
[02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:23.200]   to build something there, yeah, that's awesome. I love Minecraft. Are people building? What are
[02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:30.000]   they building a beautiful replica of the Vatican? The cathedrals are played out. We've got there's
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:37.120]   at last count, there's probably about 120 cathedrals built on the server. And I don't want to say
[02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:41.280]   any more cathedrals. No more cathedrals. Yeah, no more cathedrals.
[02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:48.160]   Reliquaries. Okay. Yes. If you want to build bones, go for it. I'm used to living near them.
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:59.680]   Minecraft-mp.com. Digital Jesuit or just go to minecraft.digitaljazuit.com. And you can't just
[02:14:59.680 --> 02:15:05.600]   wander in, right? You have to. Right. So you actually have to join the Discord. So once you
[02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:10.240]   join the Discord, you get automatically assigned permission to come into the server. That's why.
[02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:15.200]   But that also means that it's very easy to ban you from the server. Very smart. So start with the
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:19.120]   digital Jesuit Discord server. That's probably the best place to go. Right.
[02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:25.040]   You must be in the Discord server to play. Oh, is that true for the Rust and the team fortress
[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:30.960]   and all that? TFT. We haven't tied it in on those yet because those are as popular. For a while
[02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:35.760]   there, there were actually a couple of my favorite actors and actresses who wanted a
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:41.680]   place to hang out in Rust. Nice. So I said, hey, come on in. Have fun. Felicia Day wanted to play.
[02:15:41.680 --> 02:15:50.160]   So really? Oh, that's so sweet. Anything else you want to plug? No? No? Oh, yes. So I'm working with
[02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:56.800]   this organization now. It's called the Vatican Church. The Church of Rome. Okay. Yeah, we're on
[02:15:56.800 --> 02:16:03.200]   Twitter. Yeah. Yeah. It's great to see you, Robert. Thank you for being here. Somebody in the
[02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:13.680]   chat was saying OMG has a TF2 server. OMG. Wesley Faulkner. So great to see you. Anything else you
[02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:20.480]   would like to mention, developer advocate at daily.co Wesley at daily.co Wesley 83 on the Twitter.
[02:16:20.480 --> 02:16:28.320]   Did I get it all? Yes. There was speaking of Twitter. There was someone today or I tweeted it
[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:41.440]   today, someone who took bubble and daily.co's API and made kind of like a clubhouse clone in one day.
[02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:47.840]   So no code solution and they kind of rolled it into it. And so if you want to see an example of
[02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:53.760]   that, I would say check out my stream. Just that easy. It's right under my pen tweet. There it is.
[02:16:53.760 --> 02:17:00.400]   Yeah. Just go past my face. Oh, he looks so cute. And you could see one day right there. One day
[02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:06.480]   you did that. That's pretty awesome. You could just join a room and create a room. And so it's
[02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:13.200]   amazing what people can do today with these low code, no code solutions. And I mentioned earlier
[02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:20.640]   in the podcast that we will be putting out a blog post detailing how if you want to use it
[02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:26.880]   daily just for audio and to make your own either audio social network or just your own role,
[02:17:26.880 --> 02:17:34.640]   your own application with just audio. If you go to our blog, daily.co/blog, it'll be posted later
[02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:40.160]   on this week. So depending on when you're listening to this, it might be live now. So go ahead and
[02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:45.760]   check out our blog and keep an eye there. And we can we there's a lot of other good tutorials
[02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:52.640]   and lessons on how to use our API. And our free plan gives you 2000 minutes a month.
[02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:58.720]   Almost. You need a credit card. That's nice. That's a good deal. How's the Komodo dragon?
[02:17:58.720 --> 02:18:05.680]   It is a bearded dragon. Bearded dragon. The cold weather.
[02:18:05.680 --> 02:18:10.640]   When you tossed it to me right before the tease, if you heard my kids screaming,
[02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:16.560]   I did start snowing here in Austin. I would have screamed too. So they're
[02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:21.360]   huddling together. We had to use some extra heat lamps to make sure that they stay warm.
[02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:28.000]   But they are just fine pancakes. Great. Good. We have another one called milkshake and we just
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:33.680]   combined them into the same cage. So pancake and milkshake are doing great. Yes. Is this your cat?
[02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:41.120]   Yes. That is waffles. We have so all your animals are food names, basically.
[02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:48.160]   Is that right? No, no, we have various names. We have I think I think I covered all of them.
[02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:57.440]   You let the kids say last week we had nachos that perished. Oh, that was a leopard gecko that we
[02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:06.000]   had. But those are I think I've covered all of the edible names. Thank you, Wesley. Always a
[02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:13.200]   pleasure. Thank you, Brian McCullough, the Tech meme ride home is available at Techmeme.com. I
[02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:19.920]   literally live on Tech meme. And so it's very convenient for me while I'm reading on Tech meme
[02:19:19.920 --> 02:19:25.600]   to listen to the Tech meme ride home. There's a little player right there on the website. Just
[02:19:25.600 --> 02:19:31.440]   press play while you're reading. No, right. And really, just wherever you're listening to a podcast,
[02:19:31.440 --> 02:19:35.040]   say you're listening to one right now, you could search and subscribe right there. Would that be
[02:19:35.040 --> 02:19:43.440]   amazing? Yeah. Thank you, Brian. Anything else you want to plug? Not at all. We're approaching
[02:19:43.440 --> 02:19:49.760]   three years in three weeks. I'm sorry, Brian has the Tech meme ride home plus subscription.
[02:19:49.760 --> 02:19:55.600]   He's going to be too modest to bring it up. But I will subscribe to his pay for feed. It's amazing.
[02:19:55.600 --> 02:20:01.040]   Well, there you go. He just doesn't want to he's he's like me. I don't like to mark it either.
[02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:07.040]   Well, it's not only it's it's I'd rather if you haven't heard the show come hear the show
[02:20:07.040 --> 02:20:14.480]   then I'll try to push you for $5. Fair enough. Well, thank Wesley. Thank you for saying that. I
[02:20:14.480 --> 02:20:20.800]   will say like for example, the bonus episode this weekend was an interview with the economist Noah
[02:20:20.800 --> 02:20:28.000]   Smith. Looking at the question of is remote remote work real is Silicon Valley dead and over,
[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:33.600]   etc, etc. So those are the fun things you can get on the bonus for you. Wow. And he the interesting
[02:20:33.600 --> 02:20:40.320]   raises. Amazing. Like if you want to know what's going to come hearing how people are raising money
[02:20:40.320 --> 02:20:48.720]   in this like environment is great insight. It's almost like a crystal ball. Oh boy, I'm going to
[02:20:48.720 --> 02:20:54.560]   go home and listen to it right. That's awesome. That's your next your next listen. The tech me

[02:21:43.840 --> 02:21:51.120]   let you know blizzard warning now in Austin, Texas. That's crazy. My life severely. We can't
[02:21:51.120 --> 02:21:55.920]   leave. We have to stay at home. That's insane. It's exactly the same as I was saying. Oh, okay.
[02:21:55.920 --> 02:22:01.840]   Instead of wearing a mask, you should wear a mask and a hat. That's all.
[02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:08.480]   Wow. If you want to watch on demand, all of our shows on the network are available on our website
[02:22:08.480 --> 02:22:16.000]   twit.tv. They also all have their own YouTube feed this week in tech among them. You can listen
[02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:21.040]   there, subscribe there. Actually, the best place to subscribe audio or video is probably your favorite
[02:22:21.040 --> 02:22:25.360]   podcast client. If you subscribe, you'll get it automatically. The minute it's available
[02:22:25.360 --> 02:22:31.840]   at the end of the day. We have a asynchronous form for those of you who listen on demand. That's
[02:22:31.840 --> 02:22:39.440]   a www.twit.community. Really a lot of fun in there. I invite you all to stop by. And we even have a
[02:22:39.440 --> 02:22:48.400]   distributed Twitter style social network based on the Fediverse. It's called twit.social.

[02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:58.320]   I guess that's all I have to say, except thank you for being here. We'll see you next week. Another
[02:22:58.320 --> 02:23:02.080]   twit is in the can. Happy Valentine's Day.
