[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.960]   It's time for Twit this week in tech
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.280]   to show the covers the latest news of the week.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.840]   All the tech news, all the time,
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.880]   with interesting, unusual, strange people
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.160]   from around the net.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.760]   Well, you can't get much stranger than Jason Calicanis,
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.440]   ladies and gentlemen, from mahalo.com.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.200]   Hello, Mr. Chairman.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.280]   Hello, how are you, sir?
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.440]   Chairman of the board, I am well.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.240]   Welcome back.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.760]   Good to have you.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.840]   Great to be back on the program.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.480]   You never really left, but good to have you back.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.000]   I'm right.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.640]   I'm thinking to share a video on your side, by the way.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.960]   Oh, you don't see me?
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.480]   Not yet.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.880]   OK, let me just get you back here.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.320]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.720]   Let me just turn on the video now that I've expressed myself.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.240]   OK.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.560]   I'm going to this vision of Armageddon
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.200]   when the Russian space astronaut is running around kicking
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.640]   things to make them work so they can go back to Earth.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.400]   Real quick.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.920]   Fixie, fixie, that's Patrick Norton, my friend from the screen
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.720]   saver, so well, Patrick.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.240]   Hey, I'm also at Tuxilla.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.800]   Yes, he's got a new show for the last five years.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.320]   Tough to watch the screensavers these days outside of YouTube.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.040]   You know what's funny?
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.480]   I have, and I will play it for you a little later on,
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.240]   the first Patrick Norton screensavers.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.880]   The Windows 98 explainer before--
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.240]   This was with a day Kate left.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.440]   Oh, wow.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.600]   Or whatever, because I keep saying, oh, Patrick's now the host.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.800]   It's from April 2000.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.880]   You have it like on old school DVD.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.520]   How adorable.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.080]   How adorable.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.160]   And you know, it's funny because I have a lot in the subject.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.920]   By the way, that's Brian Brushwood.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.720]   Shwood.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.520]   We know him as Shwood.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.960]   The host of the great NSFW on this network,
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.960]   and of course, scam school on revision 3.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.000]   Hey, Brian.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.880]   Howdy, howdy.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.160]   Coming from Austin, Texas, yes?
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.000]   Yeah, considerably less travel this way.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.080]   I mean, not that I don't love being there in studio.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.960]   No, we love you on the Skype, too.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.880]   No, I'm upstairs.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.200]   Yeah, actually Skype is doing it.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.040]   I haven't tried it.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.840]   Have any of you tried the new Skype five-way thing
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.720]   that they just put out in beta?
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.760]   Well, it's for Windows only, I believe, at this point.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.880]   You got to hold off on Mac.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.000]   And unfortunately, I literally don't have any friends
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.080]   that are using PCs for their--
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.640]   Really?
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.920]   Friends don't let friends use PCs.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.680]   I don't have friends--
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.880]   I'd be glad to call you Brian.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.280]   These are, you know, Skype is sources.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.680]   All Windows XP machines, actually.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.080]   So I have to try it.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.080]   So none of you-- have you tried it, Patrick?
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.960]   I have downloaded it on another machine.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.960]   I haven't had anybody to call.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.880]   So maybe I can call you later on, Brian,
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.080]   and we can see who else will join us.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.080]   It'd be fun.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.040]   I'm scared to upgrade, because last time I upgraded,
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.960]   totally hijacked.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.760]   We had to do an entire show using UVU instead of Skype.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.960]   So I'm kind of scared to--
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.640]   That's bad.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.280]   That's with it on this PC.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.200]   Yeah, on this old screen savers, I review Wi-Fi access spots
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.920]   in the, like, $1,300.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.720]   Here's Patrick Norton.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.760]   Real presenter.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.280]   Maybe that's not the presenter.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.680]   I think we're answering questions here.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.040]   I mean--
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.320]   If you can't find an-- I don't think anybody's--
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.760]   You're not aged one day.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.800]   I look the same.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.280]   There it is.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.800]   There it is.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.800]   There's Patrick.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.280]   He looks the same too.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.600]   And I look 12 in that chat.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.880]   No, it's funny, though, is that for all the nostalgia
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.680]   we had about the old days at Tech TV and Screen Savers
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.160]   and all, this was kind of a crappy show.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.000]   Why do you say that?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.840]   It's not that good.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.080]   She has a couple of guys standing around in a basement,
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.080]   answering questions about--
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.080]   I'm like, this weekend.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.080]   I was wondering who was going to take that shot.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.120]   And look at the-- look at the-- because we had the Netcam
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.160]   network, so we had to have the double box,
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.600]   and they had to be on the phone.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.440]   I still remember.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.680]   I still remember right before the Nielsen's came out,
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.520]   and it's like everybody knew that the--
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.760]   The ratings.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.240]   The traffic, the ratings.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.000]   We were going to get crushed in the ratings,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.360]   because none of these internet people actually
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.360]   watched this on television, and the ratings came out.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.520]   And the numbers were surprising for a lot of people.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.640]   Yeah, I think there's about the same number of people
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.360]   listening to this show as watched the Screen Savers.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.520]   I think it's almost exactly the same.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.520]   Have you guys gotten over-- like, I would imagine
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.040]   you have some deep-seated rage at the way everything
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.280]   crumbled at the height of your awesomeness with the Screen
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.720]   Savers?
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.040]   Like, do you feel vindicated now?
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.840]   Are you guys relaxed?
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.720]   Or do you still want to kick the corpse of those who opposed you?
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.520]   No, no, no, no.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.040]   Dude, the best way to think about it
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.760]   is the guy who's responsible for--
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.840]   The guy who's responsible for--
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.280]   See, that laugh tells me it's not over.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.240]   That laugh tells me that you're talking about the famous Charles
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.760]   Marshall.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.520]   No, no, no, no.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.080]   We don't need to bring up names.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.320]   The guy who's responsible for bringing tech TV
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.440]   and combining it with G4 pretty much bled three quarters
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.600]   of a billion dollars out of Comcast
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.080]   before eventually signing for the Star Trek reruns
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.720]   to be chopped into strange pieces and have double box push
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.520]   stuff put on them, which annoyed all the people who
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.840]   would actually watch Star Trek like six weeks before the box set
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.080]   DVDs came out and it got fired.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.480]   And you know where he went?
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.160]   He went to a channel called Retirement Living TV.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.120]   And in either case, he's probably still worth more than the two
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.040]   of us put together and multiplied several times.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.520]   He had his mission, and we were not part of it.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.040]   Actually, I'm a little worried because his new company is
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.920]   called TV Live.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.040]   Uh-oh.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.520]   Uh-oh.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.040]   Anyway, with that-- no, I don't know.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.760]   I'm a little bitter.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.260]   Sure.
[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.560]   You're fucking kidding me.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.760]   I didn't notice what with the laughing and the--
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.760]   A little bitter.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.040]   I'm a little bitter.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.440]   Look, nobody's happy when you spend six and a half years
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.000]   of your life busting your ass, building something to have it
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.520]   pretty much ripped out of your hands
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.640]   and turned into something completely differently.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.680]   It's going OK now.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.720]   We're happy.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.600]   We're happy, right, Patrick?
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.920]   We like what we're doing.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.440]   Hey, you know, we have a lot more access,
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.520]   a lot more households, and a lot more control, which is really--
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.040]   It's going.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.120]   It's going OK.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.680]   And as I said, as many people listen to this show,
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.000]   this one show, as watch the screen--
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.040]   Screen Saveras, I think on the best day,
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.560]   was 225,000 people.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.360]   And we get about 200,000 people on Twitch.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.400]   That is amazing.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.040]   And do you know how much you're able to talk about,
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.520]   but are those numbers continuing to grow?
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.760]   Because it seems like podcasting as a pie is continuing
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.680]   to get bigger.
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.520]   Are you seeing a commensurate increase in your numbers?
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.920]   I mean, obviously, with the Twitch network
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.320]   is expanding and expanding.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.760]   But like this week in tech specifically--
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.640]   Well, you know what?
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.080]   The numbers had kind of-- by the way,
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.120]   we've chased Jason completely out of the show.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:39.680]   He's out of here.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.160]   He's gone.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:40.640]   That's it.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.800]   That's the top of his chair.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.240]   You're on the screen.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:42.240]   Oh, there he is.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.240]   He's still here.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.080]   He's back.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.120]   We'll talk a little more about this.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.320]   Then we'll actually get to some news.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.160]   There is some news.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.720]   In fact, I owe Jason a big thank you,
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.480]   because he talked me into doing something which he himself
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.080]   has not yet done.
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.720]   Committing suicide.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.680]   Yeah, I jumped.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.520]   Jason.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.360]   Jason.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.000]   Jason.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:01.920]   He's still on the legs.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.920]   I don't understand.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.720]   But we'll talk about--
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.160]   I'm so close.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:04.720]   You're close?
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.440]   Yeah, we'll see.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.360]   We'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.360]   I'm not going to happen this week.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.240]   OK.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.240]   You should save it for May 31.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.400]   And I'll tell you what all that is about in a second.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.080]   But let's complete the thought, which I've completely lost now.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.640]   I have no idea what we're talking about.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.680]   We were talking about numbers.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.240]   But that's--
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:19.760]   Numbers.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:19.960]   Oh, yes.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.920]   They have gone up.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.560]   I believe podcasting is plateaued, actually.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.160]   I think that most podcasts that I know of flat-lined
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.520]   about a year and a half, two years ago, there's some slight--
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.040]   we were doing like 1% a month.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.240]   Something was very slight growth.
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.760]   Then we released video of this show and most of our shows.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.080]   And I was afraid initially that that would cannibalize the audio.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.720]   And it would be a zero-sum game.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.920]   It'd be net nothing.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.720]   But it turns out we've got-- it didn't
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.320]   factor increase the audience about 20%.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.440]   Now, that may be-- don't tell any advertisers.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.760]   It could very well just be--
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.920]   although, no, our numbers come from uniques.
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.160]   I was afraid that maybe they were downloading audio and video.
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.360]   But no, come to think of it.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.840]   The way PodTrack counts our numbers, it's unique IPs.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:09.160]   So we have 200,000 unique IPs up from 175.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.600]   You know, iTunes does a good job of purging people
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.560]   who aren't really watching the content they download.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.000]   So if they really are listening to a full episode
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.600]   and watching a whole episode, I can't imagine that--
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.520]   If you skip five episodes, you stop subscribing in iTunes.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.880]   So it's my belief, a little bit self-sieving.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.640]   But it's my belief that, in fact, going to video
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.140]   did help.
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.560]   And of course, we're doing a lot to promote and expand.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.920]   We just hired Tom Merritt, his last buzz out loud,
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:36.640]   was on Friday.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.560]   And he'll be joining us in a couple of weeks.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.560]   So I think we're kind of growing.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.760]   We're going to do an iPad show.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.040]   I think that's going to do very well.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.480]   Is your iPad show doing well, Jason?
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.120]   Does that get good numbers?
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.840]   It's pretty extraordinary.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.720]   I think it's getting over 100,000 downloads each episode.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.800]   Yeah, that's what I was kind of thinking for us.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.080]   There's another one that's doing 50.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.280]   So, you know, I mean, if you picked the right topic,
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.880]   the Google show did 50 out of the box.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.320]   So if you picked the right topic--
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.240]   I think you'll do well.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:02.680]   Yeah.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.800]   Speaking of Google, the big--
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.000]   I think it's just starting, actually, the podcasting thing.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.480]   I think it's going from this sort of incubation phase.
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.880]   And it's going to be mainstream.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.000]   Well, you know better than others.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.440]   You've been through this with blogging.
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.560]   Yeah, I think--
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.600]   I think it's analogous.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.840]   It's very analogous, I think, because there
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.640]   was a sort of hobbyist moment in blogging.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.880]   And then there was the professionalism moment,
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.120]   you know, a professionalization of it moment.
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.800]   I think you were the first person, really,
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.040]   three to professionalize podcasting.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.160]   And then blogging was obviously Gawker, web blog zinc,
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.560]   where the first people to professionalize it.
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.800]   And if you look, you know, there's only maybe one podcast
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.760]   or two podcasts about every topic that are published
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.160]   on a consistent basis.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.240]   And they generally don't have technology behind them,
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.880]   a sales team behind them, a management team behind them,
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.600]   social media behind them, you know, all the stuff that,
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.400]   in order to scale this, is necessary.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.040]   And right now there's, I guess, three people or four people
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.840]   doing this.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:09.160]   And to me, I think it's just starting, just starting.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.120]   I'm not sure it's completely analogous,
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.760]   partly because you've also got these big media guys
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.760]   who want to play.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.560]   And a lot of the biggest podcasts are NPR and other mainstream
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.320]   media outlets.
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.640]   That wasn't the case with blog.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.800]   Yeah, I was going to say it's almost podcasting as a concept.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:30.160]   It was, you know, you certainly tried to change the name
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.840]   of it, Leo, and that didn't work out.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.680]   So, well, podcasting is dead because, you know, nobody,
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.040]   you're no longer restricted to downloading through iTunes.
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.280]   People are using set top boxes.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.240]   People are using, I mean, Blu-ray players can access,
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.120]   you know, most Blu-ray players, not can directly access video,
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.880]   even through RSS streams.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.200]   Widgets are coming up on HDTVs.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.840]   I think it's gone for being like, you have to go,
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.280]   you have to, you need this really specialized piece of software
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.040]   and you're going to download this cool radio show
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.240]   over the internet to, hey, you know what?
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.840]   It's right up there next to, you know, my set top box next
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.680]   to my Netflix, next to HBO, next to DirecTV,
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.240]   or whatever it is.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.400]   In that sense, you're kind of competing
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.040]   against all the big names out there.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.920]   And it's all just a video that happens to be distributed.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.160]   Ultimately, it's going to be, yeah, I mean, in a way,
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.840]   we could say victory because we'll be treated as roughly
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.920]   as a peer with mainstream media.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.480]   But it isn't going to be us, and then they're going to fade away
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.560]   by any means.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.320]   Did I hear right?
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.080]   Did I hear you say that the term podcasting
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:25.480]   was dead?
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.280]   Like, have we settled on a new podcasting years ago?
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:28.800]   And you know why?
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.280]   I knew that we were going to be, for instance, doing live streaming.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.800]   What do you call this?
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.840]   What do you call the live stuff?
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:34.760]   It's not a podcast.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:35.880]   Podcasts.
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:36.720]   It's a show.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.760]   It's always been a show.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.640]   And again, the name of the show has nothing.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.960]   It should not contain the means of distribution
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.000]   because there are multiple means of distribution.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.760]   Correct.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.440]   Absolutely correct.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.280]   I said that, but, you know, I--
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.880]   But it is its own category of consumption.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.480]   TV is something you sit down and give your full attention to.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.760]   Radio is something you have on while you're driving around the car.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.440]   There's got to be some different word for the fact that it's what's on your iPhone
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.040]   while you're pulling weeds or--
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.880]   Well, the thing is, Brian, those-- is most television sets are still on in the household
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.600]   on average in eight to 10 hours a day.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.640]   And you're not telling me if there's somebody sitting in front of that television for 10
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.040]   hours, scope-locked on the screen in its activities.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.040]   No, certainly not.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.600]   Certainly for certain programs they are.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.160]   And I think that's something that's part of the reason there needs to be a different word
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.840]   for it is because there's a different level of commitment and involvement on new media.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.240]   Like the way-- I mean, look at the chat room.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.720]   We're over 1,000 people right now watching us live.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.440]   The level of user engagement is so much higher that there needs to be a different term
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.080]   for what it is we're doing here, if not podcasting than something.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.360]   One common complaint about podcasting and this kind of stuff is that all we ever talk
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.760]   about is podcasting and this kind of stuff.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.760]   So let's stop.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:47.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.760]   Let's talk about the name of the book.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:49.760]   Let's talk about the name of the book.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:50.760]   Let's talk about Twitter.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.760]   We know talking about Twitter on the iPad.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.760]   How about Facebook?
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:54.760]   That's the story.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.960]   In fact, and we're going to get to Google I/O too because Google I/O is Wednesday and
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.800]   I think Google's up to something and there's a lot.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.800]   There's a lot of tech news.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.160]   We're going to get to all of that in just a second.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.400]   And I owe you, Jason, a debt of gratitude.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.160]   I'm going to go back onto the ledge and ask you how you're doing there in just a moment.
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.000]   So don't go anywhere else before we do though.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.080]   I do want to mention our friends that go to meeting, the folks from Citrix have done
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.080]   it again.
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.720]   They do such great products.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.640]   Go to meeting is their online meeting service that eliminates your need to travel.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.160]   It takes that boring conference call and makes it something engaging.
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.640]   You see us here, four of us talking.
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.920]   We're seeing each other.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.080]   And with go to meeting, you're seeing the screen of the person you're talking to.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.400]   You're seeing the PowerPoint.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.400]   People are visual.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.360]   A conference call, it just doesn't engage.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.880]   If you've been on a call where people are wandering, they're playing Tetris or answering
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.200]   their-- I guess it's not Tetris anymore.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.200]   It's Farmville, isn't it?
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.120]   They're answering their email.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.200]   You've got to try go to meeting.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.840]   Everyone in the call is more focused, more interested, more engaged.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.840]   You will save time.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.840]   You'll be more productive.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.520]   You can get out of that meeting faster for sales presentations, for product demos, for
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.880]   training, for collaborating.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.200]   Weekly update calls, just upon any kind of conference call, I think you've got to try
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.200]   go to meeting.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.440]   And I'm going to give you a chance to do it for free for 30 days right now.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.200]   Just go to go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:17.320]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.240]   Tetris gets better and better all the time.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.440]   They really know what they're doing.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.960]   128-bit SSL encryption, 24/7 support.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.880]   It's the easiest thing to install, easy for your clients, which is important.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.120]   You want to make them jump through hoops, try it right now.
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.120]   30 days free.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.120]   This is the best part, too.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.800]   What's the best part?
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.000]   It's available on your iPad.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.600]   Oh, have you tried it?
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.600]   And it works.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.200]   It's so cool to do go to meeting on an iPad because your microphone works.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.200]   The audio works.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.200]   You don't need a phone.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.200]   You're just holding it.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:50.400]   Wi-Fi, I'm sitting out in the backyard on a meeting.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.400]   You're right.
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.400]   I did miss the best part.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.720]   It's like an AT&T.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.480]   You will commercial when you're at the beach.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.640]   You'll be at a meeting at the beach.
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.040]   And it's like, oh, here it is.
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.040]   It's true.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.040]   Go to your meeting.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.440]   iPad, go to the beach.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.280]   Will anybody ever sit at the beach having a meeting?
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.280]   You will.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.280]   And it's true.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.280]   It's the...
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.280]   Now...
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.280]   Attaching going through a tow booth at 65 hours.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.280]   Those are fun, aren't they?
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.280]   Watching those ads.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.440]   I've got to pull those up.
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.800]   You know what's funny is that almost all of them actually happened.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.760]   Oh, they all have.
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.440]   It's like one of them was going through a tow booth at speed.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.200]   One of them was taking a meeting at the beach.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.600]   Another one was watching TV on your phone.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.000]   Watching a video on your phone.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   GPS directions.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   The only one that didn't...
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.760]   I think really didn't happen is the one where the woman's in the phone booth making
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.160]   the video call.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.960]   We have thousands of miles away.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.840]   Across the country.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.840]   What's that?
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.840]   Without stopping for directions.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:44.840]   How does that work?
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:45.840]   Oh!
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.400]   He knows where he is.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.280]   We're sending someone a fax.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.280]   That's an iPad.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.280]   That's a freaking iPad.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.280]   That's an iPad.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.120]   Yeah, but the iPad can't send faxes, can it?
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.120]   True.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.120]   True.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.120]   The app's coming.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.120]   It's coming.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.120]   Yeah.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.120]   Do you want to send faxes from the beach?
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.120]   Do you really want to send faxes from the beach?
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.680]   Have you ever paid a tow?
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.680]   Sending a tell-it.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.320]   Without slowing down.
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.320]   Yes.
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.120]   No, I didn't need a car to just drove right through.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.120]   He just wiped his car.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.120]   He swiped the car.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.520]   I have to do it at the exact moment.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.520]   From a cash-ish.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.520]   That's a good idea.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.520]   That's a good idea.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:17.520]   That's a good idea.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.520]   That's a good idea.

[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.520]   That's a good idea.
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.520]   That's a good idea.

[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.520]   That's a good idea.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.520]   That hasn't really happened either.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.520]   How is my car?
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.520]   You talk to your car and it opens?
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.520]   No, you don't even have to.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.520]   It's just getting near it.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.520]   The fob.
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.520]   The fob.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.520]   And Schlage makes a lock that you can use your iPhone to open the door.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.520]   Oh, you know kidding?
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.520]   Well, you don't do the better.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.520]   You lock that in your house.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.520]   Don't have your iPhone.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.520]   That reached that on my iPhone.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.520]   I can't go home.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.520]   Sorry.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.520]   But I was thinking of putting it on the front door of the cottage because if somebody calls
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.520]   up and says, "I'm out front and I can't get in.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.520]   I don't have to come down."
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.520]   I just go, "Okay."
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.520]   And you do it from the iPhone.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.520]   I have one of them.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.520]   I just haven't installed it.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.520]   So I guess that's close enough.
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.520]   That's a "you will" or "you do."
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.520]   [Music]
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.520]   Our car, please.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.520]   Carried your medical history in your wallet.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.520]   Not yet, but soon, right?
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.520]   Well, yeah, Tom Selleck voicing this.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.520]   Who is it?
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.520]   Or it's attended a meeting.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.520]   Who is that?
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.520]   That does sound familiar.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.520]   I'm Selleck.
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.520]   It's Tom Selleck.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.520]   [Laughs]
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.520]   In tight short shorts.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:38.520]   [Music]
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:39.520]   All of these things came true.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.520]   I think that's the funniest thing.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:44.520]   And by the way, so many of them happened because of the experience you get with the iPhone,
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.520]   which was only available.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.520]   AT&T was the first network to have those things.
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.520]   So they kind of fulfilled on their promise for all that.
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:56.520]   You know, actually, I think when these ads were made in 1993, they'd already signed a 20-year deal with Apple.
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.520]   With Apple, they're like, "Listen, you guys are going to come back from the dead, and you're
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.520]   going to create a magical device, and we're going to have the only one, all right?"
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.520]   You will.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.520]   [Laughs]
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:11.520]   Actually, that's another story that I don't know if it's a real story that was a gizmodo.
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.520]   One of the, I think it was gizmodo again.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.520]   Why do they keep coming up with these?
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:20.520]   They said, "Oh, we looked through the court papers from last October, and Apple has a deal through
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.520]   2012 with AT&T, except, of course, that was three years ago.
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.520]   Maybe they don't anymore."
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:31.520]   Anybody believe that the iPhone will ever be on anybody besides AT&T in 2010, 2010?
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.520]   In 2010?
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.520]   This year.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.520]   I'm going to say probably not.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.520]   Jason, you must know.
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.520]   [Laughs]
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.520]   He's not saying.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.520]   Oh, your mic's moved.
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.520]   Yeah.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.520]   I don't think they will.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.520]   You don't think so.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.520]   I thought that was a clever way of you, like avoiding actually saying anything.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.520]   It was like, for some reason, my mic's not talking.
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.520]   I don't understand.
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.520]   I actually have the answer.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.520]   Steve Jobs just told me on text.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.520]   He said, "I tell everybody, we'll only be on AT&T."
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:02.520]   I think what's happened is that AT&T keeps sweetening the pot, and Apple keeps saying,
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:06.520]   "Well, we're going to Verizon," and then said, "Okay, you can have $30 unlimited on the iPad.
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.520]   No problem.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.520]   Month to month, no problem.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.520]   Anything you want?"
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.520]   Because they're making so much money.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.520]   One third of the new--
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.520]   Can you all think of them?
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.520]   I mean, how much do you have?
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.520]   Yes.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.520]   One is third of the new customers to AT&T over the last three years are new.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.520]   I mean, one third of their customers are new buying iPhones.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:28.520]   It has propelled them to-- I mean, Verizon's gone down.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.520]   AT&T's gone up.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.520]   On the other hand, Verizon has now said, "We don't need the Nexus One.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.520]   We got the incredible.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.520]   We got the droid.
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.520]   We got the Aries."
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.520]   Sprint is coming out with-- Sprint may be back, baby.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.520]   This new EVO?
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:47.520]   That EVO, it's the first time that I've ever regretted being an iPhone user, where I was
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.520]   just like, "Oh, that would be so awesome.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.520]   I kind of wish I was on Sprint."
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.520]   And I'm like, "What am I saying?
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.520]   Who am I?"
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.520]   It's a really nice phone.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.520]   I get to handle one at CTIA this year.
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.520]   You've held one?
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:21:59.520]   I've held one.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.520]   I've used one.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.520]   Screen Spectacular--
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.520]   4.3 inches.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.520]   Yeah, it's a really nice screen.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.520]   It's a really nice device.
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:10.520]   Actually, at first, I was a little bummed that it's going to cost the built-in Wi-Fi router.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.520]   It's going to cost you $30 a month.
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:19.520]   Then I realized that that's half the price of getting their wireless broadband for $4.3.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.520]   I've had a lot of broadband for a 3G 4G overdrive modem.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.520]   So I can kind of see the angle they're playing on that one.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.520]   They're also going to charge $10 more for 4G, even if you can't--
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.520]   Like if you live in San Francisco, if you can't do it.
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:38.520]   No, no, they're charging a $10 fee for all network access to give you an unlimited cap on 3G.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.520]   Everybody has 4G, is an unlimited cap.
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:45.520]   They're going to charge you an extra $10 a month to basically take the cap off of 3G
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.520]   and with, because currently--
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:52.520]   I guess about a year and a half, two years ago, Sprint finally fell in line with AT&T and Verizon
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:58.520]   and capped your monthly downloads for your 3G modems, which kind of broke my heart a little bit
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.520]   because I had an unlimited bandwidth plan with them.
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.520]   Now the unlimited bandwidth plan is back in kind of a weird way.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.520]   You were always a Sprint fan, Patrick.
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:14.520]   Sprint's done-- I Sprint customer service on the telephone side of things actually is why I left Sprint.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:21.520]   Yeah, that's why I left. Their service was-- but I love the Sprint PCS and I liked their phones a lot.
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.520]   I was sad to live.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.520]   And the Sprint-- I've been using the Sprint data.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:29.520]   The Sprint data has been, generally speaking, incredibly fast and incredibly solid.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.520]   Pretty much everywhere I've traveled, even in the sticks.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:37.520]   In theory, Verizon's got some more network coverage, but their bandwidth was slower and, you know,
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.520]   AT&T, everybody owns an iPhone, raise your hands.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.520]   You kind of know what the AT&T data plan lifestyle is like,
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.520]   so I never even thought about buying an AT&T data modem.
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.520]   The overdrive is a really neat piece of hardware.
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:52.520]   I'm just kind of waiting for 4G to roll out anywhere near where I live.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.520]   Supposedly, San Francisco by the end of the year, they're trying to push it.
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:02.520]   But I have a couple of port lenders in here, Justin and Justin, who-- and this was my experience in Vegas.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:09.520]   We seem to agree. 4G is, in most cases, no faster than 3G and in many cases, slower.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:14.520]   I wonder how much of that is the website, the implementation or the location?
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:20.520]   Well, look at Vegas as a Sprint Town, and it was a heavy 4G promotion.
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:25.520]   Clear wire. Are you there at CES or-- I was there at other times as well as CES, and it just sucked,
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:30.520]   but you're right. CES, it was really terrible, but, you know, I don't think they're a lot of Sprint users at CES.
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.520]   They were all iPhone users.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.520]   And then you guys are in Portland, and you said the same thing.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:41.520]   Again, location specific, but even at its best, not particularly good.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:45.520]   So I have yet to hear somebody go, 4G, it's great, it's great. I love the 4G.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.520]   It's all hype, it seems to me.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.520]   Well, at least it's uncapped.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:56.520]   Uncapped is good, and as opposed to the unlimited 5 gigabyte that everybody else does.
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:01.520]   I mean, at times, I know when I come to San Francisco, I stayed just outside of SFO,
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.520]   and the hotel has terrible Wi-Fi, so I actually use--
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:05.520]   3G?
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.520]   --the other--
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.520]   --the other--
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.520]   --the other--
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.520]   --the other iPhone.
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.520]   Right.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.520]   And I get like 1.3 megabits down on that.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.520]   3G ain't bad.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:15.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:23.520]   Well, supposedly-- so Patrick's talking about the fact that Sprint is going to allow you to use this as a Wi-Fi access spot,
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:28.520]   this EVO, up to six devices using the 4G or the 3G if you're in a 3G area.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.520]   It's actually eight devices.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.520]   Is it eight?
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.520]   So it's kind of like a little Wi-Fi.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.520]   It is.
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.520]   It's a 4G Wi-Fi.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.520]   It's pretty awesome.
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.520]   I think I'm going to buy one of those, I think.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:40.520]   I think the battery life--
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:46.520]   The demonstration, they have two of them side-by-side live streaming on Quick, and it looked amazing.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.520]   And of course, that screen is gigantic.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.520]   It's a really pretty phone.
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.520]   So I am seeing some people in the chatroom--
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.520]   --it's hard work.
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:57.520]   --I am seeing some people in the chatroom who are saying that they're getting-- they like 4G.
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.520]   Biggie John.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.520]   How fast is it, though?
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.520]   Rob Schneider.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.520]   Hi, Rob.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.520]   Big fan.
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.520]   How fast is it?
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.520]   You know, that's the question.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.520]   I mean, people say, "Oh, I like it."
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.520]   But what does that mean?
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.520]   Now, let's get some numbers.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:14.520]   Anyway, the phone, just for the size of the screen, and the fact that it's-- I have to say
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:15.520]   Android is coming on strong.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:19.520]   The latest stats from NPD say that Android-- there were more Android handsets sold in the first
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.520]   three months of 2010 than there were iPhones.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:28.520]   Eric Schmidt, last week at the Shareholders' Meeting said 65,000 Android handsets a day.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:34.520]   Dwarfed by Nokia, dwarfed by other companies, but still respectable, right?
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:38.520]   Well, and continuing to grow, this is what you get when you create an open platform.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:42.520]   This is kind of the PC versus Mac, the day of the early '90s all over again.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:47.520]   This is what happens when Verizon spends $100 million in one quarter to promote a single
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.520]   phone and spend a lot of time promoting Android phones.
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:55.520]   It's like you've got the incredible and all these-- the phones are the subcategories,
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.520]   but the brand in general, I think, is doing very well.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:02.520]   And it makes me wonder what has Apple done with its lead for the last three years.
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:07.520]   These tiny incremental increases of the capability of the iPhone are nothing compared to the
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.520]   leaps forward that the Droid's doing.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:13.520]   I can't believe that I'm even considering getting a phone besides the iPhone.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.520]   I agree.
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.520]   And I've been using an Nexus One in lieu of an iPhone for months, and I've been very--
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.520]   Jason, didn't you switch to an Nexus One as well?
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:22.520]   Oh, you're muted again, sweet.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.520]   Jason.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.520]   Jason.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.520]   Jason.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.520]   We can't hear you.
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.520]   He's chattering away.
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.520]   He's going on and on.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.520]   Oh, you know what, Jason?
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.520]   This time, it was my fault.
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.520]   Can you say you're voting?
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:38.520]   Really?
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:39.520]   Oh, sorry.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:43.520]   I had you turn down because you dropped off and I turned you down to call you back and
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.520]   then I'm sorry.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.520]   Go ahead, Jason.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.520]   No problem.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:51.520]   No, I have an Nexus One and I found that I stopped using it because I couldn't get some of the
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:52.520]   applications I had on my iPhone.
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.520]   And so now I'm basically iPhone and Blackberry and iPad.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:59.520]   Well, I find, see, I have the iPad, so everything I really-- you know, if I need something, I
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.520]   use the iPad.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.520]   I love-- some of the Nexus One apps are great.
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.520]   Mint is now on Nexus One.
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:09.520]   I feel like I'm drowning in, like, so much connectivity now because I have--
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.520]   We are.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:11.520]   We're drowning in connectivity, isn't it?
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:17.520]   I'm like, I have the iPad and I have my MacBook Air, my desktop, and my iPhone and my Blackberry.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:22.520]   And the real loser has been my MacBook Air, which I just opened today for the first time in,
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:23.520]   like, three weeks.
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.520]   That's not connectivity, Jason.
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.520]   That's a lot of toys.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:30.520]   Kind of connectivity is bandwidth, 3G, Wi-Fi.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.520]   Just ways to accomplish the task.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:38.520]   You know, when I find the iPad is the most delightful way to check my AdSense for the day or the
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:42.520]   analytics or chart beat or, you know, email.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:47.520]   It's really nice to do-- just read email at the end of the day or on the morning on my iPad.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:51.520]   I'm shocked at how much I love the device, you know.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:56.520]   And as pissed off as I am about it being locked up and all the other things, that email thread
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:01.520]   with Steve Jobs and the Gizmodo writer where he's like, "Listen, our idea here is to make
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:05.520]   things work and use your experience, and we have the best user experience, and one of
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.520]   you accomplished in your life, nothing's so shut up."
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.520]   Wasn't that incredible?
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:09.520]   I love it.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.520]   I mean, people were like, "Jason, how could you write back to one of your employees, you
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:16.520]   know, like, when I told that employee to, like, you know, like, congratulations at being
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.520]   employed number 4,000 at Yahoo."
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.520]   And everybody's like, "Oh my God, Jason's so offensive."
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:24.520]   And then Steve Jobs writes, "You have no life, you've contributed nothing to society.
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.520]   I have done so much, we've done so much, you need to shut up now."
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:28.520]   It's amazing.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:33.520]   But he did it such a classy kind of way, Steve Jobs is really careful tone, where he even
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.520]   used the word "gosh" at one point.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.520]   Like, it's just like, "Golly, why are you so upset about all this?"
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.520]   It was a very interesting exchange.
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:46.520]   Jobs, it's a different jobs than I think I've ever heard of or met before.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.520]   First of all, he's engaging with a stranger over email.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:55.520]   I mean, this is the guy who's famous for somebody at a meeting with Steve Jobs.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.520]   Jobs comes in, the guy says, "How is your weekend?"
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.520]   Jobs says, "Can we raise the tone of the conversation a little bit?"
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.520]   I mean, this is a guy who has no time for small talk.
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:08.520]   I think some are saying because of his illness that he is maybe a little bit of a different
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:09.520]   Steve.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:17.520]   It's a 1AM email thread with four back and forth.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.520]   I mean, it's awesome.
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:19.520]   It's incredible.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.520]   It's Ryan Tate testing out his new liver that night.
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:23.520]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.520]   I mean, when somebody else is liver, I don't know.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.520]   No, let's not make those jokes.
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:34.520]   So Ryan Tate, 934PM, Ryan Tate to S. Jobs, and he had just seen the iPad ad talking about
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.520]   revolution in Dylan.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:39.480]   It says, "Ryan says, "If Dylan were 20 today, how would he feel about your company?
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:44.040]   Would he think the iPad had the faintest thing to do with revolution?
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.040]   Revolutions are about freedom."
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:48.120]   Now that's very, a very incendiary thing to say.
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.480]   If I get that email, I ignore it at best.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:54.240]   At worst, I might say, "F you."
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:57.160]   Jobs responds, "Yep.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.840]   Freedom from programs is still your private data.
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.360]   Freedom from programs that trash your battery.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.360]   Freedom from porn.
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.360]   Yep.
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.360]   Freedom.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:09.080]   The times they are changing and some traditional PC folks feel like their world is slipping
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.080]   away.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.080]   It is."
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.480]   Now you've got to know all the subtext to really understand what that message is.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:18.760]   But that's a very rich, you know, four sentences or five sentences in there.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:19.760]   That's quite interesting.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:24.920]   I mean, he's talking about windows and Microsoft, like, and he's coming back and...
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.960]   This goes on and on and on.
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:32.800]   In fact, at one point, Ryan writes several paragraphs and I couldn't get through it.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:33.800]   Steve responds.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.800]   Yep.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.240]   The last one is the best.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.240]   Read that one.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.240]   All right.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.240]   That's worth.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.240]   We're now at 2.20 in the morning.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.240]   Yeah.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.240]   Ryan has written...
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:47.280]   And by the way, Steve's responding within minutes to each of these.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.280]   Do you think it's really Steve?
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.280]   I think it is.
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.960]   Yeah, I think so too.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:56.360]   Ryan says, "I don't like Apple's pet police force literally kicking in my co-workers'
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:57.360]   doors."
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.360]   He's finally admitted that he works for Gawker.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.600]   But I suppose the courts will have the last say on that and I can't say I'm worried.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.920]   Which is quite a shot.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:04.920]   Jobs responds again.
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.440]   I think fairly even-handed.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.400]   You are so misinformed.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.680]   No one kicked in any doors.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.680]   You're believing a lot of erroneous blogger reports.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.680]   Microsoft had...
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:19.160]   Now, this is getting back to the windows in Microsoft saying you can only use the Windows
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.160]   API.
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:24.960]   Microsoft had has every right to enforce whatever rules for their platform that they
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:25.960]   want.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:30.840]   If people don't like it, they can write for another platform, which some did, by the way.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.280]   Macintosh was the benefactor there.
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:37.200]   Or they can buy another platform, which some did.
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.400]   Clearly Jobs is a smart guy.
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:41.120]   He's leaving a lot between the lines.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.880]   But it's very clear that he's talking about Mac.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.440]   Mac was a benefactor there.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.880]   Or the benefitter there.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:52.480]   As for us, we're just doing what we can to try and make and preserve the user experience
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.720]   we envision.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:58.040]   You can disagree with us, but our motives are pure.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.920]   That's very interesting.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:02.640]   Because of course, people impute evil motives.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.840]   There certainly are pure reasons for Apple to do.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.080]   And that's what they're doing.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.840]   And they've always said, "These are our reasons."
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.720]   By the way, he says, and this is the shot.
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.960]   It is 2.20 in the morning.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.320]   The bars are closed.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.080]   By the way, what have you done that's so great?
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:22.720]   Do you create anything or just criticize others' work and belittle their motivations?
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:27.040]   And that's the only job through that job.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:30.480]   Snap, oh, no you didn't.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:33.160]   And even then, it's like that's such a minor swipe.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.120]   And that's after he's dedicated a half hour of his very valuable time.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:41.400]   I mean, I thought it's very difficult to engage somebody who's obviously fired up over something
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.560]   and to come out looking so classy.
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:44.560]   And especially--
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:45.560]   Steve won here.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:46.560]   Did he not?
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.560]   Absolutely.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:49.560]   Absolutely.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.560]   Steve Jobs for Ryan Nothing.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.800]   And it's funny because Ryan published it.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.120]   And it's published in ValleyWag.
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:02.640]   Ryan is saying that he thinks that this freedom from porn line will resonate for years and
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.640]   will hurt Apple.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.880]   You know, that's the headline.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.160]   But I don't think that's the headline.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.480]   That's the takeaway from this.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:14.200]   The takeaway is a new Steve Jobs who took a lot of time with a dick.
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:21.560]   And in every respect responded not only appropriately, but I thought fairly coherently and fairly effectively.
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.000]   I think he's trying to change his position.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.080]   He's actually trying to say like, listen, here is my position.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.480]   You don't have to accept it.
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:31.360]   But I want you to understand clearly why we're doing this.
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.400]   It's user experience and malware and viruses.
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.400]   It's amazing.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.320]   It's important to make people not want to use Windows computers.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.080]   And the reason people are buying our computers is because they don't have those things.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.080]   And I'm starting to see--
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:42.080]   Well, they don't have those things.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:45.400]   It's just they're finally getting a large enough user base to get the attraction of
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:49.360]   people that are violating it and saying you can't get porn on the iPhone.
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.840]   You know, as soon as they disable IP access and take--
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.200]   You can get porn.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:55.680]   You can get plenty of porn out there.
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:56.680]   You can't make it for me.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:57.680]   There's no lack of porn.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.680]   I mean--
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.680]   Well, I think I just talk about the application layer.
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.240]   The application layer isn't full-barred.
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.040]   It isn't like malware everywhere.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.680]   I mean, it's very hard to get a virus onto the iPhone.
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.080]   I mean, how do you do that?
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.080]   Right.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:14.960]   Now, he raises an interesting point, which says-- and this, to me, there's some reflection
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.760]   to this to the Facebook guy, Elliot Shregg, who talks to The New York Times.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:21.840]   And I'm going to get to that in a second, where he says, hey, you don't have to buy
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.600]   an iPad.
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:24.600]   This is how we do it.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.200]   We're trying to create a vision.
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.520]   We're enforcing what we envision.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.760]   But nobody's making you buy.
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:30.760]   It's a competitive world.
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:31.920]   You have a choice.
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.920]   Is that--
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.240]   That's the ultimate-- that's the ultimate rebuttal, where it's just like, you don't
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.400]   like it, go somewhere else.
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.400]   That's what we're about.
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.400]   This is how we're-- you know what?
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.520]   When you start your company, you do it that way.
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.120]   You can't argue with that.
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.680]   It's not like Apple has a monopoly.
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:47.000]   No, actually, I thought that was the best point in the whole thing.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.440]   You don't like the products?
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:49.440]   Don't buy them.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:50.440]   Nobody's making you buy it.
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.440]   And here's the good news.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.640]   Here's a solid competition from Android, from Google.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:58.160]   I think Windows Phone 7 is going to be pretty dynamic.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.760]   There's Blackberries, not dead yet.
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:04.440]   WebOS, H.P. bought Palm, that they're alive.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:06.000]   I mean, there's competition.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.200]   Blackberry is the largest by far the largest platform in terms of smartphone usage.
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.040]   It dwarfs both the iPhone and Android.
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.960]   Although Android's coming on, I mean, but you're right, Blackberry is still the best.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:20.680]   Android is still a fraction of iPhone users and iPhone users are--
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.680]   A fraction of Blackberry users.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:25.400]   And they're all a fraction of Nokia, of course.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:29.840]   Well, worldwide, the US Nokia barely has a presence at this point.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.840]   And I have to say, Nokia's struggling.
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:32.840]   In the US, primarily.
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.640]   Yeah, we're talking about smartphones, too.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:35.680]   You can be dominant.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:38.400]   You can be dominant in terms of sales and still be struggling, can't you?
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:42.720]   You could be number one today and still be in trouble.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:43.720]   Am I wrong?
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.840]   Jason, I mean, isn't that the case?
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:48.240]   The trend is not their friend.
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:52.560]   There are plenty of examples like Yahoo was number two in search and had a huge market
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.760]   share and just slowly watched it ride down.
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:55.760]   AOL.
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:59.080]   30 million user accounts down to 3 million user accounts.
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.960]   You could make a case that Apple's had that happen.
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:02.960]   Just a kid.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:04.960]   Well, I want to take a break.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.840]   We've got to talk about Facebook because there is a direct correlation between what
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:11.440]   Steve Jobs just said and what Elliot Shrig just said in the New York Times last week.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:14.080]   And I want to address that in just a second.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:18.120]   And I still want to talk you off that ledge.
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:21.600]   And I get a jump jump jump before we do that, though.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:25.240]   I want to talk a little bit about Squarespace, our good friends in the New York City Squarespace
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.680]   dot com.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:31.520]   They do a site that is just really made for somebody who wants to create a website, not
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.280]   just a blog.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.600]   Photographers use it for their portfolios.
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.280]   A lot of businesses are using Squarespace dot com.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.920]   It's the secret behind exceptional websites and you could try it for free right now.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:42.920]   No credit card needed.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:45.160]   Go to squarespace.com slash Twit.
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.280]   We're using it for our inside Twit blog.
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:51.400]   We're redesigning the website for the radio show in Squarespace.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:56.640]   The reason is every Squarespace site looks gorgeous and different.
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.400]   Look at the examples at squarespace.com.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.560]   You'll see you can make a site.
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:04.760]   You know how sometimes a Drupal or WordPress, you just know immediately when you get there.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:05.760]   Oh, that's a WordPress site.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.760]   No question.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.880]   I defy you to look at a Squarespace site and say, oh, that's a Squarespace site.
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.360]   They just are gorgeous.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:16.280]   That's because Squarespace starts with fantastic templates and then gives you full CSS and JavaScript
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.120]   capability.
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.560]   You can use the templates.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.880]   You don't have to mess with them.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:23.600]   But if you know what you're doing, you can make the design sing.
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:30.720]   Squarespace's virtual servers make it easy to create a site that never falters.
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:34.120]   That's why some of the biggest sites in the world use Squarespace and affordable.
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:37.920]   Yeah, as little as $8 a month, but I'm going to make it even more affordable.

[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:56.960]   Great stats and iPhone app that just kills.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:01.200]   Seamless blog importing from WordPress moveable type, type add and blogger.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.880]   I'm not on that iPhone app.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:06.040]   What's great about it for me is they do schwood.com.
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:10.400]   Again, like you nailed it on the CSS customization, you cannot tell.
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.520]   It looks amazing.
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:15.960]   But what's funny is I always intend to find out where my traffic is coming from and how
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:18.640]   I'm doing, but I never think to do it when I'm at the computer.
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:22.160]   It's always when I'm sitting on a bus or waiting for a plane.
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.280]   I just decide to poke in.
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:26.640]   The online app looks phenomenal on the iPhone.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.800]   And you use, I can see you use their Twitter plug-in.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.720]   They have a lot of social media plug-ins.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:31.720]   It makes it very easy.
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:32.720]   It's so easy as well.
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:38.400]   And I love the fact that my website organically, automatically updates based on my other postings
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.400]   on other things.
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.400]   That's nice.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.840]   People going to the website get a new fresh feeling every time they go.
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.840]   That's really nice.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.840]   Did you do the design?
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.120]   Do you have somebody come and do it?
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:52.800]   Well, I had an older website that had some elements that are here, but they, when we
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:57.320]   signed on and they became a sponsor of scam school, they had one of their CSS ninjas put
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.640]   it together and he just nailed it.
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:00.640]   It's amazing.
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:01.640]   It's beautiful, isn't it?
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:02.640]   Yeah.
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:03.640]   That's gorgeous.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.640]   And it's easy enough now that it's set up.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:07.880]   I can actually create entire new pages and update the content.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:10.480]   It's good for me who knows just enough to be dangerous.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:14.520]   Well, you know, if you want this column to be wider, you just drag it over.
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:15.880]   I mean, it's really, really simple.
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.160]   Anyway, give it a try.
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:20.400]   It's free for the next two weeks, squarespace.com/twit.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.560]   You don't even need a credit card.
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:24.560]   And 10% off, we all have our coupon codes.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.560]   Use mine.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.960]   When you listen to NSFW, use Brian's.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.520]   When you listen to scam school, use that one.
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:31.960]   When you listen to tech school, use that one.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:36.320]   Squarespace.com/twit, T-W-I-T for 10% off for life.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.160]   And actually, it was you, Brian, that told me that's for life.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.160]   I didn't even know that.
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.160]   That's what I get.
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:42.160]   Which can add up.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:45.000]   Because you don't jump ship from one platform to another when it comes to your website very
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   often.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   So that definitely adds up.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   Make it worthwhile.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   You bet.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.760]   So Jason, you wrote, I thought, anybody who doesn't subscribe to Jason's newsletter is
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.360]   really missing the boat.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:57.120]   You publish this thing hell off and weekly?
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.120]   It depends.
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:01.720]   I took four months off when London was born.
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:05.920]   And then I came out of this fog and I wrote literally a dozen pieces.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:08.800]   And I've been refining them and then I released them one a week.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.000]   But I've done about four in the last month.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:17.200]   So about, I would say weekly is the max and then probably monthly is-
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.200]   By the way, weezer?
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.200]   No, wait.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.200]   It's okay.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.200]   I know.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.200]   I just found that out.
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.200]   Basically-
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:26.560]   You buzzed this and I said, it's Weezer without an H-e-geezer.
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:27.560]   What do I know?
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:33.200]   I mean, it is a little ridiculous that I'm going to nursery school benefits and that's
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.400]   Weezer's playing in the backyard.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.720]   You know, if Weezer shows up, I'm there.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:37.720]   I'm there.
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.120]   Basically Weezer's kid goes to the school.
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.120]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:41.120]   Which Weezer?
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.120]   Which Weezer?
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.120]   The lead singer.
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.840]   We've had Jeff Wilcox on the show a number of times.
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:46.840]   He's great.
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:48.240]   Anyway, the newsletter is at Jason Nation.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:52.200]   I basically set up a list serve and there's 23,000 people on it.
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:57.520]   And yeah, it's a way for me to have intelligent dialogue with people because the open web
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.680]   is just not a good place for that anymore.
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:01.720]   You stopped blogging.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:03.640]   You stopped allowing comments.
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:06.720]   I basically do like photo blogs on my personal blog.
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.640]   You know, I put up photos or videos.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:13.920]   But when I put stuff on the open web, I just get every stupid person or mentally disabled
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:14.920]   person.
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.680]   You know, like the all feel.
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:18.760]   Always politically correct.
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:21.600]   Jason Gallaghen is like the owner.
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.720]   You just called your fans mentally disabled.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:24.720]   It's not a fan.
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:25.720]   It's the trolls.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:26.720]   It's basically like everybody.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:32.560]   I've either fired or beaten as a competitor, you know, over a 20 year career feels the need
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:34.160]   to check in on everything.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.440]   It just becomes this dialogue of jaders.
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:43.360]   I know it's just like if I if I send it on email, I'll get replies back from like CEOs
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:47.280]   and they'll write 500 words or 1000 words or VCs or pundits.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.440]   It's a much better dialogue for me.
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.440]   I get more out of it.
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:54.440]   So anyway, I can I find can I find this Facebook issue?
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:56.160]   Yeah, it's what did I say?
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.080]   Jen, what did I call it?
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:42:59.080]   You've got the title.
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:00.080]   You've been sucked.
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:04.840]   I know it's been like, you know, we talked the last time you were on Twitter.
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.680]   You pretty much said the same thing that that Zuckerberg.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.640]   We've been talking about this like six months ago, right?
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:12.000]   Yeah, you said that Zuckerberg was, well, I like the analogy here.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.880]   You said he's overplaying his hand.
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:14.880]   Yeah.
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:15.880]   It's a poker analogy.
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:16.880]   I know you're very serious poker player.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.480]   What do you mean?
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:24.760]   In poker, when you think your hand is stronger than it actually is and you bet like you have
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:28.800]   the nuts, the best hand and you behave that way.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:32.720]   A lot of times somebody will turn over cards and you find out, gee, I didn't actually have
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:33.720]   the best hand.
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:36.960]   You think about you said you think about all the ways you can win, but not the ways you
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.800]   can lose and not think about enough about where the risks are.
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:40.800]   Yes.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:45.280]   And the risk with Facebook, I think, is a repeated and people are really attacked me on
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:50.440]   Twitter because I said, I don't trust Zuckerberg and I think he's got an ethics problem.
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:54.320]   Well, I think the chat transcripts that have come out all the laws.
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:55.320]   Did you see that?
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:44:00.440]   So, the behavior of his organization show exactly that and people don't trust him and
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:03.240]   they don't trust the service and they should not.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:07.840]   And if you say Facebook to people, I think and do word association, the two words people
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:12.720]   will say are farmville and lack of privacy or not trustworthy.
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:17.280]   That is a terrible thing to have your service pin with as being the untrustworthy service,
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.720]   the service that violates your privacy.
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:24.560]   It's the first company I think in the history of the internet and technology that has been
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:28.600]   tagged as the place to lose your privacy and the place you can't trust.
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:30.960]   And I've got a question for you guys.
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:36.400]   I've got a question because it's and maybe I'm way off base here, but I thought it seems
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:42.280]   to me like this may be a branding issue because back when MySpace was still a player, it was
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:48.040]   MySpace versus Facebook and Facebook was winning because it had a reputation for being able
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:49.280]   to keep your stuff private.
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:53.880]   You, my default, everything was open on MySpace, but you could say things on Facebook that
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:55.240]   you wouldn't want your mom to see.
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:59.200]   And that's why people were melting down when their moms would actually join on Facebook
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.800]   and they had to see these pictures of what they're up to.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:04.160]   >> That would change the new space.
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:08.360]   >> How much of this is because they built a reputation for being good at protecting your
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:09.360]   privacy?
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:11.560]   >> Well, there's privacy and privacy.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:16.440]   There's privacy like mom not seeing your posts versus privacy like whether or not third party
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:22.440]   applications, internal databases, whether or not your actual information goes away when
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:25.720]   you delete your account actually being able to delete it accounts.
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:26.720]   You know what I mean?
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:30.560]   It's like the overt level is like mom's not going to see my posts because mom doesn't
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:36.000]   have an EDU address, ha, ha, ha, and then it's a secondary level of or lack of privacy
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.440]   would be what's happening to all the information on there.
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:43.880]   Can you refuse to have third party applications use your information or some of the second
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:46.960]   party services that work with Facebook?
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.400]   There's a lot of layers to privacy going on here.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:53.960]   >> Have you seen this Wil Moffat site open book where Wil Moffat.github.com?
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:57.160]   He's using the Facebook API.
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:01.560]   So this is all legitimate Facebook searches and he gives you a few samples like cheated
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:08.640]   test and lost virginity and shows you that what people obviously think this is private
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.320]   and it's not.
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:12.480]   And you know this was a concern.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:16.800]   I read your post Jason and then I talked to my family.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:19.600]   I talked to my kids and I said, you know, you can use Facebook.
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:23.360]   It's fine as long as you understand that everything you post on it potentially will
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:28.240]   be public whether through a lapse, through a change in policy.
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.440]   At some point it may become public.
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:36.080]   And so my strong suggestion to them was go ahead and use it just only use it as you would
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:38.560]   use Twitter where everything is public.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:39.560]   >> Right.
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:40.560]   >> And they don't want to do that.
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:43.880]   They said no, no, but that's the whole point is that we can have private conversations on
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:44.880]   here.
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:48.400]   >> There's a viable competitor to Facebook today.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.160]   I think we would see their numbers tanking.
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:54.480]   The problem and the issue is there isn't really a viable competitor out there who does
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:55.480]   private.
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:47:00.920]   >> Well, you know, like the diaspora that they're trying to put together terrible name, by the
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:02.400]   way, terrible, terrible name.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:06.160]   >> Well, you know, you understand it's the wandering tribes of Israel.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:07.880]   It's the diaspora, right?
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:10.560]   So we've left Facebook's who were wandering in the desert.
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:13.360]   So they should probably have called it Oasis, not diaspora.
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:15.600]   >> Well, that's probably like my face means something.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:17.360]   It's a word that means, oh, I get it.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:18.520]   It's a place that's mine.
[00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:19.920]   You know, Facebook, oh, I get it.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.560]   This is my public perception.
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:22.560]   This is my face.
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:23.560]   >> Well, it's a project.
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:24.560]   >> I do that meant search.
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:25.560]   >> Right.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.360]   >> Well, some brads are obvious.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:29.160]   Some brads have reduced appletons.
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:30.640]   >> It's a bad name.
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.600]   It may not be the name of whatever they come up with.
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:33.600]   And you know what?
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.600]   It's just for NYU students who thought, oh, this would be, you know, we'd like to do
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:37.600]   this.
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:38.600]   They asked for $10,000.
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:40.720]   Have you seen what it's up to now?
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:41.720]   >> Oh, dude.
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:45.280]   There's no doubt that this is addressing a very pent up demand.
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:47.280]   Like they have nothing.
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:48.760]   They have no product.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:50.560]   They have no, they've got the URL.
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:52.360]   >> They're in school still.
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:53.960]   >> But then people are throwing money.
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:56.640]   They're like, yes, please create an alternative.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:00.840]   >> I gave them, when I gave them a hundred bucks, as I deleted my Facebook account, I
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:03.640]   gave them a hundred bucks just to say, just kind of more of a statement than anything
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:04.640]   else.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:08.200]   They were at five, I think 23,000 already doubled what they'd asked for.
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:10.200]   They are now at $171,000.
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:13.600]   >> Oh my God, this is turning into an angel round of financing and they don't have to
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:14.600]   avoid any equity.
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:15.600]   This is all a donation.
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:18.160]   >> Equity, they don't have to have a freaking design.
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:21.040]   >> You don't have to have a product at all.
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:26.040]   >> You know what Ken Shebertson, our CTO here said, he said, they should write 50 lines
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.520]   of PHP code and go to Belize.
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.360]   They got no commitment to do anything.
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:32.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:36.480]   But it does speak volumes to the fact that people feel like Facebook has double tricked
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.040]   them, double crossed them.
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.040]   And they have.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:44.040]   >> It started as the closed service and we had the discussion of, you know, hey, we've
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:46.480]   changed our service to protect you more.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:50.400]   Click here to say, okay, and have all your stuff become public.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.000]   I mean, it was the ultimate bait and switch.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.120]   >> This guy's the next Mark Zuckerberg look at him.
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.120]   I mean, I can tell.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.520]   I'm not trusting my data this guy.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:02.160]   >> If not that, I can tell you there's a lot of high level discussions going on right
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.080]   now in Silicon Valley.
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:07.560]   And I've been pulled into a couple of them and they are.
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:08.560]   >> What would you do?
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:09.800]   What would you do to do it right?
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.000]   >> Well, it's very simple.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:16.200]   You just come out with it and say, I'm creating a new version that is Facebook, a new social
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:19.200]   network that is by default private.
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.520]   And if you want something to be public, you have to explicitly do it.
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:26.760]   And we promise that you will get a warning dialog box that you will have to click to
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:27.760]   make something public.
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:29.120]   And it's simple as that.
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:32.480]   And we will never change the default from private.
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:34.400]   It'll always be private.
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:37.680]   And you know, the point is absolutely correct.
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:44.640]   If they had just stuck with one thing and not become obsessed with the public facing Twitter,
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:45.960]   which is really what drove them.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:48.640]   And this is the other reason I really don't care for Zuckerberg is because I feel like
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:49.640]   he's just chasing.
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:50.640]   >> He's just chasing.
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:51.840]   >> He's just chasing everybody.
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:56.480]   And the thing that makes me crazy about him is you can tell he's so brilliant and such
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:50:04.240]   a good executor on things and has such low moral fiber that that's a really dangerous
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.240]   conversation.
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:08.320]   Do you think he's immoral or amoral?
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:10.480]   Do you know what I mean by the difference?
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:11.480]   >> Absolutely.
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:13.440]   >> Is he evil or just lax ethics?
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:19.720]   >> I think he is, and I said in my newsletter Asperger's like, I was very careful to say
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:21.800]   like because I don't want to diagnose anybody.
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:25.960]   But I don't think that he cares or particularly thinks about the users.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:31.520]   I think he thinks about building a huge $100 billion company and becoming the next Bill
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:32.760]   Gates.
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:36.880]   And he thinks about himself and he thinks about what would make the biggest, most powerful
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.120]   company.
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:40.040]   And it doesn't ever occur to him.
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:42.120]   Well, what did I promise the users?
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:47.240]   And gee, if other companies came up with these great ideas, should I really be incorporating
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:48.440]   them into my product like this?
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:49.880]   Maybe I should try to buy some of these companies.
[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:54.120]   I mean, this sort of a gentleman's rule in the valley where like, if you were going to
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:56.760]   knock off Four Square, you would at least go to them and say, hey, listen, I think your
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:57.760]   features are great.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:58.760]   I'm inspired by you.
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:50:59.760]   Maybe we buy the company.
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:01.840]   >> I think you did that to me.
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:05.440]   I think Jason actually did do that to me just before you.
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:07.640]   >> Yeah, just before I stabbed you.
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:09.080]   >> Yeah, it was right before then.
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.080]   Oh, now he froze.
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:11.080]   Okay.
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:12.080]   >> Okay.
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:14.480]   >> Jason and I are buddies where you've never stopped being buddies.
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:18.160]   And I don't know what that was another case of just kind of things spin out of control
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:19.160]   a little bit.
[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:23.160]   And I'm a little sensitive to, you know, when people like Facebook say, look, this is bloggers,
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:24.160]   it's out of control.
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:28.600]   In fact, they even said it's the media that hates us.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:30.080]   Our users love us.
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:33.040]   >> Yeah, the users don't know.
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:34.040]   >> That's because they don't know.
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:35.040]   >> They don't know.
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:38.000]   >> That's why I deleted my Facebook.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.760]   I did not deactivate it.
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:40.760]   I deleted it.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:44.320]   I deleted my private page and our Twitter page and our public stuff.
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:47.760]   And the reason is not because I don't know.
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:48.760]   I know.
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:51.720]   I know exactly, you know, I only post stuff that's public there.
[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:53.880]   I'm not worried about my privacy.
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:57.280]   I'm not worried about them selling my data.
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:00.720]   I'm not worried about them misrepresenting their policies.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:05.040]   I don't want to coerce other people into participating in Facebook because that's how
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:06.160]   they would participate with me.
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:08.360]   I don't want to be a shill for Facebook.
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:12.080]   >> So how do you use the word coerce, which I thought was a little bit strong?
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:14.640]   You're not physically threatening them if they do.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:15.640]   You're listening.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:16.640]   You need to use the Facebook.
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:20.760]   I mean, it's like you, you, you're giving a tacit endorsement of it, which maybe you're
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:21.760]   uncomfortable with.
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:24.360]   But I mean, I think coerce is a kind of a strong word.
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:28.200]   But look, if you want to see that picture I posted on Facebook or you want to see that
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:29.960]   video I posted on Facebook or you.
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:31.520]   >> How about Kim Pell?
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:37.020]   >> I think coerce is exactly the right word in my mind because I'm incenting people to
[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:40.120]   join Facebook in order to interact with me.
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:44.160]   You know, we were one of the things I was doing is, you know, I had five on the five,
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:50.520]   I took two accounts, a personal account and a public account and with 5,000 fans.
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:52.560]   And those people, we were wishing them happy birthday, right?
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:53.920]   Because wait a minute, we know what their birthday is.
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:57.640]   It says, you know, 30 people a day, it's their birthday.
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:01.200]   It's that kind of interaction that we were offering that you don't get anywhere else.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:03.840]   I don't wish you happy birthday on Twitter.
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:07.440]   And in a way that's, if you want to be part of that, you have to be, it's the same thing
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.760]   with Farmfield.
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:10.880]   There's a subtle coercion, Brian.
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:14.400]   >> I still have a problem with the word coercion.
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:17.840]   And again, I understand if you don't want to be associated with it, that's one thing.
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:21.520]   But to say that somehow you're forcing someone against their will, I mean, unless-
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:23.600]   >> No, not against their will, not against their will.
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:25.280]   >> Brian and I have both working night clubs.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:29.920]   >> Clubs, coercion usually involves having to donate some of your, you know, gate so
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:32.240]   you can get your equipment back up back to others.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:34.880]   >> Which is usually just a stronger association with that.
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:35.880]   >> You're right.
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.080]   I'll use the word encourage.
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.080]   Is encourage okay?
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:39.080]   >> Yeah, absolutely.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:43.600]   >> So am I the only one who has a really hard time, anytime I see Mark Zuckerberg's name
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:49.320]   now divorcing this person from the character portrayed in the accidental billionaires?
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:51.280]   But now that I've read that book-
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:52.280]   >> No, I know.
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:57.480]   >> Actually, it's so, it's so damning of him that it's just like, it's hard for me to separate
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:58.480]   that.
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:01.240]   >> Isn't it interesting though that all the things that were like the recent IAM stuff
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:07.520]   we're seeing all kind of coincides exactly with the way he's portrayed in that book?
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:08.720]   >> It's hard not to notice.
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:09.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:10.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:11.720]   >> It's pretty scary.
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:16.200]   I mean, and the fact is, you know, the business insiders done an incredible job with these scoops.
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:19.720]   And I think that they have a source who was involved in some of the lawsuits-
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:21.080]   >> You think it's Eduardo?
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:22.440]   >> I don't know.
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:26.680]   And I don't want to even insinuate that I might know, like I'm an insider I know, which
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:27.680]   I do sometimes.
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:30.120]   This isn't one of those cases where I do not know.
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:31.560]   Really, I don't.
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:36.280]   And I think somebody who's involved in that lawsuit, who got screwed by him, and there's
[00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:38.040]   a long list of people now, right?
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:42.040]   Eduardo connect you guys and a lot of other people.
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:46.040]   They have access to discovery documents and discovery documents for those people don't
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:47.040]   know when you're in a lawsuit.
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:52.240]   There's a period of discovery and you have to legally give up all of this information,
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:53.240]   especially with it.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:56.920]   Like, so when these lawsuits happen, they might say any communication with Zuckerberg,
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:55:01.040]   we need, including your IAM transcripts, including your emails, whatever it is.
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:05.000]   Well, the stuff that was really damning is he broke according to this scoop.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:10.880]   I don't know if it's true or not, but reportedly he broke into journalist's emails accounts.
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:15.720]   And then he faced a Harvard ethics review.
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:18.240]   And he also wrote that IM chat chat.
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:20.800]   All of that was in the accidental billionaires, by the way.
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:21.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:27.440]   And also the IM chat chat transcript that said he was purposely going to delay the launch
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:31.960]   of connect you site, which they paid him to build in order to screw them and launch Facebook
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:34.200]   at the same time and set them back.
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:35.880]   By the way, that's like, well, fraud.
[00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:37.480]   That's like very high level fraud.
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:39.080]   But remember he's a college sophomore.
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:40.080]   He's a kid.
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:41.080]   Yeah, you know what, though?
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:42.080]   That doesn't fly.
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:45.360]   If you're 18, 19, 20 years old and you want to be a billionaire and you want to raise hundreds
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:48.560]   of millions in the venture capital, you can't have it both ways.
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:52.120]   If you're sad enough to raise tens of millions of venture capital when you're 18 or 19 years
[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:53.920]   old, you know, right from wrong.
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:58.360]   And if you did electronic trespassing and some hacker who did it can go to jail for five
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:00.080]   years, you know, it's Zuckerberg, Ken.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:02.080]   And so, you know, that's true.
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:03.080]   That's true.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:04.080]   That's true.
[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:05.080]   This 2018 year old hackers who went to jail.
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:06.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:11.400]   I think this, you know, like little bit of Harvard, you know, glow on him, you know, gets
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:15.440]   him a pass and this, you know, anointed by all these venture capitalists and being so
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:18.520]   effective at building product gives him a little bit of pass.
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:21.760]   And I think it built up his ego and he is overplaying his hand.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:24.200]   And now the chickens are coming home to roost.
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:26.000]   And it's in mainstream media now.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:30.640]   Once a virus like this gets unleashed in mainstream media and the movie comes out in
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:32.880]   a couple of months, October 10th, Facebook's done.
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:33.880]   I think Facebook's done.
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:35.880]   This is the beginning of the downhill.
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:37.480]   Gosh, that would have 400 million users.
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:38.480]   How could it be done?
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:40.840]   Well, it's actually 30 million users.
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:43.320]   I mean, how could anything get huge like that get done?
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:46.400]   And my space, you know, got collapsed.
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:47.880]   People said friends to would never collapse.
[00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:50.000]   It's not going to happen till there's an alternative.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:54.320]   People like you, like you, Brian, need and use Facebook.
[00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:56.080]   It's a valuable tool for you.
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:57.080]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:01.680]   And I would like to point out that this exact scenario was posited on this week in tech
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:02.680]   like two years ago.
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:08.560]   I can't remember if it was Devorak or who, but everyone was marveling at how big Facebook
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:09.640]   had gotten.
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:14.080]   And I think it was John C. Devorak that pointed out like the problem is it's a fickle market.
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:18.960]   These are adolescents that are choosing one trendier thing over another thing.
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:20.600]   And that comes and goes.
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:26.160]   And I think the moment that something else like out of the entire pitch that Jason put
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:28.600]   together the most important word was new.
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:32.680]   But everything after that, I'm sure is good and privacy is good, but the moment the kids
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:34.880]   here knew there's a chance there's another option.
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:38.800]   There's another way to go, especially when you have such a bad PR problem, the way Facebook
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:40.400]   does right now.
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:45.200]   So you think it's sinking in with real people or at least the, you know, perceptions reality,
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:47.400]   I guess, you know, I don't know.
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:50.200]   So May 31st is Facebook, quit Facebook day.
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:55.480]   It seems to me that more people will join Facebook that day than will quit it.
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:59.320]   In fact, more people will join Facebook in one hour of that day than will quit it.
[00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:03.440]   In fact, maybe even more faced people will join Facebook in one minute than will quit
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:04.440]   it.
[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:06.680]   I mean, it's thousands, maybe tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands.
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:08.120]   It's a drop in the bucket.
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:11.520]   Yeah, they, they're up to almost 2000 people.
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:12.520]   I quit.
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:13.520]   I quit Facebook.
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:14.520]   So when are you going to quit, Jason?
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:15.520]   You got me to quit.
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:16.520]   I am.
[00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:17.520]   Jump.
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:18.520]   Jump.
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:19.520]   Jump.
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:20.520]   I, you know, I'm right now I am considering it.
[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:21.520]   And I think.
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:22.520]   Why haven't you?
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:29.600]   Well, I've basically my usage of Facebook now is limited to like syndicating marketing stuff
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:30.680]   from Twitter or whatever.
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:34.160]   I don't really use it that much, but I agree with your argument and I think I'm going to
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:35.160]   clear up.
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:36.760]   I got to get my photos out of there.
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:41.360]   And then once I get my photos out, I think I may deactivate it this week because I, the
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:43.280]   truth is I don't get any value out of it.
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:44.520]   I really don't find it valuable.
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:46.000]   Yeah, I don't miss it at all.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.880]   I don't even know if it was much PR value to be honest with you.
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:51.760]   In fact, I got more press requests.
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:58.000]   I got press requests from quitting from CNN from CBC from the several local television
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   newspapers.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:03.840]   I mean, financial times printed my name and said, in fact, the one of the reasons I didn't
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:06.400]   do all those interviews, I didn't want to be known as Facebook quitting boy.
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:09.440]   I mean, I didn't want it to become my trademark, you know.
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:13.280]   Well, can you actually, can you really get your photos out of it?
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:14.280]   Yes.
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:15.280]   Here's my suggestion.
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:19.720]   As I was unhesitant to quit is I'd been using backup a file along.
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:20.720]   Yes.
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:25.120]   And this had, you know, I have all my Facebook stuff.
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:31.160]   If I go to my Facebook, you know, my backup a file account and I look in my archives,
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:34.200]   I've got every photo, every video that I've ever posted there.
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:35.760]   And unfortunately, I did this a while ago.
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:37.120]   So I don't even have to think about it.
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:39.040]   It was like, there's nothing I've lost.
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:42.280]   So they don't have archival copies stashed anywhere and Facebook?
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:44.280]   Oh, you mean, is it going to go away?
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:45.280]   Because I deleted it.
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:46.280]   That's a very good question.
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:47.280]   I don't know.
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:51.600]   I don't think if other people comment on it, I don't think it goes away.
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:52.600]   No, it's right.
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:55.360]   It's got becomes an anonymous post that somebody's commented on.
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:57.360]   So it's like, it's even worse.
[00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:02.280]   I mean, it's just like how slimy can you get, you know, it's like, that's just the worst.
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.080]   And it's a full disclosure.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:08.360]   I'm an angel investor and backup a file and they were at the open angel forum and I am
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:09.360]   backing it up there.
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:10.360]   So I forgot.
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:11.360]   Yeah.
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:14.240]   So I think I can, I think I can jump.
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:15.240]   Yeah, I did.
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:17.840]   You know, I was actually very relieved when I thought about it.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:22.040]   They've got everything in here, you know, and it's actual JPEGs.
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.760]   You know, I can actually see them.
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:24.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:29.400]   This was a big controversy if we were and what will probably happen this week, unfortunately
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:33.000]   is because I've been involved in some of the discussions.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.440]   I don't think Facebook likes this backup feature.
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:36.440]   Oh, really?
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:39.640]   I'm pretty sure that now that you've mentioned it, it's going to be turned off.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:40.640]   You're kidding.
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:41.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:45.720]   It's, it's been like a little bit of an underground thing, but other people who've built backup
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:52.520]   tools for Facebook or export your social graph have been shut down and sent law legal
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:53.520]   letters.
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.080]   So that's not good.
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.080]   Well, quick.
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:57.080]   So what happens?
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:00.120]   Join back up a fight.com before the show airs.
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.960]   Those of you watching live.
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:04.440]   And for those of you listening, I'm sorry.
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:10.240]   For those of you who had, you know, one thing people don't know.
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.240]   And stuff like that.
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.240]   Oh, there's lots of ways.
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.840]   And the truth is I never posted anything.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:18.000]   I'd have another, you have somewhere else because I knew that Facebook was downgrading
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.120]   the quality of all the pictures that you post there.
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.280]   Those are not full quality.
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.680]   So it's a lousy place to store pictures.
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:24.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:25.680]   So it's, this is interesting.
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:27.480]   So it's like you're quitting Facebook on principle.
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:31.160]   Cause as you mentioned, you're not worried about the privacy settings to you, you use
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:32.560]   Facebook as a megaphone, right?
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:34.400]   And I think all of us are of the same same.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:37.160]   Yeah, we're, we're the wrong people to talk to, talk to my kids.
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.160]   Right.
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:40.480]   And that's who, that's who I wish was represented on the panel.
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:44.760]   Cause all four of us are, are the type of people who are, were producers of content,
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:48.560]   not consumers, or at least we don't consume, we don't use Facebook as a, well, that's
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:54.440]   why I'm taking a big, you know, I never, I never use it as a megaphone.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:59.080]   I started signing up for it and just realizing that there just wasn't a lot of value out
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.080]   of it for me.
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:05.800]   Plus also actually, I didn't particularly want the, the difficulties in locking things
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:09.080]   down for me early on when I finally showed up on Facebook.
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:12.520]   I just, I just didn't trust it.
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:15.920]   Look at this business, this graphic from business day in the New York Times, it was
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:16.920]   May 12th.
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:17.920]   Brilliant.
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:18.920]   I was actually going to bring that up.
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:23.400]   There's a 50 different settings with more than 170 options.
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:27.360]   Facebook says they want to make privacy controls as granular as possible.
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:31.320]   The reality is it's a nightmare, the way in the last couple of evolutions of Facebook
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:35.520]   to try to figure out, you know, with everything basically being default public.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:39.880]   There's a ridiculous, ridiculous number of options inside of this.
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.120]   No, it'd be great.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.600]   And maybe they'll do this on diaspora.
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:47.680]   But what if you just had like three different orbit, you had the innermost orbit, which
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:51.000]   was your family and you could place, it wasn't just you were a friend of them or you're not
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.920]   a friend, but you had like, you know, you had, you had your mercury orbit closest to
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:58.320]   the sun, you had your Jupiter orbit where there, these are friends, these are colleagues,
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:02:59.400]   these are coworkers.
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:02.400]   And then there's the last orbit, which is people you met at a party and you kind of
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:07.880]   like, and you could very quickly and simply and easily decide what level of content you
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:08.880]   were releasing.
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:12.440]   Well, and that's that opt in versus opt out.
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:16.320]   All they had to do, all they have to do today is bake it.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.720]   And this was kind of the reason I think regular people don't understand the problem is they
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:24.680]   think this is still the case that everything is private unless you say otherwise.
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:29.720]   And if they just said everything is private, if you flip a switch, you can make it public,
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:33.240]   but it is private will stay private forever and ever.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.240]   But they don't.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:38.120]   In fact, this is the other part of the New York Times infographic.
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:42.480]   The Facebook privacy statement in 2005, it was a thousand words.
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:46.080]   Today it's 5,830 words.
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:51.120]   It's bigger than the US Constitution twice the size of my spaces, more than 10 times
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:55.240]   bigger than flickers, five times bigger than Twitter's.
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:57.400]   It's it's unreadable.
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.400]   Now here's my question.
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.400]   Is this intentional?
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.920]   Are they obfuscating things or are they actually well meaning?
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:06.520]   Did they just kind of screw up?
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:11.160]   I think this is all part of a master strategy they have.
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:13.880]   You think it's part of being sucked?
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:16.400]   I think we've been sucked.
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.400]   We've been suckered.
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.600]   We've been sucker punched.
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:22.840]   You know, it's it's it's his process, I think his processes.
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:26.240]   Brian, do you think you think Facebook's evil or just confused?
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.680]   No, first of all, you guys got you guys got to get a grip.
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:30.440]   First of all, Facebook's a private company.
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:31.760]   They'll do whatever the hell they want.
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:35.520]   And if they if it agrees with the user base, then they're going to get away with it.
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:38.480]   If the user base doesn't like it, they're going to move on to something else.
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:41.240]   And this is a this is a fickle market to begin with.
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:45.480]   This is something where through no fault of Facebook's own, a lot of people gave up on
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.480]   Facebook when their mom joined.
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:49.400]   And that's not something that Facebook can control.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:54.320]   The nature of these social sites is that people are always looking for the next big thing.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:58.560]   And it may be that we're about as clearly everybody's piling on right now, but it's
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:02.400]   like as far as, you know, is it right or wrong or morally right or wrong?
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:06.120]   It's like you vote with your dollars and you vote with your feet and people are going
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:07.920]   to go somewhere else if it's a big problem.
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:10.360]   And if it's not, then Facebook will be fine.
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:17.800]   Yeah, it doesn't forgive them from acting unethically and doing the baiting switch and
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:20.760]   from having a leader who people don't trust.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.020]   So you are correct.
[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:23.040]   People will vote with their dollar.
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:26.120]   And what we're seeing right now is that that process is happening.
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:31.560]   And if there is a viable competitor that is even just on par, you will see people leave
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.600]   over the trust issue.
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.800]   And this is a good sign.
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:39.680]   And, you know, people have wondered when will people care about privacy?
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:40.680]   Well, guess what?
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:44.000]   People are starting to care because I'm talking to normal folks and they're like, I don't
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   trust that Facebook.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.400]   So the same way you can do people and be like, oh, Facebook's private and they don't know
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:49.560]   it's not private.
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:51.080]   You can actually do people the other way.
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:54.200]   And they'll be like, oh, you can't trust the Facebook.
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:57.360]   You know, that's not a trustworthy service.
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:00.880]   Some of the in the chat room was complaining that I was saying that perception is reality.
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.720]   And in many things, it shouldn't be or it isn't.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:08.160]   But when it comes to a social network and especially FADs, perception is definitely reality.
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:11.480]   And it'll be interesting to see how Facebook tries to spin this one.
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:14.000]   Yeah, they and they have not handled it well to date.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.520]   I mean, they literally say nothing about it.
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:22.600]   And when there was the big comments about Zuckerberg saying people are so stupid or whatever he
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:29.080]   said in his IM chat script about the user base when he was a kid or younger, it's like
[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:32.200]   on the one hand, you know, we all know that's totally unfair and taken out of context.
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:36.240]   But on their hand, there's a reason that we're also giddy to see that because it's so perfectly
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:43.240]   encapsulates the suspicions people have about Facebook about Mark Zuckerberg, Patrick Facebook,
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:47.680]   immoral or just he'll run.
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:52.960]   You know, I kind of leaning towards the private company pushing to get his I don't know whether
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:55.400]   it being privately held has a whole lot to do with it.
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:07:01.920]   But I think they're just pushing to maximize, you know, their revenue opportunities.
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:05.560]   And if if you know, you know, a moral.
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:09.040]   That's kind of for sleazy to calling on morality.
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:11.040]   But you know, it's certainly sleazy.
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:13.840]   And I think a lot of cases, most people don't care.
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:19.240]   I would be really curious to see, you know, it amazes me what people post on.
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:22.960]   And there are still people using my space, but people post on my space and Facebook and
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:27.400]   are shocked when somebody reads about it, you know, it's an interesting.
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:32.480]   It's an it's it's a larger philosophical question because I think corporations as opposed to
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:36.680]   individuals are fundamentally immoral corporations are designed, not immoral.
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:37.680]   I'm sorry, amoral.
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:42.000]   They're designed to maximize profits.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.760]   And yet corporate governance, look what's happening to Facebook, corporate governance
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:53.280]   would you would think would you maximize profits also by being good, right?
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:55.160]   I serving your, I serving your customer.
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:08:00.000]   And clearly at this moment, whether it be in the way they're handling the PR or whether
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.360]   it be the very decisions that they're making about privacy, they're clearly not serving
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:07.120]   their customer base at this time.
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:09.440]   We're going to take a break, come back with more.
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:13.400]   I was trying to see if my mom was on Skype, mom, if you're watching, get on Skype, because
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.680]   there's a normal person.
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:16.840]   She's actually not that normal.
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:24.400]   Every time I Skype in, we get your mom on the show because she loves you, Brian.
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:28.480]   I'm trying to hook you to a no, because I'm just curious.
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:31.760]   I think as I remember when I started talking about this, mom sent me a note saying, how
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:33.600]   do I get off the Facebook?
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:34.960]   How do I stop this thing?
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:37.600]   I want to get off the Facebook.
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:38.600]   So I'm going to see.
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:39.600]   Everybody is liking everything.
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.080]   What if I don't like it?
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:43.080]   Stop poking me.
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:44.080]   Watch this.
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:45.080]   It's crazy.
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.440]   You keep poking me.
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:48.440]   I put a photo.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:49.440]   Everybody's got a comment.
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:51.120]   I don't everybody's got something to say.
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:52.600]   That's why I like photo albums better.
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:53.600]   There's no room for comment.
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.800]   No, I don't want to hear what you have to say.
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:09:00.520]   It's a perfectly good technology when it was in a photo album.
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:03.040]   I want to talk a little bit about audible.com.
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:05.400]   This is there we go again.
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:06.680]   Here we go again.
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:08.680]   Jason loves that audible.
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:13.520]   Audible is a course that bookstore out of the audio books and shows and entertainment.
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:16.560]   75,000 strong and now plays on 500 different devices.
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.000]   Still working on that Android version.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000]   I'm sure that's soon.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:25.200]   But until then, of course, every other device, including your Kindle, your zoom, your iPod,
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:31.640]   iPod, iPad, all the devices, iRiver, the SANS as many GPS's as well.
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:33.480]   I'll tell you, I love audible.
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:36.440]   We should really actually make accidental billionaires our pick.
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:37.920]   I don't know about that.
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:38.920]   I have another book.
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:40.080]   Okay, go ahead, Jason.
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.080]   Go ahead.
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:45.840]   You know, just I have the kid now and so I'm trying to catch up on things and you're
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:50.760]   busy and I have the audible to a month's subscription.
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:52.200]   And I'm like, wait a second.
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.720]   There's a lot of books on being a parent.
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:55.080]   I need to start listening to these.
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.960]   I don't have time to read them.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.360]   This is important information.
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:02.200]   In fact, critical.
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:04.640]   I love Pope Bronson.
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:06.360]   Amazing book.
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:10.000]   I am so glad I found this book is going to make me a better parent.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.240]   So if you are out there and you're a parent, you have no excuse.
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:18.440]   Get on the audible and get the stuff on your iPad, your iPhone and your desktop.
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:20.720]   It remembers where you were.
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:23.880]   It marks it basically, even if you change devices.
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:25.280]   So I'll get to my desktop.
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:27.200]   It knows that I'm on chapter five.
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:30.560]   I'll listen to a little bit on my desktop, then I'll listen to a little on my phone.
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:31.560]   And what a great book.
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:35.600]   It really talks about, you know, this generation of kids where you say like, oh, you're so
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:36.600]   good, you're good.
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.560]   And actually, that's not what you should say.
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:41.120]   Even though you think you should say too much praise.
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.120]   Too much praise.
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.440]   You should be saying, you know, describe their behavior.
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:45.440]   You did this.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:46.680]   Yeah, it's the self esteem.
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:47.680]   They correct.
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:53.120]   And a lot of other common, you know, sense ideas in the late 20th century and a lot of
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.120]   the really bad.
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:57.800]   They're basically correcting a lot of bad, propagated ideas that have come out through
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:01.920]   the media and other places in the last 20 years.
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.360]   It's a spectacular piece of book.
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.680]   And it's also based on a lot of spectacular research.
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.760]   Yeah, we interviewed Ashley Merriman.
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:12.480]   Here is his co-author who did a lot of that research on jumping monkeys, our mommy cast
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.280]   and fascinating.
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:15.280]   Really great stuff.
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:18.920]   Although a word of warning, if you are the parent of adult children or teenagers, it's
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:19.920]   too late.
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.320]   And you may not want to read this because you've already screwed up.
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.560]   And there's pretty much nothing you can do right now.
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:29.440]   So if you're a parent of a young child like you, Jason, this is okay.
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:32.760]   Actually, if you're a parent of an older child, that's too late with them.
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:33.760]   My kids are screwed up.
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:36.360]   And then you can have the cathartic offense of saying like, hey, I didn't know.
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:37.440]   I blew it.
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:38.440]   I blew it.
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:39.440]   Don't hate me.
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:40.440]   I blew it.
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:45.440]   Maybe I should just I'll play this for Henry when he's sleeping.
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:47.440]   Your parents suck.
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:48.440]   Parents.
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.440]   They praise you.
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:50.440]   You know, he's funny.
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.920]   He totally knows about this stuff.
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:55.880]   He talks about the soccer trophies, you know, where everybody gets a trophy.
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:59.160]   You know, I mean, he know, he totally knows.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:02.800]   This is somehow sunk into the psyche of teenagers.
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:03.800]   Thank God.
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:05.560]   Nurture shock, a very good recommendation.
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:08.120]   New thinking about children, accidental billionaires.
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:12.240]   That's the story of the Facebook founding starting in Harvard, a fascinating book.
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:13.800]   There's two before the movie comes out.
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:14.800]   Yeah.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.920]   I'll go to list now because you're then you can see the movie with like having actually
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:17.920]   read the book.
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:18.920]   Right.
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:19.920]   So much better.
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.080]   Like book was better.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:26.360]   We interviewed, you know, Dana Brunetti is a good friend of the show.
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:30.320]   He is a Kevin Spacey's partner on Tergier Street is producing the accidental billionaires
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:31.400]   movie.
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:38.120]   We interviewed him and the author of accidental billionaires on a net at night a few months.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:41.160]   Really interesting, fascinating and a great book.
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.160]   Audible.com.
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:43.160]   Here's the deal.
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:45.040]   If you go to audible.com/twit2, you'll sign up today.

[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:50.520]   That's the one I subscribe to.
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:53.080]   Two books is a minimum for me.
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:54.680]   I know people have multiple platinum accounts.
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:55.680]   They listen to so many books.
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:57.200]   If you have a big commute, that kind of thing.
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:02.360]   If you're rolling across the ocean, Roz listens to a book a day, a book a day because she's
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:03.360]   rolling the whole time.
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:06.120]   And she said, by the way, she wrote across the Atlantic without Audible.
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.880]   I turned her on to Audible for her row across the Pacific.
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:10.160]   She is so grateful.
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:12.680]   She said, my God, I couldn't imagine rolling across an ocean.
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:14.520]   She's going to do the Indian Ocean next year.
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:16.680]   She said, I couldn't imagine it without Audible.
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:18.880]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:22.400]   To sign up for the platinum account, that's two books a month, first month's free.
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:23.400]   So you get two books free.
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:26.080]   You can cancel at any time, never owe a penny and keep that book forever.
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:27.520]   So this is two free books.
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:29.160]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:33.360]   For those of you listening outside the US, my apologies, this offer is available to you,
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:36.080]   but not all the books we talk about are, and I do apologize for that.
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:39.480]   And that has to do with a very complex world of publishing.
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:40.480]   Book licensing.
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:41.480]   That's crazy.
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:42.480]   Talking about annually.
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:43.480]   Well, that's how authors get paid.
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:44.720]   They get paid for territory.
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.840]   So everything's a negotiation.
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:52.480]   So yeah, so the audiobook may not be available in a country or maybe a different audiobook
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:53.960]   in that country, whatever.
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:57.880]   Or God forbid, you had a tour server and you logged in and had an IP address from another
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:01.800]   country and created an account for Spotify or other services.
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:03.080]   You might be able to get around it somehow.
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:04.720]   I never thought about that.
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:09.200]   As long as your credit card also agrees with the IP address on the tour account.
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:12.680]   Now, Jason, is that amoral or immoral?
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:13.880]   That is practical.
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:17.040]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:20.320]   We thank you so much for their support of this week in Tech and Allish shows.
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:24.200]   They've been one of our most staunch supporters all along.
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:25.520]   Just a great product.
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:26.520]   There's so many stories.
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:29.920]   I think it would be important and proper of me to mention the Facebook privacy issues
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:36.000]   and not mention the fact that Google's Street View was collecting data inadvertently, they
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:43.800]   say, from open access points, like 600 terabytes of data or something like that.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:51.720]   There was a pro -- due to a programming error in 2006, I don't know.
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:52.720]   Most of you probably know this.
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:57.080]   When the street view cars are driving around, they're also mapping Wi-Fi access spots to
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:58.080]   GPS locations.
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:00.160]   It's like a poor man's GPS.
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:04.200]   They can say, "Well, if you can see on your iPad or your Wi-Fi iPad, you can see this
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.120]   access point and this one and this one's stronger.
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.120]   Oh, you must be here.
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.760]   They triangulate you.
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:10.680]   There's other companies like Skyhook that do this."
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:11.920]   So they were collecting this data.
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.520]   That's normal and perfectly legal.
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:15.480]   It's your broadcasting.
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:22.040]   They would collect the GPS location, the MAC address, and the Wi-Fi access SSID.
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:24.840]   However, whoops, thief.
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:29.800]   There was some code and in the case of non-passive protected Wi-Fi networks in Europe, the United
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:35.080]   States and other major regions, they also collected whatever data was going through
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:39.280]   the air at that time and saved it to a hard drive.
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:41.720]   You got to remember this is unencrypted data.
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:43.720]   This is the equivalent of...
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:48.600]   First of all, to me, it's a little bit hilarious that people have been out of shape over this.
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:54.640]   While nobody has a problem with cars driving around taking pictures of your physical houses.
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:56.640]   We caught Patrick Norton.
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:57.640]   The Germans don't like...
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:58.640]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:15:59.960]   Patrick, you're in this review, aren't you?
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:00.960]   Are you still in it?
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:01.960]   I'm going to be honest.
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:07.800]   I thought this was masterful headline writing for a non-starting story because I saw this
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:13.960]   and I've been using Gmail for everything except for my corporate account.
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:20.080]   For years, all this information, Google Docs, my calendar, some scumbag employee inside
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:24.040]   of Google is rooting through people's accounts and I get to the article and I'm like, they
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:27.160]   captured information from open access points.
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:28.160]   Who cares?
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.160]   Fragment.
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:30.160]   Fragment.
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:31.160]   Fragment.
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:32.160]   Fragment.
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:33.160]   Fragment.
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:34.160]   Fragment.
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:38.600]   Like, if you're one of the people that doesn't lock down your access point, congratulations,
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:39.760]   you learned a lesson.
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:46.000]   By the way, if you're on cable, if you have cable internet, all your information that's
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.120]   not encrypted to the point that you're connecting to is open and available.
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:53.680]   By the way, people can sniff your email, wake up to reality.
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:58.320]   This is how much data does Comcast have access to?
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:02.160]   Let's face it, as the ISP, massive ISP, they've got it all.
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:06.460]   If you wanted to go after Google about a privacy issue, the issue is how long do they keep
[01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:07.460]   user data?
[01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:08.460]   Right.
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:13.000]   And that's the real issue that nobody's really been talking about, but I don't understand
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:18.680]   why any of these search engines need to keep over just a month or two of data.
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:19.680]   It seems very weird.
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:21.080]   I don't know why they should do it at all.
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:22.080]   They should--
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:23.080]   No, I thought they were legal.
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:24.080]   I thought they had to retain the--
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:26.040]   So here's what, 18 now or something.
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.040]   18 months, I think.
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:28.040]   18 months, I thought.
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:29.040]   18 months, I thought.
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:30.040]   Okay.
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:31.040]   Yeah.
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:38.660]   I have to say, kudos to Google for-- they discovered this and stepped forward before
[01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:40.720]   it was revealed by others.
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:42.160]   And they immediately took care of it.
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:43.320]   It is minor.
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:44.320]   It was a story.
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.320]   They took a hit on it.
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:46.320]   I think you're right.
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:47.560]   I think it's a silly story, but they took a hit on it.
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:49.400]   And I think they handled it appropriately.
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:53.560]   And I think that's an example of handling an issue well as opposed to the way Facebook's
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:55.200]   handled its issues.
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:58.840]   Basically, they're building credibility by how they're handling this as opposed to
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:01.040]   Zuckerberg who continues to lose credibility.
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:02.040]   Yeah.
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:04.640]   They pulled the jobs instead of a Zuckerberg on this one.
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:05.640]   Exactly.
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:06.840]   That's being a jobs Apple.
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:12.960]   Apparently, according to Bloomberg, Apple did, in fact, press local police to investigate.
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:17.040]   In fact, we now know that Steve Jobs, a court document, Steve Jobs, called Gizmodo, said,
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:19.040]   "Give me back my phone."
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:20.440]   Yeah, why-- this is another story.
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:23.200]   I'm like, duh, they filed a complaint with the local police.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:24.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:27.920]   And because they're Apple and they had a relationship with the task force, they called the biggest
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:34.640]   stick they had access to and the task force went after these guys.
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:40.720]   And maybe you guys can clear my head up on this, but I'm not feeling a lot of sympathy
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:42.800]   for Gizmodo on this one.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:52.880]   Because I'm reading the EFF and they're saying it's the reporter's shield law and basically
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:55.680]   they're claiming the reporting shield law applies here.
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:19:00.120]   The warrant that allowed them to take the computers from Jason's-- Jason Chen's house
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:01.120]   is bogus.
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:03.560]   And I'm like, they don't really care.
[01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:05.760]   They just wanted to-- you know what I mean?
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:07.520]   It's like, at what point is this a shield law?
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:10.600]   And at what point is this theft of property and--
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:14.880]   It's like, is this reasonable if you're-- if your phone-- if you feel your phone was stolen,
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:15.880]   you call the cops.
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:16.880]   Right.
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:19.120]   Completely reasonable.
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:24.880]   And Gawker Media is abusing the shield laws which were intended to protect journalists when
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:29.960]   there are times when for the social good you might have to break the law.
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:32.880]   And journalists have to be aware of that fact and pay the price.
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:39.120]   If you want to do that investigative story where you carry a knife through a-- so you
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:43.400]   should check point out an airport, you have to be prepared to get arrested to prove your
[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:44.400]   point.
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:49.800]   And if Gawker is so high in mighty that they prove some point about the new iPhone when
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:53.880]   they wanted to prove that they could buy the 4G if they felt like it.
[01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:54.880]   They have, sir.
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:55.880]   Right.
[01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:59.520]   And they broke the law and for no social good reason, you know?
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:05.960]   And in fact, I think a lot of their motivation was to get into a criminal situation, an illegal
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:07.200]   situation.
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:12.200]   And I think this kid, Jason's from his motto, I don't know him personally, is it dope?
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:16.760]   Or fabulously naive because Nick's dented is making so much money.
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:18.000]   He's a patsy.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000]   And building his brand.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.280]   And this kid may go to jail or whatever, get a felony.
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:24.280]   And you know what?
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:28.680]   When you steal something, you should face the consequences.
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:29.920]   That's what the law is for.
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:32.360]   You're saying Nick should go to jail, not Jason.
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:33.360]   Jason's a phone guy.
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:34.360]   Well, but Jason did all of it.
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:36.280]   So Nick can be like, I didn't do it.
[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:37.280]   This guy did it.
[01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:38.280]   And so he's a dope.
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:39.280]   And you know what?
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:43.280]   I feel that the law is a way of stupid people getting educated to reality.
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:44.280]   You know?
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:46.560]   It's like the lowest form of education we have.
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:48.800]   You go to college where the cops can pick you up.
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.280]   Yeah, that's a good way to take it.
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.280]   And that's what's happening here.
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:52.280]   You know, I'm not going to do it.
[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:54.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:55.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:56.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:57.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:58.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:20:59.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:01.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:02.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:03.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:04.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:05.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:06.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:07.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:09.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:10.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:11.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:12.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:19.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:20.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:21.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:22.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:23.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:25.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:26.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:27.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:28.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:29.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:31.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:32.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:33.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:34.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:35.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:36.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:37.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:38.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:39.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:40.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:41.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:42.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:43.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:44.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:45.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:46.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:47.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:48.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:49.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:50.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:51.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:52.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:53.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:54.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:55.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:56.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:57.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:58.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:21:59.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:00.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:01.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:02.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:05.280]   You may be able to explain this, Jason.
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:11.280]   It raises $625,000 for a stealth startup called Canvas Networks.
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:19.280]   VCs like backing young people who understand the viral nature of the Internet.
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:21.280]   He is one of those young people.
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:28.720]   I'm sure that the idea has some amount of merit and is probably in no way related to
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:30.480]   the 4chan debauchery.
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:36.200]   In the same way that Chatru lets founder become the toast of the town.
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:41.120]   If you can figure out a way to go viral, you know something.
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:44.720]   Would you rather give $600,000 to an NBA out of Harvard?
[01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:45.720]   Or move.
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:48.640]   Would you rather give $600,000 to somebody who already has a website that got a couple
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:49.640]   million people?
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:23:00.120]   4chan gets 8.2 million uniques a month at average of 800,000 new posts a day.
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:01.120]   Yeah.
[01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:03.560]   He understands something.
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:10.360]   He's just got to take that insane energy that's there and put it into something productive.
[01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:17.200]   In piracy news, LimeWire crushed by the Recording Industry Association of America and their
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:18.960]   infringement lawsuit.
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:23.280]   They were found liable of copyright infringement last Tuesday.
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:24.840]   They'll probably be out of business.
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:25.840]   The RIA.
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:31.200]   Kimba Wood back in the news, US District Court Judge Kimba M. Wood ruled that LimeWire's
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:34.200]   users committed a substantial amount of copyright infringement.
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:35.200]   That's shocking.
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:36.200]   That's shocking.
[01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:37.200]   That's shocking.
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:40.680]   There's gambling going on in here.
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:42.320]   Shocking.
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:45.200]   And they had not taken meaningful steps to mitigate the infringement.
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:46.760]   So they're liable.
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:51.960]   The RIA is seeking $150,000 per copyright violation.
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:54.480]   And they want to put them out of business.
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:55.480]   Yeah.
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:24:02.320]   They've got 50 million uniques a month, hundreds of thousands of users downloaded every day,
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:05.800]   millions of active users in a given moment times 150,000.
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:06.800]   That's good.
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:07.800]   That's like a trillion dollars.
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:12.840]   It's what will be interesting is this is where it's politically safe and easy to go
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:13.840]   after.
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:18.680]   You go after the businesses that are clearly profiting on a model that is based on piracy.
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:24.800]   But as these giants get slayed, eventually they're just going to have to turn on the
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:28.400]   juice and go after all the individual people pirating their movement.
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:29.400]   Well, good news.
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:30.400]   You mentioned that.
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:32.240]   The producers of Hurt Locker are going after.
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:33.240]   Hurt Locker.
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:34.400]   The US copyright, sorry.
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:39.480]   I was the Hurt Locker producers freaked out.
[01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:44.600]   You know, the Hurt Locker's made like 16 million US, maybe 42 million worldwide.
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:46.360]   Movie costs 15 million.
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:50.040]   And there's been zillions and zillions and zillions of downloads.
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:55.000]   They started five months before the US release of the film and then it went ballistic.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.720]   It went viral after it won all the Oscars.
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:03.720]   So they've hired the US copyright group to go after all of the people basically to go
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:08.720]   after all of the ISPs for all the bit torrent traffic related to downloading copies of the
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:09.720]   Hurt Locker.
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:11.280]   And they're going to offer a settlement.
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:13.480]   If you refuse, they're going to offer you a second settlement.
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:19.680]   And if you refuse the company's history, the US copyright group's history is to then
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:21.760]   take you to court going on lawsuit.
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:26.360]   And apparently a lot of independent movie producers are looking at this because they
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:28.760]   are seeing huge amounts of traffic on the door.
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:31.240]   Seeing dollar signs in their eyes is what they're seeing.
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:36.000]   Well, here's an interesting, here's an interesting related story.
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.960]   The US copyright group is suing over Far Cry.
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:44.600]   And Time Warner Cable says, we're not going to give you the information.
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:50.000]   They'll have to be seen by the saying an ISP standing up against the it was a massive
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.520]   2000 person lawsuit.
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:56.840]   And they basically said, look, we got four people who do IP lookups.
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:57.840]   We got four people.
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:59.960]   That's three months of their full time effort.
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:00.960]   We can't do it.
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:01.960]   We can't do it for you.
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:05.960]   They're going to have to do it because they what's funny is that the lawyers that work
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:11.520]   for the US copyright group said like 75% of the ISPs, they contacted, complied immediately.
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:15.400]   And the ones that have currently refused to reply will have to once they're subpoenaed
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:17.280]   by the court.
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:20.760]   Because at that point, they have to give up the information and that they were objecting
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:21.760]   because it was a fine.
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:24.640]   They felt it was a financial burden to just turn over the information.
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:29.640]   So apparently a lot of ISPs just immediately handed over the information to the US copyright
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:31.960]   group lawyers.
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:37.120]   So I don't see time order being able to back out of this once the court's opinion is the
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:38.680]   information.
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:42.320]   That's why they call it file sharing kids.
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:46.320]   Patrick Norton is the host of our newest show of course, the host of Texas and so forth.
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:48.400]   But we are great on this week in computer hardware.
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:49.920]   I'm going to come by with Ryan Shraut.
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:50.920]   I was surprised.
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:52.120]   He is so good on this show.
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:56.120]   And it's all about if you're in a computer hardware, it's all about computer.
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:58.320]   You can just like they had some issues a few years ago.
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:26:59.320]   There he is.
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:00.960]   Patrick Norton on this week in computer hardware.
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:05.720]   I think it's interesting to switch.tv/twitch.
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:06.960]   You'll see Ryan Patrick.
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:08.960]   I wonder if maybe the sale of debt.
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:13.760]   And now that Colleen is leaving, I'm going to show up on that show more than once in a
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:15.600]   while I think if you don't mind.
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:16.600]   Absolutely.
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:17.600]   Yeah.
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:18.600]   Door is always open.
[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:19.600]   Thank you.
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:20.600]   You're the best.
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:24.240]   Patrick Norton also at techzilla.com.
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:26.240]   Make sure you watch.
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:30.880]   Let's not forget our great friend Brian Brushwood who is also the host of a few shows.
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:34.560]   And on revision three as well called scam school.
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:35.560]   What a great show.
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:36.560]   And also NSFW.
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:39.120]   Can I play a little clip from NSFW since I played a little bit?
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:42.640]   Yeah, I think this is from we started a summer movie draft league.
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:44.960]   And if you want to see how we're doing.
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:47.840]   In fact, my co-host, Justin Robert Young, who you should have on the show sometime.
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:48.840]   I love Justin.
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:49.840]   He's so good.
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:50.840]   He's so good.
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:51.840]   He's so good.
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:52.840]   He's so good.
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:53.840]   He's so good.
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:54.840]   He's so good.
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:55.840]   He's so good.
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:56.840]   He's so good.
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:57.840]   He's so good.
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:27:58.840]   He's so good.
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:27:59.840]   He's so good.
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:03.560]   He's really going to see at the end of the summer how who got the biggest gross for the
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:04.840]   money they were able to spend.
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:06.360]   And it's all up at Bitly.
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:08.080]   That's a great idea.
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:09.560]   Yeah.
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:10.560]   And then what is this here?
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:11.560]   You're eating food?
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:12.560]   Oh my gosh.
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:13.560]   I think you opened the wrong clip here.
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:17.560]   This is clearly the episode where we took our...
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:19.000]   You made the kid throw up.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.760]   This isn't one where you made the kid throw up, is it?
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:23.000]   No, no, no.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.600]   This is him giving up his vegetarianism after two years.
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:26.600]   Oh.
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:27.600]   He did it in style.
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:28.600]   And it looks like he's eating bacon.
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:29.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:31.520]   No, we got all the Rudy's barbecue.
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:33.400]   Austin has phenomenal barbecue.
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:35.720]   I have to say, I really enjoyed the barbecue.
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:38.520]   Is this the dolphin that everybody's been telling me about right there?
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:39.520]   Is that the one?
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:41.360]   Well, you mean this guy right here?
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:44.120]   This is our tribute to the dolphin boy.
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:45.120]   All right.
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:48.480]   And here's your guests and you're bidding now for what was the movie?
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:50.480]   This is on point story three.
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:52.560]   And it got up to $50 actually.
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:53.720]   It went for half his budget.
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:55.040]   It went to Toy Story 3.
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:59.000]   Because now does it have to be the biggest movie of the summer?
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.240]   No, no, no, no.
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:02.640]   You total up, for example, I bought all my movies cheap.
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:06.320]   I think I spent most like $18 on a movie, but I got eight movies.
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:10.200]   Now, meanwhile, Justin, he got Iron Man 2, spent half his money on it.
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:11.760]   And so far, it's looking like a good call.
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:15.600]   But like next week, we got, you know, Prince of Persia and I got Robin Hood this week
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:16.880]   and Sex in the City 2.
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:20.120]   I actually find myself rooting for Sex in the City 2, which is weird for me.
[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:21.120]   I wanted this.
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:22.120]   Yeah.
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:23.120]   Come on.
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:24.120]   That's pretty brilliant.
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:25.120]   I don't care if you root for it.
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:26.680]   You're not going to go see it though, are you?
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:27.680]   You know what?
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:28.680]   I may.
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:31.360]   I was like, you ought to go watch that Sex in the City movie.
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:32.360]   It'll be amazing.

[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:37.040]   I, my Mrs made me watch it.
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:39.480]   It was two hours of my life.
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:40.480]   I will never get back.
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:42.320]   Just the most horrible, horrible.

[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:50.920]   And it is a good insight into the mind of the woman.
[01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:54.200]   Oh, you're talking about schwood.com, right?
[01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:55.200]   Yes.

[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:19.840]   That's not it.
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:22.720]   See, he's stealing from you.
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:23.720]   That's not mine.

[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:26.280]   Oh, no, that's this week.com.
[01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:27.280]   It looks like exactly what we're doing.
[01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:28.480]   We're doing the non-tech show.
[01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:29.480]   OK, there you go.

[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:45.160]   Yeah.
[01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:47.080]   It won a streaming best production.
[01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:48.760]   Yeah, it's a really good quality.
[01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:51.160]   Kind of such a crush on Justine Bateman.
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:52.560]   She's been tweeting with me.
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:54.040]   And I'm like, oh my god.
[01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:55.720]   Justine Bateman is tweeting me.
[01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:57.080]   She's a big Twitterer.
[01:30:57.080 --> 01:30:57.920]   She loves to tweet.
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:59.240]   This would have been huge in 1988.
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:01.320]   Seven for me.
[01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:02.320]   It's still really cool.
[01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:03.160]   Don't get me wrong.
[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:05.560]   I always thought of you as Schneider, so it's perfect.
[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:06.560]   Absolutely.
[01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:06.880]   Yeah.
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:08.800]   Is that the show she was on?
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:10.760]   No, she was on growing pain.
[01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:11.880]   Growing pains.
[01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:12.640]   Family ties.
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:13.920]   Family ties.
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:14.800]   Yes.
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:15.320]   Anyway.
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:17.520]   What would they do, baby?
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:18.520]   Thank you, Jason.
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:20.080]   [LAUGHTER]

[01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:50.920]   With the kids are running around, I always turn it on
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:53.200]   and just enjoy-- I pay attention for a while,
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:54.840]   and then I go over and play with the kids.
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:56.600]   I love the live experience.
[01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:57.440]   It's different that way.
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:57.800]   Yeah.
[01:31:57.800 --> 01:31:59.360]   You don't have to pay attention.
[01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:00.320]   It's what he's saying.
[01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:01.240]   Well, just nonstop.
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:01.720]   It's good.
