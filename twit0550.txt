[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.640]   Nice to be here.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.000]   We thought it was going to be Academy Award night.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.360]   We're all set to have film girl talk about films.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.640]   We will anyway, because I'm really curious what you think.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.960]   But there is bigger fish.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.920]   There are bigger fish to fry.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.760]   And here one of our chief fish fryers, Mr. Ben Thompson from Stretecory, joining us from
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.760]   Taipei today.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.760]   Hello, Ben.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.760]   Good morning.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.760]   Good morning.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.760]   Early morning.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.760]   How old?
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.760]   What time is it?
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.760]   Seven o'clock.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.760]   Oh, not bad.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.160]   Oh, ah.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.760]   You got a kid.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.760]   You're up this early anyway.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.440]   Yeah, something like that.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.920]   I don't want to actually, I do not want to diminish your generous contribution.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.000]   Thank you for being here so early.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   I really appreciate it.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I appreciate it.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.600]   And he knows what's happening on Monday.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.600]   So that's important.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.760]   It's living in the future.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.960]   Also joining us, The Great Ed Bot from ZDNet, my old buddy.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.120]   It's great to see you Ed.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.120]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.360]   What a nice thing to say.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.360]   Yeah, from the great southwest of this nation.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.360]   Yes.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.800]   I can't even put that.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.400]   I put the flag up back.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.400]   It helps me.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.720]   It helps me know you're in New Mexico, not Arizona.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.160]   I can tell now.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.120]   Don't know where in New Mexico, but somewhere nice.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.960]   Turn left at Albuquerque.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.840]   That sounds like an Eagle's song.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.280]   It's actually a Bugs Bunny.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.400]   Oh, Bugs Bunny reference.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.400]   Okay.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.400]   Good.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.400]   I'm keeping it light right now because we're going to probably get no fairly heavy conversation
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.960]   about Apple, the FBI, and what the hell is going on.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.960]   And I have to say this story, which broke on Wednesday, came in Dribs and Dribs.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:37.400]   We didn't really kind of, we saw the court order to, from, to Apple saying you've got
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.320]   to help the FBI unlock this phone.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.800]   We saw Tim Cook's response.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.920]   We had a very good conversation, I think, with the technical information, additions from
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.320]   Steve Gibson on Wednesday on this week in Google.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.740]   Jeff Jarvis and Matthew Ingram and I with Steve Gibson's help.
[00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.120]   But since then more and more information has come out, I don't probably need to summarize
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.120]   the story.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:06.320]   No, there, there was a cell phone that belonged to the San Bernardino County Health Department
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:12.480]   but was in use by its employee, the shooter in the San Bernardino mass shooting tragedy
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.960]   a few months ago.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.800]   The FBI got that cell phone.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.960]   They didn't get the other cell phones.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.760]   Those were destroyed before the shooting.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.440]   But this cell phone survived.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.440]   It's an interesting position because it's owned by the, by San Bernardino County Department
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.440]   of Health.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.280]   It's owned by the shooter.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.320]   It also, he agreed to the right to monitor.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.920]   So really there shouldn't be any issue at all about unlocking the phone and looking what's
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.000]   on it except that it is locked.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:53.080]   It's an iPhone 5C but of course Apple was updated to iOS 9 so it was encrypted and the
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:00.000]   FBI has asked the court to force Apple to help them unlock it, not decrypt it, but unlock
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.800]   it.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.000]   The court said Apple has to make it, has to do a few things, has to make a modified firmware.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.640]   By the way, as you probably know, firmware can't put a B put on an iPhone and will not
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.320]   work on an iPhone unless Apple signs it.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:20.360]   So they would have to sign this with their super secret signing key put on the iPhone.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.000]   Because a firmware would do a couple of things.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.760]   One, it would disable the automatic erasure if more than 10 attempts to unlock the phone
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.000]   are made in case that that guy turned it on.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.240]   And it would also reduce the delay in between key presses.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.160]   There's an 80 millisecond delay between key presses to slow down brute forcing.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.800]   The whole, that's not quite right.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.240]   There's a five second delay.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.240]   Five seconds.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.760]   The 80 milliseconds is how long it takes the phone to actually process the request.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.760]   So they can't speed that up.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.760]   Right.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.360]   The minimum is 80 is 80 milliseconds.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.600]   And it has to be done on the device because part part of the key is a combination of the
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:08.760]   passcode and the unique ID unique identifier of the device, which is not known to Apple
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.760]   is not tracked.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.480]   It's imprinted like in the silicon basically.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.120]   And so the 80, 80 milliseconds is the limit, which is the other thing here.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.920]   I mean, no one said how long the passcode is.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:26.120]   But because of that 80 millisecond delay, if it's anything but a four or five digit,
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.720]   numeric passcode, it's going to be pretty impossible to brute force anyway.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.080]   I presume it's just a four-character one or four-digit one, I should say.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.800]   But that 80 milliseconds is still a pretty substantial amount of time.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.800]   This kind of underscores.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.320]   There's a lot we don't know about this.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:49.000]   So the court order was that Apple should modify the firmware, turn off the delay, turn off
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.800]   any, you know, automatic erasure on the phone, not to actually crack the phone, but just to
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:01.760]   give the FBI an opportunity to run an automated -- oh, and to give the FBI software access
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.680]   to the phone so they could run an automated brute forcing attack so they could unlock
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.040]   it.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.280]   It's kind of a weird request.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:14.200]   In the past, Apple has in fact been ordered to decrypt criminals' iPhones and deliver
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.840]   the information to law enforcement.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.840]   And they say they've done that.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.600]   In fact, they've done it, I think 70 times.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.600]   They don't like doing it.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:27.160]   And that's one of the reasons they released iOS 8, which had full-disc encryption.
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.160]   Right.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.120]   I mean, Apple can't decrypt it.
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.600]   I think that's the big thing here.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.600]   That's what makes this.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.520]   There's the multi-levels of the story.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.600]   And I certainly feel your pain about it dribbling out.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.160]   And I had a very widely spread -- I made a daily update, free on Thursday.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:45.240]   That ended up having a couple of things wrong.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:52.040]   But I mean, it is where it is, which there's an update to it.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.480]   The way encryption works -- and Apple uses very strong encryption on the disk -- is that
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:01.480]   even if you have the data on the disk, if you don't have the key, like you're not getting
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.480]   it, you're just not.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:10.400]   I mean, it's theoretically possible, but realistically impossible, even with a brute force attack.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:17.120]   So the issue is -- so the IBM could -- if the FBA really cared about this, IBM, if the
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:22.000]   FBA really cared about this, they could extract the data off of the memory chips and then
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   try to brute force it.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.400]   But the whole issue is that it's easier, even with all these challenges, the only realistic
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:34.600]   way is to break the passcode itself, which again has to be done on the device because
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:41.280]   it's tangled with the device ID because no one can break encryption.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:47.840]   And I think that's what makes this such a multi-layered issue is -- I think the real
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:56.240]   fear in the very long run for any of us in tech is the idea that Apple run to have to
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:04.200]   make the sort of golden key or skeleton key for their encryption itself, which is a really
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.200]   terrible idea.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.120]   And Apple says they can't do it, right?
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.120]   I mean, they could go forward.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.200]   Right, you can't do it after the fact, exactly.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:20.720]   Which is why I think the real concern here is that the FBI loses this case and then leverages
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:26.560]   that into congressional action to force this sort of gold key thing.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.560]   We can't trust Apple.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.480]   Apple is not going to help us, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.680]   I mean, all those times that Apple helped the FBI were pre-IOS, were as far as I know
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.680]   pre-IOS-8.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.680]   Yes, they were.
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:37.680]   They were.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.680]   And that was before the encryption stuff.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.680]   Right.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.960]   So it was a different sort of assistance where in a lot of times, what I understand, they
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.840]   were just instructing them to look towards tools that already existed from third parties
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.600]   and not actually giving them any data themselves.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:55.280]   Although as Jonathan Zadarski, who's a really great Apple expert pointed out in a long
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:03.120]   blog post, there's a difference between what Apple used to do, which is essentially do
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:09.760]   what they needed to and provide the contents of that phone to law enforcement versus creating
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.520]   a forensics tool, which is what the court is ordering them to do now.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:19.440]   And there is a much higher burden of proof with a forensics tool than there would be
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.440]   when just Apple saying, "Well, here's what was on the phone."
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:28.320]   So this is a fairly burdensome, as it turns out, fairly burdensome order from the court.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.400]   Apple has said it won't do it and it will appeal.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.680]   They have some extra time.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.480]   It looks like they're going to be given three extra days to respond.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.480]   Yeah, they haven't until Friday.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.480]   They haven't until Friday.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.480]   They haven't until Friday.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.480]   They haven't until Friday.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.480]   Now, and I don't know what Apple will say.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.480]   We only know that as soon as this order came out, Tim Cook wrote this open letter and posted
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.920]   it on the Apple website saying, "This is why it's a bad idea.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.240]   We think this needs to be public."
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.760]   Now, there's some additional information that may change the color of this.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.360]   A couple of things.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:05.920]   First of all, apparently Apple had originally asked the FBI to do this under seal privately
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.200]   and the FBI declined.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.120]   They decided to do it publicly.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.120]   Right.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:15.680]   The reason that might be interesting is maybe Apple was willing to comply, but just didn't
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.400]   want anybody to know they could comply.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.040]   Or I don't know what.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.880]   I'm not sure why.
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:28.360]   I don't think that's true because in the narratives that we've had so far, it's been
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:33.800]   very clear that they had tried the four different techniques that Apple recommended and none
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.280]   of them worked.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:40.680]   They were at the impasse of saying that our only option left is for you to give us physical
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:47.960]   assistance to getting into the contents here where we can then try to decrypt it.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:53.360]   They've already said that the cooperation ended unsuccessfully.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:13:02.000]   Now we're at the FBI asked them to do a specific thing they said no, and so we go to court.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.080]   Now one fascinating thing that seems to have happened here though that is different from
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:15.400]   other similar situations in the past is previously something like this starts out and the facts
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.080]   come out first.
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:23.120]   So I remember when Apple's phone was liberated from that bar.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.440]   It was iPhone 4.
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:30.500]   All those facts came out first and then it turned into a court case and then the lawyers
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:31.500]   got involved.
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:37.720]   But this, the very first salvo is from the lawyers from the Department of Justice and
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:44.280]   the response and Tim Cook might have signed that letter but it was written by lawyers
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:49.120]   or at least vetted and sealed by lawyers.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:55.480]   And as a result, every bit of information that we've had on this story so far has come
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:14:03.660]   in legal form which means that every word is carefully chosen to communicate a particular
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.740]   fact so that it might be true but they might want this to believe something else.
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:12.900]   There is some other information that didn't come vetted or in legal form and it throws
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.780]   further mud in the water.
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:22.380]   Initially the FBI, Apple pointed out that the iCloud password had been changed while
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.100]   the phone was in the FBI's custody.
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:29.560]   The FBI immediately threw the San Bernardino County Department of Health under the bus saying
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.560]   they did it.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.960]   And then they immediately threw the FBI under the bus.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.560]   They then tweeted.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.560]   No.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.000]   The FBI told us to do that.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.480]   Although in my mind they're both sort of incompetent because from best I can tell and
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.480]   I've been working on a story about this for the last few days.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:49.560]   There was absolutely no mobile device management software on the iPhone that was given out
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.840]   by the San Bernardino Department of Health.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.920]   Apple pointed out, well that's dumb.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:15:00.340]   Apple pointed out though had they not changed the iCloud password it's very likely that
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:06.040]   as soon as they went to a known Wi-Fi access point such as his home or work the phone would
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.040]   have gone on.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:12.140]   I mean back up over Wi-Fi and then they would have had access to that backed up data.
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.140]   So right.
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:16.560]   I mean we don't really know if that would have been the case or not because we don't
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:21.340]   know if if there was another problem on the phone there that setting have been able to
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:25.180]   be disabled but at the very least they could have attempted it and let me give you this.
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.420]   Let me let me give you my conspiracy theory.
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:28.420]   Sure.
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.420]   I think the FBI wants this case.
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:35.100]   FBI we know that James Comey the director of the FBI is one of the strongest advocates
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.100]   in government.
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:40.140]   By the way there is no unified point of view in government about encryption and encryption.
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:44.260]   In fact the I've been told the NSA wants and the end encryption and believes is important
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.260]   to national security.
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:49.380]   But the FBI does not they don't worry about bad guys going dark.
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.380]   That's the term they use.
[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:55.460]   Comey has been looking for a case to set a precedent.
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:16:01.780]   What better case than a terrorist and his phone belonging to a terrorist.
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:06.980]   I think they were looking for exactly this kind of case and if it were easy to get the
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:10.700]   information they wouldn't have been able to go for the precedent.
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:17.380]   My conspiracy theory which kind of impunes the FBI here is that they didn't want to easily
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.540]   decrypt this device.
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.900]   They wanted this device to be hard to decrypt.
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:25.100]   Why else would you change the iCloud password.
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.620]   Is that a hamfisted attempt to get the data?
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.180]   They know better than that.
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.540]   They know better than that.
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.380]   I know that.
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:33.380]   You know that.
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.980]   I mean I think that this might have been a case where they were so desperately trying
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:40.220]   to get access to something and just made a sloppy mistake.
[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.380]   I would hope that was the case.
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.380]   You know what I don't buy it.
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.580]   I think the FBI's forensics is much better than that.
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:46.580]   They know what they're doing.
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:49.620]   No, there's actually an explanation for this.
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:56.140]   They changed the iCloud password so that they could access the backups and then they
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:01.060]   discovered that the backups had stopped on October 19th or 20th and that's when they
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:06.340]   said oh there's additional information on the phone.
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:07.340]   And the backups.
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:08.340]   Still hamfisted.
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:12.660]   They could tell how the last backup without being able to unlock it right.
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:13.660]   Maybe not.
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:14.660]   Maybe you couldn't get into the computer.
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.460]   No, they had to get into iCloud to see the backup.
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:18.460]   I see.
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:19.980]   And then they would show up.
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:20.980]   Okay.
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:24.660]   So this is probably a case where they didn't want to wait for Apple to respond.
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:28.660]   They wanted to get information as quickly as possible and went too fast and by doing
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:32.220]   that ended up kind of screwing themselves.
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:38.060]   I mean, but all of this of course is on the pre disposition that the press position that
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.660]   there is something on this phone that can be useful in this case.
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.300]   And I personally don't know.
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.700]   There's not a lot of there's not a lot to indicate that there is they destroyed their
[00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.500]   two personal phones.
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.420]   That's I was going to say the two personal phones are destroyed.
[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.180]   Find my iPhone was enabled.
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:56.340]   So for find my iPhone to be enabled, the backups to be disabled.
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:56.340]   Jonathan Zizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:19.620]   Jonathan Zizzewski was pointing out that seems weird too.
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:24.620]   So I think it's important to there's really three layers on you know, arguably more, but
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.900]   I would characterize that being three layers to this case.
[00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:32.700]   And I think it's important to keep those layers distinct because otherwise it's very difficult
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.700]   to keep track of what's going on.
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:39.780]   So layer one is what is not going on in this case.
[00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:40.780]   And that is encryption.
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:41.780]   This case is not about encryption.
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:46.100]   And actually I've seen I saw headline in the world should drill the Apple FBA encryption
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.100]   case.
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.420]   It has nothing to do with encryption.
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.740]   No one is asking Apple to break their encryption.
[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:56.820]   There is not to date a discussion of this golden key, which I just bought recently.
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:02.460]   I think but but it's something that looms over this case because that is something the
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.100]   FBA FBI has wanted previously.
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:10.180]   It was put to rest at least temporarily last year and a bit of a repaint of kind of the
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.740]   crypto wars of 20 years ago.
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:17.060]   And in which and and there's been like reports have come out that the FBI has kind of basically
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:21.700]   said, well, okay, we lost this round, but let's keep our eyes open for a chance to reopen
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.540]   it, which this certainly would seem to fit the bill.
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.220]   So that's what is what is not happening.
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:30.300]   There's not a debate about encryption going on right now.
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:36.740]   What is going on is a debate about security, broadly in security of iPhones and whether
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:41.940]   or not Apple can be compelled to to weaken their security measures.
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.020]   Again, they can't break the encryption.
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.300]   It's not possible.
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:49.740]   But they can be compelled to do the things that that you listed.
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.860]   And the question is, is that covered on the All Ritz Act?
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:55.740]   And as an aside, I'm a little tired of this this act from 1789.
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.820]   That's the act that establishes the All Ritz Act, which is such a.
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:19:59.980]   No, it's not the All Ritz Act.
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:00.980]   It's not the All Ritz Act.
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:05.620]   It's not part of the judicial act, which established the court system, which I don't
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:09.500]   think anyone is calling to undo because the law happened to be passed in 1789.
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.420]   I mean, the All Ritz Act is not an unreasonable thing.
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.420]   And it's a point of part.
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.420]   Why do people cite the All Ritz Act as being?
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.980]   Well, what he's saying is that he's I think what you're saying, Ben, correct me if I
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.900]   don't want to speak for you is that you're tired of people saying, why is this law from
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:27.220]   1789 defining what's happening now when in actuality that's sort of what the law was
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.780]   created for, which is a general like this.
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.500]   A very general situation.
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.660]   It's been cited in a lot of similar cases over the years.
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.260]   It's been used in phone unlocking cases since 2005.
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:40.900]   It was it was used as the basis for other source of cases.
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.420]   So I mean, I think that's probably a good point.
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:47.900]   I still think that they're using this as a way to get around the fact that there's not
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:48.900]   legislation.
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:49.900]   Sure.
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.700]   Which I would be happy to get to as my third point.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:56.180]   I mean, the All Ritz Act was a part of the judicial act of 17 and I just just my only
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.180]   point.
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.180]   No, I know.
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.140]   I think that we should undo the Supreme Court because the law came from 1789.
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:04.940]   Like it's part of the same set of laws that passed at the same time.
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.460]   You know, Allah the Bill of Rights.
[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:13.780]   So the third point, which Christina just referred to is the political angle and which which
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.380]   is what kind of ties the first two together.
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:22.300]   And that's where a lot of this, the new developments and our from is attempt to win the political
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.300]   war.
[00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:26.620]   It doesn't really matter at the end of the day, how or why from a wheel perspective.
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:31.220]   It doesn't really matter how or why the past the iCloud password got changed.
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:36.860]   It matters from a Apple making the trying to win the PR war where frankly they're at
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:41.140]   a disadvantage because we're dealing with a terrorist attack that happened.
[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:44.540]   And the FBI, I think is if I don't think there's any question whether or not they did
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:45.540]   this on purpose.
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:50.540]   I don't think there's any question that they see this as an opportunity to win a political
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:51.540]   battle.
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:57.020]   And I think it they these are clearly all tied together, but they are but they all have
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.500]   distinct issues.
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:03.340]   And that's why it's easy to get these these mix up together is it's not about encryption
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:06.500]   specifically, but but that's certainly in the background.
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:12.820]   It is about this this compelling software company to create software, not to simply
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.100]   take advantage of software.
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:18.500]   Now pre iOS 8, Apple simply needed to use their their root certificate and they could
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:22.260]   extract it off the device because it wasn't encrypted and they could extract the data
[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.660]   off this device as well.
[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:26.620]   The only problems it would be encrypted.
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.420]   And then part three is big picture.
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:29.900]   What's going on politically?
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:33.140]   What is the attempt in the long run to compel this?
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:37.820]   And again, and I think that's that's the that's what's going on, especially over the
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:38.820]   weekend with this stuff.
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:42.180]   This is Apple finding back on Apple was I think justifiably and understand we pissed
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:47.580]   off at the at the FBI's court request was framed this as a marketing stunt by Apple.
[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.060]   The FBI literally said this is good.
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:55.340]   This is Apple going full full bore marketing wise.
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:56.340]   Right.
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.940]   I mean, which I mean, we can certainly we can certainly get into.
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:22:59.940]   I mean, it is good.
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:00.940]   I mean, they're not wrong.
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:04.500]   It's good for Apple to promote their privacy.
[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:08.140]   In fact, it was somewhat of a revelation to me that this was even that Apple could even
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:13.380]   do this that they could sign a modified firmware that would make it easier to get into an
[00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:14.380]   iPhone.
[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:18.500]   I mean, you say it's not about decryption, but once the phone is unlocked, the data is
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:19.500]   decrypted.
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:23.580]   It is a methodology to decrypt the phone.
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.140]   It's not about forcing Apple to break their encryption.
[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.700]   No, they don't have to break their encryption.
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:33.260]   They merely need to break into the phone, but the end result is the same.
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.260]   But it matters.
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:38.340]   One, it matters is because one, they can't break their encryption.
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.580]   That's the entire point of encryption.
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:41.580]   Mm-hmm.
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:47.500]   Two, the FBI would like Apple to create encryption with a golden key with what's called a golden
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:48.500]   key.
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.500]   Yes.
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:53.820]   No, but that's that's that's that's my biggest slippery slope.
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:54.820]   Yeah.
[00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:56.100]   Well, it's not just a slippery slope.
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:02.420]   It's a you can see a scenario where Apple wins this case as they very well made because
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.540]   part of the All Ritz Act as later defined by the Supreme Court, which again was created
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:10.620]   at the same time, was that there can't be an unreasonable burden.
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:15.580]   There's quite a burden to this if Jonathan does a Darski is correct.
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:18.860]   This is a significant effort to do this.
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.260]   Well, I mean, Apple's not a forensics company.
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.700]   They'd be required to create a forensics tool.
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.700]   Right.
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:30.860]   And so the Apple could very well win this case on its merits from a legal perspective,
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:36.180]   but then that's where you kind of come big circle like you can see the FBI heading.
[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:43.580]   Oh, I going to Congress and saying, look, we had a terrorist attack on US soil.
[00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:47.340]   Apple refused to help and legally they were not compelled to.
[00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:50.140]   We need legislation that won't allow this to happen again.
[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:54.340]   The best way to get this legislation is to make it so we don't even have to go to Apple
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:55.340]   in the future.
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:56.340]   Right.
[00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:57.340]   We have a golden key that lets us get this stuff.
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:00.500]   And again, this is this is by far the worst possible outcome.
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:04.980]   I mean, the real the problem with the big difference with that is then you have a silent
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:09.900]   failure of security because no one will know when or if that is compromised and it will
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.100]   be eventually.
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:13.400]   And so that's it.
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.900]   That's what makes us so complicated is there's multiple levels going on.
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:21.660]   And one of the levels is it is a PR thing.
[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:27.620]   And it's a PR thing because ultimately the end game is a con is potentially congressional
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:31.540]   action that could result in something even worse than what's Apple being compelled to
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:32.540]   do here.
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:35.860]   And so there's there's multiple levels of thinking about this that that are going on
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:40.820]   and makes it which is why it's not going to be a story that's going to go away and nor
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:41.820]   should it.
[00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:46.140]   We had yesterday on the new screen savers.
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:49.100]   We had a Julian Sanchez.
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:53.340]   He's a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, but he was one of the authors of the Berkman
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:57.420]   study, Don't Panic, which is an excellent study and some of the best security researchers
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:00.740]   in the world were brought in on this panel.
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:04.380]   Hey, the conclusion there was there.
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:05.380]   Don't worry.
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:06.900]   There's no reason for the law enforcement to worry.
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:10.540]   There are more ways to surveil us than ever before.
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:14.220]   And they will and if already said we'll use all of them.
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:21.060]   But what Julian said is that absolutely that's going to be the upshot of this case is a resurgence
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:24.020]   of legislation to provide backdoors.
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:25.140]   That's what this is all about.
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.140]   He agreed.
[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:27.820]   Which is a far worse outcome.
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:32.300]   And that's why I mean I absolutely support Apple's position.
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:38.940]   One, two, I agree there is a very serious problem with precedent here.
[00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:47.260]   But three, I'm also very wary of how this is going to play politically.
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:52.580]   And I've gotten some pushback from members about this because like no principles principle,
[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:56.120]   like yes, principles principle, but there's multiple layers of principle.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:06.380]   And make no mistake, a golden key is the worst possible outcome if you care about security.
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:10.300]   But we should be clear that that is not what's being asked for at this time.
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.300]   It's not.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:16.700]   It would be impossible because as you noted, I mean that's a forward looking security
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:22.340]   measure which gets at why it's so terrible as opposed to something that is backwards,
[00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:25.900]   that is retroactive which is the case here.
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:32.680]   I mean the more I've been kind of making this point for the last couple of days.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:37.480]   The more I think about it, I think the, you know, I do think that Apple is right to fight
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.840]   and win this and win on the merits.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:44.760]   And I think the, there is a great tweet the other day that something about the US best
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:48.440]   thing with the three great world religions and I can't remember what the other two were
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.600]   but the turn was Apple.
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:57.660]   And I think the FBI is probably going to get more of a fight than they bargained for on
[00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:59.480]   this which is great.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:06.160]   I mean, we've all, you know, I, I, good, good on Apple for, for leveraging that.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:10.920]   What's also very clear is that there is an agreement in the federal government whether
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:16.240]   in the administration, law enforcement or Congress, there's no, I don't believe there
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.460]   is a consensus on providing a backdoor.
[00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.900]   I think there were many members of Congress stepped forward and said Apple is doing the
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.660]   right thing.
[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.880]   Some did said Apple should absolutely comply.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:32.380]   I don't think there, and we've, I've heard from others inside the Beltway that there's
[00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:35.380]   no consensus on how to handle encryption.
[00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:41.820]   Well, I think that that's the, that that's the one, I mean, you mentioned the NSA and
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.620]   I think the issue here is the FBI.
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:48.140]   I mean, James Comey has been particularly in Calcster and on this point.
[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:50.500]   We know, fortunately, we know who wants a backdoor most.
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:51.980]   That's James Comey, director of the FBI.
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:56.060]   Well, and I think the, the thing to remember is the FBI is mostly dealing with, yes, they're
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:29:00.820]   doing what they deal with domestic terrorism, but by and large, they're dealing with, you
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:05.740]   know, probably mostly less sophisticated criminals.
[00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:09.580]   There's a lot of, of, of drug cases that come up.
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:12.620]   There was an interesting story about, you know, there's this thing in the all, in the
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:18.700]   Patriots act, like a peak, a peak provision that lets you invest or basically spy on someone
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:21.420]   without them knowing you are, if you got a court order.
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.140]   And it was said at the time, this is for terrorism is not going to be used for anything else.
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:30.380]   And since then, 95% of cases have been about drugs and like 0.5% have been about terrorism,
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:34.820]   which I think the FBI just wants his capability and they don't, the, the, the, the, the promise
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:39.940]   you look at a big picture, when it comes to encryption, we have more to lose by not having
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:42.540]   our stuff encrypted by we, I mean, the United States.
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:44.500]   I mean, that's what the NSA says.
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:45.500]   Right.
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:48.220]   Where there comes a corporate secrets where there comes to things are, are government.
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:53.180]   And the thing is, I mean, the United States has the most capability of overcoming and avoiding
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.180]   that.
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.340]   And we're the ones that all the satellites, we're the ones that are listening in on communications
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:57.740]   all over the world.
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:06.260]   And so if you game this out, uh, when it comes to a systematic look at our capabilities versus
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:13.220]   Chinese capabilities versus the very anyone else's capabilities, uh, it behooves the United
[00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:17.660]   States to have stronger encryption because the United States has more ways around that
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.500]   encryption relative to other countries.
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.860]   So it makes the playing field more uneven.
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:26.100]   So yes, from a, from a big picture perspective, encryption is good.
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:32.980]   Unfortunately, that has convinced enough people in, in DC, unfortunately, the FBI is, uh, has
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:38.860]   its head up, its ran a bit and only cares about their particular problems and, uh, and, you
[00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:44.340]   know, gets us, you know, now we're stuck in this morass.
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:49.260]   Another point to be made is that no matter what happens with Apple, uh, strong encryption
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:52.860]   is widely available from sources all over the world.
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:56.860]   Uh, I think was more than 70 countries making encryption software available.
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:01.220]   The math is out there and there's nothing anybody really can do in the long run to prevent
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:03.540]   encryption from being used.
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:08.380]   So, um, the notion of putting a backdoor into software made in the United States, all that
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:12.460]   does is weaken the product from United States.
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:19.300]   But this is getting, but that is getting, I, you know, uh, I understand how you can game
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:24.580]   things out so that it gets to that point, but it was going to get to that point anyway.
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:29.420]   That argument, those bills are being written.
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:33.580]   Those, those lobbyists are, are working on this already.
[00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:38.500]   If you're looking for a test case, uh, on encryption, this isn't the one.
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.500]   Right.
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:44.180]   This, because it does, because it has been rightly notes, it has nothing to do with encryption.
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:52.420]   What it does have to do is setting the precedent that large, very, very, very large and influential
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:59.180]   American tech companies can be required to cooperate and provide technical assistance
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:03.980]   to the United States government when a proper warrant is issued.
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:07.380]   But one thing that I do like about this case, shouldn't that be the case?
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:09.100]   I mean, why should they be exact?
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.100]   I think it should be the case.
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:15.340]   And one thing that I'm really happy about in this case is that it's not coming through
[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:22.980]   the secret FISA courts, uh, that this entire thing is being argued, uh, very, very publicly,
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:26.180]   uh, with good legal teams on either side.
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:31.580]   So the arguments will be, uh, I mean, you, you know, Ted Olson is working for Apple.
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:37.420]   You don't get any better, uh, in, in terms of arguing before the Supreme Court than Ted
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:38.420]   Olson.
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:39.420]   No.
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:40.420]   Yeah.
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:44.220]   I mean, the, the, the, I, it's a good thing to know that there is such clarity around
[00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:45.220]   this.
[00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:48.900]   I mean, there's, there's zero question about the government's right to the data, frankly.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:53.260]   Um, you know, I mean, that, I think one reason this is a, this is a particular, this case
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:56.500]   was handpicked because the government owns the phone.
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:57.500]   Right.
[00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:01.500]   Well, not just that, but I mean, if there ever, there was a justifiable warrant, I mean,
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:02.500]   right.
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:05.020]   This, this is one of them, you know, a known terror.
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.540]   The guy committed a horrific crime.
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:07.540]   Right.
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:12.420]   So it's very clear and a lot of people, including Donald Trump said, well, you should buy cut
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:15.020]   Apple because they're un-American.
[00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:17.620]   This is not about Apple protecting a terrorist.
[00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:19.900]   That's not, it's not at all what this is about.
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:20.900]   Yeah.
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.700]   Well, you know, Donald Trump, come on.
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.220]   Don't, he's no Tetleson.
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:31.380]   When he's president of the United States, you're going to change your tomb, buddy boy.
[00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:33.140]   That's all I can say.
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:38.660]   The other thing to remember is, is, um, yeah, I think if you go back to the cyber, you know,
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:45.940]   the cyber wars of, of, of the 1990s and this was when encryption was a, you know, the first
[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:47.660]   time that encryption was really challenged.
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:50.620]   And this go dark debate is not a new debate.
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:56.140]   In that case, the US government for a time actually limited the export of encryption.
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:59.180]   So I think the most famous example was Netscape.
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:01.500]   The international version had 40 bit encryption, which is.
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:05.820]   And look at the consequence of that, by the way, because that bad encryption still plagues
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:12.300]   us today with signing keys for SSL.
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:15.940]   You can, yeah, there are escalation attacks that you could, you could trick a browser
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:20.220]   using weak encryption because that, and that encryption is in there because of those export
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:21.820]   restrictions from years ago.
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:22.820]   Right.
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:26.420]   Because the US one was allowed to have 128, but it was too complicated to verify you were
[00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:27.700]   like, you know, everyone.
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:28.700]   Right.
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:32.260]   So everyone basically got the 40, the 40 bit version.
[00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:37.660]   And eventually, again, fortunately the, you know, the, the sides of the angels, one
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:38.980]   as I would characterize it and.
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:42.180]   But we're still at the position, but there's a long term consequence.
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:47.260]   That's the other, that's the real import of this is the even that misguided law plagues
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.860]   us still today.
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:49.860]   It does.
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:55.580]   And the other thing though is, is in response, Congress passed another piece of legislation
[00:34:55.580 --> 00:35:00.500]   that people tend to forget about, which is, which is known as the Kalia, the Communications
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.740]   Assistance for Law Enforcement Act.
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:05.140]   And this was, this was the counterpart.
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:07.580]   This is, again, there's always two parts to this going on.
[00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:10.300]   This was the counterpart to the encryption part.
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:13.300]   They find you can have your encryption, but we're going to do this.
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:18.780]   And that's why all communications hardware and now software with all these telecommunications
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:25.640]   has vendor ports or why AT&T has that unmarked room in their, in their, in their systems.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:31.180]   Those are not AT, AT&T, you know, kind of gets an unfair and Verizon get a bit of an
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:32.180]   unfair wrap.
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:36.280]   They are legally compelled to have those by an act of Congress.
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:42.300]   Like they're not providing vendor ports and these unmarked rooms because they're kissing
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.620]   up to the government.
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:46.940]   Like they, it is because of the Communications for Law Enforcement Act, which came about
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:52.140]   in response to the cyber wars debate and was like, fine, you can have your encryption,
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:53.220]   but we're going to build it.
[00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:56.220]   But in that case, we get capabilities to capture everything.
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:00.420]   And that's where all this data collection and stuff that was revealed by Edward Snowden
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:07.140]   on stuff, that's, it all stems from this act, which again, just to reemphasize, there's,
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:11.860]   there's multiple, it's, it's a, it's all a security debate, but there's different parts
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.100]   of security.
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:18.220]   And I think what the FBI is trying to accomplish here is the equivalent of the, the, the CLIA
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:19.220]   act.
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:22.580]   They're trying to say, fine, we'll let you have your encryption, at least for now, but
[00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:29.300]   we want to have, we want to weaken or have access to against all your other security
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:34.220]   measures in the meantime.
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:35.780]   Anything more to say before we move on?
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:39.420]   I mean, this is a good conversation.
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:42.580]   I think the facts are now fairly well known.
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:43.580]   Yeah.
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:48.140]   You know, there's a, there's a couple things that, that I thought of here.
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:54.660]   One is, you know, you mentioned that a lot of this dates back to the 1990s.
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:37:03.300]   At the beginning of the 21st century, Microsoft actually proposed and was ready to introduce,
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:10.380]   I think in 2003 or 2004, I don't know if you were there at the time, Ben, but, palladium,
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:18.900]   oh yeah, which became formally named the next generation secure computing base, which was
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:21.580]   essentially this.
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:30.380]   It's essentially what Apple has now, you know, and, and many of the pieces of what, of what
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:36.340]   palladium proposed have made it into the existing PC hardware today.
[00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:43.300]   So you have TPMs and you have, you know, BitLocker encryption that uses that and you've got,
[00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:49.020]   you know, the equivalent PCs for several years have had the equivalent of Apple secure
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:50.740]   enclave on them.
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:55.500]   But, but the point of bringing up palladium is that when it came up in 2003, it was shouted
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:38:03.500]   down hard and loud by the same people who are now ready for Apple to win this.
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:08.940]   We saw it as a grab of a power grab by Microsoft that would allow them to keep non Microsoft
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:11.300]   software off their system, things like that.
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:12.300]   Right.
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:18.460]   No, I mean, there's a, I think the bigger point that it's making is the capability that allows
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:22.140]   only Apple to install firmware here, which there's another point to be made here, by
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:25.580]   the way, but that's the root of the walled garden.
[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:30.140]   I mean, that's, is the fact that only Apple can install an iOS device.
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:33.300]   And by the way, this gets at why the FBI is definitely making, if the FBA is, if the
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:38.100]   FBI really wanted to get there on this phone, you know, it's widely believed that the government,
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:41.980]   at least the NSA anyway, whether they want to share it or not, has zero day exploits
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:46.940]   that they, that they spend a lot of time and money researching and understanding that would
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:50.420]   allow them to install the firmware themselves.
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:55.980]   That would, that would defeat this, at least this, this 10, this 10 attempt before wipes
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:57.020]   sort of thing.
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:05.180]   So in what that, what those zero day exploits are about is about defeating the, the requirement
[00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:11.100]   that all software that the core operating software be signed by Apple, which, you know, yes,
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:17.100]   there's lots of people who are on Apple side right now that a week ago were opposed to
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:21.100]   Apple's, the requirement that Apple sign all the software because it's my device and I
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.940]   should be able to run whatever software I want on it, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:24.940]   Yes.
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:25.940]   Yeah.
[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:29.940]   And I think that's a good thing to do with Apple because Microsoft could keep anybody else
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:33.940]   from opening a Word document, for instance, or installing anything, but Microsoft Windows
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:34.940]   on their PC.
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:38.540]   But, but I do think you bring up a good point Ben, which is the fact that I mean, and I
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:41.420]   heard from a lot of people who have been talking to a lot of security professionals, a lot
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:45.140]   of hackers who, who more than just the NSA people believe they can get into this phone
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:47.220]   and there are other vectors to get into this phone.
[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:49.220]   John McAfee thinks you don't have to see.
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.220]   Well, okay.
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:51.220]   But I'm talking about, I'm talking about confidence.
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:53.500]   He says he could do it with social engineering.
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:57.180]   Because he and his team of social engineering hackers, I'm not sure exactly who you would
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:59.900]   call and, and fool to give you that phone.
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:00.900]   Ghostbusters.
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:01.900]   Yeah.
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.380]   I'm talking about actually competent people.
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:04.380]   Yes.
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:05.380]   No, I agree.
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:08.740]   You can see crackheads, but, um, alleged crackheads.
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:09.740]   Allegedly.
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:10.740]   Allegedly.
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:14.900]   But, uh, no, I mean, but, but I think that brings up an interesting point, which is,
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:18.540]   and it'll be interesting to see when this goes, gets further into court is, is how much,
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:21.900]   you know, the, the FBI, their position, the Department of Justice's position is very
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:25.340]   clearly that the reason that they're going to Apple is because Apple is their only hope.
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:26.340]   You know, help us.
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:28.940]   Apple, you know, Tim Cook, Kenobi, you know, you're our only hope.
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:30.940]   Um, but that doesn't seem to be the case.
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:34.820]   And, and, and it'll be interesting to see if that impacts this case or not and, and,
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:39.220]   and how that impacts the, the burden because I know that behind the scenes, there are a
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:42.860]   lot of security professionals who are actively offering their services.
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:46.260]   And I've heard that there are kind of two levels of people at the FBI.
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:49.820]   There's kind of the higher political level where they do see this as kind of a bigger
[00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:52.860]   political case and there's a bigger statement to be made.
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:56.460]   And then there are the people who are actually just wanting to work the case, who just want
[00:40:56.460 --> 00:41:01.180]   to get into the phone and see if they can actually just, you know, work what's happening.
[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:06.020]   And so that disconnect that's even happening, you know, at that level on law enforcement
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.340]   side is interesting too.
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:08.340]   Yeah.
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:09.340]   Yeah.
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:15.260]   I think one thing that really highlights this, this fact that the, the same Apple capability
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:21.940]   that, that is keeping this phone secure is also the one that, you know, lots of people
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:26.060]   have been annoyed about to put it, to put it, to put it kindly gets to the fact that all
[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:30.660]   this stuff has like, it has trade-offs and the trade-offs get really extreme when it
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:32.260]   comes to anything involving encryption.
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:37.340]   You know, it's very much a all or nothing sort of, sort of proposition.
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:40.980]   I mean, it's, it's math at the end of the day, like you're, you're going to get, get
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:43.780]   one answer or, or, or, or, or you're not.
[00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:47.420]   And that is what makes this case, this case tricky.
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:55.180]   And I'm not sure it's one of those things where being an absolutist, you may be right,
[00:41:55.180 --> 00:42:00.540]   but you, you, there's a danger of losing winning battles and losing wars here, I think.
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:04.620]   And that, and you can't, that's why I think it's useful to think about these different
[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:09.940]   layers because it's very possible to be narrowly right on one issue.
[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:13.980]   And if you don't, if you're not aware of and acknowledging the trade-offs that that has
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:20.140]   at other issues, there is no question that encryption makes the job of, of legitimate
[00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:21.820]   law enforcement more difficult.
[00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:25.380]   And there's nothing wrong with admitting that that's the case.
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:33.140]   The burden is on us in the tech, technological community to make the case why that trade-off
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:34.500]   is worth it.
[00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:41.580]   And one thing that I think would be very helpful, I absolutely believe in, in a right to privacy.
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:44.740]   And I think that that's an important reason to have encryption.
[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:48.500]   I'm concerned that's not the best political argument to make.
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:53.460]   The fact of the matter is people have, there's a long history of people willing to throw
[00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:56.980]   away other people's privacy to make them feel more secure.
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:59.460]   And I, but the, there's an even better archmaker.
[00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:01.100]   This is a security argument.
[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:04.420]   Like there are legitimate security reasons.
[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:10.420]   If you care about being safe, if you want to be safe, then you're not the, you don't
[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:14.100]   get to just find I'll trade away some privacy for security.
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:20.380]   No, in this case you are trading away better security for a short-term sense of feeling
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:21.380]   secure.
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:27.640]   Like Apple actually has, the FBI shouldn't be able to make the argument that this is
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:29.300]   security versus privacy argument.
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:32.820]   Oh, we're so sorry we have to violate privacy this one time.
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:37.700]   Like the argument to be made, and I think the winning political argument is that what
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:44.020]   the FBI is asking may help them in the short-term, in the long-term, it's making us, everyone,
[00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:47.260]   the US, every single citizen less secure.
[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:50.580]   Because that absolutely, it happens to be true.
[00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:55.340]   And that's, I think the, when it comes to that PR level, that's something that I think
[00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:57.300]   all of us could do a better job articulating.
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:58.660]   It's not just about privacy.
[00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:02.220]   It's important, believe me, I, we can, we're, I think, but the thing is we're preaching
[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:03.420]   to the choir when it comes to privacy.
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:08.420]   I think everyone listening to this show, everyone on here, by and large, agrees with that.
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:16.580]   When it comes to winning hearts and minds, which is going to have to be done with this,
[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:20.580]   there's a security argument to be made in favor of this and it's the right one.
[00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:23.660]   Well, it's not the end of the line.
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:24.660]   This is going to go on.
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:25.940]   Apple's going to respond.
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:26.940]   This story is going to go on.
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:33.380]   But this is also going to be the first of many attempts in a variety of ways, I think, to
[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:34.820]   break encryption.
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:44.780]   Why is, is this also partly an issue of digital technology being treated differently than
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.580]   non-digital analog technology?
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:51.140]   In other words, if the, if the police have a search warrant for my home, they can search
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:52.140]   my home.
[00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:57.220]   The lockbox in the home and the warrant covers it, they can get into it.
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:45:02.060]   If the chub, if it's a chub safe and they can't open it, they can go to chub and say,
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:03.460]   help us open it.
[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:05.740]   None of that is debated.
[00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:07.820]   Why is this treated so differently?
[00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:12.220]   I don't think it's going to be.
[00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:16.140]   The encryption issue because the encryption is breakable or it's not.
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:18.260]   Like encryption forces this to be a nightmare.
[00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:22.100]   Well, let's say there were an unbreakable safe, but there isn't, Leo.
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.900]   That's the entire point, whereas encryption is.
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:32.500]   And so that's what makes it, and the problem is you either fundamentally, you either fundamentally
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:39.940]   flaw encryption, I think I just use flaws of verb, or you don't.
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:41.940]   That's what forces this to be.
[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:45.260]   Well, I should point out, you can't break math.
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:47.020]   Encryption will continue to be possible.
[00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:49.700]   Strong encryption will still exist.
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:55.940]   It just means that Apple's version of it, or Google's, or whoever is forced to provide
[00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:58.460]   a backdoor will no longer be reliable.
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:00.980]   But it doesn't break encryption.
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:04.580]   It just means your chub safe is no longer uncrackable.
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:08.100]   I'm not sure that that's a huge moral hazard.
[00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:11.700]   If you want privacy, you just don't use an iPhone.
[00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:12.700]   And after all--
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:14.700]   So what do you use instead, Leo?
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:15.700]   PGP.
[00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:16.700]   Okay.
[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:18.740]   Or GPG, which is open.
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:21.660]   There is nobody to compel to give you a backdoor on GPG.
[00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:24.660]   And if there were, because it's open source, it'll be immediately obvious.
[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:29.060]   But I guess my point is, I mean, this is the sort of thing that on any level phone, if
[00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:31.220]   you're wanting to get into it, I mean, you're talking about Apple's encryption, but I'm
[00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:32.220]   saying okay.
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:38.100]   Well, if you want privacy, the idea of carrying a smartphone and wanting privacy seems to
[00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:40.220]   be a contradiction in terms.
[00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:43.660]   If you want privacy, you should not be carrying a smartphone.
[00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:50.260]   Well, this is why this is a question of principle, ultimately, is the burden on the customer
[00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:53.060]   to enforce their own constitutional right?
[00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:55.820]   You don't have a constitutional right to privacy.
[00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:56.820]   You don't.
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:00.060]   The Supreme Court precedent would disagree with you.
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:03.020]   Well, the Supreme Court might say so, but it's not a constitutional right.
[00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:04.020]   There may be--
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:07.220]   My amendment might disagree a little bit, but--
[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:08.220]   Well, so I mean--
[00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:11.260]   You have a right against unreasonable search and seizure.
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:14.420]   The Supreme Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution.
[00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:17.060]   And so they say it's a constitutional right to privacy.
[00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:18.860]   Is that it is a constitutional right?
[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:19.860]   Okay.
[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:22.980]   The number is and the number is of the Constitution, of the various amendments.
[00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:24.060]   It's not just the Fourth Amendment.
[00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:25.660]   It's a few different ones.
[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:32.140]   Has been found to make it so that people can't stop you from using contraception or abortion,
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:38.620]   which is why the other issue is why the privacy right-- this is why this political issue is
[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:39.620]   so complicated.
[00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:45.020]   I mean, when you talk about a right to privacy, there is a segment of this country that their
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:50.940]   ears perk up and they hear abortion because that is the-- that's at the root-- at the
[00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:51.940]   root of that.
[00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:52.940]   And again, that's what makes it so--
[00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:54.740]   This is not the amendment, most cases, yes.
[00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:56.980]   Yeah, that makes it so harrowing politically.
[00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:04.660]   I mean, the other issue is this is not just about-- this issue, whether this should be
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:05.660]   four layers.
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:08.460]   The fourth layer is this isn't just a US issue.
[00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:12.220]   This is about Apple selling in other countries.
[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:20.500]   The most obvious example is China, where all reports indicate that Apple has successfully
[00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:25.420]   resisted similar requests from the Chinese government for things like Golden Keys.
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:30.660]   They actually said on a call with press on Friday that China has never asked them for
[00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:32.660]   what the FBI is asking them for now.
[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:34.060]   Oh, isn't that interesting?
[00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:41.420]   Yeah, I would parse whatever statement they made, I would parse those words as carefully
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:42.420]   as possible.
[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:43.420]   Yeah.
[00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:44.420]   Because--
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:46.900]   Yeah, I mean, the whole issue in China is complicated.
[00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:52.220]   I mean, like, for example, iCloud data is hosted by China Unicom, not by Apple.
[00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:56.340]   And there is speculation that that allows Apple to say that our date-- we don't allow
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:58.340]   anyone to access to data that we first--
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:48:59.340]   Sure.
[00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:01.340]   Although at this point, iCloud data is not encrypted anyway.
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:05.540]   So-- Do you not think, though, that there is some balance that we could strike that would
[00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:13.220]   help us fight terrorism, fight criminality without-- I mean, as I said, if you really
[00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:18.620]   wish to have privacy, this does not-- this means you can't carry an I.
[00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:20.140]   Let's say this all goes through.
[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:25.900]   You could-- and at some point, there's a Golden Key for the iPhone or for Windows or whatever.
[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:28.140]   It doesn't mean you cannot pursue privacy.
[00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:30.260]   It just means that this device can't.
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:35.820]   And frankly, I again would say if what you want is privacy, you shouldn't be carrying
[00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:37.620]   a smartphone with you.
[00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:38.620]   Right?
[00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:42.620]   I mean, how can you protect somebody's privacy if they've got a GPS device with a microphone
[00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:46.020]   and a camera in their pocket that's broadcasting on the internet?
[00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:49.460]   How can you-- that seems like a-- that seems like a lot to ask.
[00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:51.100]   Well, I mean, really, I think--
[00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:56.380]   I don't think that we have a requirement to make sure that somebody can take-- like,
[00:49:56.380 --> 00:50:01.260]   you should be able to go jump off a cliff without hurting yourself.
[00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:02.260]   That's not a requirement.
[00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:03.980]   You can still pursue privacy, if you wish.
[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:05.860]   Just don't carry one of these around.
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:10.020]   Well, I appreciate you making the point, Leo, because I do think that it's easy for us in
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:15.540]   tech to just dismiss, you know, very legitimate arguments on the other side.
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:17.460]   I would push back on two points.
[00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:26.660]   One, I already made the point that the-- it's not my responsibility to guarantee my ability
[00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:32.180]   to speak freely, for example, to enforce my right-- my right right right right free speech.
[00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:33.860]   That burden falls on the government.
[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:39.300]   The burden falls on the government to respect rights that are enshrined in the Constitution.
[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:41.460]   So that's one.
[00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:49.260]   This is why the argument-- this is a political argument ultimately, because the fact of the
[00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:54.740]   matter is, at the end of the day, the threat from terrorism in the United States has been
[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:57.180]   dramatically oversold and leveraged to--
[00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:58.180]   That's a point of--
[00:50:58.180 --> 00:50:59.180]   --make all kind of changes.
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:00.180]   That's a political argument, and that could be the biggest--
[00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:02.700]   But you're making a political argument as well.
[00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:08.380]   But you're making a political argument that concern about terrorism ought to trump rights.
[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:10.180]   No, that's not the argument I'm making.
[00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:14.700]   I'm asking if there is some balance that we can make between protecting ourselves and
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:18.700]   protecting our security and absolute protection of privacy.
[00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:21.500]   I think it's kind of absolutist to say, well--
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:22.860]   This is why there's no reason for this.
[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:28.500]   --in no circumstance should the FBI have be able to search my phone under no circumstances.
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:29.500]   But this is--
[00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:30.500]   No, that's fine.
[00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:34.220]   So this is why the argument is not to make a privacy argument, even though one, I will
[00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:36.020]   go to the map with you on it.
[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:41.340]   But two, I will respond to you by saying, OK, Mr. Leo Loport, devil's advocate, you say
[00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:42.940]   you care about security.
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:49.180]   Well, let's back up and consider security as a whole and not in this one particular case.
[00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:54.780]   If you look at security from a systematic basis, the fact matter is the United States
[00:51:54.780 --> 00:52:01.780]   collectively has more to lose from bad security than any other country in the world, one.
[00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:08.300]   And two, we have more capabilities of overcoming security than any other country in the world.
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:15.740]   So if we want on balance to be in a better position from security, we ought to encourage
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:19.140]   broadly available technologies like encryption.
[00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:23.140]   And just make sure everybody has an Internet of Things device or two in their house.
[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:24.140]   Right, exactly.
[00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:25.140]   If you can take advantage of it.
[00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:28.260]   I mean, if you want to get back to nuts and bolts, that's the exact argument.
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:29.260]   Is it the argument?
[00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:33.500]   Yeah, if you want to make, you can make the security argument that like if you want the
[00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:39.180]   USB more secure and secure, there's good, good, strong, and widely available.
[00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:43.020]   And make sure everybody has an Amazon Echo in the house.
[00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:44.020]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:48.340]   The FBI is the FBI is so focused on like offense, right?
[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:52.820]   Like they're like this miss balanced basketball team that all they're focused on is about
[00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:54.140]   how can we score the most buckets?
[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:55.660]   How can we get the most data?
[00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:59.180]   To win a game, you have to put offense and defense.
[00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:04.100]   And the problem is the FBI is seeking to fundamentally compromise the US's defensive
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:10.980]   capabilities in order to score more buckets with the unwitting reality that that's a
[00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:16.540]   bad trade off because if everyone has the same level of defense, the US is like innate
[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:21.340]   offense is so superior to what else that we don't need to weaken our defense to have
[00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:23.140]   a systematic advantage.
[00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:28.340]   And then you, the problem is the FBI, again, they're just so focused on their problems,
[00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:31.500]   they're not focused on, and this is why the NSA supports strong encryption.
[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:34.060]   The NSA wants nothing better than to spy on everyone.
[00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:35.940]   So why do they support encryption?
[00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:40.420]   Because if you look at it on balance in a systematic sort of way, you can understand
[00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:44.820]   that everyone having the same level of defense is an advantage to the country that is the
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:45.820]   best offense.
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:48.180]   That's the United States and it will be for the foreseeable future.
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:52.460]   And bot should Apple just say, yeah, whatever you need, we'll do it.
[00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:54.940]   No, of course they shouldn't say that.
[00:53:54.940 --> 00:54:03.940]   I think the larger issue that we have here though is one of a complete lack of confidence
[00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:06.420]   in the United States criminal justice system.
[00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:07.620]   That's the root.
[00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:09.620]   That's an interesting point.
[00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:11.180]   That's the root problem here.
[00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:12.180]   They need help.
[00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:18.100]   Well, and the other thing is that the law enforcement people, maybe I'm biased because
[00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:26.060]   I happen to know a few FBI agents, but I know that they wake up in the middle of the night
[00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:30.980]   in a cold sweat thinking, did I forget something today?
[00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:36.660]   Is my phone going to ring with somebody telling me the thing we were afraid of just happened?
[00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:38.180]   And I think that's their motivation.
[00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:40.420]   I don't think there's petty politics involved here.
[00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:46.140]   I think it is coming from a sincere place from them.
[00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:51.820]   But the fact is that what they're asking for here, essentially they're asking for Apple
[00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:57.620]   to set up a dedicated criminal justice lab that they can come to with a warrant and say,
[00:54:57.620 --> 00:55:01.180]   look, we got a judge to give us this warrant, help us unlock.
[00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:02.900]   We have physical possession of this device.
[00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:04.300]   It has information on us.
[00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:06.940]   Help us unlock it.
[00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:11.460]   If you could actually create a system like that where everyone's phone was safe, the only
[00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:15.900]   people who could break into it were Apple and Apple would only do it in their secret
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:18.420]   lab with a court order.
[00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:23.900]   That would probably be okay except that nobody has any confidence in that outcome actually
[00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:29.740]   happening and nobody has any confidence in those warrants that are being issued being
[00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:36.340]   trustworthy because we have a history of the FISA court rubber stamping those warrants for
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:38.980]   the last God knows how many years.
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:40.980]   That's a really interesting thing to say.
[00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:46.700]   I like it, which is if we knew that this could just be restricted to this phone and to-
[00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:47.700]   But it can't be.
[00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:48.700]   But it can't be.
[00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:50.260]   What not just Apple?
[00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:56.100]   How can, should only the US be able to ask Apple to use a secret lab should the Chinese
[00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:58.100]   government be able to ask them?
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:55:59.100]   Right.
[00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:00.100]   I mean, the Chinese government-
[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:04.620]   If you do business in China, you have to adhere to the laws of the Chinese government.
[00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:09.180]   It opens up a lot of precedents that go way beyond this case.
[00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:12.860]   Even just in taking it just to this case, of course it can't just be restricted to this
[00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:13.860]   phone.
[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:14.860]   That's such a ridiculous argument.
[00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:18.700]   I mean, because they can very easily get a warrant to change the software to make it
[00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:19.700]   be done elsewhere.
[00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:24.860]   And as Shonathan Zadziyarski said, the fact that they would have to go through testing
[00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:29.620]   policies to prove that the software they're creating was valid.
[00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:30.940]   They would have to go through labs.
[00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:34.580]   This isn't one of those things where no matter what that this court order says, "Oh, you
[00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:36.140]   can just keep it on your campus."
[00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:39.100]   That's simply not true because that's not how the forensics testing works.
[00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:40.100]   There's still an example.
[00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:45.300]   That Zadziyarski posts is well worth reading because it may in fact be Apple's defense.
[00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:50.260]   We don't know what Apple's going to say on the 26th, but in the court order, one of
[00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:55.060]   the defenses Apple would have is that it's an undue burden for them to create this tool.
[00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:58.900]   And if it in fact is a true forensics tool, it's a massive burden.
[00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:00.820]   And it's a business that Apple's not in.
[00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:04.900]   They're asking Apple to do something that they don't do, which is create forensics tools.
[00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:05.900]   The department-
[00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:07.620]   I think that might actually be Apple's defense.
[00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:11.540]   I do want to say one thing though, and I think it's really important to say this, which is
[00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:21.220]   I come from a point of view, perhaps foolish of assuming that everybody in this is acting,
[00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:26.820]   they believe in the best interest of the American people and of our security.
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:31.380]   I don't think the people involved in this are malicious actors.
[00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:34.500]   I think we can disagree about what is the best way to go.
[00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:39.860]   And I think that one of the reasons Tim Cook had this, wrote this public post is he wanted
[00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:41.100]   this discussion to happen.
[00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:47.140]   He wanted people like you, Ben, to say, "Okay, I understand why you want this, but you have
[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:50.860]   to really understand the consequences of a golden key.
[00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:55.340]   And it's so far reaching it actually, and this is the most important argument to make
[00:57:55.340 --> 00:58:00.620]   to the FBI, hurts our long-term national interest and our long-term national security.
[00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:04.100]   And if you can make that argument successfully to Congress, to the FBI, to law enforcement
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:11.060]   in general, I think they are, I do believe, like you had, I know many people in law enforcement.
[00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:14.620]   There are people, high up people in the Department of Justice who listened to this show, I know,
[00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:16.180]   on a regular basis.
[00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:19.220]   And I think it's really important that we not come from the point of view that they're
[00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:20.220]   malicious actors.
[00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:23.260]   No, they're acting in our, what they believe is our best interest.
[00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:26.700]   And it's important to have this conversation so that they understand, everybody understands
[00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:29.660]   the full consequences of this.
[00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:38.500]   And that is something that, unfortunately, in the initial rush to judgment on this, there
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:44.420]   is an unfortunate assumption from Silicon Valley that the motives of the government
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:48.060]   are evil, just plain evil.
[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:51.820]   And that's kind of what I want to separate out is this, there's an anti-government streak.
[00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:57.260]   Look, I understand, and I maybe don't even disagree with it, but that is not really where
[00:58:57.260 --> 00:59:03.860]   the conversation needs to go because that's a political conversation.
[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:08.220]   And there is an, once you start saying, "Well, I don't trust the government in any way,
[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:11.820]   they should never have this ability," you've kind of really lost your moral standing to
[00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:12.820]   have this discussion.
[00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:15.300]   I think Ben is working this much stronger, frankly.
[00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:16.300]   I completely agree.
[00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:19.980]   And I think that's something that the point that we're all in the same boat here.
[00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:23.060]   And this is why this is a political fight.
[00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:27.420]   And being an ideologue about this is not going to help.
[00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:31.140]   Again, you might win a battle, but you're going to lose the war.
[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:34.700]   And I think that that's a great reminder, Leo, and something to bring up.
[00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:40.100]   One thing I do think that, and actually, I would almost use an example of, I think this,
[00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:45.940]   John Zizarski post was very good and excellent, and he's had a couple of really good posts.
[00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:52.580]   I'd be wary of, for example, I would bat the FBI with, should this post or similar, I would
[00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:55.500]   talk about that and say, "Oh, no, we don't want to make a forensic tool."
[00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:56.500]   And then the guy's already dead.
[00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:59.500]   His defense lawyer is not going to make us verify it, blah, blah, blah.
[00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:02.260]   This is why it comes down, like, is the--
[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:04.380]   It's broader reaching than just this case.
[01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:05.700]   Well, it's about precedent.
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:12.380]   It's about once the FBI, it's in the FBI's interest to make this as narrow as possible.
[01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:15.860]   So for example, they're making it, that's why Apple can do it on their labs and they
[01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:17.140]   can make it for this one phone.
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:18.980]   And Apple can make this for one phone.
[01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:22.540]   This, of course, is an Apple can easily make it for another phone once it's done.
[01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:28.820]   And so the FBI is going to keep this as narrow as possible.
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:35.420]   And frankly, as an observer and a former recovering constitutional law student, this
[01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:40.180]   is a very nice case because it is so clear cut.
[01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:45.420]   It comes down to a matter of principle and others' interpretation of the All Ritz Act.
[01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:46.420]   And I would--
[01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:47.420]   I see--
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:50.900]   It's kind of cliché, say, "Oh, this is not to go to the Supreme Court."
[01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:53.900]   The reality is that the vast majority of cases don't go to the Supreme Court.
[01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:56.620]   It's a very few number of cases per year.
[01:00:56.620 --> 01:01:02.580]   But this one is so clear cut and it's so clearly a matter of, like, there are arguments to
[01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:07.540]   be made on both sides that I think it will.
[01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:10.980]   And it's going to be fascinating to watch it unfold for sure.
[01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:11.980]   All right.
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:19.820]   We spent an hour on it, an hour we need to spend, and I think very-- really, really informing
[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:20.820]   valuable discussion.
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:21.820]   So thank you.
[01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:24.740]   Anything, Christina, you want a final word, too?
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:29.700]   No, I mean, it's been said-- I think this will go to the Supreme Court.
[01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:31.820]   I think that this is much bigger than just this case.
[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:35.740]   And I think that that's why there are so many opinions on both sides and why it's such
[01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:39.340]   a difficult conversation to have because it's not just about this one phone.
[01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:40.700]   It's about a lot more.
[01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:43.740]   And what that means down the line we'll see.
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:47.100]   It'll be interesting to see Apple's response on Friday.
[01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:48.100]   Absolutely.
[01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:54.340]   And I have no doubt that right now in Cupertino, there are similar conversations going back
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:57.460]   and forth about what is the best course of the two lives.
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:59.340]   There's one more angle, too.
[01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:06.740]   I mean, first off, this was the 5C, which these restrictions can be overcome by updating
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:07.740]   the operating system, basically.
[01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:11.900]   The operating system enforces the 10-pass code "women."
[01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:20.220]   This would be significantly more difficult on the 5S and on because the 10 limit and the
[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:23.820]   delay between tries is enforced by the secure enclave.
[01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:28.380]   This secure enclave is basically a separate computer within the iPhone.
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:32.940]   It's its own silken, it's its own software.
[01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:39.060]   And Apple's contention on background has been that, well, yes, but the same technique could
[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:45.140]   apply, which basically means Apple could update the secure enclave to overcome this sort of
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:46.140]   thing.
[01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:52.980]   I think what's going to be interesting from my perspective is it's too late for next year,
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:03:00.020]   but maybe the year after that is the 10-pass word counting or the delay at least.
[01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:02.140]   Probably the delay would be the more likely thing.
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:04.140]   Is that going to be etched into the silken?
[01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:07.900]   So basically Apple's going to be like, well, the only way to overcome this is, yeah, we
[01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:09.900]   have to build a custom chip for you.
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:10.900]   Sorry.
[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:12.700]   If you want to know when Ries will burden.
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:14.700]   That's a good idea.
[01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:16.660]   Well, I respect those.
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:20.900]   That's kind of what the TPM and Palladium was all about was hardware-based security.
[01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:25.100]   And if you don't think they're already thinking about those things, I'm sure that they are.
[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:27.220]   And they're also thinking about what things they can do on the software side.
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:31.900]   But there are many in this country who would see that as treasonous.
[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:37.460]   That Apple is acting in every moment to undermine law enforcement in this country.
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:40.260]   There's quite a few people who would say that.
[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:41.260]   Right.
[01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:43.260]   And that's why I think we should be making this secure.
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:44.260]   That's why this case is so interesting.
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:45.260]   Yeah.
[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:48.020]   I mean, that's why this is the ultimate, the last thing I would kind of say, what I think
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:51.220]   has been interesting about the last week is that it has been kind of this ultimate PR
[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:53.700]   battle because you have Apple obviously fighting their side.
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:56.780]   They haven't even filed a response yet, but they have filed their letter and they've obviously
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:58.940]   had calls to people on background.
[01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:02.700]   And you have the FBI and the Department of Justice who are going full blast on their
[01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:03.700]   side.
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:09.460]   It's at this point, even though it's it's ostensibly not a political case, the entire
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:13.060]   way this is being handled on both sides is as political as you can get.
[01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:14.580]   And it's already getting very, very ugly.
[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:17.540]   And I think it's only going to get uglier.
[01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:18.540]   Let's take a break.
[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:21.180]   We're going to come back with more ed bot is here from ZD net.

[01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:27.140]   Oh, Fran.

[01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:29.420]   T station.com, we thank you for their support.
[01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:33.500]   I did find the tweet I referred to earlier, which was Josh centers.
[01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:38.940]   He said, "Trump has picked fights with the world's three largest religions, Roman Catholicism,
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:39.940]   Islam and Apple."
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:42.180]   Oh, it's true.
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:45.820]   I should find just for entertainment sake.
[01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:51.380]   Here's the video of Donald Trump, who by the way, I think after this result in South
[01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:54.860]   Carolina, we have to start taking seriously.
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:07:00.260]   You can't just say, this guy is probably going to be the Republican nominee very likely.
[01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:05.020]   So I like the idea boycott Apple until such time as they give that information.
[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:07.220]   I think that's a great idea.
[01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:10.860]   Okay, yes.
[01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:11.860]   That's the Donald.
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:14.340]   Actually, I think he wants to do more than boycott Apple.
[01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:18.580]   I think he wants to Apple to bring all of its manufacturing back to the United States,
[01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:19.580]   which would put it out of business.
[01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:21.300]   So that's a good idea.
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:24.620]   It's only the most successful company in the United States right now.
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:25.620]   Why not?
[01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:28.820]   Speaking of Apple, good news.
[01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:35.980]   It's interesting because I think that the Apple manufacturing in China thing is it's
[01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:42.820]   a great example of how soundbites can replace kind of like thought, real understanding.
[01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:43.820]   Yes.
[01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:45.820]   Well, first off, why-
[01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:53.820]   By the way, there is a huge appeal to just saying stuff like that because you go, "Yeah."
[01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:54.820]   And that's it.
[01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:55.820]   It's just visceral.
[01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:57.420]   I mean, there are devils in the details.
[01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:58.860]   I mean, how do you build a wall?
[01:07:58.860 --> 01:07:59.860]   How do you ban Muslims?
[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:01.580]   How do you do any of this?
[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:06.180]   Doesn't matter because it makes you feel good.
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:07.180]   Right.
[01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:12.620]   I mean, that's why it's on, you know, I think it's on us and this goes with this debate
[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:13.620]   too.
[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:21.260]   Like, there's, we can actually, if you can say, you want to say this is about security, fine.
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:22.260]   Let's talk about security.
[01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:23.260]   Right.
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:28.980]   And then, Apple is in the right here, even if you think there's no right to privacy.
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:30.740]   You think that's all a bunch of BS?
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:31.940]   Like, they're fine.
[01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:34.460]   I will win on security argument.
[01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:36.020]   Let's have that conversation.
[01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:37.180]   Right.
[01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:43.420]   And I mean, you know, the Apple manufacturing point is the value add to an iPhone is dramatically
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:44.740]   in favor of the United States.
[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:46.300]   The China value add is quite small.
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:48.700]   The Fox 9 add is a couple dollars per device.
[01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:53.860]   What's done here in the States by programmers and engineers and designers is 90, what is
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:54.860]   it?
[01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:56.060]   90% of the iPhone's value is a huge.
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:57.460]   Well, it's not that much.
[01:08:57.460 --> 01:09:01.540]   I mean, if you go through the amount of value add to the iPhone, China is relatively low
[01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:02.540]   in the West.
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:05.460]   I mean, the United States is far and away number one.
[01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:07.380]   I believe South Korea is number two.
[01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:11.100]   Taiwan's, I think number, I think Japan's number three, Taiwan's number four.
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:14.020]   I think Japan might be fifth or six or China might be fifth or six.
[01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:21.340]   But I mean, it's the entire point where being there's an aspect of meeting people where
[01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:22.340]   they are.
[01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:24.100]   And that's a complicated issue.
[01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:28.260]   You understand people don't live and breathe this like we do.
[01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:37.140]   And I'm just concerned about people being so ideological and like it's understandable
[01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:42.100]   why people believe that unequivocally, Apple should do this.
[01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:47.100]   We got attacked, it's terrorism, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:53.700]   But I think it's an opportunity to win this war, not just in this case, but for the long
[01:09:53.700 --> 01:10:00.700]   run, which would be a tremendous benefit to the, to technology probably and to the United
[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:01.700]   States.
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:04.820]   This is why, you know, if you were a politician, Ben, you'd have to say we're doing this for
[01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:08.260]   the children for future generations.
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:09.260]   Just a tip.
[01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:11.060]   Next time you're running for political.
[01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:12.060]   I'll keep that in mind.
[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:13.740]   Yeah, that's with kids.
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:17.980]   Apple has admitted that, oops, era 53 was an error.
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:19.780]   We didn't mean to do that.
[01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:22.740]   And that's kind of what I thought, but we didn't work short because Apple wasn't being
[01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:24.980]   very communicative.
[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:27.900]   What of course happened and you we've talked about this story, we talked about it last
[01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:32.820]   week was if you had a third party, fix your screen didn't even have to be the fingerprint
[01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:34.660]   reader, but just fix your screen.
[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:40.140]   It would break the relationship between the fingerprint reader and the secure enclave.
[01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:43.700]   Of course, that's a security flaw.
[01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:50.180]   And if at that point you updated your phone, you'd break it with the dreaded error 53.
[01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:53.980]   Apple said we never intended that to happen.
[01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:57.300]   They released an update to iOS 9.2.1.
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:59.780]   If you have an error 53 phone, we'll fix it.
[01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:01.420]   I'm not sure how you would have applied that.
[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:02.420]   I guess you'd have to plug it in.
[01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:03.420]   I can't.
[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:05.900]   Yeah, that's not that's not quite right.
[01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:06.900]   We go.
[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:11.020]   This was absolutely about the home button, not about the screen.
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:15.220]   Sometimes the connector would be removed in the process of replacing the screen and that
[01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:16.860]   was enough.
[01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:20.700]   And actually, I think Apple is speaking very carefully here.
[01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:21.860]   Of course, they intended to do this.
[01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:26.460]   And actually, this update does not restore the fingerprint sensor.
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:27.460]   Right.
[01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:28.460]   And you will no longer have touch ID.
[01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:29.460]   Right.
[01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:30.460]   It doesn't have to be a third party.
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:34.260]   By point was that it doesn't have to be a third party touch ID.
[01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:40.100]   Apple's error was in not having text that explained what was happening instead of displaying error
[01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:41.100]   53.
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:43.100]   No, the error was very much.
[01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:48.740]   No, no, Apple, the entire point of the fingerprint sensor, the fingerprint sensor being tied
[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:54.660]   in the secure enclave is the fact that the operating system like should not be able to
[01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:55.660]   interfere with that chain.
[01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:56.660]   And actually, that's why it's interesting.
[01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:59.060]   It has an interesting tie in to this in.
[01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:00.900]   It's part of the overall security.
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:01.900]   That's right.
[01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:02.900]   Exactly.
[01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:06.180]   That's why even though it's updated here, there's two things going on here.
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:09.980]   One, it's updated and they're not restoring fingerprint functionality because that--
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:13.140]   But at least restoring the functionality of the telephone.
[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:14.140]   Right.
[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:15.140]   Exactly.
[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:16.540]   And that's what they would have intended.
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:21.940]   And I presume at that point, you could bring it into the Apple store and they would repair
[01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:24.540]   the secure enclave with the fingerprint reader providing--
[01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:25.540]   They can't--
[01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:26.540]   Or they have to replace it.
[01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:27.540]   Yeah.
[01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:28.540]   Go ahead and--
[01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:29.540]   Let's set it in.
[01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:31.540]   They're putting the entire phone.
[01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:37.940]   But the problem here was that they brick the phone instead of just disabling the touch
[01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:39.740]   ID capability.
[01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:40.740]   Right.
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:41.740]   And saying--
[01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:42.740]   Which is--
[01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:43.740]   It's an--
[01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:44.740]   It's a--
[01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:45.740]   It's a--
[01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:46.740]   --what Samsung would do.
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:47.740]   Samsung has the same issue with Knox.
[01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:48.740]   They would make Knox no longer functioning.
[01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:51.700]   It would no longer have access to Samsung pay.
[01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.380]   It wouldn't brick the phone.
[01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:56.380]   But I think I credit Apple saying we didn't mean to do that.
[01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:57.380]   We're sorry.
[01:12:57.380 --> 01:12:58.580]   That wasn't the intent.
[01:12:58.580 --> 01:13:00.180]   Do you not think that's the case?
[01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:01.180]   Ed?
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:02.180]   I don't know.
[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:03.180]   I do think that's the case.
[01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:05.180]   I think it was a mistake.
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:08.820]   Apple says we apologize for any conveniences.
[01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:14.220]   It was designed to be a factory test and was not intended to affect customers.
[01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:16.740]   Customers who paid for an out-of-war warranty replacement of their device based on this
[01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:19.580]   issue should contact Apple Care about reimbursement.
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:20.580]   Right.
[01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:24.620]   But I mean, again, the point was the way the error was handled.
[01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:26.420]   It wasn't the throwing of the error.
[01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:27.420]   I--
[01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:28.420]   Yes.
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:29.420]   No, they want--
[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:30.420]   It says they should have an error.
[01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:31.420]   I mean, it's a warning.
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:33.180]   Look, you may have a compromised device.
[01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:35.740]   We don't know what's going to happen now.
[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:37.660]   You could have a Trojan on there.
[01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:38.660]   We don't know.
[01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:40.500]   Well, let's just say you have a car price device.
[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.140]   Fingerprint reading has been disabled.
[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:43.140]   Right.
[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:44.140]   Exactly.
[01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:45.140]   You know, you bring it to Apple.
[01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:49.300]   And then, yeah, it's-- but then again, I mean, are you sure it's going to brick the
[01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:50.300]   phone?
[01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:51.300]   I mean--
[01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:52.300]   Well, it's--
[01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:54.300]   I don't think it's going to brick the phone.
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:57.140]   This is why this is why this is-- whole issue is complicated.
[01:13:57.140 --> 01:14:03.460]   The fact of the matter is, this could be a vector to attack the security of a phone.
[01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:08.260]   We've already established that with the on-disc encryption, the disc can't be attacked
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:09.260]   directly.
[01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:13.460]   By far, the most efficient way to attack the disc is to attack the passcode.
[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:18.420]   And this is-- the fingerprint reader is a way around attacking the passcode because
[01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:20.100]   that's what the fingerprint reader does.
[01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:26.220]   I mean, the entire-- the entire point of the year, I just found it fascinating how-- this
[01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:31.820]   is just a great example of how binary and problematic this entire issue is because I'm
[01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:36.060]   not totally certain that breaking a phone when you replace the fingerprint reader if
[01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:40.700]   you actually do care about security is the worst thing in the world.
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:43.740]   It's a bad thing from a customer service perspective and from the way people--
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:45.380]   I don't care that much about security.
[01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:46.700]   I want to use my gosh darn phone.
[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:48.340]   I want to buy a new phone.
[01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:49.340]   Exactly.
[01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:55.620]   If that's the case that should-- no, it-- look, this is the law of unintended consequences
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:15:00.620]   and update to the operating system is what brick the phones that had been repaired months
[01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:03.300]   or a year earlier.
[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:09.620]   Now this was just sloppy software engineering and not testing because Apple employees don't
[01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:11.820]   have to take their phones--
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:13.620]   That's a good point.
[01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:15.180]   There was no third party.
[01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:16.660]   Third party point.
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:21.140]   So they didn't test this scenario because they didn't think it was going to be--
[01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:24.700]   Well, even more so, there's a psychology, hey, if you're taking a third party repair
[01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:26.700]   people, all bets are off.
[01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:28.700]   Well, I think that's a good point.
[01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:30.700]   I don't know if that's the case where there is no Apple store.
[01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:31.700]   Right.
[01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:32.700]   That's the exact--
[01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:33.700]   Right.
[01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:34.700]   Like the reporter for the Guardian that discovered this.
[01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:35.700]   Right.
[01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:36.700]   He was in Macedonia.
[01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:37.700]   Right.
[01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:41.860]   I mean, if you're in the Balkans and you need your phone fixed, you need your phone fixed.
[01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:45.860]   I think that it's perfectly acceptable and reasonable to say that most users should
[01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:49.580]   understand that if you want your phone to work the way that it shouldn't be under warranty,
[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:53.780]   you need to go to an Apple store and pay their prices as imply as they may be.
[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:57.900]   But the fact remains that if your phone-- if you've got an issue with it and you need
[01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:01.380]   a working phone for whatever reason, then you can't send it off to them or there's not
[01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:05.660]   a store there, repairing your phone shouldn't brick it with the software update.
[01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:07.700]   I think that what they're doing now does make sense.
[01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:09.260]   I mean, then you make a good point.
[01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:11.420]   There could be a potential security vector here.
[01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:15.460]   But I mean, if you're shutting off everything associated with a secure enclave, which is
[01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:21.700]   what you would hope is being done and basically letting that just not be accessible anymore
[01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:26.860]   and the only way it can be, you know, you can basically get Apple Pay back is to get a
[01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:27.860]   brand new phone.
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:29.500]   I think that's a fair trade-off.
[01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:34.540]   But I don't think it's fair if you're getting your phone fixed and like Ed says, you get
[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:39.300]   an update, everything has been working fine and all of a sudden your phone's bricked.
[01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:40.900]   That you've got something that's completely useless.
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:46.660]   I mean, at least deprecate it to being the equivalent of an iPhone 5C, don't make the
[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:48.660]   whole thing useless.
[01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:51.460]   Here's another.
[01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:53.580]   Okay, I'm not going to do all Apple today.
[01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:57.580]   We got a lot of stuff from Mobile World Congress says nothing to do with Apple.
[01:16:57.580 --> 01:17:03.700]   But I kind of, I like this story because it's so, I saw it, local news, Channel 5 news here
[01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:09.220]   in San Francisco reported on mystery noises is my friend Mike Sugarman as a matter of fact,
[01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:13.660]   coming from a secret Apple facility in Sunnyvale.
[01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:18.740]   Car's building its driverless car and testing it in here.
[01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:20.940]   They certainly don't want anybody to know what's going on.
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:24.060]   They got fences like this one up all over the place.
[01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:25.700]   Not building the driverless car.
[01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:26.700]   That's no big deal.
[01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:27.700]   That's legal.
[01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:28.700]   It's nothing.
[01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:33.380]   But in the middle of the night, neighbors here clanging, banging, trucks pull up at all
[01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:35.900]   hours of the day to make deliveries.
[01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:36.900]   And it's a neighborhood.
[01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:38.540]   It's not an industrial area.
[01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:43.260]   So neighbors have been complaining about the noise from this.
[01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:45.340]   Now, who knows what's really going on in there?
[01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:48.060]   For all we know, they're building a secret fingerprint reader.
[01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:51.580]   I just loved it.
[01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:55.500]   The San Francisco, it's basically turned into TMZ.
[01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:56.500]   It is.
[01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:57.500]   It is.
[01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:04.100]   It's got the paparazzi out there with high range cameras and microphones to pick up every
[01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:05.100]   little thing.
[01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:06.100]   That's fantastic.
[01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:10.140]   They talked to the Sunnyvale City Hall and they said, we didn't know this was going on
[01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:11.900]   until we saw your report on TV.
[01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:14.940]   So apparently they have a permit.
[01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:15.940]   This is funny.
[01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:18.220]   Mike tries to knock on the door.
[01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:21.580]   They have a permit to build cars here.
[01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:27.660]   So they actually did apply for a permit to build cars in this facility ages ago, I guess.
[01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:29.220]   And maybe they've been doing it all this time.
[01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:30.620]   And we're just doing some body work.
[01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:32.620]   We do a little body work.
[01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:36.500]   We're thinking that a couple of things and dents were taken out here.
[01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:37.500]   Let's take a car.
[01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:39.980]   What do we got to fix it?
[01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:40.980]   Who knows what's really going on.
[01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:43.340]   Steve would have wanted it.
[01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:44.340]   Yeah.
[01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:45.340]   All right.
[01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:48.340]   Let's talk about Barcelona.
[01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:51.340]   The mobile world Congress starts tomorrow.
[01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:54.420]   We actually have Father Robert Ballisare there and a team covering it.
[01:18:54.420 --> 01:19:01.980]   But of course, today, both LG and Samsung had events to show off new phones.
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:09.620]   Let's start with the LG G5 because that chronologically was the first nice looking new phone.
[01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:14.340]   It's pretty much a kind of a reinvention of what was always a good phone, but never got
[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:17.860]   much play.
[01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:18.980]   The G4 is a great phone.
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:28.140]   The G5 now has a pop out modular chunk on the bottom that will allow you to change batteries
[01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:35.780]   or even add more battery and kind of a camera button on the thing.
[01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:36.780]   See, there it is.
[01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:39.660]   It's popping out of the bottom if you're watching the video.
[01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:41.260]   This has been tried before by other companies.
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:44.060]   I haven't seen a modular phone in some time though.
[01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:47.900]   What do you think?
[01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:49.420]   I love LG's phones.
[01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:51.300]   I have a G4 and a V10.
[01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:53.540]   Did you get the V10?
[01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:56.060]   I was there's the camera back by the way.
[01:19:56.060 --> 01:19:57.060]   Yeah.
[01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:58.060]   What do you think of the V10?
[01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:00.060]   It is considerably bigger.
[01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:02.100]   It's like a six inch.
[01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:03.540]   It's like a five point.
[01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:06.180]   Yeah, pretty close to six inches.
[01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:14.340]   Although it's not as tall as an iPhone 6 Plus or 6S Plus.
[01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:16.780]   It's not as tall because it doesn't have the button.
[01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:19.420]   It doesn't have to have the home button at the bottom.
[01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:21.860]   The button is on the back.
[01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:23.900]   They've abandoned that, which I find interesting.
[01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:25.860]   They've replaced that with a fingerprint reader.
[01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:28.740]   It's kind of a Nexus 6P style fingerprint reader on the back.
[01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:33.180]   Well, the V10, this is the button and the fingerprint reader that are the same on the
[01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:34.180]   back.
[01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:35.180]   Yeah.
[01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:38.580]   Although it doesn't work about half the time.
[01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:41.420]   They're going to the same one that they made for the 5X.
[01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:43.300]   I think LG made the Nexus 5X right.
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:45.700]   They're going to that same.
[01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:47.900]   And it works really well on the 6P.
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:51.460]   In fact, it's kind of a natural way to pick up the phone and unlock it all in one swoop
[01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:52.460]   in it.
[01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:54.740]   I think it works quite well.
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:21:00.340]   It's going to be the Samsung-- I'm sorry, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820, four gigs of RAM,
[01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:07.180]   16 megapixel camera on the front, and it's got two cameras and another front on the back.
[01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:12.460]   And it's got a second 8 megapixel camera with 135 degree angle, a wide angle on the
[01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:13.820]   back.
[01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:18.660]   So I'm not sure how those will work together or maybe they won't.
[01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:20.420]   Maybe you'll just use whichever one you want to use.
[01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:22.860]   But in a way, that's kind of like having a zoom.
[01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:29.020]   Yeah, that's similar to what the rumors are that Apple might be doing for the iPhone 7.
[01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:31.940]   They are going to do a dual camera according to the rumor mill, yeah.
[01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:32.940]   Right.
[01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:33.940]   So it's kind of a similar thing.
[01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:38.620]   I think this modular thing is interesting, although I'm always skeptical of anything modular,
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:41.820]   because I like the idea and theory and I think that it's cool that you could swap out something
[01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:45.220]   for another battery or you could add another accessory or you could do other stuff.
[01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:46.460]   I think that's interesting.
[01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:50.340]   But if I'm being totally honest, it's one of those things I feel like, OK, you invested
[01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:54.900]   a lot of money into R&D and development of this and almost no one is going to use this.
[01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:57.140]   But they need a differentiator.
[01:21:57.140 --> 01:21:58.900]   This is the hardest thing when you're making an answer.
[01:21:58.900 --> 01:21:59.900]   They do need a differentiator.
[01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:03.300]   But I guess my point is this still feels like a gimmick for gimmick sake that no one who
[01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:07.100]   actually buys the phone is actually also going to be buying the accessories because it's
[01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:12.020]   cool, but it seems like one of those things that's going to appeal to a very small amount
[01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:13.020]   of people.
[01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:15.260]   Like you might buy the phone thing, you know, yeah, I'll buy the accessories and swap stuff
[01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:16.260]   out.
[01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:19.340]   But do you really want to travel or like go around with having the different accessories
[01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:20.340]   in your pocket?
[01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:21.340]   No, I mean, that's a good idea.
[01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:22.420]   I do like a replaceable battery.
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:24.140]   I'm glad they brought that back.
[01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:28.500]   Well, I mean, the reality is, is there's a small amount of the market for high in Android
[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:29.700]   is a small amount of people.
[01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:30.700]   Right.
[01:22:30.700 --> 01:22:36.140]   I mean, the market dynamics of the smartphone market are such that Apple has as a hold on
[01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:39.540]   it and that hold is slowly but steadily increasing.
[01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:46.580]   And the sort of people who remain are the people who actually, I think, do tend to value
[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:49.900]   flexibility and modularity and that's a reason why they like Android.
[01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:55.580]   Why they'll pay $600 for an Android phone or $500.
[01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:59.940]   And for that market, and this is actually why I wrote last year that I thought the S6
[01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:03.540]   was a really, by Samsung was a really poor decision.
[01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:07.380]   Like you'll remember last year, Samsung focused on we're going to have design and we're going
[01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:08.380]   to have all in one.
[01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:10.740]   They removed like a memory card, all those sort of stuff.
[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:13.780]   And the S and ever like, oh, the Samsung back, are they going to make a thing?
[01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:16.940]   Actually, the S6 was a big disappointment.
[01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:18.180]   And the reason I think was obvious.
[01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:22.780]   The reason is because the sort of people who were the market for a high in Android phone
[01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:24.620]   value those kinds of things.
[01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:26.580]   That's why they like Android in the first place.
[01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:28.380]   How does Android sell in Taiwan?
[01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:30.180]   Do you see a lot of Android phones here?
[01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:32.180]   Oh, there's a fair number.
[01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:33.580]   Mostly iPhone though.
[01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:38.860]   No, I think, and I mean, I mean, I mean, in any country, the iPhone is not the, is
[01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:39.860]   not the majority.
[01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:44.540]   The US, it's the US here where you see most of the iPhones for sure.
[01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:48.540]   Well, the US is very dominant in Japan also.
[01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:53.860]   And you'll see, especially in first tier Chinese cities, there's, I mean, there's iPhones
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:54.860]   everywhere.
[01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:56.580]   Because it's a status symbol.
[01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:57.580]   Right.
[01:23:57.580 --> 01:24:02.100]   When you talk about selling the entire ecosystem, the ecosystem isn't just apps.
[01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:03.580]   It's not just the hardware.
[01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:04.940]   It's not just the status.
[01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:06.340]   It's not just those things.
[01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:08.580]   It's all that, it's all that sort of stuff.
[01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:11.620]   And the Apple proposition here is very strong.
[01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:17.580]   Again, where the vast majority of Android sales are at the lower end of the market.
[01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:21.060]   So I think we're talking about a specific niche, which is high in Android.
[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:25.100]   And for the high in Android market, which again, these are people who could afford an
[01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:27.700]   iPhone, but they choose not to buy an iPhone.
[01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:29.300]   And why would they not buy an iPhone?
[01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:32.500]   Well, probably because they value the things that Android brings to the table.
[01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:36.420]   And if you think about what they value from a software perspective, it seems natural to
[01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:39.780]   assume that would extend to the hardware side as well, which again is why I think Samsung
[01:24:39.780 --> 01:24:41.220]   made a mistake with the S6.
[01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:45.100]   I think the evidence bore that out that it wasn't received as well as they hoped.
[01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:48.740]   And with the S7, which you haven't talked about yet, but they're adding back in.
[01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:50.300]   SD cards are back, baby.
[01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:51.300]   Exactly.
[01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:52.300]   And I brought it back.
[01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:54.460]   But for this, I think it's LG.
[01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:56.940]   Well, that's why I like this LG sort of thing.
[01:24:56.940 --> 01:25:01.980]   Because I think they're, they, it's an understanding of what the high in Android market values.
[01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:05.460]   And I think it's, it's a very interesting move in that one of the modules you'll be able
[01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:12.180]   to add is a, is a high-fi module, a 32-bit DAC, and amplifier unit with, from Bang and
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:13.180]   Olufsen.
[01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:16.700]   They probably sell a few thousand of those.
[01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:18.940]   I don't know if people though, that's the thing.
[01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:22.220]   A few thousand, Neil Young couldn't sell a few thousand PONO players.
[01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:25.540]   I think LG is going to sell a few thousand on top of this phone that's already going
[01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:26.540]   after a niche market.
[01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:28.820]   I mean, I love the phone and I like a lot of the ideas.
[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:32.780]   I just genuinely don't think that the most people who even buy this phone accepting, you
[01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:36.620]   know, for the reasons the bin lays out, are still going to want to buy accessories to,
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:37.620]   to carry around with them.
[01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:39.820]   I mean, I could see buying the camera thing.
[01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:44.780]   Now it adds a big bump, but it also bumps the battery from 2,800 to 4,000 milliamp hours.
[01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:48.140]   That's a significant size battery for a phone like this.
[01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:49.140]   Yeah.
[01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:51.100]   And then suddenly you have this big bump with a camera button.
[01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:55.620]   I mean, that's what I'm saying at a certain point, it's so, it still needs to be a phone.
[01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:59.500]   And I mean, I think that everybody who's tried this modular stuff, it ends up not really
[01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:00.500]   working that well.
[01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:02.180]   And it didn't even work that well with laptops.
[01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:05.100]   And that was, you know, back in the late 90s, early 2000s.
[01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:08.980]   And that was when it was cool to actually have like hot swappable bass in your laptop.
[01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:13.700]   I mean, like, I love that on my Mac, like my, my power book, my, my, my, my, my, my,
[01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:14.700]   my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my,
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:15.700]   my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my,

[01:26:38.700 --> 01:27:08.700]   my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
