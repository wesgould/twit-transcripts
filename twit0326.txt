[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.200]   This is Twit, this week in tech and joining us a great panel.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.240]   Once again, to discuss the week's tech news.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.720]   And it's a bunch of authors today,
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.160]   starting with Nick Bilton, who lives in the future.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.400]   And in fact, shares how it works, the paperback edition.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.440]   It's now out, Nick Bilton writes, of course,
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.440]   for the New York Times.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.320]   Bitt's blog is the lead technology writer.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.720]   They're a reporter for the paper.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.040]   I'm reading off the back of the book.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.520]   Oh, you are.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.840]   Yeah, that makes it a good way for me.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.560]   I was actually impressed with that you knew that.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.480]   And he blogs at NickBilton.com.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.480]   So congratulations.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.280]   No, he doesn't usually do.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.680]   You don't write anything.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.160]   It's like one--
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.960]   Who has time?
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.360]   Who has time?
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.120]   No one.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.560]   I tweet.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.520]   You tweet.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.440]   And you brought a lollipop.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.360]   You said you brought me a gift.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.520]   It was a lollipop gift.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.520]   No, the gift was the book.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.000]   Oh, the book.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   All right.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.280]   And also sitting next to me.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.600]   My black friend, Barreton--
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.160]   No, I say that because that's what you wrote in.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.880]   I actually signed it for you that way.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.640]   So don't write me letters, folks.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.360]   Write me letters.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.800]   This is going to be out any minute now.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.800]   It'll be out January 31st.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   Ah, finally.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.300]   What?
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.040]   You can pre-order it.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.280]   You can pre-order.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.040]   And I'm doing a very special thing, Leo.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.560]   What's that?
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.160]   I'm doing a street team for the book.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.320]   I'm recruiting an army, a black army of blackness.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.840]   You don't have to be black to be in the army.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.480]   Can anybody join?
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.400]   Anybody can join.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.160]   I encourage everybody to--
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.040]   If you want to be behind me--
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.040]   You have to read the book first.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.040]   You have to read the book first.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.040]   You can join this thing.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.040]   So join the team.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.120]   It's about.me/--
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.120]   How to be black.me.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.960]   I was talking every once.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.720]   How to join/twit.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.400]   There's a special code just for Twit.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.320]   How to be black.me/join/twit.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.320]   There you go.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.320]   What do we get?
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.320]   So you're going to get early access to the book.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.320]   Oh, that's great.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.400]   You're going to get a private messaging group to share ideas.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.240]   You're going to get a forum for the other street team members.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.800]   You're going to get private video chats.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.800]   That's awesome.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.240]   Personally signed copy by me and a whole bunch of other stuff
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.240]   to be decided.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.560]   And you'll also get to make a book blow up.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.600]   Baron Toden has been working on this book for a long time.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.280]   I'm so glad to have the proof here.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.280]   My life.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.280]   Thank you.
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.280]   I can't wait to read this.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.280]   Thank you very much.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.280]   You've been awesomely support.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.280]   Also joining us, this is a big day for Joshua Topolsky because his new site, The Verge, has launched.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.520]   And you know what, Joshua?
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.880]   We were talking before the show.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.960]   Beautiful job on this.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.360]   Very impressive.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.360]   Thank you very much.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.880]   Remember Joshua was editor and chief at Engadget.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.880]   We've started something called This Is My Next with a bunch of his Engadget pals like
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.240]   Niele Patel.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.560]   And they have gone on to create the site.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.720]   They were working on it for a long time.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.720]   And you could tell, you know, this feels like a site that's been around for years.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.840]   The content on this is incredible.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.480]   Yeah, they did a fantastic job.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.680]   I'm just really blown away.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.680]   Beautiful.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.680]   Of course, we brought it to its knees.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.280]   He, yeah, you've crashed it.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.960]   I know you don't know.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.760]   You know, we launched in the middle of the night.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.240]   And my greatest fear, of course, is that you would launch and immediately crash.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.400]   They found, you know, developers like we're going to pick the lowest traffic time to launch
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.400]   it in this smart.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.400]   It's been, it's been stable.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   I'm jinxing it now.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.400]   Here I am, jinxing.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.080]   But it's been stable thus far, which is great.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.880]   It's always wonderful to do that the site doesn't go down.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.040]   So that's exciting.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.880]   I'd like to warn them though.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.960]   Can I, so Joshua, how many, can you share any of the numbers as far as what you had from
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.400]   This Is My Next as far as users and page users?
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.680]   So last month of This Is My Next, we did three, about three million uniques and 10 million
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.200]   page views.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:59.840]   And already, I mean, we're, we're probably going to do far better than that with the
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.600]   verge as it has been right now.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.200]   One of the things I wondered about, did you, do you think that people followed you from
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.720]   Twitter and things like that?
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.720]   Was that how they found your stories on this?
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.640]   I mean, I think, I think at the start for sure.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.200]   I mean, we've only had Twitter to promote ourselves.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.000]   And in fact, I think that we're annoying to some people who follow a bunch of the people
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.280]   from the site because we all, as soon as we, there's a new link, a big story, we're all
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.280]   tweeting it.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.240]   But yeah, I think that, I mean, I would not, I cannot understate the importance of social
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.200]   in letting people know what we're doing and where we're doing.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.200]   Just like people.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.200]   There are Sundays doing.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.880]   I mean, you're really pushing this through the social even months before it comes out.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.800]   I mean, I'm going to change the way people get the ideas out there.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.000]   I certainly want to change the way books are sold.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.280]   And so working got a really great publisher trying to build on top of that and just make
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.280]   it.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.280]   Harper Collins was up for that.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.720]   They were, they're, I think they were excited because they have an author that actually knows
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.960]   Twitter and is excited about it.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.280]   They don't, but they, but they hope to learn from you, right?
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.280]   And I wrote the book in public using screen sharing a lot of weird stuff.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.280]   Right.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.280]   So we want to do the marketing the same way.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.280]   It's funny.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.840]   I wrote a book in 2004 that I had a spy cam on me the whole time.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.080]   And as I, as I was doing the countdown of pages, I'd actually have the countdown in the
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.320]   corner to 300 pages to go, 290 and all that stuff.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.720]   I just, I took a page out of your book.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.720]   I didn't do anything at all.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.720]   You know what's cool with the book about it?
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.720]   It's interesting though.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.720]   There was no Twitter then.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.600]   I was, I was, I think, but I think that this is really important.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.480]   If you look at, you know, the fact that they had three million uniques, Twitter is the
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.480]   new printing press, right?
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.600]   It's, it's, well, and that was something we were talking about because you've made the
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.200]   verge of great destination site, but I bet you, most people don't enter from the front page.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.720]   They click a link in Twitter and they mean there's a lot.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.760]   I think it's coming from a lot of different places and that was, we were talking about this
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.720]   before we started that we wanted to make each part something you could enter and experience
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.720]   that wasn't.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.960]   You didn't feel like you necessarily, you know, you could experience it and enjoy it without
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.600]   necessarily going to the rest of it, though I think there are lots of great hooks into
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.600]   the rest of the site.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.640]   But yeah, not everybody's going to the portal, the front pages and the portals.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.360]   So, and social has been huge for that.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.900]   I mean, what Nick is saying, there's just, I mean, it's incredible that we were able
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.840]   to leave a big, big site and to let people know what we were doing and where we were
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.960]   and what our plans were and our timelines and they, and they paid attention.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.600]   And I don't think you can get that kind of traction with people in any other way.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.320]   I mean, it's kind of, it's kind of amazing and we're all, we're not like, I think that
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.440]   we're kind of tame when it comes to social media.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.000]   I mean, we're not really shilling, right?
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.560]   We're just kind of trying to say, hey, we're here, we're doing this thing.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:31.520]   So, you know, we don't have a social media specialist who's, you know, running our social
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.520]   media guy.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.520]   But.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.520]   Right.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.520]   I mean, really?
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.520]   So I can't.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.440]   I mean, Ashton Kutcher, I mean, who is like, who is like leading edge?
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.800]   Who is cutting edge on this?
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.200]   Cutting edge on what respects social media to promote themselves and to make a who's
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.200]   not cutting edge on it.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.200]   I guess everybody's doing that.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.760]   I mean, is there anybody who is like Gary Vee, for instance, there's a guy who has
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.880]   been just like, is everywhere, right?
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.200]   I mean, he really is killing in social media Gary Vee.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:03.200]   And I think that we, I think we're less everywhere than I was a Gary Vee's Facebook
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.360]   page and I somehow happened upon it.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.360]   If I'm, you know what?
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.360]   It's exhausting.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.360]   He's tired.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.520]   He needs to take a break.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.520]   That's why.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.520]   I'm just an app.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.520]   Well, he hasn't, let's see.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.520]   He's tired.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.520]   I'm telling you.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.080]   He doesn't have a, he doesn't have a, he's not using it a lot.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.080]   He's exhausted.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.080]   He's also running a company.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.080]   He's got a pipe in his Twitter.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.080]   That's the way to do it.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.080]   Just keep your Twitter.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.240]   That same pattern of kind of sideways entrance is something we started noticing on the onion
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.800]   web traffic a few years ago as the homepage decline.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.800]   They don't go to the front page.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.560]   Yeah, because of the social influence.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.120]   So it started with RSS actually.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.120]   Right.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.920]   And then when Twitter went on, that joke was saying that everyone.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.960]   Now that Google readers did, maybe we can finally get back to front page.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.360]   I've been saying to everybody that everything is viral now.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.120]   You know, everything, and really isn't, and that's not just like a catchphrase, I think
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.080]   that everything becomes a little bit viral.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.320]   And the way people are finding things is that in a very viral fashion, which is, hey, your
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.560]   friend is showing you something or you're seeing it on Twitter.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:59.080]   And it's, there is, I mean, the portal is definitely on the decline.
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.480]   I think there's a certain number of users that want to go into that front page and see
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.480]   everything.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.920]   But I do think that the concept of the portal is changing and declining.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.080]   Can I ask him one more, one more question?
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.080]   Please.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.440]   Which is, this is much better than any of the news stories you've got this week.
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:17.640]   In terms of your, you know, business model, do you find that your advertisers want that
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.240]   homepage more and like, how do you battle that interest?
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.320]   Just like the big TV advertisers are way behind everybody else.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.440]   So they do, they do that.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.440]   They do want that.
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.640]   Also, I mean, when we were going to advertisers and the sales side is something that I'm not
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.640]   that involved in.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:38.480]   But one of the things, one of the things we could do is to say, look, we have, and we
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.960]   did this and we sold a bunch of this stuff.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.440]   We said, we've got the homepage, but we have the reviews page.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.440]   We have the product page.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.440]   We have an Android page.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.720]   We have an Apple page.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.560]   So if you're, if you're Motorola and you want to advertise to your, you know, we've got
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.560]   an Android forum.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.080]   So you've got an Android forum, Android product.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.080]   You've got a cell phone product page that's, you know, Android related.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.240]   You've got Android hub page, which is just Android news.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.240]   So there are all these places.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.920]   So we actually sold it saying you don't have to just buy the homepage.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:07.040]   There are other, you know, really significant important portals that you can buy.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.200]   So we have mini portals and the big portal.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.560]   And they, and they did buy and we had great, our launch sponsors are incredible.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.640]   BMW, Sony and Samsung are the first set of launch sponsors.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.000]   So people were really, you know, they wanted in.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.400]   They actually were intrigued by that.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.400]   Which is the name of the sponsors for me again?
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.400]   Well, pre-med.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.400]   BMW.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:28.040]   I'm actually just, you know, my, my co-founder, Marty Mo, has, he's the guy who's usually
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.040]   big up in the salespeople.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.080]   And now I have like, it's part of my, when I'm talking about the site, it pops.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.080]   It's good.
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.080]   No, I can't.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.080]   I was surprised.
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.880]   I was surprised for months, not months.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.920]   Years has been on the forefront of this kind of viral advertising.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.480]   Yeah, no, they made the, the transporter was the hard driving thing.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.480]   Yeah, they do.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.520]   And then remember they had a little weird mystery bug on the Apple page that when you
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.880]   clicked it, it was a mystery ad campaign.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:52.960]   And that was years ago.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.400]   They have a lot of money.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.400]   They have a lot of money.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.400]   All right.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.400]   So we only have an hour left.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.400]   We'll move on before we do.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.600]   We're going to take a break, but they don't wait longer.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.240]   I want to talk about this is going to be the week that the tablets come out.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:07.640]   This is going to be the week the Barnes and Noble Nook gets announced this week.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.120]   And I think the fire comes out in two weeks comes out on the 15th.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.120]   Barnes and Noble Nook comes out the day after.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.360]   Let's talk about tablets because that's going to be a big story.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.040]   We have lots to talk about.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:22.320]   None of it is interesting as just sitting around drinking and talking about social media.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.320]   But I guess-
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.400]   When are we going to start doing drugs on the show?
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.400]   Well, actually, we stopped.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.400]   The marathon thing does.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.400]   The water does say-
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:34.160]   Just say that these are Gateway drug.
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.320]   He does say that he was raised during the crack years of the 1980s in Washington.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.320]   I survived.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.320]   I was a survivor.
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.320]   It was a tough era.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.080]   Was that when Marion Berry was the mayor?
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.240]   It was from the top down.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.800]   The whole system was pretty erupting.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.120]   Did you smoke crack out of your toes, Barreton?
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.920]   I did not smoke crack out of anything.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:52.920]   Good man.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:53.920]   Good man.
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.920]   That's why he's here today.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.160]   He's unable to sit up all by himself.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.600]   Which is responsible for my success.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.360]   Did you know Chelsea Clinton when you were at Sidwell from-
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.360]   She knew me.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.360]   She knew you.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.360]   I like that.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.000]   I like how you heard that around.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   She knew you.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.600]   I was two years older than Chelsea.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.080]   Now is she hot in real life?
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.080]   Okay.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.080]   We're moving on.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.080]   She's much whiskey.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.080]   Not enough content.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.840]   By the way, thank you for bringing rye this time.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.520]   Instead of bullet bourbon, I've had bullet bourbon.
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.440]   Molly Wood brought me bullet bourbon and I love it.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.440]   When to mix it up for you.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.440]   What is rye?
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.440]   Rye is awesome.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.240]   It's just another kind of whiskey made out of it.
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.240]   It's a kind of age.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.440]   Is it made out of rye bread?
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.120]   It's soaked in an oak cask.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.520]   There's a rules about the proof that it is.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.520]   It's cool.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.520]   It's cool comes down to the cask.
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.520]   It's not really necessary.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.520]   It's all about the cask.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.000]   And how long would also the age of them and the proof that they end up at?
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   I thought rye was like-
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.160]   I thought rye was for like drunks.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.160]   Any alcohol is for me.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.160]   That's why I was wondering if you could ask.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.160]   I don't think that's that just scribb it in.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.520]   I'm a drunk but I'll only have rye.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.520]   I know.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.520]   I just thought rye was like that.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.520]   I don't know.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:13:00.240]   It's a bad idea but I had this impression that rye was for like winos but that's wrong.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.240]   You know why it's that song?
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.560]   Rye risky, rye whiskey, rye whiskey.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.080]   If I don't have rye whiskey, I surely will die.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.080]   I've never heard that.
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.080]   You've never heard that?
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.080]   But now I'm worried about you.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.080]   No, I am too.
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.080]   Hi, my name is Leo.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.080]   You've never heard that.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.080]   I've heard that.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.080]   I've heard that all the time with the meetings.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.040]   In fact, we sing it at the end of every meeting.
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.520]   Let me talk a little bit about go to meetings, speaking of meetings.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:23.000]   And we'll be back with more with Baratunde, Nick and Joshua.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.440]   Sounds like a folk group.
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.440]   I like that.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.640]   I like it too.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.640]   The Brooklyn trio.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:29.640]   They're joining us.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.640]   They can Joshua with to a tree.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.640]   They're in the night playing drums.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.680]   Oh, now they'll never return.
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.360]   No, they'll never return.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.200]   See, go to meeting is this great product from Citrix.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.600]   Oh, rye no seeds.
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.280]   Let's you, let's you meet online, right?
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.240]   So the idea is you put go to meeting on your computer and you send out an email with a
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.200]   link and then people can join you.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.320]   They can see your desktop.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.840]   But now thanks to HD faces, they can see you.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.120]   So it's got video conferencing.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.800]   It's got screen sharing and get ready for this.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:02.680]   Now people attending your meetings can meet with you on any computer, of course, Mac
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.920]   or Windows on an iPad.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:05.920]   We've had that for a while.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.680]   And now on iPhones and Android phones too.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.680]   Oh, wow.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:15.440]   So this means we're going to have more and more meetings in bars, subways, men's rooms.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.440]   It's going to be amazing.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.320]   It's going to transform meetings.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.040]   And they actually, I'm being a little facetious, but it is true that nowadays it's hard to get
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.480]   everybody, get the troops together.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.920]   Everybody's moving around.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.480]   You have offices everywhere, people all over the world that you work with, whether you're
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:34.840]   collaborating, selling, training, status meetings, any kind of meeting.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:39.680]   This is a great solution and $49 a month for as many meetings as you want as long as
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:40.680]   you want.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:41.680]   It's a great deal.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.680]   But don't pay anything right now.

[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.040]   No, no.
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.040]   If you hate meetings, you'll love going.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.040]   Everybody hates meetings.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.720]   And nobody would use this if you had to love meetings.

[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:09.840]   So we're going to see the Nook tomorrow, the color Nook.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.840]   The color tablet.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.040]   Oh, they don't call it a Nook tablet.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.560]   They're pushing the word tablet.
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.560]   Tablet.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.000]   The new one is going to be called, I think they're going to get rid of color, they're
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.160]   going to call it Nook tablet.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.080]   I think we saw some leaked stuff.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.120]   It's the Nook.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.840]   It's a little faster, it's got a little more memory.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.840]   It's the Nook.
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.840]   Well, they're going to really push more multimedia content videos, music.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.680]   It's 50 bucks more than the Kindle Fire that is correct.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.680]   Yeah.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.680]   Non-starters.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.680]   So we've heard.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.680]   Non-starter, if that's the case, right?
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.680]   No one cares about the specs.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.680]   Why would you?
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.320]   Well, Barnes & Noble does have some cool features.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.080]   So one of them, for example, is--
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:49.120]   which I mean, maybe it doesn't make sense for a lot of people, but if you have a Barnes
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.520]   & Noble Nook product and you go into a Barnes & Noble, and you sit there, you literally
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.720]   have access to every single book that appears on the Nook.
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.520]   When you leave, it's as if you're there.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.520]   So you could read in the--
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.520]   That's kind of cool.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.520]   You could read it.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:01.520]   You could read it in the fake store.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.520]   You could read it in the fake store.
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.520]   You could read it in the fake store.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:04.520]   You could read it in the fake store.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.520]   You could read it in the fake store.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.520]   You could read it in the fake store.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.520]   You could read it in the fake store.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.520]   You could read it in the fake store.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:12.760]   They don't have the brick and mortar.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.760]   But look what Amazon did in response.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.760]   The Kindle Owner's Lending Library.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.760]   You get a free book a month.
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.000]   Yeah, Nick and I were talking about this on the drive up, and I think there is something
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.520]   novel and weird about imposing the physical lending scarcity metaphor to a--
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.680]   But it's not really lending because you have as long as you want to read it.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.680]   Well, this is a difference.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.240]   Yeah, in the Barnes & Noble version, you don't.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.480]   You have to return it after seven to ten days or--
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.480]   You want--
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.480]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.480]   That's the lending piece.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.480]   That's not the--
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.480]   That's the library piece.
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.480]   Yes.
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.480]   Yes, the library.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.480]   That's a separate thing.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:47.120]   I'm not even going to deal with actual thousands of libraries where you can loan books out from
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.360]   the library and you have to return them sevens of fours.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.360]   This basically--
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.360]   It's like that digital copy is physically removed.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.360]   Well, wait.
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.920]   Do I have to go to a library to do this?
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:54.920]   No.
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:55.920]   For this new thing that we're talking about?
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:56.920]   No.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:57.920]   They've got about five thousand--
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.800]   There's a limited number of copies, right?
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.520]   Well, yeah, but which is just ridiculous.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.520]   It's like--
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.520]   Yeah.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:04.520]   We're applying these physical metaphors to these digital products.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.520]   Okay.
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.520]   So--
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:07.520]   That's the most right now.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.520]   That's the problem.
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.520]   I have a Kindle.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:10.520]   I have a Prime membership.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.520]   You have to be Prime.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.520]   Yes.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.520]   Adding value to me.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.520]   Now, I-- there's five thousand titles.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.520]   Yes.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.000]   And so I can-- and so I do have a Kindle.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.840]   So I could just say I want to read the portable SAT.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.800]   And-- but there's a limited number of people that can do this?
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:22.800]   No, no, no.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.800]   Not with this one.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.240]   The limit is on how many you can have as a subscriber.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.400]   Because borrow this book for free with no due dates if you're a Kindle.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.400]   Okay.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.400]   You can do one a month, right?
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.400]   One month free trial.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.400]   You borrow this book.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.760]   As frequently as a book a month and there's no due date.
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.840]   So every month I get a new book.
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:41.840]   That's right.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.600]   Well, that's-- that's given away a book a month.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.600]   That's pretty good.
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.600]   What's wrong with that?
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.600]   Well, for Prime members.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.600]   No, where-- where-- where-- what my problem is with these other lending services, some
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.600]   of which Amazon has, where they--
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.600]   I don't like the library.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.600]   The library.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.080]   Exactly why they say you can only have the book for seven to ten.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.080]   Yeah, it's like-- but there's no limit.
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.080]   Exactly.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.080]   This is a digital edition.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.080]   What are you talking about?
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.080]   It's ridiculous.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.080]   But that's the publishers doing that.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.080]   That's the publishers doing that.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.080]   Right.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.080]   And they're doing it on this new Amazon lending library is that they don't have the six major
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.640]   publishers signed up yet.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.400]   So their catalog is pretty limited.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.400]   They're trying to prove--
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.400]   So it's a bunch of crap.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.400]   Basically.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.400]   So the publishers-- yes.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.400]   Because they're afraid they're going to lose back catalog sales and, you know, kind
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.400]   of archive titles.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.160]   Well, they do have some good stuff on there.
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.800]   I mean, they have, you know, 100 of the top New York Times best sellers.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.800]   But it's a very limited--
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:24.800]   It's 5,000 titles.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.800]   What it reminds me a lot of is Netflix streaming, Amazon streaming.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.800]   And this is the problem is that you can be innovative and come up with these new, interesting
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.400]   things, but the content creators are terrified.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.440]   Well, the business models are not nearly as innovative and the legal models are even
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.440]   less innovative.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.440]   Right.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.440]   So there's a lot of--
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.000]   There's a lot of-- there's a lot of cruft in the-- there's a lot of cruft in the system,
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   right?
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.040]   The way that we think about content and who owns it and who can use it and where it goes.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.840]   And they haven't figured it out.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:51.840]   So they're doing crazy things.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:56.200]   Like, you're getting a digital copy, but it's a representative copy of a physical copy.
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.600]   And you have to give it back because somebody else needs it.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.760]   So the other thing that's really-- it's just ridiculous.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.400]   And then you apply these metaphors to-- I mean, they managed to pull it off with media, but
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.400]   what have you bought a digital camera?
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.720]   And then they said, you can't see the photos for three months.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.720]   What?
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.720]   Why would they do that?
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.720]   I don't understand.
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.720]   But that would make sense to Kodak.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.720]   Right.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:20.040]   But if you think about where we are still coming from with the cable box world, some of those
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.520]   limits are not that unreasonable.
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.480]   I mean, in terms of historically being present, you can imagine that future, especially where
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:30.160]   it reminded me of Zitrain's book, The Future of the Internet and How to Stop It, something
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.160]   like that.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:35.400]   And it's worrying about the control that content makers have along with copyright holders and
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.800]   legislatures to tell your Tivo what it can and can't do and switch things on.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:43.320]   So here's the argument that Steve Jobs made that was actually a compelling argument that
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.280]   busted the monopoly of the music industry.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.320]   He said, guys, they're robbing you blind.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.600]   The only reason the music industry was willing to do a deal with iTunes is because they didn't
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.040]   want to sell 99 cent songs.
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.680]   They wanted to sell bundled albums.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.160]   Steve said, look, they're going to steal them.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.400]   They're going to download them.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.640]   Isn't that argument just as compelling for the movie industry, the TV industry and the
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.640]   publishing industry?
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.640]   Books.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.640]   Always streaming books constantly.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.640]   I just go to the book.
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:11.200]   So, and the designers should just say, look, guys, you should be happy to do this.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:16.120]   We're keeping people in the commerce and we're keeping them off Pirate Bay.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:21.800]   They really should be actively and aggressively looking at ways to make content completely
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.600]   accessible for money because people will buy it.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:29.000]   It's a proven fact that if you give somebody an option to easily go and buy it, I mean,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.800]   I would pay tons of money to get the content I want without having to jump through hoops
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.800]   or to get some elaborate setup in my living room or, you know, I mean, it's really is
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:42.160]   it is incredibly aggravating right now that they haven't that the other content industries
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.320]   have not figured out what to mean.
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.000]   I mean, in the music industry was hurt.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.760]   I mean, make no mistake about it.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:52.200]   Labels aren't the same as they were before, but I'm sure I assure you there are more people
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.520]   making money off of music now than ever before.
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.520]   Absolutely.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.520]   Because they level the playing field, which is awesome.
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:01.440]   I mean, you look at what this is also if you look at the grand scheme of fragmentation
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.800]   and decentralization of authority, which is what this is all really about at the big
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:06.800]   pressure, right?
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.200]   Whether it's movies or politics or banking, you're having, you know, central authorities
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.240]   are kind of losing their power to the edge again.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.240]   And so in that sense, you have a choice of what do you keep begging at the door of the
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.360]   mainstream old school broadcaster, the centralized authority.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.360]   Right.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.360]   If you just go build your own thing.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.360]   And so Amazon is also doing this.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.360]   I think that's what we did here, by the way.
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:28.240]   No, I've got a new, I've coined a new term for this as microcasting.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.160]   And I think it's the future in many ways of broadcasting.
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:35.480]   Broadcasting was you get as many people as you want watching sign, as you can rather,
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.480]   watching Seinfeld.
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.160]   It lowers common denominator.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.360]   You have to pay, you know, pander to people.
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:45.560]   So you get millions of people hence no key for the middle and you shoot for the lower
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:46.560]   middle.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:47.560]   The broad middle.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:51.320]   Or you do what we do, which is I'm not trying to get abroad on it.
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:55.200]   I'm trying to get a very dedicated, engaged, narrow audience.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.200]   Microcasting.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.200]   So I, this is, this is, you turn to the porn chapter, my book before.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.200]   I did write to the porn chapter was about, that's the wrong book, Leo.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.960]   No porn in, how do you get it?
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.160]   There's no porn in the porn.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.560]   No, but one of the things, one of the things I lost a lot of sales.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.560]   There will be.
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:10.560]   It's not time yet.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.560]   Is there a strat of neutral?
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:12.560]   Bottom, I think.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.560]   I'm going to put it in the chapter.
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.560]   So, one of the things, the reason I wrote about the porn industry in the book was because
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:21.640]   they, although we, you know, we, they've been at the forefront of every technology.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.920]   And one of the things that they realized was that they could, you know, if people are
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:29.600]   into, you know, three foot tall women that like wear glasses and have striped stocking.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:30.600]   There's a site for everyone.
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.600]   There's a site for that that people will.
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.600]   Can you give me that URL?
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.600]   We were interviewed.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.600]   That was a great topic.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:38.440]   Eric Ries of the Lean Startup this week on our triangulation show.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.440]   Really interesting.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.440]   He's great.
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.960]   And he said, you know, you've got to care about making something of value.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.600]   Otherwise, if you just want to make money, do porn.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.960]   If it's all about money, it all comes down to porn.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.560]   If it's about something else.
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:55.440]   Well, if it's all, if it's about a niche market, it comes down to money.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:59.240]   You know, that is the, well, I don't, you know, if I wanted to make more money, I would
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.480]   make it a broader show.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:05.200]   I mean, the one limitation of microcasting is we're not talking hundreds of millions
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.360]   of dollars.
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.280]   We're talking a smaller amount of money.
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.480]   But you writing your business for the show?
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.480]   No.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.480]   Nobody.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.240]   I mean, you're business, Leo, your business works, right?
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.240]   You're making money.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.000]   You're paying staff, right?
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   And we have 20 employees.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.520]   You built this new studio.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:24.120]   I mean, I think the thing is you look at the model, the old model, the old model is very
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.120]   little gets through.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.360]   It's all controlled by one place.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.360]   That's right.
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.440]   You have to go to one place to get it.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.520]   And so the, you don't really have, there is no choice, right?
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:35.720]   The choice is you have ABC, CBS or NBC or whatever.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.880]   The new model is, and this is something that I was thinking about the whole time we were
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.680]   building this new site, which is I looked at the landscape of other websites and other
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.680]   news sites.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:47.120]   And so how many there are, you really start to think about how many sites are there that
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:51.240]   do similar things or the same thing, and they have their following and they have their
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.760]   business and it's profitable.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:53.760]   They're making money.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.280]   They're paying their employees.
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:00.560]   And it's kind of stunning to see all of these businesses, you know, news in particular,
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:06.000]   covering similar beats and they're able to sustain businesses and they're small companies
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.840]   and their audiences for all of them.
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:08.840]   That's very positive.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.000]   When you say this, it's democratizing.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.200]   It's taking this out of the hands of the oligarchs, the people who have all that capital, the,
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:21.520]   you know, the Andrew Carnegie's of the world and letting every individual have a voice.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.200]   It's very, to me, it's so positive and uplifting.
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.720]   It certainly has a high level of potential, you know, and it.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.360]   Well, and frankly, the economy is tanking.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:38.680]   We need to do, we need to get back to an economy that is distributed, that is decentralized.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.680]   Clearly.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.680]   We're doing it.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.720]   But thanks to technology, it's going to happen anyway.
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:44.720]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:48.520]   And the other part is that when you don't have a brick and mortar business where you
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:54.880]   have the expenses of that, you have much lower overheads and you can expand and experiment
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:55.880]   and so on.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.560]   You know, if Joshua were starting the Verge as a print publication, there would have been
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.960]   a lot more money that would have been put behind it.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:07.040]   Well, that's why the web, that's why software businesses, this is a huge innovative time
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.040]   for that.
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.040]   Correct.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.040]   It costs almost nothing.
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.320]   Well, maybe not for the Verge.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.640]   I'm sure that was a fairly expensive.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.640]   It costs the relative.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.920]   Well, it costs money, but the money is there.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:17.920]   The printing press money.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.000]   It's not printing press money and there's not printing, right, and not printing press
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.760]   time and you can move quickly.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:26.040]   So if something wasn't working, we can change it immediately.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.920]   We can change the thing that's not working immediately with a printing press and with
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.720]   a magazine or a newspaper.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:31.720]   It moves much slower.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:37.440]   You know, and that is, it is kind of incredible to have that agility to be able to pivot or
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.480]   to move when you need to.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:42.920]   And that's something that you can do in technology that you can't do almost anywhere else.
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.280]   When you start to bring machinery into it, it's impossible.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.280]   Let's be a pivoting.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:50.480]   Well, I'm not going to pivot yet, but I shouldn't be drinking this rye.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:55.880]   I was said so honestly, that's the most honest thing you've ever said on the ship.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:56.880]   Things are going to get really dark on this.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.600]   This is going to start confessing things.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.400]   I had something there.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.840]   I was going to go with it, but I've forgotten that.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.840]   We will pivot.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:05.840]   Let's pivot.
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.040]   You've made me pivot, Nick.
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.040]   Okay.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:12.280]   I want to talk about something, speaking of the equivalent of...
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.280]   Wait a minute.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.280]   I just remember.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.280]   Oh.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.280]   But against this...
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:20.480]   I want to circle around to how we started this, which is these devices, the Kindle and
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.480]   the Nook.
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.560]   Aren't these in fact those centralizing devices?
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.360]   How important are these to this democratizing infrastructure?
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.360]   Yes and no.
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.200]   And the reason that...
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.200]   The reason no is...
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.200]   The reason yes right now they are app...
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.960]   It comes to raise power in the hands of Barnes and Noble and of Amazon.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.960]   And Apple, too.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.960]   And Apple.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:41.920]   And they're eventually going to get to a point where those apps are primarily web apps.
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:46.080]   In the same respect that the desktop, 10 years ago, everything was an app on the desktop
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.960]   and now they're all apps in the cloud or Photoshop.
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.960]   Or Photoshop and things like that.
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.960]   It's still a hybrid.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:51.960]   I think they're a hybrid.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.520]   I mean, in your DC on an iPad, you can have the Kindle app and the Nook app and the Kobo
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.160]   app and those are all the cloud stores.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.160]   Exactly.
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.160]   And you can read them anywhere.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.160]   And your place is saved.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.160]   It's kind of fascinating.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:06.560]   But the other thing is, if you look at the cost of these devices, the fact that they're
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.560]   cheaper than the computers.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.560]   Yeah, they're cheaper than computers.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:13.920]   But the fact that the color Amazon devices coming out next week is 250 bucks.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.480]   So if you look at the cost of a...
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:20.040]   I've said this before, but if you look at the cost of a 10 megabyte hard drive in 1984,
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.040]   it was like $4,000.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.040]   Right.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:26.480]   You literally cannot get one for 0.01 cents right now because it's just so cheap.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:31.280]   So this $200 Nook or whatever it is that coming out next week in five, 10 years is going to
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.760]   cost 0.01 cents.
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:38.560]   As long as you don't continue the pathological route that Apple is engaged in of closing
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.160]   it off and owning it and saying it's ours...
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.400]   But they're not going to be able to.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.400]   They can't.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:48.080]   Because the perfect example is what Amazon did with the web version of the bookstore
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.080]   where they have a web version...
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.080]   Right.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.080]   They broke that monopoly.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.080]   But it eventually will be.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.080]   Yeah.
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.080]   They broke that monopoly.
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.080]   As long as you have to say I'm encouraged.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:00.080]   I think that now that after I've read this Steve Jobs book and I've spent some time thinking
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.040]   about this, he was pathological.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:05.440]   He was pathologically paranoid, secretive.
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.600]   He wanted total control.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.680]   He changed the screws on the 4S because he found out people were able to open the iPhone
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.680]   4.
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.960]   So he said, "Well, we can't use standard screws because I don't want anybody opening my stuff."
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:15.960]   He was pathological.
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.520]   And here's to the crazy one.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.320]   Here's to the literally out of his...
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:23.280]   I mean, you know, I mean, but to do that kind of thing, I mean, you have to be a little
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.280]   bit crazy.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.280]   I mean, to do what he's done.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.200]   Already though, and I think it's very interesting, Tim Cook is kind of changing things.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:32.920]   For instance, Steve said, "We will never have a charity program at Apple where we match
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:33.920]   funds."
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:37.560]   Tim Cook has already said, "We're going to match up to $10,000 for employee donations."
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:38.560]   And let's be realistic.
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.240]   You know, Bart's under and I were on the drive up.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.520]   We were talking about the profit margins of the iPhone, right?
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:49.360]   So they own 4% of the smartphone market when 50% of the profit.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.360]   50% of the profit.
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.520]   You know who did that?
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.520]   Who?
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.520]   Tim Cook.
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.520]   Not Steve Jobs.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.520]   Tim Cook was the genius.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:57.520]   He's a manager.
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.480]   There's a telling story in this book about the antenna gate issue.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:06.760]   We finally learned this truth about antenna gate, which is that Jobs and I've wanted this
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.520]   metal band around the iPhone because it looked good.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.560]   The engineer said, "Guys, it's going to break the antenna.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.160]   You can't do that."
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.440]   And Jobs said, "Make it work."
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.440]   They didn't make it work.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.080]   Jobs stonewalled.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.080]   He denied it.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.080]   He said, "You're holding him wrong."
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.080]   He's the science denier.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.080]   He's the science denier.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:25.840]   He thought the reality is, "Dorition Field extended to physics."
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.200]   Apparently it didn't.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.280]   They eventually had to resolve this and I think they've redesigned it a little bit.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:34.120]   But the point being that you can only go so far in denying reality.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.920]   Well, he denied reality with his cancer.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.920]   I mean, he's the only thing of getting surgery from us.
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.720]   He probably ended up killing him prematurely.
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.080]   Unfortunately, sad to say.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.080]   Well, it's funny.
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:45.760]   Somebody said to me the other day, "I was at a conference in Ireland and somebody said,
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.760]   'You know, I want to be Steve Jobs when I'm older.'
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.880]   And I was like, 'Do you really want to be Steve Jobs?'
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:55.000]   I mean, the guy created amazing, amazing products, but at the same time struggled with
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   pretty much everything.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.520]   It was possible to be a great product guy without being pathological."
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:00.840]   I don't think so.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:04.320]   That's like asking, "Is it possible to be a great businessman without being a jerk?"
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.000]   I have a good question too.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   I don't know the answer.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   It's a great combo.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.400]   But you know, Nick, does anybody who says, "I want to be Steve Jobs have a shot in hell
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.400]   and he's being a job?"
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.760]   I mean, I think if you stand there, then maybe being the first black Steve Jobs.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:21.040]   If you consciously think that you want to emulate Steve Jobs, there's no way you're going
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.040]   to do it.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:24.400]   I don't think Steve Jobs sat down and said, "I want to be X."
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.400]   I think he was like, "I'm going to be Steve Jobs."
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:31.360]   I think that's the only way you really become Steve Jobs is by not trying to do Steve Jobs.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:32.360]   I want to be Steve Jobs.
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.360]   That's good.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.080]   We're going to take a break when we come back to Thailand.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.920]   You've wanted to talk about it all show.
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:37.920]   Thailand.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:38.920]   Is that in your book?
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:39.920]   So I think that's your answer to this.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.920]   Thailand did not make it into my book.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:42.920]   Yeah, all.filing.
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:43.920]   I'm going to be talking about flooding.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:44.920]   Yeah.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:45.920]   So we're talking about flooding and how are you doing?
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:46.920]   Have you ever heard of that?
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.920]   You've ever heard of that?
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.560]   Also, well, and you have a good article, both of you.
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.840]   Yes, we have two separate angles on the article.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:52.840]   So that's exciting.
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:54.840]   You've come down and it's actually, I think, yes.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:55.840]   And?
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:56.840]   Quite anyway.
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:01.200]   And get ready because if you thought you had enough Steve Jobs, now there's a lost interview
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.200]   coming to a movie theater near you.
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.200]   Yes.
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.200]   Holy cow.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.200]   I want to see him on the big screen in VHS.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.920]   I was so disappointed with that PBS show where they said we have a 1994 interview, never
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:11.920]   before it aired.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:16.400]   It was two sentences which they repeated just to make sure it looked like there was more.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:20.440]   Before we do that, I do want to talk about Ford and amazing technology.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.440]   Talk about...
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.320]   Here's an example.
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:27.920]   Henry Ford was much like Jobs in the sense that he didn't ask his customers what they
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:28.920]   wanted.
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.920]   In fact, somebody said...
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.520]   He had a great quote about the horse.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.400]   If Henry Ford had asked customers what they wanted, they would have said, "Well, we want
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.400]   a faster horse."
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.400]   Yeah.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.400]   That's great.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.400]   It's exactly what...
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.880]   It's the same thing.
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.800]   You have to go where the puck is headed.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:49.160]   So it's kind of amazing to see a company like Ford that it really is, an old line industrial
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.960]   company, one of the great companies of the United States reinvent itself.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.640]   Something that very rarely happens in business these days.
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:58.840]   They truly have become a car company for the 21st century.
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.600]   Took no money from the bailout because they planned ahead.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:07.720]   Alan Malali, their amazing CEO, was an engineer, first and foremost.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.440]   Designed the 777 cockpit.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.440]   Was all about systems.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:14.880]   I think he's kind of putting the 777 cockpit in your Ford.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:15.880]   Pretty amazing what they're doing.
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:19.040]   If you want to see more Ford.com/technology.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.600]   More come to our barbecue next Sunday.
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.600]   It's next Sunday, right?
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.600]   You have an barbecue?
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:24.600]   You have an affordable barbecue.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.240]   You should have time on my trips.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.560]   Why didn't you have a barbecue today when we were here?
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.560]   Because we're here.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.960]   And I knew you need all the food.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:31.960]   Whiskey.
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:32.960]   You brought whiskey.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:33.960]   We have meat next week.
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.440]   Which goes great with whiskey.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.440]   Oh, damn.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:37.440]   What was I thinking?
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.440]   We'll be there next time.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.040]   Well, we have one December 4th, too.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.040]   You come back.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.040]   I'll look at that.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.040]   November 13th, December 4th.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:46.000]   If you want to go to our barbecue, go to twit.tv, click the barbecue link and sign up
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   because we will have a sellout.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   We're going to have a tent.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   We're getting a parade permit from the Petaluma police.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.320]   They're doing up for the vegetarian options.
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.320]   There will not be.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.320]   Come eat meat.
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.320]   Are you a vegetarian, Joshua?
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.320]   Oh.
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.320]   Yes, there will be.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.320]   There will be.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.320]   There's always--
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.320]   You took a barbecue or something.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.320]   Go to the menu.
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.320]   What is the great time for?
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:04.320]   No, no, no.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.320]   You know what?
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:08.800]   You're getting the best caterer and Petaluma to do this and I'm sure there will be a vegetarian.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.120]   Will there be some pork ribs and things like that?
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.120]   That as well.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.120]   It's a barbecue.
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.120]   Okay, good.
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.120]   I'm here.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.120]   There's something for everybody.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.120]   No, just be-- it'll be a vegetarian only barbecue.
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.120]   Absolutely.
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.120]   The 2012 Ford Fiesto.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.120]   The Fiesto.
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.120]   We'll show you this app link.
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.120]   This is amazing.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:25.640]   This is one of the things Malalie said is, look, our iterative process in designing cars
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:28.760]   can never be as fast as, let's say, Android or iPhones.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.680]   Those guys really can crank out iterations.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.680]   So here's what we're going to do.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.840]   We're going to make it so that there's an API for the Ford Sync.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.160]   You know, that's the thing where you press the button on the steering wheel and talk to
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.640]   your car that talks to your smartphone.
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.960]   And as smartphones add features, so will the car.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.960]   So already it's out now on the 2012 Fiesta.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.000]   It'll be on other new phones.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.160]   Ford vehicles, I'm going to get the electric focus.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.160]   I'm very excited about that.
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.160]   It'll be on the Apple car.
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.640]   So what happens is you're driving along, keep your hands on the wheel, right?
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:54.640]   And keep your eye on the road.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.640]   So it's safe.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.160]   You press the button, boom.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.320]   You can say, you know, cabin temperature 73.
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.280]   You could say, where's the nearest gas station?
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.560]   You could say, play a song.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:07.440]   But now you could say, launch Pandora on my smartphone, works with iPhones, Android
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.280]   phones, and the newest Blackberries.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:13.240]   Launch Pandora on my-- you could say, play my classic rock station, say, thumbs up, thumbs
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:14.240]   down.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.600]   You could say, bookmuck this song so I can buy it later.
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.960]   It'll work with Stitcher II so you could listen to this.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.720]   You could say, play a twit.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:21.720]   And it'll do that.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:22.720]   Play Twit 236.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:23.720]   I'll say, OK.
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:25.520]   It works with-- I think I'll even read you tweets.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.880]   They have this thing called OpenBeak.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:29.120]   It'll read you tweets, your timeline or your replies.
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.120]   OpenBeak is a pretty-- it's a pretty creative name.
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.120]   It's pretty creative.
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.120]   No, it's pretty creative.
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.120]   It's like open graphic.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:38.120]   Just like-- that should be the motto, the visual of your face right there.
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:39.120]   OpenBeak.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.120]   That's it.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.120]   That's the three-log of property.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.120]   First, I thought you were going to say launch.
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.120]   Anyway, open.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.120]   I don't know.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.120]   I don't know what it is.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.120]   More more apps are going to do this.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.800]   This is called App Link.
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.440]   And it's on newer vehicles with Ford Sync.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.760]   They have a thing for teenagers.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:54.280]   None of you use have kids.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.640]   If you had kids, I do.
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:56.640]   You would love this.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:57.640]   It's called--
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.640]   Shut them up.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:59.640]   Yes.
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:00.640]   It's called-- of course, sort of.
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:01.840]   It's called my-- it's called my key.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:05.240]   When the kids take the car, it tells the car, don't go faster than this.
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.240]   Oh.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.240]   Don't turn up.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.240]   You can teach the stereo.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.240]   No.
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.240]   You can keep the stereo from going too loud.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:14.920]   And most importantly, it says it's almost at a gas at 75 miles left instead of 50 miles
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:15.920]   left.
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.920]   But the teenagers never put gas in the tank truck.
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:18.920]   It doesn't really fit in the limit.
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:19.920]   Mine's like 20.
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.920]   No, no.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:22.680]   The standard Ford is 50.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.000]   By the way, just these little things.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.080]   When the light comes on and says, you have 50 miles left, the GPS starts showing gas
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.160]   stations all of a sudden.
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.800]   So I know where the nearest gas station is.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.400]   I can actually ask gas prices.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.320]   It'll show me the cheapest gas nearby.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.320]   Anyway.
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.320]   Best such thing is cheap gas.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.320]   Well, it's not cheap.
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.840]   This is my most important question.
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.720]   Does it actually limit the speed of the car when you're changing?
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:44.720]   That's so dangerous.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.720]   What if you're kids?
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:46.720]   What if you need to get it?
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.720]   Don't make it 30 miles an hour.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.720]   It has to run away from the cops.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:51.720]   It has to run away from the cops.
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.640]   What the devices and the power of the devices that are connected to a network with these
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.640]   controls.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:59.000]   It's got to be some kind of override for like I'm running for my life from the killer behind
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   me.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Right.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   What if you're getting rear end of the bike?
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   I don't know.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   You're getting crazy.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   You just drive.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.760]   It's set to place limits on speed up to speed to 80 miles an hour.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.520]   I think that's fast enough.
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.520]   I don't know.
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.520]   It keeps them from going 100.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.200]   So big brother is your dad.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:19.360]   I'd say when I was a success, I was doing 100 on the freeway and almost killed me and
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.360]   not several people.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.360]   You shouldn't be allowed.
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.960]   There should have been a button that said 80.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:23.960]   80 is plenty fat.
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.240]   Well, maybe they could do that.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.720]   Instead, it wouldn't slow you down.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.720]   Just say, stop.
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.720]   What are you thinking?
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.720]   It should be your dad's voice.
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:32.720]   You're driving too fast.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:33.720]   Or your dad's voice.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:34.720]   Or your dad's voice.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:35.720]   Or your dad's voice.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:36.720]   Was your mother Jewish?
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:37.720]   Slow down, there.
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:38.720]   It's a day.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:39.720]   It should always be a nana.
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:40.720]   It doesn't even matter what your lady is.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:41.720]   It's always a Jewish grandmother.
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:47.720]   I hope Alan Malawi is taking note of all these suggestions.
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:51.200]   I'm just saying, if your kid needs to get away from something, you've got to think about
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:52.200]   that.
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.200]   Alan, I agree.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:54.200]   I think this is a problem.
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.760]   You don't have to turn it on if there's a kind of a doubt.
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.080]   If you're worried about that, don't turn that part on.
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.800]   But make sure they don't listen to stereo too loud.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:01.800]   There you go.
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:02.800]   You can't.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:03.800]   There's no...
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:04.800]   Can you have an argument for louder stereo?
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.800]   I was a philosophy major.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:06.800]   I have an argument for everything.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.800]   You know what I'm...
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:08.800]   By the way, I...
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:09.800]   Okay, you can take down the forehead.
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:13.520]   It... itunes you.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.840]   Amazing.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:19.600]   I'm listening to a lecture from Philosophy at Yale on death.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:20.600]   Wow.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:21.880]   Like the philosophy of death.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:22.880]   It's fascinating.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.880]   That's really common.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:24.880]   I'm so depressed.
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:25.880]   I've been reading Steve Jobs' book.
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:26.880]   I'm listening to death.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.880]   It's been made off of me.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.880]   All right, let's go.
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.040]   And now there's floods in Thailand.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.040]   Let's talk about Thailand.
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.040]   Thailand is up.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.240]   No, we should actually really call it Thailand because it's a very serious...
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:36.240]   So let's go Nick.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.240]   So...
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.240]   Have you seen the pictures?
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.240]   I mean, it's devastating.
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:43.680]   Well, is this because they're not properly planning for these floods?
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.680]   Absolutely.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:45.680]   And they're over building the urban areas.
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:48.280]   Yeah, and they're over building the factories and everything.
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.280]   They're not planning.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.280]   There's no planning.
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.880]   You look at Bangkok and it's just scary.
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:52.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:55.960]   Well, one of the things that's happening is that there's been this flooding and as a
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:58.040]   result, thousands of factories have been shut down.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.040]   Mostly hard drives, right?
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.160]   Well, a lot of hard drives, but what...
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.640]   It's not necessarily just the hard drives.
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:06.200]   It's little springs and things like that from hard drives that are built around the world.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:10.360]   Parts that are being built in China cannot be put together.
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.280]   It's affecting tons of stuff.
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.280]   Yeah, I mean, there's people...
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.760]   Of course, people that are dying, there's people that don't have jobs, there's people
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:16.760]   that can't support their families.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.960]   There's all of these different things that are happening.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:19.960]   And there are mental deficits.
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:23.440]   And as Nick wrote, it's also about the cloud.
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:26.600]   So one of the things I didn't realize when I started reporting the story was I was looking
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:27.960]   at it from the consumer standpoint.
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:34.560]   So the next two quarters, they're going to be making about 30 to 35% less hard drives,
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:39.320]   which is about 50 million less per quarter, which is going to have huge effects on consumers,
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:40.320]   right?
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.760]   So you go to buy hard drives, your computer is going to be more expensive, so on and so
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:43.760]   forth.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.440]   We're already seeing price gouging.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.440]   Yes.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.440]   People are...
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:50.000]   Even though there's no shortage yet, people are already raising the price.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.880]   But the bigger problem is the massive drives for Oracle, Facebook, Google, Apple, all of
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:59.720]   these companies, the WoodaSire cloud computing.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:03.560]   So Apple, for example, which is now expanding iCloud and has Siri and all these things,
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.160]   is going to need to continue to expand its drives as a unique growth.
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.600]   So they use the same consumer hardware?
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:09.960]   No, they use different drives, but they're all made there.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:13.080]   And in China, where the other drives are made, they're at 98% capacity.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:16.440]   So there's literally nothing that anyone can do.
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.600]   And so there's two problems that are going to happen.
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:21.600]   One, they're not going to have enough drives to expand the internet.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:24.760]   But the other problem is that the drives that exist, they're going to have to take engineering
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:28.520]   resources, Facebook, for example, will have to do this, and figure out ways to get the
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:32.920]   most out of the drives that are there so they won't be innovating as quickly and as much.
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:36.800]   Well, though we heard this story before, I mean, in the tsunami in Japan, we were very
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.720]   worried there would be big shortages.
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:44.680]   I remember the ram factories burning down and everybody was concerned to be shortages.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:45.680]   There was price gouging.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.360]   But in the long run, there was some resiliency.
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.360]   You think there's no resiliency?
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:55.080]   Well, in the long run, but in the short term, you know, when things, you know, when you
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:59.680]   are decentralizing production like this, you know, there are obviously trade offs and a
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:03.240]   big one is sure you're not, it's not all in the same place, but it's not all in the
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.240]   same place.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.440]   So this is, this does have an impact.
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.440]   This will have an impact.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:07.440]   Nick is right.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:11.920]   I mean, this will have an impact in all, at all levels of in technology that are, you
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.080]   know, where these factories are coming into play.
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:20.320]   When you're changing the assumptions of a business model and a, an innovation model that
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:24.600]   took, you know, something that was scarce storage, right, and then made it plentiful
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:26.040]   when an abundance of storage changed.
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:29.440]   50 bucks for a two terabyte drive for crying out loud.
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.040]   So you look at the scaled up services that Nick is talking about.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:35.920]   That's built on how your Gmail storage just grows and grows and no thought of it.
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:40.960]   And what's the engineering behind that that has assumed zero cost storage effectively?
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:44.800]   Could there be an intended consequence that maybe they figure out ways to be more efficient
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:45.800]   as well?
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:46.800]   Right.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.800]   Yes, but it's, but they haven't been efficient.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.000]   I mean, I remember when I in the, in the late 90s, when I was working as a web startups
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.760]   and my, one of my jobs was to figure out how to make a webpage less than a hundred K and
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.680]   it was, it was taking photos and optimizing them and all of these different things are
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:58.680]   trying to make things.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:59.680]   No, that was a good thing.
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:03.680]   No, we've gotten really, we've gotten really lazy with being economical when it comes to
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:04.680]   data.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:05.680]   Where?
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.680]   No prices make you lazy in every part of the economy.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:07.680]   Right.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.680]   And also, you know, when about food, think about our use of oil, think about any sort of
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.680]   truth.
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.200]   It's like a five world economy, you know, the five world economy, right?
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:16.480]   I mean, we have, we're, we're treating things like they're just infinite, right?
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:20.000]   There's an infinite amount of hard drives that are going to be super cheap forever.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.880]   So we don't have to worry about, you know, optimizing our data.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.880]   And we really, that, that, you know, that speaks to the cellular problem too.
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:31.160]   I mean, we have this massive network congestion now, you see AT&T is off, you know, the service
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:32.760]   is awful a lot of the time.
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:36.280]   And the reason is because we are pushing far more bandwidth than we really have.
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:39.280]   I mean, we're pushing into far more bandwidth than we have.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:44.160]   I was in, when I was in Ireland, I left my phone on accidentally.
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:49.560]   And I barely checked my email and just even the background, things that were happening,
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:54.860]   like, you know, sites checking GPS and things like that was, was like megabytes and megabytes
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:55.860]   after like a day.
[00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:57.540]   So you can expense that, right?
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:58.780]   In the background all the time.
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:00.060]   Did you get a heavy guy or bill?
[00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:01.060]   Yeah.
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.700]   I had a phone call with AT&T and I said, look, come on guys.
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:04.700]   I'm Luke.
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:05.700]   I don't want to pay you $60,000.
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:08.140]   Have you ever heard of the New York Times?
[00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:09.140]   I can't do that.
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:11.300]   I know David Pokes, that works.
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:12.300]   Yeah, that works.
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.300]   And then they hang up on you.
[00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.700]   We're going to double these charges.
[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:21.660]   No, no, the, the, it's weird because our economy, we're assumed that our economy is,
[00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:23.860]   is one of abundance because we're in an information age.
[00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:24.860]   Yeah.
[00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:25.860]   We're not going to change the case.
[00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:26.860]   Not the case.
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:27.860]   The physical goods.
[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:28.860]   Natural resources.
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:29.860]   Eliminate.
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:33.340]   Elements on metals, water, petroleum products and, and manufactured goods that are susceptible
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:37.700]   to natural disasters, which are still events that we fall victim to, both on the human
[00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:38.700]   skin.
[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:41.260]   And this speaks to a larger issue with the way these things are produced.
[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:45.620]   I mean, we don't, there is no connection here between the, you know, and really anywhere
[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:49.740]   and, and develop countries where you, the things that you buy, there's a connection of
[00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:53.820]   understanding where those things come from and how they're made and what the cost is,
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:58.500]   what the, what the, what the human cost is, what the, what the, you know, monetary cost
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:42:59.500]   is.
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:04.060]   And I think that as we start to, as technology culture becomes regular culture, we're going
[00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:06.420]   to start to see things that we don't like to see.
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:08.460]   And I feel like we need to address them at some point.
[00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:11.900]   We're already starting to see them and start to address them a little bit, but on, you
[00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:14.220]   know, on mass, we're not really doing it.
[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:17.340]   And I think eventually we're going to have to take a look at how these factories are
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:20.820]   run, where they're run, why they're run the way that they're running, you know, start
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:21.820]   thinking.
[00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:24.820]   And really depressed, have you seen the slavery footprint project?
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:25.820]   No.
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:27.900]   How many slaves work for you?
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:31.420]   So there's, but by slaves, I mean, people who are essentially working for free or are
[00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:37.180]   in bondage and servitude some, some way, there are, they estimate 27 million of them
[00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:38.180]   in the United States.
[00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:42.860]   If you go to this website, which is slavery footprint.org and there's an iPhone app as
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:43.860]   well.
[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:44.980]   You can calculate it.
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:46.980]   It's a very depressing, very depressing.
[00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:49.980]   So it's an iPhone app, which is built on a product.
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:50.980]   It's precious metal.
[00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:51.980]   It's precious metal.
[00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:52.980]   Just owning an iPhone is not a destroy.
[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:53.980]   What is the game?
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:57.580]   You know, what's the name of the game that was banned from the, from the app store that
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:02.900]   was basically, it was a game where you played as the children who were mining the materials
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:04.460]   that were used to make Silicon.
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:08.700]   And the last thing, the last thing Apple wants you to know is that, of course.
[00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:11.940]   Well, I mean, this is something Joshua, I mean, this is something that I think that we kind
[00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:17.300]   of overlook as journalists too, is, you know, look, ooh, look at this shiny new iPhone 4S,
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:21.420]   but thinking about the things that went into this and the people and everything, it's
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:26.460]   something that Apple has managed to put behind this magical guard.
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:28.740]   So we don't know how the magic trick is put together.
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:30.740]   And really, it's not necessarily.
[00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:35.460]   Well, most companies have, I mean, everybody hits, you know, it's completely, you don't
[00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:36.460]   see it.
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:42.140]   And you know, we, I actually, I did a panel a few years ago and I moderated the panel and
[00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:43.620]   it was about recycling.
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:46.140]   And we were talking about, I was talking, there's a rep, I think, from Panasonic there
[00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:50.060]   and I was talking about the fact that new TVs come out every few months with just the
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:52.500]   most incremental minor changes.
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:56.700]   You know, and there's evolution of technology and innovation and then there's just, you're
[00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:58.940]   just pushing it out because you need a new product on the shelves.
[00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:02.700]   And I think that at some point in the near future, and look, I mean, this is our business,
[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:03.700]   we report on this stuff.
[00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:07.980]   So it's kind of, you know, there's a give and a take for me to talk about and to talk
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:08.980]   about it.
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:10.660]   But the truth is, we're confronted with it all the time.
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:11.660]   This is a great example.
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:15.500]   And we see it more and more now as we get exposed to how this stuff is really made and
[00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:16.500]   who's making it.
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:21.260]   At some point, we're going to have to start to think about the global impact of this or
[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:22.460]   I think we're going to be in trouble.
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:23.460]   Well, we're not.
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:25.500]   I mean, it goes far beyond the cell phone.
[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.260]   It goes to look at auto.
[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:28.260]   Right?
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:29.260]   We just made cars, made car.
[00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:31.780]   We're just starting to slow that down a little bit.
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:35.740]   And this is where you reach the limits of our version of capitalism because real capitalism
[00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:37.860]   would take into account all the costs.
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:38.860]   Correct.
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:42.820]   And so that the market would assume all that information, absorb it and reflect it in the
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:43.820]   price.
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:44.820]   And the fact is we don't.
[00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:45.820]   Our oil is still cheap.
[00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:50.060]   Our light, our warmth is cheap relative to how much it actually costs to get this stuff
[00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:51.060]   done.
[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:56.340]   So this is just the major side effect of an industrialized society where things are relatively
[00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:57.340]   easy day to day.
[00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:58.340]   Yeah.
[00:45:58.340 --> 00:45:59.340]   Even something like a tornado.
[00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:00.340]   Yeah.
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:01.340]   Right.
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:02.340]   Even something like subsidizing a phone.
[00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:06.980]   I mean, if everybody had to pay $600 to the phone with the actual cost of the phone,
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:09.940]   first we would change our buying habit of case.
[00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:13.260]   I think it would change our buying habits a lot.
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:16.100]   And I'm not sure that that would not be a good thing.
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:18.780]   I mean, I'm fine with paying.
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:21.700]   Well, I mean, maybe I can say this because I'm in a different position than a lot of
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:22.700]   people.
[00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:26.740]   But I don't expect things that are nice and work well to be necessarily cheap.
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:27.740]   Right.
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:33.020]   I think that's a real illusion that this is what Ryan Lam quit Gizmodo essentially,
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:36.700]   you know, he said that he was pushing his book for tourism.
[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:38.660]   You need to buy another TV next week and another TV.
[00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:39.660]   No, I understand.
[00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:40.660]   I feel the same.
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:43.460]   I question that myself all the time.
[00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:48.220]   And you know, I wonder if somebody were risky enough to say, I'm going to make stuff in
[00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:49.220]   the United States.
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:52.420]   I'm going to charge what it's really costing to make this.
[00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:53.660]   If it's a last one.
[00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:58.940]   So that would people who are buying cheap Chinese gadgets all their lives, would they
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:46:59.940]   buy this stuff?
[00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:04.140]   Would they spend more to buy this kind of to support our economy?
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.780]   I mean, we shop at farmers markets sometimes, right?
[00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:07.780]   Some people say, right?
[00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:08.780]   I think we would.
[00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:11.460]   I see somebody thinking of the mocks that way, to be honest.
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:15.380]   And I agree that it is, you know, there is some element of that where you, you know,
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:17.540]   every day, are we pushing this stuff?
[00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:21.180]   But look, there is a community that's really interested and really wants it.
[00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:24.140]   But our habits will change and they already have changed.
[00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:25.940]   You know, our phone buying habits have changed.
[00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:29.300]   And now they're, they're accelerated, but that's going to change in the future too.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:31.980]   I mean, as we, you know, we'll reach a point where, you know, you're not buying a new
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:34.260]   computer every year, every two years.
[00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:36.860]   And I think that we'll start to see that with phones as well.
[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:38.620]   But at some point, you know,
[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:41.340]   I think the whole industry is moving towards six months.
[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:43.140]   I think there's the whole point.
[00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:44.140]   It's working.
[00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:45.140]   Yeah.
[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:46.140]   We're in it.
[00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:47.140]   We're in the midst of insane innovation.
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:48.620]   I don't think that that's going to continue.
[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:50.260]   It's going to get worse.
[00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:52.340]   Every indicator is going to get worse, not that.
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:53.780]   Oh, it's going is going to get worse.
[00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:57.420]   The only thing will stop it is an economic collapse, but we are headed straight towards
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:58.420]   that.
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:47:59.420]   What's the same?
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:02.780]   You think it'll stop six month phone is economic collapse.
[00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:03.780]   Absolutely.
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:04.780]   Yeah.
[00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:06.860]   No, I think that at some point we're going to start to level out.
[00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:09.380]   I mean, we're just at a point that things are spiking like that.
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:10.380]   There's no history of that.
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:11.380]   That's actually really funny.
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:12.380]   Big ginger.
[00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:14.180]   Victorian lawnmowers are still working.
[00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:15.180]   Exactly.
[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:16.180]   Which is true.
[00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:17.180]   Yeah.
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:19.380]   My first generation, I have a first generation iPod and iPhone.
[00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:21.700]   They wouldn't work if I had an engineering degree.
[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:25.020]   I mean, those things, they're designed to last and still cut things.
[00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:26.020]   Yeah.
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:30.060]   You know, it's one of the reasons that I always was resistant to covering gadgets and really
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:34.100]   always wanted to talk about promoting technology as a democratizer, as a tool, as something
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.500]   that you could continue to use to change the world.
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:41.820]   And it is something I think we always have to keep in mind is that this is not sustainable,
[00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:42.820]   it's kind of growth.
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:46.580]   And yet, I don't think it's going to slow down unless we're forced to slow it down.
[00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:48.100]   No, the system itself has to--
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:49.100]   The system will collapse.
[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:50.100]   Yeah.
[00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:53.220]   Well, I mean, you also have to find-- you have to make a decision about what's real innovation
[00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:55.420]   and what's phony innovation, right?
[00:48:55.420 --> 00:49:00.220]   I think that we have to start looking hard at what is-- I mean, you know, there's going
[00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:01.660]   to be a period where we don't look at it.
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:05.220]   At some point, you're going to have to say, is the droid razor any better than the droid
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:07.180]   bionic, which came out three months ago?
[00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:09.340]   And the truth is, they're almost the exact same phone.
[00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:12.700]   Well, I mean, I thought for us and iPhone 4, let's be realistic.
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:13.700]   Right.
[00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:17.820]   But I think it's-- I think at some point, there will be a leveling out of some of this.
[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:21.100]   And there's also going to be a reevaluation of what we accept as innovation.
[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:25.700]   I mean, right now, there's a race going-- there's a huge race for who's going to control this
[00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:27.260]   mobile space, right?
[00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:29.380]   And I don't think it's been completely decided yet.
[00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:30.740]   And at some point, it's going to level out.
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:31.740]   It's going to get decided.
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:32.740]   I mean, it's like PCs.
[00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:34.740]   At some point, I don't know.
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:36.500]   Do you remember the-- remember the Amiga?
[00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:38.860]   Well, it's absolutely going to get decided.
[00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:39.860]   Not only-- you want to go back--
[00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:42.260]   They've made two winners or three winners, though, not five winners.
[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:43.260]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:44.260]   Correct.
[00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:45.260]   Yeah.
[00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:46.260]   And if you want to go back even further, go back to the typewriter.
[00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:49.420]   When the typewriter first came out, there were 30 different styles of keyboards.
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:50.420]   Right.
[00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:52.140]   In the end, we have Quirty, even though it is not--
[00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:53.140]   It's horrible.
[00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:54.140]   It's horrible, completely.
[00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:57.100]   But there were literally 30 different types of keyboards on the market.
[00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:58.980]   And there was all these different races and so on.
[00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:03.460]   If innovation continues on the web and in software where it uses resources, but fewer
[00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:07.300]   resources, is that where innovation will head in an economic meltdown?
[00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:12.260]   Well, I think we were-- we reward things in a system based on the cost we acknowledge.
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:15.540]   Once-- if you look at this hard drive store, which is where this started in Thailand, we
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:17.180]   will reward efficiency again.
[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:18.180]   Right.
[00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:19.580]   Because the cost will demand it.
[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:20.580]   Well, I have to.
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:21.580]   So society, why?
[00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:22.580]   You look at the cars that are selling now.
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:25.500]   I mean, look at the price of rental cars over the past decade.
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:29.740]   SUVs are ridiculously cheap because no one wants them.
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:30.740]   No, but it wants them because you can't afford them.
[00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:32.260]   The Prius is hard to rent.
[00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:36.220]   The little smart car is hard to rent because the consumer mindset is shifted because the
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:37.820]   cost is more acknowledged.
[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:38.820]   There are those who say, yes, you can--
[00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:46.060]   That's a great example of this kind of blindness of the industries and of the consumer to something
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:48.660]   that is so obviously unnecessary.
[00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:49.660]   Right.
[00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:54.020]   And now we're seeing the backlash to that, which is in the leveling out of people-- the
[00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:55.020]   desire for an SUV.
[00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:59.260]   I mean, but I love what you said, Nick, though, that we are setting ourselves up for failure
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:03.060]   because we are designing things that are obsolete in a year or two or three.
[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:04.060]   Absolutely.
[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:06.180]   Well, we're going to-- I mean, here's a fun exercise.
[00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:08.180]   Like, what would our grandchildren say?
[00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:09.180]   It'll be WTF.
[00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:10.180]   Yeah.
[00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:11.180]   But what were they thinking?
[00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:12.180]   What were they thinking?
[00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:13.180]   Yes.
[00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:14.180]   You thought you could just burn things?
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:15.180]   Yeah, if they're here.
[00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:16.180]   You have two iPhones.
[00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:17.180]   And four years.
[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:19.180]   If they're here, Joshua, you're darn Bob.
[00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:21.180]   I was saying, you know, things are--
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:22.180]   There's two aspects.
[00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:23.980]   You know, we have a book.
[00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:25.860]   God, that says, "I live in the future."
[00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:26.860]   And we're still here.
[00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:27.860]   Let's ask the guy.
[00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:29.620]   He's from the future, Nick built.
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:30.620]   Thank you.
[00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:33.020]   I took my time machine in this morning.
[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:34.020]   Use it for this.
[00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:35.020]   I hate the time machine.
[00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:37.020]   He actually looks-- I can go anywhere.
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:38.820]   Can I just say he looks like he belongs in the '50s?
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:39.820]   He kind of looks like a hipster.
[00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:40.820]   I'm sorry.
[00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:42.820]   I was told-- Bart's when they told me to wear the hat.
[00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:43.820]   I did tell him where they're going.
[00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:44.820]   I wasn't going to wear it.
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:46.980]   Are you really from the band R-E-M?
[00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:48.220]   I wish I was from the band R-E-M.
[00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:49.220]   Wow.
[00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:50.220]   Are you really Michael's side?
[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:51.220]   Come on, admit it.
[00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:53.620]   Oh, he's killing in the studio, guys at home.
[00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:54.620]   Killing me.
[00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:55.620]   Oh, what is hipster mean?
[00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:56.620]   You tell me.
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:57.620]   So here's the other side of this.
[00:51:57.620 --> 00:51:59.220]   I don't talk about that later.
[00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:02.700]   Moving on from how beautiful I look.
[00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:03.540]   That's a hipster.
[00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:09.020]   A young coach for wearing the hat for those who are visiting.
[00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:11.180]   I don't see a man of mine age when I wear this.
[00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:12.180]   I look like an old fart.
[00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:13.180]   I don't look like an idiot.
[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:15.700]   You look like Laurel from Laurel and Hardy.
[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:16.900]   You should do a little bit.
[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:17.900]   But are you going to stop?
[00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:20.580]   Like, there's some stop motion going on right now.
[00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:21.580]   12 frames or something.
[00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:22.980]   So we were saying.
[00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:28.940]   So the other aspect of this that I discovered when I was reporting is that when the cost
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:33.460]   of hard drives go up, these computer makers will go along to other countries and other
[00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:35.900]   creators of other parts like DRAM and graphics chips.
[00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:40.980]   They'll say, you have to give us this at a lower price because we need to maintain the
[00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:43.100]   cost to keep the final goods down.
[00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:46.100]   So now every single country feels the effects.
[00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:47.100]   Yeah, it's a ripple effect.
[00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:51.100]   So if the workers then get lower wages and they get less hours and they're fantastic.
[00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:55.900]   That's the real problem is that this kind of poverty and globalization, a slavery is
[00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:57.300]   invisible to us.
[00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:00.100]   Those are costs that we just will not see.
[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:03.140]   All we want to do is have like on our Facebook page.
[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:06.100]   We found a way to move it out of our view.
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:07.100]   That's the thing.
[00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.820]   We can move it away.
[00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:13.260]   Move it out of our view and say Americans don't want to do these jobs that are really
[00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:14.260]   hard long hours.
[00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:16.860]   I think we've crossed my nuggets.
[00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.780]   Siri was down for three days.
[00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:19.780]   Really?
[00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:20.780]   We just were three days.
[00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:21.780]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have to pause.
[00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:24.140]   Are we just pause that that's where we're going to pause?
[00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:25.860]   My nuggets.
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:26.860]   I have to go.
[00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:29.060]   Can you explain what nuggets are talking about?
[00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:30.060]   What nuggets are talking about?
[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:31.060]   And how are we frosting them?
[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:32.060]   Where is this Kellogg's Frost?
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:33.580]   It's like a sugary frost?
[00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:34.580]   Yes.
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:35.580]   It's a freezer frost.
[00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:36.580]   Yes.
[00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:37.580]   It's a chill.
[00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:39.780]   It's a chilling effect on your nuggets.
[00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:40.780]   Shrinkage.
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:44.820]   I think we found the name of today's show.
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:46.180]   That's why I turned to the porn.
[00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:47.180]   My nuggets on rye.
[00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:48.180]   Really?
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:50.140]   I've gone all over here.
[00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:51.140]   Really?
[00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:55.300]   We've gone from the depths of deep philosophical discussion.
[00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:57.580]   Sorry, the heights of deep philosophical discussion.
[00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:59.420]   We've talked about porn.
[00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:00.860]   No, to the depths of nuggets.
[00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:01.860]   Yes.
[00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:02.860]   At Leo's nuggets.
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:04.700]   We've gone porn globalization nuggets.
[00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:05.700]   What's next, Leo?
[00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:07.540]   Let's let Leo segue because he's got a ton of cash.
[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:09.700]   There's no story to go for our efforts.
[00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:10.700]   The rye talking?
[00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:12.020]   This is the rye talking.
[00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:15.260]   I think we're going to take a break and then come back and then regroup.
[00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:16.660]   So you've got to frost your nuggets?
[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:21.260]   I can warm up my nuggets with a little commercial from a company I call Audible.com.
[00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:22.260]   Yes.
[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:23.740]   We love Audible.com.
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:29.020]   I listened to the entire Steve Jobs book driving in my car and at the gym.
[00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:34.260]   I am now about to do Reem D, which is the Neil Stevenson book, American Gods from Neil
[00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:35.260]   Gaming.
[00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.740]   And I hope that I know there's an audio book of this.
[00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:38.740]   I live in the future.
[00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:39.740]   It's actually very good.
[00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:40.740]   It's supposed to be very good.
[00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:41.740]   That's how I forget.
[00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:43.780]   He was really good.
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:49.940]   So you can get the paperback or you can go to Audible.com and find out how the future
[00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:52.300]   works from Nick Bilton in an audio version.
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:53.300]   In audio version.
[00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:54.300]   In fact, this, you know what?
[00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:55.300]   I'm sorry.
[00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:56.300]   Do you read that, Nick?
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:57.300]   Is that your name?
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:58.300]   You want to hear Mike read it a little bit?
[00:54:58.300 --> 00:54:59.300]   Just a little bit.
[00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:00.300]   I was in Mike Bilton in the Reddit.
[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:01.300]   Do you know Mike Bilton?
[00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:02.300]   I spoke to him on the phone.
[00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:03.300]   Did he call you up and say, "How do you pronounce this thing all but?"
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:04.300]   He did.
[00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:05.300]   He said, "How do you say iPhone?"
[00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:06.300]   Yeah.
[00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:07.300]   He said, "Bill."
[00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:08.300]   How do you say, "Thailand?"
[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:15.660]   Did they pick somebody that sounds like you?
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:16.660]   Do they do that?
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:17.660]   It seems like they do.
[00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:18.660]   I don't know.
[00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:19.660]   I don't know.
[00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:20.660]   Maybe it's the top of the reading that I was in.
[00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:21.660]   And his articles are there.
[00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:22.660]   And his articles are there.
[00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:24.660]   Sports is in the back of the business section on most weekdays.
[00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:25.660]   Well, Nick's got more.
[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:26.900]   But that's the problem.
[00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:27.900]   More manly.
[00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:30.540]   It's only a collection of what editors think is appropriate.
[00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:33.740]   Anyway, it's a great way to listen to books.
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:34.740]   Get them read.
[00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:36.420]   I am a huge Audible fan.
[00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:38.260]   I'm going to get you two books here.
[00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:41.660]   So the real challenges, there are 100,000 books at Audible.com.
[00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:42.660]   That's the new number now.
[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:43.660]   Wow.
[00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:44.660]   100,000 books.
[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:45.660]   You know why?
[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:46.660]   Because publishers realize people like audiobooks.
[00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:48.660]   Nobody has time to read anymore.
[00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:52.980]   And nowadays, when a book like the Jobs book comes out day and date of the release, they
[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:53.980]   have the audio.
[00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:54.980]   I hope you're going to do it.
[00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:55.980]   Oh, dude.
[00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:56.980]   Dude, I've got some amazing news.
[00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:58.500]   I just booked my voice over dates.
[00:55:58.500 --> 00:55:59.500]   You're going to do it?
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:00.500]   Of course.
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:01.500]   You have to do reading my own books.
[00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:02.500]   Oh, you have to do it a great way.
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:03.500]   So it should be.
[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:04.500]   It's a personal book.
[00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:07.020]   So January, when this comes out, we'll be able to listen to Barret Tunde.
[00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:08.020]   Yeah, you can.
[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:09.020]   You can do it a year voice.
[00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:11.820]   And the thing is, you're a performer, you're an entertainer, you have a beautifully cultured
[00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:12.820]   voice.
[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:13.820]   Well, I thank you.
[00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:15.300]   You could get Morgan Freeman to read it, but it wouldn't be the same.
[00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:16.300]   No, no, it wouldn't Leo.
[00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:17.300]   No, it wouldn't be the same.
[00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:18.300]   No, it wouldn't be the same.
[00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:19.300]   I would have to be Morgan Freeman.
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:20.300]   Morgan Freeman.
[00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:21.300]   I barretune it.
[00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:24.100]   So when are you going to read it?
[00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:25.300]   How long did they tell you how long it takes?
[00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:26.300]   I got three days booked.
[00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:27.300]   Three days.
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:30.500]   There's a little cushion built into that, and I'm doing it in, or...
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:31.500]   It's 250 pages.
[00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:32.500]   It's 250 pages.
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:33.500]   Wait, November or mid December?
[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:34.500]   I have to.
[00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:35.500]   It's in the Google Calendar.
[00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:38.500]   It's in the future.
[00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:40.500]   Nick, I will be going there after this.
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:46.500]   Nick, I'm going there after this event, back to the future to help you with it.
[00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:49.260]   But I've done some readings at shows just to test it out.
[00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:50.260]   Oh, I think it's great.
[00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:54.820]   It's just so much fun to read your own book, and I think people who had read some chapters
[00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:57.380]   online that I'd shared, they're like, "Oh, it's totally different when you read it."
[00:56:57.380 --> 00:56:58.380]   That's not how I heard it.
[00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:00.380]   That's why I'm putting the emphasis where I think I'm all.
[00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:02.540]   I think I'm loving audiobooks because you really...
[00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:03.540]   It's a performance.
[00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:04.540]   Yeah, no, it's definitely a show.
[00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:05.540]   You participate in it.
[00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:06.540]   It's a show.
[00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:08.220]   They're like the idea of you reading your own book.
[00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:09.220]   That's great.
[00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:11.420]   David Cross, it's awesome.
[00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:12.420]   And I really like it.
[00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:13.420]   It is his voice.
[00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:14.420]   It's a fan feeling.
[00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:15.420]   It's a fan feeling.
[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:16.420]   It's a fan feeling.
[00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:17.420]   On the reader.
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:20.260]   Okay, so like, for instance, David Sedaris, he should read his own books because he has
[00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:21.260]   such a unique voice.
[00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:22.260]   Yes, the delivery card.
[00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:25.060]   And the voice comes through in the writing, and it's much, much better.
[00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:26.460]   Sarah Vowel, same thing.
[00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:27.460]   Weird voice.
[00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:28.460]   Got to go with the book.
[00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:29.860]   Wait, should I have read my own book?
[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:30.860]   No.
[00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:31.860]   Yes, yes.
[00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:32.860]   You made it here.
[00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:33.860]   Wow.
[00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:34.860]   Ring.
[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:37.420]   Should I have Siri read my next series?
[00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:38.420]   Siri might be better.
[00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:39.420]   She's available.
[00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:42.940]   She'll say is, "I'm unable to connect to the network."
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:43.940]   To the fore.
[00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:44.940]   Yeah, Siri.
[00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:45.940]   Mmm.
[00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:47.540]   Tina Fey read her own book, "Bossie Pants."
[00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:48.540]   And she should.
[00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:49.540]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:50.980]   Al Franken's book was read by Tina Fey.
[00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:52.580]   That shows you how good that was.
[00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:53.580]   Anyway, audible.com.
[00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:54.580]   Here's your problem.
[00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:56.460]   You've got to figure out what two books to get.
[00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:57.900]   The first ones are free, though.
[00:57:57.900 --> 00:57:59.060]   So if you go to audible.com...
[00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:00.820]   I don't think they have to figure out what two books to get.
[00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:04.700]   You have to figure out what one book to get in addition to my book.
[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:05.700]   Perfectly said.
[00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:08.420]   I know you're getting Nick's book.
[00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:10.620]   The question is, what's that other book?
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:13.740]   So I live in the future and hear how it works by Nick Bilton.
[00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:15.180]   Hi, I am Ring.
[00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:16.180]   By Nick Bilton.
[00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:17.900]   That's your first book.
[00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:18.900]   Pick another book.
[00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:20.060]   Steve Jobs' book could be good.
[00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:21.060]   You know what?
[00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:22.380]   That was a good job.
[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:23.860]   I was depressed at the end of it.
[00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:26.740]   It's like, I'm so sad, but was worth listening to.
[00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:28.620]   Oh, it was excellent book.
[00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:29.620]   It's well done.
[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:31.940]   There are a lot to take right around his death.
[00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:33.860]   I mean, you don't normally say?
[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:34.860]   That's a good point.
[00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:38.180]   And immediately you read the biography that you've never read before.
[00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:39.660]   It just never possible to read.
[00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:43.220]   Because it came out right after he died, it was kind of more sad than it might have
[00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:44.220]   been otherwise.
[00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:45.220]   I think that's true.
[00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:50.460]   Oh, James Dickery Dickey's Deliverance has never been out in unabridged form on audiobook.
[00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:51.460]   It is now.
[00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:52.460]   That would be a good one.
[00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:53.460]   Deliverance?
[00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:55.060]   You got a pretty mouth.
[00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:56.060]   Almost lack of woman.
[00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:57.060]   It's so creepy.
[00:58:57.060 --> 00:58:58.060]   Wow.
[00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:00.060]   There's definitely something wrong with you.
[00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:01.060]   I want you to know.
[00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:02.660]   Not a normal person.
[00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:04.060]   I am not a normal person.
[00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:05.060]   I am me.
[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:06.780]   And that's who I want to be.
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:07.780]   Will Patton reads this?
[00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:09.060]   Oh, he's going to be like, oh, we got a list.
[00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:10.060]   They're a little deliberate.
[00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:13.060]   He's enrolled slowly forced to show its colors.
[00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:16.940]   Oh, this is curling and snapping back whenever one of us turns loose.
[00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:17.940]   Squealack of pig.
[00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:22.860]   The whole land was very tense until we put our four steins on its corners and laid the
[00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:23.860]   river out to run for us.
[00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:24.860]   Yes, it's a clarky cartoon.
[00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:25.860]   See, or hear that performance.
[00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:26.860]   That's a performance.
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:27.860]   Yeah.
[00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:28.860]   Is that a song that you've ever heard of?
[00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:29.860]   Yeah.
[00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:30.860]   I love Neil Stevenson.
[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:32.860]   I'm a big new, a cryptanomicon.
[00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:34.580]   One of my favorite books of all time.
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:35.580]   I love that.
[00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:37.580]   I loved the last one.
[00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:38.820]   You read the trilogy?
[00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:40.180]   Did you read the trilogy?
[00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:41.180]   I tried.
[00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:42.180]   Quicksilver.
[00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:43.180]   Had a hard time.
[00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:44.180]   You should read it.
[00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:45.180]   You got to get through the first book into the second.
[00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:46.180]   That's amazing.
[00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:47.180]   Yeah.
[00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:48.180]   Because it's really about the history of science.
[00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:49.180]   That's what's kind of interesting about it.
[00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:50.180]   He's brilliant.
[00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:51.180]   And the economy.
[00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:52.180]   It's about the history of our modern economy.
[00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:53.180]   It's fascinating.
[00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:55.020]   It's hard to read, but it's worth it.
[00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:56.140]   Well, they have it on Audible.
[00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:57.140]   So maybe that's the way I'll do it.
[00:59:57.140 --> 00:59:58.780]   It's like 18 volumes.
[00:59:58.780 --> 00:59:59.780]   All right.
[00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:00.780]   A bottle of rye and...
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:01.780]   3,000 pages.
[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:02.780]   Yeah.
[01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:04.220]   That's a great night.
[01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:06.220]   Audible.com/twit2-2books.
[01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:08.220]   Two books.
[01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:09.220]   That's the platinum account.
[01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:10.220]   There's a subscription.
[01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:11.900]   Two books a month, but the first month's free.
[01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:14.140]   You can cancel it anytime those books are yours to keep forever.
[01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:16.100]   How much for the subscription?
[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:17.100]   I don't know.
[01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:18.100]   That's the one I have.
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:19.100]   It's 15 bucks, 20 bucks.
[01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:20.100]   I don't know what it is.
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:21.100]   It's worth it.
[01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:22.100]   It is really worth it.
[01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:23.700]   But it's free for the first month.
[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:24.700]   I use it.
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:25.700]   I use it too.
[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:26.700]   Two books a month?
[01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:28.940]   I actually started using it after being on the show.
[01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:29.940]   And do you like it?
[01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:30.940]   I love it.
[01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:31.940]   Are you saying advertising works?
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:35.620]   And you don't have a big commute, but there's always time in the gym or where you walk into
[01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:36.620]   the bar.
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:37.620]   I'm at the bar a lot.
[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:38.620]   Yeah.
[01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:39.620]   On the way to the bar.
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:40.620]   I can mute to the bar.
[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:42.700]   I can mute to the bar at the bar.
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:45.700]   The staggering commute home where I don't remember the last chapped writer.
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:48.420]   That's a new ad campaign for Audible.
[01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:50.260]   I got to say, this is why I love Forest Park.
[01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:52.900]   Because I know exactly where Nick is at all times.
[01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:53.900]   It's a bit of a...
[01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:54.900]   Give it up Audible y'all.
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:55.900]   This is good stuff.
[01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:56.900]   Thank you very much.
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:57.900]   Flash tweet too.
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:00:58.900]   For their support.
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:00.340]   I just coded the ad with you.
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:01.340]   That's how much I love Audible.
[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:02.340]   You are good.
[01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:03.340]   I'm a junkie.
[01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:04.740]   Apple TV going to happen.
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:05.740]   What do you think, Joshua?
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:07.900]   You're on top of this stuff.
[01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:11.940]   Well, Gene Munster has been saying it's going to happen for 10 years straight.
[01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:13.900]   He's an analyst in case you're wondering.
[01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:14.900]   I know.
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.900]   He's been willing this into existence by...
[01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:17.900]   Just 16.
[01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:20.620]   Did you guys see my Apple television series story?
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:21.620]   No.
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:22.620]   I think...
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:23.620]   Oh, I did.
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:24.620]   That's right.
[01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:28.660]   When Steve Jobs says in the book, "I've licked it," you said, "This is how he's licked it."
[01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:30.300]   Yeah, he wasn't talking about making television.
[01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:32.380]   They've known that since 2007.
[01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:36.300]   The whole concept that Apple TV was a hobby is complete nonsense.
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:37.300]   They knew what they were doing.
[01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:39.660]   Apple says not have hobbies.
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:40.820]   We don't like this.
[01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:41.820]   We hate it.
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:42.820]   And then...
[01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:43.820]   We don't care about this.
[01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:44.820]   We don't care about it.
[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:45.820]   They do it.
[01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:46.820]   And then they do it.
[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:47.820]   They did it with every single pop.
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:48.820]   They don't have video on their handheld device.
[01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:49.820]   No one wants so much.
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:50.820]   No one wants so much.
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:52.620]   They don't want to read anymore of the iPad and Apple.
[01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:53.620]   The one he...
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:54.620]   He struggled with.
[01:01:54.620 --> 01:02:00.060]   And I know this from speaking to people at and with the company is that what they struggled
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:01.660]   with was they didn't...
[01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:05.420]   They wanted to create an interface that was simple.
[01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:10.700]   The remote control is the biggest piece of garbage that exists in technology today.
[01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:13.700]   And you could tell that it would just drive Steve crazy.
[01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:14.700]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:15.700]   Yeah.
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:16.700]   Just the way he is.
[01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:17.700]   He was on the four-puss.
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:18.700]   There's too many funs.
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:20.340]   He wasn't in the hospital dying.
[01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:21.340]   He was dying.
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:24.020]   I think he had pneumonia.
[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:25.460]   He was really on death's door.
[01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:31.540]   And he's redesigning the finger cuff that measures his blood...
[01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:32.540]   His heartbeat.
[01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:33.540]   Correct.
[01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:34.540]   He says it's poorly designed.
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:37.180]   And he's talking to the doctor saying, "This is a piece of crap.
[01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:38.500]   It could be so much better.
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.780]   This guy lived for this stuff."
[01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:42.580]   So Nick, you wrote a couple of days ago.
[01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:44.180]   What's really next for Apple and television?
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:45.820]   And it isn't a television set.
[01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:47.460]   Well, it is a television set.
[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:48.460]   It is a television set.
[01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:49.460]   Absolutely.
[01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:50.460]   Oh, it is.
[01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:51.460]   It is a lot of when.
[01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:53.420]   Part of the thing is waiting for the margins to come down.
[01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:54.420]   Crazy!
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:55.420]   Why is it crazy?
[01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:56.940]   You know how much a 32-inch television costs now?
[01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:57.940]   It's $250.
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:58.940]   Two years ago, it was $1000.
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:01.180]   So you don't think it's a 60-inch TV?
[01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:02.980]   I think it's going to be the same as we have.
[01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:05.300]   At first they will release just one television.
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:07.300]   Well, think about it.
[01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:08.540]   They made their displays.
[01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:11.700]   They had what is essentially an Apple TV and just a display.
[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:15.180]   I mean, they could do it in a way that seems somewhat economical.
[01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:16.720]   It's not going to be for everybody.
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:17.720]   Correct.
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:18.720]   It's going to be for a certain segment of the buyer.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:19.720]   It will be $1000.
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:23.140]   They corner 5%, just 5% of the market.
[01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:25.940]   It's $90 billion in revenue per quarter.
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:26.940]   Wow.
[01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:27.940]   That's not including per quarter.
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:32.060]   That's not including any kind of deals they make with television.
[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:35.140]   But the key you say is the voice recognition.
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:38.340]   I think the key is that it's the interface.
[01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:44.140]   When you can sit there and you can say, "Ciri put on the latest Big Bang Theory."
[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:46.140]   Or, "Ciri, find me that video."
[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:47.140]   I agree, that would be awesome.
[01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:48.140]   For the Republican debate.
[01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:49.140]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:50.840]   It's so hard to find some of these things.
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:51.840]   Well, I know.
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:54.640]   Or, "Ciri, find me that video of those cats that was everyone's been talking about this
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:55.640]   week on YouTube."
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:56.640]   And then it crashes.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.640]   Yeah.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:01.600]   Well, no, I mean, the use case is definitely one thing that needs to be considered.
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:04.040]   And I think that Nick is on to something.
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.840]   They have to simplify the interface.
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:06.840]   Right?
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:07.840]   Even Apple TV is miserable to use.
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:12.000]   I mean, anybody who has an Apple TV can attest to the fact that it is nightmarish to navigate
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   that thing.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.480]   And that's pretty good.
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:20.020]   So they have to crack making it better to use, but they also have to crack partnerships and
[01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:22.420]   they have to crack how you get the content.
[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:23.700]   Like, where's the content coming from?
[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:24.700]   Right?
[01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:29.540]   And I actually wrote something up on the Washington Post about this that they may, you know, an
[01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:31.020]   app model might make sense.
[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:34.720]   John Gruber was talking about this and I tend to agree with them that an app model
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:37.060]   couldn't make a lot of sense for some of this stuff.
[01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:38.260]   Google may beat them to it.
[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:40.460]   They're going to add the market to Google TV.
[01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:41.460]   Yeah.
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:42.460]   They're not taking the weekend.
[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:43.460]   Yeah.
[01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:46.320]   And they're going to have a thing called a user interface that they know nothing about.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:47.320]   And a wallet that they don't have access to.
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:48.320]   Also the hardware.
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:49.480]   I mean, they're hardware is clunky.
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:51.360]   How do you get Google TV on your television?
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.360]   Do you know?
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.000]   Yes, I have a Google TV and I love it.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   Really?
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   You have a Logitech review.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.160]   So you get to pass through device.
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:02.440]   So you and I like this instead of having to take an extra HDMI port and switching on
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:06.280]   my TV to another port, it passes the cable box passes through it.
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:08.720]   So it's an overlay on top of my existing TV.
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:13.500]   Yeah, you're describing a setup where you have to connect some extra box through into
[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:17.460]   your television in addition to the rest of the stuff that you already have.
[01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:18.980]   Nobody wants to do that.
[01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:19.980]   Everybody hates that idea.
[01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:21.300]   I mean, it's a fact.
[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:22.900]   The less box is the better.
[01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:25.820]   So I want to actually point something out to you right now.
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:33.420]   If you go, if you have a lion, right on your computer, right?
[01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:37.300]   And if you let me just log out of my computer.
[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:41.960]   And if you look on the front of the screen, can you pull yours up?
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:42.960]   I will log out.
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:43.960]   You want me to log out?
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:44.960]   I don't know.
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:45.960]   Can you hear the line?
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:46.960]   Here, let me just hold this up.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:47.960]   Yeah.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:48.960]   Yeah.
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:49.960]   See, this I truly believe you see this little circle here?
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:50.960]   Yeah.
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:51.960]   So they changed that.
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:52.960]   They made it a circle.
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:53.960]   So what else?
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:54.960]   Why did they do that?
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:55.960]   It's a little circle, but Siri.
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:56.960]   Yeah, Siri.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:57.960]   Right?
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:58.960]   So are we turning into Siri?
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:05:59.960]   I understand.
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:03.440]   So eventually what's going to happen is my belief that eventually what's going to happen,
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:04.920]   this interface is simple.
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:07.100]   Can you buy an iPhone or an iPad or a computer?
[01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:08.100]   You know how to use it.
[01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:09.100]   There's no manual.
[01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:10.100]   You press, you will open it up and Siri will say, "Who are you?"
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:11.100]   And you'll say, "I'm Nick Bilton."
[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:13.620]   It'll say, "Oh, let me go and get all your stuff for you."
[01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:14.620]   Right.
[01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:15.620]   That's it.
[01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:16.620]   That's on the cloud now.
[01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:17.620]   Now, if you can.
[01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:20.180]   You know, Mike Yallgen wrote a very interesting article taking this to the next step on CultivMac.
[01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:21.180]   That was it.
[01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:22.180]   I hated that article.
[01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:23.180]   You hated it?
[01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:24.180]   First of all, can you read the opening line of that article, please?
[01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:27.260]   A few years ago, everything was peaceful in the Valley of Silicon.
[01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:28.260]   The relationships.
[01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:29.260]   Stop right there.
[01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:30.260]   Oh, that's all we have to talk about.
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:34.800]   Happy for sense, I admit it, but let me forget the writing and I like Mike a lot and he's
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:37.920]   a regular on the show, so I'm not going to slam his writing.
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:39.280]   But I think he's got a point.
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:43.920]   Remember that Jobs said he was going to wage thermonuclear war against Google.
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:45.680]   So what does that mean?
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:49.760]   It means removing all traces of Google from the iPhone, right?
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:50.760]   Yes.
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:51.760]   So no more Google search.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.360]   And how do you do that?
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:55.320]   Because you tell Siri to find it for you.
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:56.880]   Siri is the future of Apple.
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:57.880]   Siri replaces Google.
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:58.880]   Hands down.
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:06:59.880]   It replaces Google search.
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:04.580]   It doesn't, but Siri doesn't replace Google until it has actual search capability.
[01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:06.820]   Siri is just piggybacking on search capability.
[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:09.300]   Well, if you go to Bing, it could go to Bing.
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:12.380]   It could go to Bing if they want to partner with Microsoft instead of Google.
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:14.380]   But Apple bought the mapping software.
[01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:17.060]   C3, they have the ID map they need.
[01:07:17.060 --> 01:07:21.060]   But when it comes to search, real search, they need a source.
[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:23.700]   Wolfram Alpha is one of their sources.
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:26.180]   Okay, but what if, okay, so let me just pose this question.
[01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:30.800]   What if that source were an API within to every app that exists in the app store?
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:31.800]   And let them know.
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:33.300]   Well, I mean, because really, let's think of it.
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:34.300]   The search is changing.
[01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:38.260]   I think you're, I think you're in the old world of what search is, which is you state
[01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:41.620]   a search term and you find web pages that match that search term.
[01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:43.620]   But then the one theory is something very different.
[01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:44.620]   It's context sensitive.
[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:46.780]   You're not really searching for a web page.
[01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:47.780]   Go to Yelp.
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:48.780]   Exactly.
[01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:50.300]   But you're searching for content.
[01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.100]   You may be searching for a specific show.
[01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:53.100]   And nice, easy.
[01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:55.100]   And when you're trying to app, you do get some huge advantages.
[01:07:55.100 --> 01:08:01.220]   You get automatic loads and loads of content that you can incorporate into a search, right?
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:05.700]   But if you're searching on a broader, in a broader sense, like for news or for other
[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:08.220]   pieces of content, then it becomes a little bit tougher.
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:10.540]   Is it the valley of Silicon that you don't like?
[01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:11.540]   Is that what you don't like?
[01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:12.540]   Well, there were a couple of things.
[01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:17.700]   I mean, I think it was a very fantastic metaphor in terms of thermonuclear and taking Steve's
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:19.740]   words and kind of running with him.
[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:24.260]   And I do think there is an overall fallacy to the argument of this piece, which is he
[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:30.820]   assumes that the relationship that Google and Apple had would have looked exactly like
[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:34.980]   the Android relationship that Google has with its own apps on iOS.
[01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:37.460]   He's making a little, you know, we can look through his list of thermomuclear apps.
[01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:38.500]   Apple didn't have maps.
[01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:40.060]   They didn't have a lot of features.
[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:45.300]   Google offered those for free on the iPhone, but Apple is clearly moving actively and quickly
[01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:46.460]   to replace them all.
[01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:47.460]   That's true.
[01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:48.460]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:49.460]   That's clearly true.
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:53.980]   That's how much, you know, he talks about Google, you know, Yelp to replace Google places.
[01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:54.980]   Right.
[01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:56.940]   So Google places isn't the incumbent.
[01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:57.940]   Right.
[01:08:57.940 --> 01:08:59.860]   It's not like the market on local.
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:02.420]   But can I do it along that?
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:03.420]   Yeah.
[01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:08.620]   I am willing to bet that in three years, it is 2011, November 6, in two or two to three
[01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:11.460]   years, every single Apple device will be powered by Siri.
[01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:12.700]   That's what Mike is essentially saying.
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:14.700]   Why I think that's the best top will.
[01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:15.860]   The laptops will.
[01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:16.860]   The phones will.
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:17.860]   The television will.
[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:23.380]   And Siri becomes suddenly this kind of very intelligent because it is interacting with
[01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:24.380]   you.
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:29.100]   And it replaces the, it replaces that Google search box, which is the primary web interface
[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:30.100]   for so many people.
[01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:31.100]   It dissintermeates.
[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:32.100]   It dissintermeates.
[01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:33.620]   And so you don't go to Google anymore.
[01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:34.620]   The Siri gets to decide.
[01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:38.460]   What does that even just that you don't go to Google if you think, I mean, here's what
[01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:39.460]   I liked about the article.
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:45.180]   He talks about Wolfram Alpha as the result generator for your queries to Siri.
[01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:46.660]   You don't even have to know that.
[01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:49.900]   You don't know which is the world.
[01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:51.380]   Well, and that's the point, Josh.
[01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:54.980]   Yes, they don't have the search, but they don't, but they have an interface.
[01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:56.620]   They have the intermediary.
[01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:59.060]   It actually is not disintermediating.
[01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:00.060]   It's reintermediating.
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:04.580]   Well, but it's in one way there, but there still needs to be something at the end of
[01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:07.300]   the there needs to be content or an item.
[01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:08.300]   But who controls her?
[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:10.420]   But where does that come from?
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:14.380]   But I think you're right, Nick, that Siri is going to appear on all of Apple's devices.
[01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:19.980]   But I think the key phrase there is on all of Apple's devices and the internet and the
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:23.620]   world is a lot bigger than all of Apple's devices and Google knows that.
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:25.220]   But here's what Apple knows.
[01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:26.740]   And here's what we talked about earlier in the show.
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:28.380]   Let's go back to the 5%.
[01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:33.020]   Nick, you said all Apple news is 5% shared to generate 20 billion in revenue.
[01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:35.220]   And let's remember that operating margin conversation.
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:41.940]   We just had a few weeks ago where they have 4.0% of the smartphone market and 52% of that
[01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:44.700]   market's operating profit.
[01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:47.420]   So it's not just a question of market share.
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:50.380]   It's a question of revenue and more importantly profit share.
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:53.380]   They could dominate the business with only 5%.
[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:55.380]   And they're going to make a lot of money.
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:56.380]   Make no mistake.
[01:10:56.380 --> 01:10:57.380]   Well, it's about money.
[01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:58.380]   It's about money.
[01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:00.780]   It's about power in the business.
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:04.700]   And let me point out this that Google seems to be going down a very dangerous path.
[01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:07.500]   They're becoming more and more like Microsoft in the 90s.
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:10.340]   They're becoming more and more rapacious.
[01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:15.900]   And frankly, they may well get their heads chopped off by the Department of Justice,
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:17.300]   by the EU.
[01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:18.300]   It's getting more and more.
[01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:22.220]   And Google does not seem to have a unified strategy in all of this.
[01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:23.220]   I can completely.
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:24.820]   I don't think they've ever had a unified strategy.
[01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:25.820]   That's Google, right?
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:26.820]   They're beta tech.
[01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:27.820]   The business is in beta.
[01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:29.980]   I mean, I think that they're kind of just seems.
[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:33.820]   I don't think that Google has a lot of the new stuff they're doing is...
[01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:34.820]   He's a smart guy.
[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:36.820]   You're on the verge of saying...
[01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:37.820]   I think that's it, Josh.
[01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:38.820]   You're done for the day.
[01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:39.820]   We're all done for the day.
[01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:41.820]   I'm going to wrap this up because I have to go.
[01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:42.820]   I missed something.
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:47.180]   We know when you said that Google's business is in beta, we were saying that's very strong.
[01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:48.180]   No, it's really good.
[01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:49.180]   Maybe that's a little bit...
[01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:50.180]   Oh, it's true.
[01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:51.180]   But it is true.
[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:52.180]   When you watch what they do, they just killed a bunch of stuff that they bought a couple
[01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:53.340]   of years ago without any...
[01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:54.340]   They weren't sure why they bought it.
[01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:56.380]   They were like, "Well, maybe that'll be part of our business."
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:59.580]   And with Android, I think they started kind of going, "Well, maybe we could do smartphones."
[01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:02.460]   And I don't feel like their first couple of phones were awful.
[01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:06.140]   And I don't think they had a real idea of what they wanted to make, which is so different
[01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:07.700]   than what Apple did, right?
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:10.420]   Which is they had the exact idea of what they wanted to make.
[01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:12.220]   But I think that Google looks...
[01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:13.220]   I don't know if they look evil.
[01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:15.220]   I just think they look confused.
[01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:16.220]   They kind of don't...
[01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:17.220]   It's like these guys...
[01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:20.060]   I actually believe that they built this big business and all of a sudden they're kind
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:22.620]   of like, "Hey, turns out we have a monopoly on search.
[01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:24.100]   Whoops, that was an accident."
[01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:26.900]   I don't think they're like Microsoft in the sense that...
[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:30.660]   I don't think they're like Microsoft in the sense that there were some really crazy practices
[01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:35.660]   of Microsoft throughout the '90s that were just...
[01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:37.260]   You had to call into question.
[01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:38.780]   And they've changed that, I think.
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:44.500]   But Google doesn't seem as malicious to me as Microsoft was when Bill Gates was there.
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:45.500]   We shall see.
[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:48.340]   We're going to find out what's ahead in the week to come.
[01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:52.220]   Ladies and gentlemen, let's go to the newsroom where Tom Merritt has this...
[01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:53.220]   Hey, Tom.
[01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:54.220]   Hey, Tom.
[01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:55.220]   Thanks, Leo.

[01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:39.780]   of the emergency broadcast system.
[01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:41.420]   Be appropriately alarmed.
[01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:47.020]   Friday, November 11th, the Apple iPhone 4S launches in 15 more countries, Minecraft exits
[01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:50.380]   beta and Skyrim launches.

[01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:55.140]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:56.140]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:13:56.140 --> 01:14:01.180]   Tom Merritt, TNT, tech news today, every Monday through Friday, 2.30 p.m. Pacific 5.30, Eastern
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:04.420]   22.30 UTC on twit.tv.
[01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:10.180]   Congratulations, Tom, won the Best Technology Podcast Award, the People's Choice, or the
[01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:17.660]   Podcast Awards this week, beating such incredible podcasts as App Slappy, Podnuts, and We Nerd
[01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:18.660]   Hard.
[01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:19.660]   Are you serious?
[01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:20.660]   We Nerd Hard?
[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:21.660]   Do you think I'd make that up?
[01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:22.660]   Elon James White.
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:23.660]   App Slappy.
[01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:24.660]   No, I've heard We Nerd Hard, but App Slappy.
[01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:27.260]   Podnuts and We Nerd Hard.
[01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:29.260]   Was this the sex category for podcast?
[01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:31.700]   I just frost my nuggets.
[01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:35.340]   I want to thank Joshua Topolsky for being here.
[01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:36.340]   The Verge is awesome.
[01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:39.900]   I think we should do a little toast for Josh for launching the Verge.
[01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:40.900]   Well done.
[01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:41.900]   Well done.
[01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:42.900]   Nice job.
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:43.900]   I'll drink to that.
[01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:44.900]   Well done.
[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:50.020]   Really a great sight, and I think Engadget should be, Ariana should be shaking in her
[01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:52.380]   pratas right now because you've got it.
[01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:53.380]   In her what?
[01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:54.380]   Pratas.
[01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:55.380]   Oh, pratas.
[01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:58.500]   I thought you were talking about nuggets again, but it's frosted nuts.
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:01.500]   The book is not out yet, but I've got a copy.
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:02.500]   That's because I'm special.
[01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:04.460]   How to be Black, Baratunde Thurston.
[01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:05.460]   I'm so proud of you.
[01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:06.460]   That's exciting.
[01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:07.460]   That's so great.
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:09.860]   Baratunde, of course, writes for the onion.
[01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:11.380]   They're a web editor.
[01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:12.380]   What is your title?
[01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:13.380]   Director of Digital.
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:14.380]   That's what I said.
[01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:15.380]   Let's close.
[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:21.980]   Also, go to howtobeblack.me/join/twit to be part of the army promoting this fabulous
[01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:22.980]   book.
[01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:24.900]   Promoting, engaging, changing, expanding.
[01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:25.900]   I can tell you.
[01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:28.460]   I haven't had a whole lot of time to read it, but everything I've read, it's very good.
[01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:29.460]   I'm really exciting about it.
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:30.460]   Thanks, Leon.
[01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:31.460]   Yeah, it's really, really nice.
[01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:32.460]   Funny, but trenchant.
[01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:33.460]   Ooh.
[01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:34.460]   Yeah.
[01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:35.460]   Trenchant.
[01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:36.460]   A lead on the port.
[01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:37.460]   That's my blur.
[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:41.380]   And now in paperback, I live in the future, and here's how it works from Nick built in
[01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:44.660]   Nick writes for the New York Times Bids blog and as a reporter for the Times.
[01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:47.460]   And of course, you can also listen to the audiobook at audible.com.
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:48.460]   Thank you, Nick, for being here.
[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:49.740]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:50.740]   What fun.
[01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:51.740]   Thanks for the bullet rye.
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:52.740]   Of course, Leon.
[01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:53.740]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:58.420]   We do the show 3 p.m. Pacific Times, 6 p.m. Eastern, 2200 UTC at twit.tv.com.
[01:15:58.420 --> 01:15:59.420]   What's the matter?
[01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:00.420]   Thanks to the studio.
[01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:01.420]   What a great studio.
[01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:02.420]   Yes, thanks to this audience.
[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:04.980]   Thank you all over the world.
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:08.860]   They join us every week, even though we have no bathrooms, which is same.
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:10.900]   What happened here, bathrooms?
[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:11.900]   You don't know about that?
[01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:14.060]   The people at home, you could afford them.
[01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:16.220]   No, the pipe broke.
[01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:17.220]   Oh.
[01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:18.220]   Do you have bathrooms?
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:19.220]   Do they have anything to do with fun?
[01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:21.220]   Yeah, bathrooms, you can't go in there.
[01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:22.220]   Yeah, for us, mind them.
[01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:23.220]   They ended with the flooding.
[01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:24.220]   Sir.
[01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:25.220]   It was the flooding.
[01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:26.220]   The flooding.
[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:28.380]   Entirely and somehow broken our toilets.
[01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:29.380]   I don't know why.
[01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:30.700]   I shouldn't have even brought it.
[01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:33.500]   Yeah, we should thank the chat room audience, which has been always entertaining.
[01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:34.500]   Always great.
[01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:37.540]   Especially that who had the Victorian lawnmower comment?
[01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:38.900]   Yes, that was...
[01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:39.900]   Googie-woogie.
[01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:40.900]   G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G.
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:42.660]   Jeannie in a bottle.
[01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:44.620]   Nuke Jello, number nine.
[01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:45.620]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:46.620]   We'll see you next week.
[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:47.620]   Another twit.
[01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:49.940]   Oh, by the way, one of the reasons we're wrapping this so early, I have to get over to
[01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:50.940]   Vegas.
[01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:51.940]   Yeah, you do.
[01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:54.460]   I'm gonna be speaking at Pubcon on Tuesday, so if you're at Pubcon, come see me.
[01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:55.780]   Can I make a quick?
[01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:57.860]   Pye-leen Rivera would like to plug something.
[01:16:57.860 --> 01:16:58.860]   Go on in.
[01:16:58.860 --> 01:17:00.420]   Twit.tv/bestof.
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:04.220]   Please send us your best submissions for the year, your favorite moments, your favorite
[01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:06.420]   stories from any of our twit shows.
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:10.700]   There's a drop-down menu here on the site, so if you want to go to this, we can tack
[01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:14.340]   and nominate episode 326, the rye episode.
[01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:15.340]   Go for it.
[01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:17.860]   You can actually, you don't have to give us as much information as you know, but if you
[01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:20.220]   just kind of remember something dimly, it'll help us.
[01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:23.300]   We want to put together best-of episodes for New Year's Day.
[01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:27.780]   We are gonna have our traditional Twit Christmas with John Hodgman, Jonathan Colton, and
[01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:32.980]   Paul and Storm, and that'll be on Christmas Day this year on Sunday 25th of December.
[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:35.660]   Is that in the studio or is that...
[01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:39.820]   Usually they join us via Skype because there's usually large conceptions of Jaeger Meister
[01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:42.220]   and we just really don't want to clean up after them.
[01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:43.220]   Got it.
[01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:47.060]   So even if they were in town, we'd kind of ask them not to come in.
[01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:49.340]   This isn't really not fun.
[01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:50.340]   Thanks for being here.
[01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:51.340]   We'll see you next time.
[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:52.340]   Another Twit is in the can.
[01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:53.340]   This is amazing.
[01:17:53.340 --> 01:18:00.340]   And that A. Yes.
[01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:06.340]   I hear it as Joshua.
[01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:07.340]   Hi.
[01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:08.340]   How are you?
[01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:09.340]   Congratulations.
[01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:10.780]   What a great-looking sight.
[01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:12.140]   Oh, get out of here.
[01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:13.140]   I am sincere.
[01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:14.940]   I have a question.
[01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:15.940]   Get in here.
[01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:16.940]   Yeah.
[01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:17.940]   I am sincere.
[01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:23.300]   We're talking about the Verge.com, which kind of made me sad because I realized I blew
[01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:26.340]   it in our sight redesign that this is really what I wanted to do.
[01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:28.180]   That was my goal was to make you feel bad.
[01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:29.180]   You made me sad.
[01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:30.180]   I realized this.
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:31.180]   How could I get Leo?
[01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:32.180]   The tiled.
[01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:33.180]   The tiled.
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:34.180]   This is it.
[01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:38.300]   And what you've done, which is great, is you have big, beautiful pictures in every article.
[01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:40.460]   And then the thing I really like, actually this is the wrong article to pick because
[01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:42.340]   this is the jawbone is a one of a kind.
[01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:43.900]   So let me pick something that is not a one of a kind.
[01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:45.380]   Well, it's not one of a kind.
[01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:46.380]   No, it is.
[01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:47.380]   It's costable.
[01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:52.300]   In the sense that on other pages, you will aggregate all of that you've written about
[01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:58.460]   that after you read the initial article, you've done a nice job, I think, of aggregating
[01:18:58.460 --> 01:18:59.620]   previous articles.
[01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:03.620]   I think you're talking about story streams, which is a story streams, the trademark.
[01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:09.540]   Yeah, it is actually, I believe they're working on the Vox product team is working on patenting
[01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:11.060]   that right now.
[01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:14.260]   But it is, yeah, story streams are a way that you can kind of, you can put a container
[01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:19.780]   on a story and pull in all of the relevant, specific, relevant pieces of that story in
[01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:22.380]   a chronological narrative, which is kind of amazing.
[01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:24.700]   Yeah, there it is.
[01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:27.900]   This is one of the things that when we saw that what SB Nation was doing, I was like,
[01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:29.900]   this would be incredible for.
[01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:31.940]   Oh, they did it for their sports stuff.
[01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:33.180]   Yeah, they have it on the sports stuff.
[01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:37.820]   And we were just thinking when we saw it, how incredible is this when you go from like
[01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:41.540]   a rumor and you have the code name and then you see a lead photo.
[01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:42.540]   Yeah.
[01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:43.540]   Yeah.
[01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:45.900]   And this whole stream of chronological list of things.
[01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:46.900]   Yeah.
[01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:47.900]   Yeah.
[01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:48.900]   Very nice to see you.
[01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:53.460]   I mean, it's exciting to see something in publishing online that, you know, something
[01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:56.900]   that works like, oh, wait, I, you couldn't do this before and now I can do it.
[01:19:56.900 --> 01:20:00.580]   And it's a whole new sort of put, makes you think differently about the content that
[01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:02.340]   you're making and how you make it.
[01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:04.220]   Eileen will validate this because I told her this.
[01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:06.660]   I said that this is the future of the magazine.
[01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:11.060]   I mean, this is exactly what, you know, if you think outside of the box, you don't think
[01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:14.980]   in terms of magazines, making a website be a magazine, this is what you should have it
[01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:15.980]   be.
[01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:20.980]   So I'll give you a story.
[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:23.980]   Next story, you have story streams.
[01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:24.980]   Yeah.
[01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:25.980]   Yeah.
[01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:27.980]   You know, here's the story stream.
[01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:29.980]   And we try and you see that there's contextual information.
[01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:31.980]   You've got the products that are mentioned in the story.
[01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:34.980]   You can go right to their product pages and we're actually working on doing even more sort
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:37.980]   of cyclical organic connections between that stuff.
[01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:40.980]   So eventually they'll be in line stuff.
[01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:43.980]   And then when you get to those pages, they'll be stuff that already is related, but we're
[01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:44.980]   going to kind of build that.
[01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:47.980]   And then we're going to be doing a lot of work for us because we had a blank slate.
[01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:50.980]   You know, we can, when we started working on this, you obviously have been, your writers
[01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:54.980]   have been working for the last month or so creating content before you open because
[01:20:54.980 --> 01:20:55.980]   it was, it's a rich site.
[01:20:55.980 --> 01:21:00.980]   Well, we've been working on doing content, but also we had all of this is my next content,
[01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:02.980]   which we migrated into the Verge.
[01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:06.980]   So we have a bunch of stuff that, I mean, it's kind of a, you know, we never planned on
[01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:07.980]   doing this is my next.
[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:11.980]   This is my next was like, we wanted to write and then it kind of spiraled out of control
[01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:12.980]   in a good way.
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:13.980]   Right.
[01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:14.980]   So I think that's because you got residual.
[01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:17.980]   Yeah, the residual is that we had all this content when we launched.
[01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:20.980]   So it wasn't like, you know, here's page one and then page two is totally blank.
[01:21:20.980 --> 01:21:23.980]   Big challenge for a site, brand new site.
[01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:26.980]   How do you, yeah, what do you, how do you make it a rich, deep, rich site?
[01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:27.980]   I think you've done a nice job.
[01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:28.980]   Look at this.
[01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:30.980]   It also made it, it also made a challenging on the flip side, which is, you know, to try
[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:35.980]   to write and build something at the same time is, is, you know, rather complicated.
[01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:40.980]   So we were, it was, it was a bit of a mad dash at the end.
[01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:41.980]   Like five minutes on the Verge.
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:42.980]   I think that's great.
[01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:44.860]   Yeah, actually we should do one.
[01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:47.180]   We'll do a five minutes on the Verge with you if you're open to it.
[01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:48.660]   That's, we're just doing quick conversation.
[01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:51.500]   It's just sort of a snapshot of a.
[01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:54.700]   So, so what came up for me though, and so that's the positive.
[01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:58.980]   What came up for me though is you've made a great destination and I just wonder, do
[01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:01.700]   people do destinations matter anymore?
[01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:06.660]   In other words, I noticed how I read content is I read it in aggregation.
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:11.620]   So if you have, if there's a great Verge article on the job, own up, I will see it on my Twitter
[01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:15.500]   stream or my Facebook stream or I'll see it in my RSS reader or whatever.
[01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:19.500]   I'll go, I'll read that article, but then I leave the Verge.
[01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:24.140]   You know, in other words, it's, do, do people's destination make sense anymore?
[01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:27.060]   So, so yeah, I actually, well, no, I mean, in a way, yes.
[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:30.100]   And then in some ways, no, I mean, we, there are people who come to the front page and scan
[01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:31.100]   the front page.
[01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:33.700]   And one of the reasons we designed the front page, the way we designed it was for the people
[01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:36.540]   who haven't been there 20 times in a day.
[01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:37.540]   Right.
[01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:38.540]   The people who are getting there.
[01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:39.940]   No, and that's, that's the thing I like the best.
[01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:43.420]   Is this tiled, tiled aggregation of everything you've missed.
[01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:47.940]   Our thinking, our thinking was with the site was, and this, you know, you see this in the
[01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:51.860]   long form, you see it in our product database and even in the forms is there are all these
[01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:53.180]   places you can enter the site.
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:55.580]   I don't expect people to enter the site from one place.
[01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:58.820]   I think they're going to come in from a bunch of different ways and they're going to get
[01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:02.900]   the content in a, in a, it's almost, you can almost just have that piece of content by
[01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:03.900]   itself.
[01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:04.900]   Right.
[01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:08.140]   And just that piece of the site by itself, not necessarily be on the rest of the site.
[01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:11.020]   And the whole idea is that, yeah, it's all sort of viral.
[01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:15.060]   I mean, it's sticky enough so that when I get here, I see the jawbone story, but I also
[01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:18.260]   see previous next, I see that you've done a night.
[01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:19.860]   That's why the story stream is so great.
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:23.540]   It might draw me into more, more of the site.
[01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:27.420]   So you in some ways you see every landing page as, as a front page.
[01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:30.980]   Well, and I think a lot of people coming to find reviews are looking, they go to Google,
[01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:36.020]   they search, you know, job bone, uh, up review, and they just want to read that review.
[01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:38.340]   And the reviews pages serve that perfectly.
[01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:41.140]   And I don't, you know, I don't think I'm going to, uh, I actually don't think people
[01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:44.860]   are looking at the sidebar very often and going, all right, now I'm here and I want to
[01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:45.860]   go to somewhere else.
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:49.740]   I think a lot of times they just need to get, I think in certain instances, like long form
[01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:51.900]   stuff, they're looking for this one piece of content.
[01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:55.860]   They're not necessarily there to browse around, but we do have, I think we're offering a kind
[01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:56.860]   of balance of that.
[01:23:56.860 --> 01:24:01.100]   But when I was thinking about this, when we were trying to figure out what we wanted
[01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:04.260]   to build, it was like, you can't, you can't get it.
[01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:05.260]   You can't, you're not a portal.
[01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:07.940]   I mean, to some people, you're a portal, but not to everybody.
[01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:12.060]   That's my, that was my thought is you've made it a beautiful portal, but that will be less
[01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:14.180]   important and as time goes by.
[01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:15.180]   Yeah.
[01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:17.820]   And I think we'll learn, you know, this is where five days, six days into this site,
[01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:19.500]   I think we're going to learn behavior.
[01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:23.700]   Uh, the long form stuff is brand new and so we'll see what the behavior is on these pages.
[01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:26.700]   But so far they've, they're performing great in terms of traffic.
[01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:27.700]   Good.
[01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:28.700]   Love them.
[01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:29.700]   The comments have been really positive.
[01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:32.460]   So I mean, we're, I'm just ecstatic that people like it because I thought we were taking
[01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:34.780]   a bunch of risks and it's always scary.
[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:37.380]   To do something weird and not be sure if people are going to care.
[01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:38.860]   I think this is an Engagic killer.
[01:24:38.860 --> 01:24:39.860]   I really do.
[01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:41.420]   I know that that probably wasn't job one.
[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:43.020]   Might have a job four.
[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:44.120]   It's on now.
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:46.500]   But I really think, I mean, don't you think this is an Engagic killer?
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:47.500]   I think it's beautiful.
[01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:48.500]   It's so gorgeous.
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:51.500]   I think it's doing a lot of long form stuff, which I think is very interesting.
[01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:54.340]   You know, one of the reasons I love ours, Technica, is the long form stuff.
[01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:58.900]   But one of the things that we learned at, this is my next that was immediate.
[01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:01.900]   When we started writing there, we said, well, we're not going to do every piece of news,
[01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:02.900]   right?
[01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:05.740]   We're going to do tutorials and reviews and longer form stuff.
[01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:07.300]   We do events and people love people.
[01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:08.620]   We're like, I love this.
[01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:11.220]   This is the meaty stuff that I really want to read.
[01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:12.780]   And we've been trying to do that at end gadget.
[01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:14.380]   We've been trying to build out our longer form stuff.
[01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:18.300]   But of course, we had this crush of news that we had to deal with every day and we
[01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:19.660]   weren't expanding in the right way.
[01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:22.100]   So we wanted to do that.
[01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:23.740]   That's a big emphasis for us of this thing.
[01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:27.780]   And I think people are starting to look, go back to, and I'm sure Nick can attest to
[01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:28.780]   this.
[01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:32.100]   I mean, this people are starting to want to find the narrative of these stories.
[01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:33.100]   It's not just about the quick hit.
[01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:34.100]   And I love the quick hit.
[01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:35.980]   I love like, hey, breaking news.
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:40.100]   But people want to know what this, the culture of technology.
[01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:42.180]   That's kind of, I mean, that's to me, that's what Twitter is.
[01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:43.180]   It's not the quick hit.
[01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:45.020]   You don't come here to find out what's new and what's hot.
[01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:46.260]   You find out you want to hear the narrative.
[01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:47.260]   You want to hear the conversation.
[01:25:47.260 --> 01:25:48.260]   The conversation.
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:49.260]   Yeah.
[01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:52.280]   I mean, there's a lot of context that's missing and there's a lot of narrative that isn't
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:53.280]   getting told.
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:57.060]   So I think we're trying to do that in the way that we think is engaging and interesting.
[01:25:57.060 --> 01:25:59.700]   I think that's the thing, like, when I first started blogging through the talk,
[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:01.700]   get that mic right in your mouth.
[01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:02.700]   You didn't like the wall.
[01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:03.700]   You didn't like the wall.
[01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:04.700]   You didn't slide your mouth.
[01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:05.700]   Yeah.
[01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:06.700]   No, I think you're absolutely right, Joshua.
[01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:09.700]   When I first started blogging through the times, I knew I'd never be able to actually
[01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:11.420]   win on timing for the most part.
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:12.700]   I can break stories and things like that.
[01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:16.540]   But when it comes to press releases, you know, everyone's going to just put the headline
[01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:17.860]   and that's what the times does.
[01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:22.820]   And so I have to look at reporting from an analytical standpoint and talking to researchers
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:23.820]   and things like that.
[01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:26.900]   And I'm amazed at how people, that's what people want.
[01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:27.900]   Yeah.
[01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:29.100]   We're going to start the show.
[01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:30.500]   So hold on.
[01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:35.300]   will continue of course the best part of the show as always before we record it.
