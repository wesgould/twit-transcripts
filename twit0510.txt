[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   It's time for "Twit" this week in Tech, the show where we

[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   in the business, well not last week.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   But this week, yes.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I'm really glad to welcome Jeff Jarvis, who's normally here
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Wednesdays for this week in Google.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   He's a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   He blogs at buzzmachine.com.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   He likes long walks on the beach.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   And he's usually picker than this.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   He's looking good, like the hair.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   He's just growing out there.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   That looks nice.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   That's good.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   It's good to see you on a weekend.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Jeff, thank you for doing this.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Appreciate it.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I'm honored and delighted.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   In fact, I was actually hurt that I haven't been asked to honor
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   in a long time.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   You've done this show before though.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I've done this show before, but it's been quite a while.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And I thought, what did I do wrong?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I feel like it's cheating when we ask our other hosts to be on the show.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Like, that's too easy.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   But I love it.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I love it.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Well, good.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Well, put him down for more often.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Will you, Jason Hell?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I love Jeff.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   I'm on it.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   He's the greatest.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Plus, you were so cranky on Wednesday.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I was.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   I felt bad.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I felt bad because I did.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Matthew was just the nicest guy in the world.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   He's a sweetie.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Even for Canadian, he's really nice.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   And we disagreed and I went to full Jeff mode and he was in full
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Matthew, nice mode.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   So I lost that one.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   It was fun.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   We love that.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   You know, you had it.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   You probably just moved on.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Move on.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Enough, Jeff.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Well, I was just trying to get to a commercial.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I was just representing the economic interests of the program.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   That's all.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   You know, it's good theater.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Also here from Bloomberg Business Week, Mr. Mark Millian.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Great to have you back.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Oh, he's a good time here.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Do you live in the city now?
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   I do, yeah.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   And today was what's called beta breakers, which is supposed to
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   be an annual marathon.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   It's not even a marathon.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   It's like 10 miles.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Show.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Now it's just a bunch of frat boys get drunk and puke in the city
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   streets.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   It's gotten a little out of hand.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   It's definitely.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   There's no athletics and athleticism involved.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   There is, I guess, for the first, like, hour of the competition.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   And then there's another four hours of just drinking publicly.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   And it makes it hard to get around.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   It's great to have you, though.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   He covers global technology for Bloomberg.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Always nice to have you up in studio with us.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Also, Miriam Jwar is here.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   We love having her here.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Formally of an Engadgett.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Tankgirl.com.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Oh, you got a website now.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   TNK.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I've had it forever.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   GRL.com.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Are you putting stuff there, then?
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   And we'll see the review videos and stuff.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   And whatever comes to mind.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Longtime mobile phone editor at Engadgett.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   So you get, in fact, you have.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   I have the G4.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   How many cool things?
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   I do a lot of your phone reviews here.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Before you buy, she's a regular.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   She's also a regular on it all about Android.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   This is the LG G4.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Jeff, this is, I think this is the next--
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   This is the one.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   This is the one this year.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   You like it?
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   I think it's--
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   It's got no one off switch.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Part of the pun, but it edges out the GS6 a bit.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Yeah, I've been using Galaxy S6, but I have to say it's a little--
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   wonky.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   I have to reboot it every day.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   And I think this is--
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   It might be a lollipop, an Android 5.0 problem.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   People say there's a memory leak in Android 5.0.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   The hope is that 5.2 will fix it, but I'm running 5.1.1.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   And I have to reboot.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   I'm not getting that on the Nexus 6.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   You are not?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   No.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   I'm kind of hitting my Nexus 6 right now.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Well, we all need to keep our Nexus 6 in case we get an invite
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   from Project 5.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Right, exactly.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Well, Mr. G, I've been thinking about that.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Now, I'm not ready to switch over my regular phone number to Project 5.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Right.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   You lose your Google voice capability, right?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Well, I don't even use that that much, but probably what I'll have to do is move my account
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   over to my Nexus 5 and then do a Project 5 on my Nexus 6.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   It's going to be very confusing.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   The camera you say-- so Nexus 6 camera is not good.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   No.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   And the screen is only adequate.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   When you compare the screen to the QHD screens on the Galaxy S6 and the G4, these screens
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   are spectacular.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   There's a lot of debate right now as to whether the GS6-- let's put it this way.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   The GS6 and the G4 in terms of camera have really finally brought Android into the realm of the iPhone.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   iPhone?
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   They could both favorably do an iPhone.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Or better, in my opinion.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   But there's a lot of debate whether the GS6 or the G4 are better.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   And I actually do believe the G4 is better.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   And it's not by a little bit either.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   It's significantly better.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Well, I ordered one.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   But we don't know when availability will be.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Everybody says they'll have it.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   What's the price point?
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   We don't know.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   We don't know.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   I mean, we can expect about $650.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   It's the usual.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   You know, and $100 to $200 on contract.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   You don't think it'll be a $300?
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   No.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Feature phone deluxe.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   No.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Let me take a picture of you.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Hey.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   So you like-- it's got laser focusing.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   So it's faster, right?
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Or it's just better because it's less--
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   What I like about the camera is--
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Love those lasers.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   --particular is--
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Hey, that's a good picture.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   --the low light performance.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   That's actually great.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   It's pretty bulletproof, right?
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   What I love about it--
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   To the detail.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   I know, right?
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   It's pretty bulletproof like the iPhone.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   It has incredible amounts of low light performance.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   And it has a manual mode, which I really love.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Hang on.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   We'll go back to the camera here.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   I'm trying to go back to the camera.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   So in here you have a--
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Okay.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Same picture on an iPhone.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   It's pretty close.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   I mean, the iPhone's really good too here.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   But the camera's probably not technically--
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Well, I like here.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   It's an 8-megapixel sensor.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   This is a 16.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   And this has three axis OIS.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   It does rotation OIS as well as--
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Oh, that's optical images.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   --and this one does no OIS.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   You have to go to the 6 plus.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Yeah, the 6 plus has LIS.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   So it has a manual mode that gives you raw.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Holy cool.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   And it has an Instagram, and you can set shutter speed.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   So, whereas the GS6 can only have--
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   You can set shutter speed on your phone.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Yeah, I'm sagging.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Sagging in its phone.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Oh.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Give me my sagging phone bag.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   All I know is that--
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Look, it doesn't apply to everyone, but if you're into photography,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   the manual mode on this is killer.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   I feel like people when they buy smartphones these days,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   the camera is-- if not the number one feature,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   it's right up there.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Oh, I think it's-- I think after your decision between Android
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   and iPhone, it's--
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Camera's the next thing.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   I can't wait till they release this, I hope.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Now, mine's what version of Android it has.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   It was two bollocks done.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Well, and so people are saying, and they may be right,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   that this memory leak issue is a Galaxy S6 feature.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And supposedly, Samsung has a 5-- a fix that they're pushing
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   out ahead of 5.2.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   But--
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Lots of folks in the chat room are saying on their Nexus 7s,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   they have a problem, neither do I.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Yeah, I don't have a problem on Nexus 7.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   My 1 plus 1 with oxygen seemed fine.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   But I find that the Galaxy S6 becomes slower to respond over time.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   And after a day or two, you really want to reboot.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Here's a low light shot.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Here's a low light shot.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   It's a low light shot.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Try that with your iPhone.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   That's--
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   It's a long exposure.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   One second.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Oh, you can set it for a one second.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   This is one second.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Holy cow!
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Wow.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Holy cow!
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Where do I get one?
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Can't.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Yep.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   You got this from here?
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Again, having shutter speed control-- this was some LG.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   It's a Korean version.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   A rumor.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Shutter speed control is critical if you want to do some really good--
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Look at the detail.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Okay.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Handheld.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   See that?
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Wow.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   That's that little tiny yellow dot there.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   And remember, handheld one second exposure at 200 ISO.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Yeah, that's crazy.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Wow.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Looks really good.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   I'm going to throw away my DSLR.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Okay.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.440]   So to give you a point of reference, as you know, I've been a professional journalist for a long
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:54.760]   time doing live blogging of big conferences with a DSLR with a big lens.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:59.920]   I did the live blog of Microsoft Build with this, and it was web quality usable.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.320]   No problem all morning long.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.720]   I've never been able to use smartphone to live blog ever.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.200]   This was worthy of, you know, like a point and shoot.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.200]   Wow.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.760]   So, there we are.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.760]   This is where--
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:17.800]   It's so frustrating because you can't buy a phone before another one comes out that's
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.800]   better.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.680]   I think we're good for the one for the year.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.160]   We're good for a while.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.760]   What's going to happen next to IO?
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.760]   What's going to happen when I have a phone?
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.760]   It's just a week, two weeks away now.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.120]   Look, I had to say this.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:34.920]   But as much as I've used an XS as my main phone since the Nexus 1, I have never been satisfied
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.920]   with the imaging experience.
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:36.920]   I've managed to extract--
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:37.920]   No, terrible cameras.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.080]   I've managed to extract incredible photos off of the phones because I know what I'm doing.
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.680]   But honestly, Google does not know how to handle imaging on their devices with their
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.120]   default camera or their imaging chain.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.680]   It's about software, isn't it?
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.680]   If you look at the--
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:51.680]   It's software and hardware.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.400]   What Apple does with the iPhone, it's software.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.400]   It's just hardware.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.400]   And they have great-- but aren't they both using Sony sensors?
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.400]   I mean, it's not--
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.440]   I mean, no, but they made a conscious effort to pick good hardware.
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:04.040]   Like, large pixels, good sensor, good optics.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.800]   But the iPhone is an 8 megapixel camera.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.760]   That may not be a bad thing because it means the pixels are bigger than the high megapixel.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.520]   This is actually a 1.35 micron.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.520]   OK.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.520]   The iPhone's 1.5 micron.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.040]   The old HTCs were two microns, the ultra pixels.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.560]   I have six, I think, is 1 micron.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.000]   It's 1.1, yeah.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.960]   It's same as a lot of the high megapixel-- like the 20 megapixel on the M9.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:34.200]   I remember talking to Jan Peter Bronner from-- I guess this is his name.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.200]   I'm getting his name wrong.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.200]   He was on triangulation.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.600]   Nokia engineer, great photographer.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:45.720]   And he-- this was a year, two years, maybe two years ago, said the future photography
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.720]   is computational.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.720]   Absolutely.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.400]   It isn't about sensors.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.800]   One of the reasons-- this was when the 1020 had just come up.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.000]   It's a 1020, which is a 41 megapixel.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.840]   Though this beats the 1020, a lot of us have made some actual comparisons.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.840]   I think it does.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:03.560]   We're finally at the stage with this Steve Litchfield, who is a British camera photography
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:08.400]   expert, has taken these two phones side by side and actually has, for the first time,
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:13.280]   admitted that, you know, Microsoft's no longer in the running at this point unless they have
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.280]   something else.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.760]   You've got to feel for Microsoft.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.360]   What are they going to do?
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.200]   The only thing they had, right?
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.760]   They had these great-- they bought these great Nokia phones.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.320]   They have these great Lumia phones.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.120]   We do hear there's going to be a new Lumia coming out, a couple of new high-end Lumia's
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:33.440]   coming out towards the end of the year when Windows Phone 10 comes out.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:43.760]   And they've also said that they're going to make it possible to create-- take your iOS
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.600]   app and your Android app and port it over to Windows Phone.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.600]   But my question is--
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:53.480]   So, well, yeah, but if you're an iOS developer, if you're an Android developer, are you going
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.560]   to really say, "Oh, great.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.840]   I get the giant Windows phone.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.840]   Are you an even bother?
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.080]   Even if it takes a day, is it worth it?"
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.640]   I'm mad enough to get stuff moved from iOS to Android.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:02.640]   I know.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.640]   Let alone--
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.640]   I can't get the New York Times app.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.240]   I can't get instant articles on Facebook.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.240]   It's very irritating.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:14.320]   I think the next big battle is going to be over India because that's such a huge market
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.320]   that's just coming online on smartphones right now.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.000]   Did we say that China was the next big battle?
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   China's there.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   China has established.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   China has established.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.640]   Sales are going down, aren't they?
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.840]   I mean, growth is slowing down because they've reached a peak.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:27.840]   They've saturated.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.840]   So it's now it's India?
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.840]   It's India now.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.840]   And Satya Nadella has--
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.840]   He's India.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.840]   Yeah.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.040]   Well, not only that, but Nokia has huge--
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:41.280]   Well, the brand is big in a lot of those countries, but it's not the Lumia brand.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.280]   It's the Nokia brand.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:47.600]   But from what I talk to the Indian journalists, I know they're quite-- the people have kind
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.600]   of done the switch.
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.600]   They understand that--
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.640]   Historically, Microsoft is now Nokia, whatever.
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:57.200]   Windows Phone has done well in odd markets like Russia where the iPhone wasn't available
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.080]   for a long time.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.800]   India, Southeast Asia, Southeast Asia.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:05.160]   The reality, I think we're missing a big chunk here of this super critical is that low
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.160]   end Android is a terrible experience.
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.160]   Yes.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.920]   Low end Windows Phone is not a terrible experience.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:10.920]   Much better, I agree.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.880]   In fact, it's not much different than high end Windows Phone.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:14.880]   Miriam, have you tried Android 1?
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.520]   I have not tried an N11 device yet, but I've tried more than that.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.520]   The G and Moto E and--
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.520]   That's the cheap version in India and now Turkey.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.520]   Target emerging markets.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.520]   And it's designed to be workable in a cheaper phone.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.520]   It is a challenge though.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.080]   They're selling a lot of Android's phones, but they don't run very well.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.640]   Jeff, I agree with you that there are some that are like the Moto G and Moto E are good
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:40.440]   examples of awesome experiences on Android at low price, but it's the exception of the
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.440]   role.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.440]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:46.640]   I'm just-- what I'm also curious about though is that the Android 1 is designed for that.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.000]   I mean, if it's cut down to work, I'm really eager.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.200]   When I was in India, I tried to find an Android 1 phone and I couldn't.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.200]   I didn't have time.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.720]   But I'd love to buy one just to see what it's like.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:59.600]   But we could stipulate, I think, that Windows Phone gives you the best low end.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.600]   I think right now--
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:05.360]   I think their low end is a significantly higher bar than Android's low end.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.360]   You can put Android onto--
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.360]   A $10 phone.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.040]   --you know, $70 in components.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.920]   And Microsoft tends to not let OEMs do that.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.360]   So what is the $530, the $63?
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.360]   What is the cheapest--
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.400]   Oh, no, there are some that are not available in the US.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.400]   It's like 200 series.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.400]   $4.24, $3, $4.44.50.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.400]   Yeah, no, we start to get significantly down.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.400]   There's a--
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.040]   You don't want those, trust me.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:33.160]   Like, you look at the specs on those, you're like, whoa, time warp back to 10 years ago.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:39.320]   I think we take reasonably a bit of a hit because we pretty much focus on the high end
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:43.960]   smartphones, the flagship phones, because that's what's interesting, frankly.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.520]   And that's where all the profit is for these companies.
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.960]   That's why Apple loves it.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.320]   Samsung loves the high end premium.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.240]   So why is India important?
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:59.160]   I mean, India is important because it's a massive market of potentially a billion users.
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.720]   So you only make $10 a phone.
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.720]   You get a lot of users.
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.000]   You get a huge foothold in the biggest new market.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.240]   It's why China was important five years ago.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.560]   Isn't it funny that you don't make the money on the phones.
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.960]   You make it in Google's case, you make it on the services.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.200]   It's next after India is out of curiosity.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.200]   Well, we saturate India.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.120]   Well, India is also against Southeast Asia.
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:22.840]   A lot of countries within Southeast Asia are starting to come online around the same time.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.280]   India has kind of been this success story everybody's been waiting for since around
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.120]   the same time as China.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.560]   But government issues, bureaucratic issues.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.320]   This is your beat, by the way, as well.
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.920]   Yeah, we focus a lot on this.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.720]   Is there infrastructure?
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.720]   Is that an issue?
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.800]   I mean, really, these smartphones require internet infrastructure.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.040]   They just got 3G within the last couple of years.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.200]   But now they have it.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.880]   Now they're starting to come online across the country.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.040]   But China's already doing LTE across.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.360]   They're starting to roll it out into rural areas of China.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.800]   All the biggest cities there in India is not even close.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:09.480]   So infrastructure will be an issue and mobile videos can be nonexistent in India for quite
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.480]   some time.
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.920]   They'll be behind the rest of the world.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:17.000]   But it's still going to be a massive market for companies to sell phones to, which my
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.760]   Microsoft is looking there.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:24.200]   And Android is doing this Android one initiative which started in India.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:30.200]   Apple makes exceptions where they'll sell very old models that they don't sell anywhere
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.200]   else.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:35.520]   They'll sell them in India because they know they need a cheaper model to start to get
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.520]   a foothold there.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.320]   So this will always five Cs ended up, huh?
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.320]   And it's still sold.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.920]   I think the 4s there and the 4s.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:44.920]   Are you kidding?
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:45.920]   Wow.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:53.160]   I talk to people all the time who have iPhone 4s in the United States of America, my friends.
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:58.400]   Why is Microsoft investing in submarine cables to Asia?
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.400]   What is that?
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.400]   What is that, Jeff?
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.400]   You just tell that?
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.160]   Is that I feel like my that's the latest iPhone I own because I don't use I've been
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.160]   an Android for that long.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.160]   You got one.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.160]   That's all it matters.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:12.560]   By the way, one more point on India real quick, Mark, I was at the the Hindustan times about
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.200]   three weeks ago.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:19.240]   And from our media perspective, the opportunity for India to leapfrog the web world, the mobile
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:25.800]   world, they can really stand apart and make great progress in new ways to look at media
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:26.800]   and services.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.320]   And that's huge for us.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.440]   I think that we're still stuck in a web world.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.360]   I need to understand this better.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:39.720]   Maybe Mark, you can teach us because it is a very different world where even power infrastructure,
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:43.320]   charging infrastructure sometimes doesn't exist.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.840]   People use phones as their primary computer.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.400]   A lot of banking is done.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.400]   I understand.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.400]   This is all what I've been told.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.840]   A lot of banking is done on the phone.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.840]   Yeah.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:53.840]   That's your bank.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:19:00.440]   I mean, those two issues you brought up, power and banking are particularly interesting in
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.840]   Kenya where Africa.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.840]   Yeah.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.360]   Charging your phone is like a, you know, they're vendors with cars.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:12.760]   Go around with power to walk for half an hour just to get to a place that'll have reliable
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.800]   charging station.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:21.200]   And then there's a service in Kenya called M-Pesa, which is huge.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:26.800]   One of their telecom companies just offers this payment system that works with your phone
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.800]   bill using text messaging to pay people back and forth.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.880]   They were years ahead of us in mold.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.680]   I mean, we're just now starting to come on to Venmo and Square Cash and some of these
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.560]   things where, where's Kenya's been using this for years and years?
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.120]   It's quite fascinating.
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.920]   Where does India stand in that continuum?
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:51.600]   I think like Jeff said, they're very much like bypassing PCs.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.600]   Right, yeah.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.640]   And many, many people there have never used a computer before.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:01.120]   And their first computers are these smartphones that they're just starting to get.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.720]   I mentioned this, Mark, have you covered Flipkart?
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.000]   It's like the Amazon of India.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   It's the Amazon of India.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   And it's the lab deal.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   And it's the lab deal.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.200]   Is there other huge competitor there?
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:15.720]   And now Amazon is starting to invest a ton of resources into India because they see this
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.800]   massive e-commerce market coming online.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.200]   But it's billions and billions of dollars.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.840]   It's kind of challenging for American companies to understand.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:28.560]   It was hard enough understanding China to understand these new markets and act appropriately.
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.960]   It took us years, frankly, to figure out how to deal with China.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:39.840]   China and India are two, I think they recognize emerging superpowers that want to sort of
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.200]   self-contained the benefits to an extent.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.480]   They don't want to market companies.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.480]   They want companies.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.800]   And so if you're an American company who wants to work in India, you need to find a local
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.280]   subsidiary there that you can work with.
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:56.440]   And it's not as easy to break as it has been for China the same way.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.440]   Let's take a break.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.440]   Come back with more.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.040]   We've got lots to talk about.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.040]   Verizon purchases AOL.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.840]   Somebody made the joke.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:11.840]   AOL got another old company to buy dial up service.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.640]   Another old guy buying dial up from AOL.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:19.800]   We guess AT&T and direct TV also getting together.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.120]   Lots to talk about.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.120]   Mark Williams here from...
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.120]   From the Sun.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.120]   Say again?
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.120]   Frallicking in the Sun.
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.120]   Is that what they're doing?
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.120]   Yeah, it's summer.
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.120]   Oh.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.120]   It is.
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.120]   It's summer.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.120]   We're frolic in the Sun.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.120]   So they're mating.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.120]   It's like, you know, it's mating season.
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.120]   It's spring.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.120]   It's the lusty month of May.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:41.760]   You ever hear the Jonathan Colton song on that subject?
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.760]   It's May.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:43.760]   It's May.
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:44.760]   Outdoors.
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:45.760]   Lovemaking begins today.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.760]   There you go.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:47.760]   See you.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:48.760]   He doesn't say...
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.680]   No, this is not the answer.
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.880]   This is an injured mezzo.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.040]   Mark Williams here from Bloomberg Business Week.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:59.320]   Miriam Jwar, a great friend from TankGirl.com.
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:03.360]   And Jeff Jarvis, not only from this week in Google, but he actually has a job teaching
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.680]   journalism to young people.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.160]   Corrupting them.
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.160]   Corrupting them.
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.160]   Actually, we had a...
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.160]   They need it.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.160]   They need it.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.160]   I'm on people today.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.160]   I tell you.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.160]   I was...
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.160]   Okay.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.200]   So I started getting the New York Times.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.520]   But I can't read it.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.920]   It's the Prince Too Small.
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.920]   I've been spoiled by the internet.
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.360]   You can keep hitting command...
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:26.360]   Command...
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.800]   Command zero and Command one and a clamp one and it's still too small.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:30.800]   It doesn't work.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:31.800]   I have to...
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:32.800]   I can't...
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.560]   So I'm actually going to stop getting the print edition.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.280]   Wow.
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:40.800]   I was all excited because we had such a great experience on our honeymoon of opening the
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.360]   paper, having a cup of coffee.
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.360]   Read...
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.360]   I don't think it was...
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.360]   Leo, that was nothing New York Times.
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.360]   The honeymoon was...
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.240]   It was just a halo high.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.240]   Okay.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.240]   The halo effect.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.960]   But then you get home and it's like, "I can't..."
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.920]   Lisa says, "They're printing it smaller."
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.640]   I said, "I don't think they are."
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.640]   I think...
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.800]   No, they are.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.800]   It's smaller.
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.000]   Yes, and my clothes are shrinking.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.840]   Our show today brought to you by Braintree.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.760]   You talk about mobile payments.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:16.000]   Braintree has brought together every possible way to pay.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.880]   So that if you're creating a mobile application with just a few lines of code, you can integrate
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:25.240]   Braintree in and it's incredible.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.720]   That's why Uber uses it and Lyft.
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.720]   I like that.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.920]   If Uber and Lyft use something, you know it's got to be good.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.960]   Airbnb, GitHub started with Braintree payments.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.920]   They've grown with GitHub.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.120]   They've scaled from your first dollar to your billionth dollar.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.120]   Braintree can do it.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.080]   Living social uses a munchry stub hub.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.080]   Everybody.
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:48.080]   How can you pay?
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.880]   Your customers can, of course, use Apple Pay.
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:55.480]   They can use credit cards.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.480]   They can...
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.480]   The way they can use Bitcoin.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.480]   It works with Bitcoin.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.480]   Venmo.
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.480]   You mentioned Venmo earlier.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.480]   PayPal, of course.
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:02.480]   So I want you to try it out.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.480]   BraintreePayments.com/twit.
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.480]   They've got a sandbox.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.480]   You can see what your app would look like with Braintree payments integrated.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.240]   And of course, it works with all the languages.
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:17.280]   It's not with Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby, of course.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:22.920]   It's making payments in these apps seamless and magical and you need it in your app and
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:23.920]   you can get it now.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.280]   In fact, it's such a good deal.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:33.320]   You get the first $50,000 in transactions fee free when you go to braintreepayments.com/twit.
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:39.200]   You know your users want these payment methods supported with just a few lines.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.200]   It's a code.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:44.560]   BraintreePayments.com/twit.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:51.640]   Microsoft has released information about how many different SKUs there'll be of Windows
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.640]   10.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.640]   There's going to be home.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.640]   There's going to be mobile.
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.640]   There's going to be pro.
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.640]   There's going to be enterprise.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.640]   There's going to be education.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.640]   There's going to be mobile enterprise.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.880]   And there's going to be three different Internet of Things versions.
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.800]   We thought Windows 10 was going to be...
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.480]   You know, do it like Apple does.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:08.800]   Release one version and have it work everywhere.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:09.800]   I'm just a friend.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.800]   Get a Chromebook.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:11.800]   Get a Chromebook.
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:12.800]   Get a Chromebook.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.800]   I'm disappointed.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:18.280]   Actually, oh, a bunch of us that build, us that build and we came up with this great
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:21.960]   idea which is to make a version of...
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.520]   They should make a Chrome...
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.080]   Edge is the new browser, right?
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.080]   Yeah, Edge.
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:31.320]   I said they should make a version of Windows called Windows Edge which is Chrome.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.760]   Chrome OS, the same thing.
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:33.760]   They already have...
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:39.940]   Ubuntu, boot into Edge the web browser and gives you a very well managed, secure, well
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.440]   updated version of Windows.
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.600]   Okay, you have the choice.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.600]   Would you rather use that or Chrome OS?
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.040]   I would use Chrome but in terms of strategy, this would be a great way.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.600]   No, because people use Windows to run Windows applications.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.200]   You'd be surprised.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:56.160]   Some people sell by Windows machines thinking they need all the functionality and they'd
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.000]   be perfecting Apple with Chrome OS.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   That's why we tell them to buy Chrome OS.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.280]   Yeah, at some point, the over complication of this which is Microsoft Way hurts them.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.280]   It sells Chrome.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.880]   Don't worry about all this stuff.
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.240]   Just buy one thing and be done with it.
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.080]   We had started saying July for Windows 10.
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:20.480]   Turns out that was just one vendor and Microsoft has not confirmed that they still just say
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:24.920]   this summer which could be any time between now and September 20th.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.280]   So at some point...
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:28.600]   Here's one thing though they're doing.
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:33.080]   They're taking in hand the Windows phone updates and they're saying we're going to do it.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:36.920]   From now on, all Windows phones will be updated at the same time.
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.360]   Can they get that by carriers?
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.440]   Because that's something that's been killing Android.
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.360]   They can totally bypass the carriers.
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.360]   They can.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.360]   They can.
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.360]   They can just push it out.
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.680]   I mean, the carriers in it be kicking and screaming like they always do, especially Verizon
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:51.040]   and AT&T who want to be in control and want to say, "You know, we need to test this on
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.600]   our network blah blah blah blah blah."
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.280]   We all know it's BS but hey.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.280]   Is it BS?
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.280]   It is BS.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.280]   I understand why Samsung may say well...
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.280]   What do you think an unlock phone like this?
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.120]   We've got skinned versions of Android.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.800]   We're tremendously well on AT&T.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:03.800]   Yeah, they don't.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:04.800]   It's never been tested by AT&T.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.560]   It's perfectly fine.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.280]   That's why standards exist.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:09.280]   Right.
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:15.000]   Well, if you want to avoid fragmentation, get a Windows phone.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.560]   Yeah, sure.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.920]   That's another great reason.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:19.920]   That's ironic I think.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.400]   That was supposed to be ironic.
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:27.720]   I don't care about Edge that much.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:28.880]   I see some stories here.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.200]   We could talk about Edge.
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.200]   This is the browser that replaces Internet Explorer.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.200]   Windows Edge.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.200]   The Windows Edge.
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.200]   The Windows Edge.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.200]   I like the idea of Windows.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.200]   It's cool, right?
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.200]   They do sell.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:44.160]   They do do a free version of Windows for OEMs with 9-inch or less screens called Windows
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.160]   with Bing.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.160]   Oh, Bing.
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.160]   Oh, Bing.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.160]   Oh, Bing.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.160]   So lost.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:55.320]   All right, let's-- I guess we need to talk about the big merger or acquisition.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.280]   It's not a merger.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:58.280]   $4.4 billion.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.080]   It's hate no equals, yeah.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.480]   It is not equals.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.400]   Although, really, I guess not.
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:07.080]   What do you think Jeff AOL was worth in its heyday?
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.040]   $4.4 billion sounds like a lot of money.
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.040]   It's probably not though, right?
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.040]   Not at all.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.040]   What was it?
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.040]   Matthew had the numbers on Twig.
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.040]   It was something like 160.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.040]   It was a ridiculous number of lots more.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.480]   It was $200 billion of something at the time.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.480]   That was a merger.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.720]   The time Warner AOL thing was a merger, right?
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:23.720]   So we don't know exactly.
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.720]   AOL--
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.720]   But they were valued.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.240]   Time Warner for $162 billion in January '20.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.240]   That was time Warner.
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.240]   They got rid of that, right?
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.800]   They were valued over $200 billion at one point.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.800]   Probably.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:35.800]   But that's with time Warner.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.440]   And they don't comment on this.
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.840]   Anyway, $4.4 billion.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.440]   It's not a fire sale.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.440]   The question really is--
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.440]   Oh, it's a good exit.
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.440]   I mean, Tim Armstrong did a very good exit here.
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.440]   Excellent.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.520]   I'm being bankrupt.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.800]   So $50 a share.
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:58.560]   The question everybody's saying is what's going to happen to the AOL content properties?
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.240]   Seems to be some consensus.
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.080]   The Verizon really wants AOL.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.920]   This is not what AOL says, by the way, where Tim Armstrong says the CEO of AOL.
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:11.680]   But I think most of us believe the Verizon is really buying it for the mobile ad technology
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.640]   and the content.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.080]   We talked about this on Wednesday on Twig.
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:22.880]   The content will probably be sold off, including Engadget, TechCrunch, The Huffington Post.
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.880]   You still think that, Jeff?
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.880]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:27.880]   I think so.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:28.880]   It may take a while.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:29.880]   I don't know.
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:30.880]   But yeah.
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.880]   What do you think?
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:32.880]   What do you think, Mark?
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:38.000]   I think the whole value of AOL as a tech company is that they had this whole audience,
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.640]   which was based largely on their editorial.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:46.000]   I mean, once you sell Verizon what this audience for?
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.240]   To sell advertisements to them, the same reason AOL has blogs.
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.240]   I see.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:57.440]   Who's going to buy Verizon AOL ad technology when Google and Yahoo are far and away to leaders?
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:01.440]   So we should stop thinking of Verizon as an internet service provider or a cell phone
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:04.880]   company and start thinking of them as a content company?
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:05.880]   It's a media giant.
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.880]   It's a media giant.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.840]   It's like Time Warner before they split cable off.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.200]   Yeah, they're trying to do that.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.200]   I'm not saying they're succeeding.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.200]   Verizon is in the...
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.200]   Or like Comcast, which is bought NBC.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.440]   Comcast is a very successful example of that, aren't they?
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.480]   Compassity is a content company.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.280]   Arguably starting to turn NBC around.
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.240]   They own universal pictures too, right?
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.840]   So they own movies, they own television.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.080]   They're the delivery medium.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.440]   They're also an internet service provider.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.200]   Is this Verizon trying to be Comcast?
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.040]   As if anybody would want to be Comcast.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.040]   Actually, come on.
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.040]   Well, they're plenty and want to be Comcast.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.040]   Yeah, Comcast is doing okay, I'm sure.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.540]   I think it's...
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:43.540]   You used to work at Engadget.
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:44.540]   Yeah.
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:50.060]   Because I feel like the editorial team at Engadget and TechCrunch are going to feel a
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.060]   little bit of pressure.
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.540]   Yeah, so we talked about this a little bit before the show.
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.700]   I know these guys really well.
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:55.700]   I work with them.
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.580]   Michael Gorman is editor in chief at Engadget.
[00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:03.100]   He will walk way before they try to tell him what to write and how to write it.
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:04.580]   That goes to his first team as well.
[00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:07.060]   I'm not worried about them caving in in any way.
[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:10.940]   I'm more about worried about if they have to walk, what's Engadget as a brand going
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:11.940]   to become, obviously.
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:12.940]   Right.
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:13.940]   Then it's a house organ.
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:19.140]   It's possible that we'll see Engadget as this today with an independent editorial voice
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:21.900]   surrounded by Verizon ads the entire page.
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.860]   Which would be terrible, but it's possible.
[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:30.260]   I would think because it wouldn't really work very well to try to read unbiased editorial
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.660]   content surrounded by Verizon ads.
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:33.860]   But I'm not worried about these guys.
[00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:35.660]   I think they're...
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:38.500]   As Jeff thinks, perhaps they'll get spun off.
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:42.060]   If they don't get spun off, I think they're going to fight tooth and nail to keep their
[00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:46.420]   editorial freedom until they have to walk if they have to.
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:47.420]   I hope they don't.
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:52.140]   A lot of attention paid to the idea that maybe Verizon wanted the video operations.
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:54.140]   Huff, Poe, Engadget.
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.700]   They're all associated with those brands.
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:56.700]   I'll have video.
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.140]   Yeah, but I'm saying, yes, of course.
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:00.260]   They wouldn't dump the brands.
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:01.260]   But does Verizon...
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.980]   I mean, Verizon has a deal within the NFL, but is it really good for the Verizon network
[00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:05.980]   to have video?
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:09.340]   I think they feel like if I were a phone company, I really wouldn't want people playing a
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:10.540]   lot of video on the phones.
[00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:11.540]   Or maybe I don't know.
[00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:12.540]   We're talking about AOL.
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:13.540]   Well, it's the use case.
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:18.020]   Are we talking about AOL on the player, the cranky player that's embedded in every
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:19.980]   Engadget video I had to create?
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.660]   Trust me, that thing is the biggest freaking turd in the universe.
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:23.660]   Good, I like hearing that.
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:26.140]   Like, you should not even consider that an asset.
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:27.140]   Okay, good.
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:32.380]   Like, you know, we were screaming to try to get AOL to let us use YouTube just because
[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:35.180]   from a workflow perspective, it's such a nightmare.
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:38.020]   So I think YouTube is going to open itself up more.
[00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:39.020]   I was at this...
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:42.260]   I was at this news, guys, we'll talk about it later probably, and a lot of demands for
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:46.300]   the AOL player, the YouTube player to be opened up because everybody hates your players.
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:47.300]   Everybody.
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:48.300]   Yeah.
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.580]   We're moving to a new player that I think is quite good.
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:53.420]   A lot of porn sites use it.
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.420]   It's...
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:56.420]   But I'm pumped.
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:58.420]   Well, challenging the environment.
[00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:00.220]   Well, you know that porn drives the technology.
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.260]   No, we talked about this last week.
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:04.020]   Devorex says it's not true.
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:08.380]   The JW player, which they say is the most popular video player in the world.
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.780]   That's what we're going to use on the new Twitset.
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:11.780]   It's nice.
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:14.940]   And one of the things it does, if you pay a little extra, it does a Chromecast.
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.580]   So you could Chromecast with this.
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:18.580]   Ooh, that's nice.
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:19.580]   Yeah.
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:21.180]   So I don't know.
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:24.060]   So what they're saying is they want the YouTube player...
[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:25.060]   What?
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:27.700]   The code for the YouTube player to be...
[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:32.540]   No, no, more of an ability to white label it a little bit.
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:37.300]   So if they get hosted or owned videos on their whole show videos on it exactly.
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:39.980]   And why would you want that?
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:41.780]   Because it's a better player.
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:44.620]   And because Google could sell in ads when it could have a higher value ad.
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:46.300]   So Google might do it because they could...
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.420]   This would give them more outlets for your ads.
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:50.580]   As a content creator, the biggest...
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:52.060]   And maybe you can agree to...
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.740]   Mark, I don't know how it is with Bloomberg.
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:57.460]   But for us, the biggest issue was when we had a trade show and we have to get a video
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:02.740]   up in a very quick amount of time, you know, YouTube sometimes was problematic because
[00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.180]   we'd be in a queue, right?
[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:05.180]   Like you'd upload...
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:06.180]   Yeah, it takes a while.
[00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:07.180]   It takes a while to be live.
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.180]   It's a process thing.
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:12.220]   Whereas one of the things we were able to work out with in Well On obviously was to get
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:13.220]   priority, right?
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:19.300]   So if we posted something, we could like set a flag, say, this has to go up now.
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:22.260]   And so having that ability through YouTube would be fantastic.
[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.220]   Even if you had to pay them for it.
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:26.660]   You know, I think that would be the great thing.
[00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:30.460]   And then some kind of revenue share setup where, you know...
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:32.340]   I don't think it's really very good for...
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:36.140]   It's good for individuals like me who have their own YouTube channel to make money off
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:37.660]   the ads from on YouTube.
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:39.540]   But I think for a while, it was always an issue.
[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:42.740]   They always said, "We don't make money off of YouTube."
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:47.580]   So somehow I think YouTube, Google has to figure out a way for bigger, big partners,
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:53.260]   big companies to make money through YouTube as well as themselves make money through
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:55.220]   YouTube at the same time.
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:35:00.380]   And for these companies to have special packages that let editors that work there, click a
[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:02.380]   button that says, "This needs to go live now."
[00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:06.140]   Like the moment that the bits hit the stream, they need to be live.
[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:08.900]   So YouTube needs to pull a Facebook instant articles.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:09.900]   Kind of.
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:14.500]   I mean, Facebook cut those individual deals with their nine chosen publishers.
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:18.100]   And I'll tell you, you serve their own ads or they can let Facebook do it and take a
[00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:19.100]   cut.
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:20.100]   Exactly, Mark.
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.100]   And the point here is that...
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:27.260]   And this is what came out of this conference I just went to, is that embeddability is...
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:31.220]   In-Indo streams is a next phase here.
[00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:34.620]   And YouTube's been the model for years and years and years and it still amazes me that
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:39.140]   the rest of media have gone that way and now instant articles forces it that way.
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:43.500]   So good embeddable experiences where you have some data and you have control over your advertising
[00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.780]   about an opportunity for more advertising.
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:48.540]   We're going to see a lot of that coming up, I think.
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:49.540]   Yeah.
[00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:53.620]   And I think if Google can crack this with YouTube, I want to see things that all these other
[00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:55.540]   video-serving platforms are gone.
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:57.860]   Like, there's just no need for them anymore.
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.180]   Vimeo goes away.
[00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:00.180]   Maybe not Vimeo.
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:03.940]   Maybe not Vimeo because Vimeo is just slightly different.
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.820]   You know, Vimeo, we see a lot of short films and...
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:08.780]   Yeah, there's no ads in Vimeo.
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:09.780]   Exactly.
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:10.780]   So I don't know.
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:11.780]   Certain advantage to that.
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.100]   Although they might go away because there's no money.
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:21.380]   But I really do think right now there is a missing chunk out there for the Engages and
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:26.220]   the TechCrunchs and the Bloombergs of the world and even the Twits of the world to use YouTube
[00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:32.060]   in a really compelling way because YouTube gives you that audience, gives you that, you
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:36.540]   know, the searchability, gives you all this awesome stuff, right, that we all love about
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:37.540]   it.
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:43.140]   I like to go on YouTube as a customer, as a user and just browse around and get suggestions
[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:46.180]   and do searches that give me relevant content.
[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:49.460]   And that's what Google's done so well with everything, searching.
[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:56.220]   Somebody in the chat room gave me a press release from last year from AOL.
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:00.020]   The first cross-screen programmatic advertising platform.
[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:08.860]   This is, I think, what Verizon bought, which is called One by AOL and puts ads everywhere.
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:12.660]   Global cross-platform.
[00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:15.060]   So maybe that's really the value.
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.940]   That's worth $4.4 billion alone probably.
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:23.580]   It took them four years to build and it's time-tested with all the AOL content.
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:27.900]   Yeah, you know, the thing that Tim Armstrong is brilliant, I keep on coming back to it,
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:32.020]   is that he built Google's US ad structure and sales.
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:33.020]   He knows ads.
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:34.500]   He knows ads.
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:36.020]   He knows ads at volume.
[00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:37.020]   Yes.
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:38.020]   Yeah.
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:43.220]   So that came from an acquisition technology in 2013, Adapt TV.
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:46.820]   The AOL paid a little over $400 million for it.
[00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:47.820]   Okay.
[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:48.820]   Good.
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:49.820]   But yeah, that's definitely a big deal.
[00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:54.220]   I mean, $400 million is no drop in the bucket for a company like AOL.
[00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:55.220]   Right.
[00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:56.220]   Yeah.
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:58.220]   Let's talk, what was it?
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.220]   You were in Helsinki.
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.220]   Helsinki.
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.220]   Helsinki.
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:03.220]   How was that?
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:04.220]   You were only there for a day.
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:05.220]   I was there for a day and a half, yeah.
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.980]   But it was really worth going.
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:10.700]   Google, there's something really interesting and heavy to write now because Google, as
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:14.580]   we talked about on Twig before, wants to make nice with European publishers, European
[00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:18.660]   publishers are filled with Eurotechno panic and causing them problems.
[00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:25.380]   So they did a deal with eight old-world, old-style publishers to do some innovation
[00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:30.700]   and a kind of a bribery, I mean, innovation fund and train some money.
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:31.700]   There's some money.
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:36.620]   So it was good that finally there was a bit of an effort at Daytona in some groups.
[00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:41.820]   And then Facebook, frankly, leapfrogged them and Facebook came out with instant articles,
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:46.420]   nine publishers instead of eight and said, "We're going to put you in the stream.
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:49.820]   We have a beautiful tool and we're going to let you keep 100% of the ad revenue you
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:54.180]   sell or 70% of the ad revenue that presumably at a higher value than Facebook sells.
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:55.260]   Hell of a deal."
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:39:00.940]   So then this was the first effort, we call it a newsgeist, unconference with about 100,
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:05.140]   150 media people and Googlers in Helsinki.
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:08.900]   Very, very good discussions, very serious discussions.
[00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:15.220]   And gives me some hope that there is data on peace in the kingdom and also hope that
[00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:20.900]   this ability to leapfrog each other finally puts media people in a decent position where
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:22.900]   we can come up with mutually beneficial deals.
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:26.420]   Yeah, everybody's going to say, "I don't trust Facebook and I'm trust Google."
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:28.380]   But as I always say, it's about the business terms.
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:31.140]   Come up with the right business terms and negotiate it.
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:36.020]   And so one of the, I've talked for a long time about this idea of embeddability.
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:39.860]   So we had a very serious discussion about trying to open up what Facebook did to every
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:42.300]   publisher in every site.
[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:45.300]   And maybe Google could help, maybe Facebook could help, who knows?
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.220]   I imagine there's a lot to talk about that.
[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:48.220]   There was a lot of talk about that.
[00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:52.100]   And then there was a session about what Google could do, which focused more on Google News,
[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:53.100]   but that was interesting.
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:57.100]   And some people in the rooms, without dissent, people said, "Buy Twitter."
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:00.300]   Google should buy Twitter.
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.300]   There's a lot of news in the room.
[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:06.420]   I was among them pushed for a Google News API, a product API, a data API.
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:08.420]   And this was the kind of discussion we had there.
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:14.980]   But I think it was extremely healthy that we have this game of leapfrog going on right
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:16.340]   now.
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:20.580]   And we have major technology platforms that see the importance of media and the importance
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:21.580]   of news when we're playing along.
[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:23.340]   There's lots and lots of issues.
[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:24.340]   There's issues of trust.
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.420]   Will Facebook pull a rug out from under us?
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:28.340]   Well, that's a business term.
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:33.180]   Issues of whether Facebook will take responsibility for the news and have the courage of a publisher
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:40.780]   to keep up controversial and difficult news, even against sensors and tyrants.
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:44.060]   Issues as to whether my biggest issue is whether or not we will get -- we publishers will get
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:48.340]   data from people to be able to build our own relationships of relevance and value with
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:49.340]   people.
[00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:52.580]   It's just the beginning, but finally it's the beginning.
[00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:56.220]   In all fairness, the German publishers I've made fun of for making life so difficult
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.220]   for Google.
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:58.620]   Well, to an extent you've got to give them credit.
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.540]   They brought Google to the table if not their knees.
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:03.460]   And that brought Facebook to the table.
[00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.620]   And now there is a serious discussion going on.
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:08.100]   So it was a really heartening event, I thought.
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:13.500]   I'm trying to find an example of this new Facebook news format.
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:20.780]   There is an instant articles Facebook account that they curate.
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:24.860]   I haven't signed up because I can't because I have Android.
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:30.780]   And publishers choose individual news articles that they want to host within the Facebook
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:31.780]   system.
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:36.900]   And on launch day, The New York Times put a single article through instant articles.
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:39.420]   So it's not by any means ubiquitous.
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:41.340]   But it is beautiful.
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:43.580]   It's really quite a nice little CMS there.
[00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:44.580]   Is this one here?
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:47.180]   Thirteen steps to instantly improve your day.
[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:48.180]   This is from BuzzFeed.
[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:49.180]   Oh, you see it?
[00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:50.660]   I picked something kind of trivial.
[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:51.660]   I'm from --
[00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:52.660]   It's got cats.
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:53.660]   It's got cats.
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:54.660]   Nothing wrong with that.
[00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:55.660]   No.
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:58.940]   Swipe right and look at those ladies on their wedding day.
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:00.940]   And then you can use the tilt.
[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:01.940]   And you can turn it back up.
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:02.940]   Yeah.
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:03.940]   See?
[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:04.940]   Whoa, whoa.
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:05.940]   Okay.
[00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:06.940]   I never understood that UI.
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:07.940]   It's such a gimmick.
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:08.940]   It's just terrible.
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.260]   Okay, but see, here's the bride.
[00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:13.900]   And here's the groom seeing her for the first time.
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:14.900]   What the hell?
[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:15.900]   Right.
[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:16.900]   Right.
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:20.300]   He's behind the -- there's the bride.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:23.660]   And now what the -- you know what that would be useful for is a panorama.
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.540]   Yeah, that would be cool.
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:26.540]   Yeah.
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:27.540]   So here's the bride.
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:30.700]   And here's the groom seeing her for the sixth time he's biting his --
[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:33.620]   That is so BuzzFeed.
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:34.620]   Here's the bride.
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:35.620]   Ooh, BuzzFeed.
[00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:36.620]   And here's the groom.
[00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:39.140]   Here's the -- but no, I'm getting the groom before the bride.
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:40.140]   There's the --
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.460]   Are we going to have a groom and groom here anywhere or bride and bride books?
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:43.660]   No, no, come on.
[00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:44.660]   Hey, he's Asian.
[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.860]   That's diversity.
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:47.860]   This is a way.
[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:52.060]   Scroll down and watch this majestic beast who is living life the way she wants to and
[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:54.420]   doesn't even care the tiniest bit about your rules.
[00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:57.220]   Her name is Marnie and there's a cat.
[00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:58.220]   Oh, no, a dog.
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:42:59.220]   What is that?
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:00.220]   An animal.
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:01.220]   I don't know.
[00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:02.220]   What is that?
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:03.220]   I don't know what it is.
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:06.940]   Marnie seems to be listening to the left a little bit.
[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:07.940]   Okay.
[00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:10.860]   It looks like there's a lot of custom work involved with putting this together.
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:11.860]   How hard is this to do?
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:12.860]   Yeah.
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:14.500]   I mean, it doesn't work like a buzz.
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:15.500]   No.
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:16.500]   No.
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:17.500]   That's the CMS.
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:18.500]   The CMS.
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:19.500]   I'm told.
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:20.500]   I haven't seen it, but I'm told.
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:28.380]   Or these internet companies are asking publishers to spend time developing this particular version
[00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:30.540]   of this article for our app.
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:35.220]   The same thing the Snapchat is doing where they're asking a select group of eight publishers
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:40.700]   to create custom channels every day of content.
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:43.900]   That's why I'm arguing that we need that we publishers need to get together and cope
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:45.900]   with some open standards for embeddability.
[00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:48.940]   Because otherwise you're exactly right.
[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:52.740]   You're going to end up creating 20 stories and 20 platforms with 20 CMSs and 20 different
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:53.740]   business models.
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:54.740]   It's terrible.
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:57.340]   It's going to be a talk about fragmentation.
[00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:00.300]   Yet, the reaction from media people is predictable.
[00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:01.300]   I don't trust Facebook.
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:03.140]   They're going to be bad to us.
[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:04.340]   That's what Matthew understands.
[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:06.980]   We can't not deal with the devil.
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:09.380]   We can't not deal with this.
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:10.380]   Facebook's already there, folks.
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:16.220]   It's already presented up to 70% of clicks in traffic to news sites with a bad experience
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:17.820]   of having an open browser.
[00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:19.740]   So we're going to have to deal with going to where the readers are.
[00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:22.740]   We're going to have to deal with a new distributed world for media.
[00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:24.820]   A video figured it out and did it.
[00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:26.380]   Why can't the rest of media?
[00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:30.180]   Well, maybe it's Flipboard's job to make that happen.
[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:31.180]   That's right.
[00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:32.180]   It could be Flipboard.
[00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:33.180]   It could be Facebook.
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:34.180]   It could be a startup.
[00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:37.660]   I worked with a startup that unfortunately died and called repost.us was brilliant in
[00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:39.220]   embeddability.
[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:41.220]   There's a lot of players who could be doing this.
[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:46.180]   Well, but if you say Flipboard, then it reminds me of something like Zinnio, which was a magazine
[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:48.860]   platform that magazines can put themselves on.
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:51.860]   The reason you go to Facebook is because that's where the readers are.
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:52.860]   It's not the platform.
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:55.940]   No, but I'm just saying in terms of creating a standard, they have the technical know-how.
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:58.100]   They've done some incredible technical things.
[00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:01.940]   They need to convince Facebook and Snapchat everybody to actually use this.
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:02.940]   I mean, this looks good.
[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:03.940]   I got to say that.
[00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:04.940]   It's great.
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:05.940]   It's just too...
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:07.740]   I just said it's dangerous because it's Facebook.
[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:08.740]   They're going to screw this.
[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:09.740]   You're getting in bed.
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:12.460]   Well, no, you see, that's my point.
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:17.100]   I think we have to get past that because there is an effort at serious dialogue now in negotiation.
[00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:19.700]   The problem is that we are in a position of weakness.
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:23.580]   We're in a slightly stronger position now because they want to make friends.
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:26.900]   My answer to everybody who says, "I don't just trust Facebook," because I say, "Okay,
[00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:27.900]   fine.
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:30.900]   Give me the business terms that would make you do this deal."
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:34.580]   If you make people sit down and give you the business terms, and a lot of people just won't
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:36.700]   do it because they just keep on saying, "Repeating to get it again.
[00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:37.700]   I don't like them."
[00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:38.700]   Well, that's not...
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:40.500]   That doesn't work anymore.
[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.180]   You can't say that anymore.
[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:46.780]   Now, we may not come to business terms when we disagree, but that's the level at which
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:48.420]   we should be having this discussion now.
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:50.700]   It sounds like they got there in this first round.
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:56.260]   They got to some very favorable business terms where these nine select publishers that they're
[00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:59.820]   working with.
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:10.660]   Sarah Fryer at Bloomberg Business did an interesting article about this deal she did the math
[00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:16.380]   and found that the average age of these nine publishers that Facebook is working with is
[00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:17.380]   107.
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:19.380]   That includes BuzzFeed.
[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:20.380]   Wow.
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:22.380]   BuzzFeed brought the average dental.
[00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:25.980]   It brought it down quite a bit.
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:30.660]   It's interesting because a lot of these technology companies, they try to get into the...
[00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:36.380]   They work with Vox and Gawker and some of these new media companies, but Facebook took
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:41.140]   a different approach where they hand selected these old Venner applications.
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:44.580]   Of these are publications by Facebook, not the other way around.
[00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:47.100]   Well, Facebook also included BuzzFeed.
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:49.100]   BuzzFeed was alone youngster.
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:50.100]   Yeah.
[00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:53.900]   And then the rest is Atlantic and the New York Times.
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:54.900]   Are you right?
[00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:55.900]   Yeah.
[00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:56.900]   Oh, no, you're right.
[00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:57.900]   I'm right.
[00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:58.900]   I'm right.
[00:46:58.900 --> 00:46:59.900]   Seven.
[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:03.500]   But Google's deal was only with old publishers in old Europe.
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:04.500]   Right.
[00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:07.300]   So, it was a big deal time, whereas Facebook went with some brand...
[00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:10.500]   They find that nature stuff from National Geographic's popular on Facebook, it kind of
[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:11.500]   fits.
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:13.900]   BuzzFeed will do anything to get the traffic there.
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:17.220]   The Guardian and the New York Times, it was a very, very big deal.
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:22.020]   This is very inside baseball, but built, which is the largest paper in Europe, a tabloid,
[00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:26.500]   is owned by actual Springer, which has led to the war in Europe against Google.
[00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:30.660]   And the fact that built, signed up for this Facebook deal is a big deal.
[00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:32.660]   Mm.
[00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:35.900]   More importantly, you played a lot of "Wearwolf."
[00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:36.900]   I didn't.
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:37.900]   I didn't.
[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:38.900]   I refused.
[00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:40.900]   That is a fun game.
[00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:42.820]   I should have everybody else had fun.
[00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:43.820]   It's really fun.
[00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:44.820]   You should play it.
[00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:50.380]   The convenience was so metaphorically convenient because that's been the mood of technology
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:53.460]   versus media is mistrust and killing each other.
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:54.460]   Yeah.
[00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:58.180]   And now the key to "Wearwolf" is being a very good liar.
[00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:59.180]   Yes.
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:00.180]   Yeah.
[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:02.620]   About who's the "Wearwolf" and who's the "not"?
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:08.580]   Google's going to take itself driving cars into the public starting this summer.
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:12.460]   You'll be able to see the Google self-driving cars driving around Mountain View.
[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:17.180]   I mean, it's not like, and it's not going to be these Lexuses with the LIDAR on the roof.
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:20.940]   It's going to be the funny little cars that look like the Tonka cars you had when you were
[00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:21.940]   a...
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:24.460]   I would hate to take a tour in one, wouldn't you?
[00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:25.460]   Yeah.
[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:28.540]   Well, I'm sad because they're putting a temporary...
[00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:31.780]   The real ones don't have any steering wheels, accelerator, or brake.
[00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:35.900]   But to reassure people, they're putting a human in there and a temporary accelerator
[00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:39.540]   brake and steering wheel so that if you see these driving around, you don't go, "Oh, my
[00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:40.540]   God, actually..."
[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:42.020]   Actually, it's a little more complicated than that.
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:44.820]   So all the testing they've done is at Ames, which is federal land.
[00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:45.820]   Right.
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:47.220]   And the rules for California don't apply.
[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:51.020]   And the rules for California are saying that to get their autonomous licenses, they need
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:52.420]   an accelerator, brake, and steering.
[00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:53.700]   So they put those in for California.
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.260]   So it's not just temporary.
[00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:57.980]   It's until they can tweak the laws, okay?
[00:48:57.980 --> 00:48:58.980]   Yeah.
[00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:02.140]   As you know, I call a lot of automotive stuff, too.
[00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:03.140]   I don't know.
[00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:07.340]   I think it's interesting to see how people will take to seeing these on the road.
[00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:08.900]   Well, this is smart, right?
[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:09.900]   Yeah.
[00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:10.900]   I mean...
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:12.900]   This is a way of getting those little cars out there.
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:13.900]   Yep.
[00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:16.100]   It's all about PR at this point.
[00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:24.900]   I think if I'm a purely rational point of view, humans are terrible drivers and shouldn't
[00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:27.380]   be allowed to pilot vehicles.
[00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:33.500]   If all the cars on the road were autonomous, there would be, I think, far fewer accidents.
[00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:36.980]   There would be far fewer traffic jams.
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:37.980]   It would be...
[00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:41.780]   There'd probably be fewer cars because you wouldn't need to own a car as necessarily.
[00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:44.020]   You just call when you want one.
[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:45.020]   Right.
[00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:47.460]   With special purpose cars is what's interesting here.
[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:48.460]   Right.
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:53.940]   Well, I remember talking years ago to somebody at Google who was doing autonomous vehicles
[00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:59.900]   who said, "What this really is all about is eliminating car ownership."
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:04.100]   Because if you've got a fleet of autonomous vehicles of all kinds, and you could just
[00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:09.020]   push a button, by the way, now I understand why Uber's worth $50 billion, if you could
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:12.980]   just push a button on an app and an autonomous vehicle would show up, would take you to where
[00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:13.980]   you want to go.
[00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:15.140]   Let's say you're going to go camping.
[00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:20.700]   It would take you to the high Sierra where an autonomous RV would be waiting for you.
[00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:22.460]   I wrote about this.
[00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:23.460]   What would Google do?
[00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:28.700]   And it was exactly this idea that if you became a get you their company rather than a sell
[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:33.660]   you a car company, that you want to go out in a date, you come with a Mercedes.
[00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:34.660]   Right.
[00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:37.900]   You know, pick up the kids, you come with a minivan, you want to go camping, you get
[00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:38.900]   a camper.
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:39.900]   It's crazy.
[00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:44.020]   We all own multiple cars that many of which just sit in a driveway or a garage and don't
[00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:45.020]   get used.
[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:48.340]   So, from a purely rational point of view, this all makes sense.
[00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:51.860]   From an emotional point of view, they've got a lot of splaining to do.
[00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:53.260]   They've got a lot of PR to do.
[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:55.580]   They've got a convince legislators.
[00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:59.340]   They've got a convince users who's going to be the first person to get in a car with
[00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:00.340]   no steering wheel.
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:01.340]   Break.
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:02.340]   I'll do it.
[00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:03.340]   I'll do it.
[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:04.340]   Really?
[00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:05.340]   Would you go over?
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:08.220]   Okay, Jeff, would you go over a bridge in one of them?
[00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:09.220]   No.
[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:10.220]   All right.
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:12.940]   Well, in the very end, that's severely win.
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:13.940]   Thank you.
[00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:17.140]   So, Jeff doesn't want to go on a bridge with a car with anybody.
[00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:18.940]   Jeff, tell us why no.
[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:21.260]   No seriously, tell us why no.
[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:22.260]   Why not?
[00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:23.260]   Because I'm bridge phobic.
[00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:24.260]   He's phobic.
[00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:25.260]   Okay, that's fair enough.
[00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:31.580]   But you would trust the car, the Dolph I car, the Dolph I outy that went across.
[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:32.580]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:35.260]   The story said that when they were scared, they were scared because when it hit like
[00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:38.660]   the Ben Franklin Bridge, the car is confused by metal.
[00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:40.260]   Oh, wow.
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:43.940]   You know, I covered that car, it's South by Southwest, actually.
[00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:45.900]   And I was wondering if they're going to make it problem free.
[00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:47.820]   I already took them several days though.
[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:51.020]   There have been accidents, but according to Google in every respect, when the Dolph
[00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:54.100]   I car had an accident and when it's according to Google, according to Google that they
[00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:56.540]   were all human caused errors with quotes.
[00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:57.540]   Yeah.
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:00.100]   All, all errors in the world are human errors.
[00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:01.100]   Yeah.
[00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:04.420]   That's what the robots will say to us when they started limiting your the error.
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:06.260]   My friend, you are the air.
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:07.260]   Poon.
[00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:08.940]   Are we machines will kill you?
[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:09.940]   That's right.
[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:10.940]   You are error machines.
[00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:11.940]   We are not.
[00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:12.940]   That's the.
[00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:19.820]   I don't think most people would argue with the logic that machines could perform better
[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:23.860]   than humans in a normal scenario.
[00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:24.860]   Normal scenario.
[00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:30.860]   The fear is that you'll have like a Siri moment and your car will just like, you know, drive
[00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:32.860]   off the road or an Apple Maps.
[00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:33.860]   I agree with you.
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:36.460]   I think like I really think they need some manual controls.
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:40.660]   Look, airplanes today fly almost completely autonomously.
[00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:41.660]   There's pilots from there.
[00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:42.660]   There's still pilots.
[00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:45.900]   And the pilots are in there to land and take off because those are the critical phases of
[00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:46.900]   flight.
[00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:50.500]   I don't see why you can have manual control.
[00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:56.500]   Like look, the semi that was launched by Daimler this past week or 10 days ago now in
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:58.180]   at the Hoover Dam.
[00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:06.980]   The first autonomous semi that is legal, road legal in Nevada and, you know, it's Freightliner,
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:08.460]   Daimler company.
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:12.300]   And that thing is really clearly designed to just cruise along on the highway and its
[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:16.820]   lane autopilot follows the lane, follows the cars in front of it.
[00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:21.140]   But as soon as it needs to get off the freeway or pass something, it gives control back to
[00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:22.140]   the driver.
[00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:25.340]   Elon Musk has talked a lot about this where he sees it.
[00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:26.340]   Yeah, the blinker is the thing.
[00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:29.220]   It should be autopilot, not self driving or autonomous.
[00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:30.620]   I think he's right though.
[00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:36.260]   I mean, people need to think about it in that context where planes have it and it's a good
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:40.820]   thing to rely on when you don't, when you can't focus 100% on the road at all times.
[00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:48.420]   But you still need people there to help out if the vehicle is in a, you know, a lot of
[00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:49.420]   traffic.
[00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:50.420]   That's actually not complicated.
[00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:51.420]   This is 2020.
[00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:52.420]   That's the previous one.
[00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:55.620]   Look for Freightliner self autonomous truck, Nevada.
[00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:59.020]   I did, I did, I did, but I like it.
[00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:03.420]   If you just got auto blog or Jalopnik, they have lots of coverage and gadget covered.
[00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:04.420]   That's interesting.
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:07.740]   You raised another interesting point here is that I'm thinking about this is that it
[00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:13.620]   says the autonomous car, the autopilot car has to know whether the cars around it are
[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:15.460]   driven by humans or computers.
[00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:18.660]   Because if it's computers, it can go closer and they can communicate.
[00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:20.780]   If it's humans, it's, oh, stay away.
[00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:22.780]   They're idiots.
[00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:23.780]   Yeah.
[00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:24.780]   Yeah.
[00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:31.260]   And, you know, I think road work is a situation where, you know, there's detours and like,
[00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:33.420]   you know, it can't rely wholly on the map.
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:36.260]   But I know they've got those infrared sensors and stuff on the top.
[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:40.060]   It looks like there's certain situations where you're driving and really think about it.
[00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:45.060]   But it's that it would be quite complicated for a computer to figure out.
[00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:51.380]   Now, now Jeff, would you be willing to jump in these and run around the town and a big
[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:52.380]   truck?
[00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:53.380]   Anything.
[00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:54.380]   Actually, I'd rather be in a big truck.
[00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:57.020]   At least if I tangled with somebody I'd win.
[00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:58.020]   I...
[00:54:58.020 --> 00:54:59.940]   But I like the idea of the autopilot.
[00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:00.940]   You've talked to me down.
[00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:02.180]   I thought this would be cool.
[00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:03.180]   Yeah.
[00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:07.780]   But here's what Google says, we didn't put a steering wheel in there because people freak
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:08.780]   out, they make mistakes.
[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:10.700]   It's better to say you're out of luck.
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:12.020]   You just go for the ride.
[00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:13.020]   But that's what...
[00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:16.700]   And to let them take control because they do dumb things.
[00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:20.260]   Somebody in the shower masking, we started talking about this, well, who would you trust
[00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:22.460]   in black ice or eight inches of snow?
[00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:24.460]   And I trust the autonomous car.
[00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:25.460]   Yeah.
[00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:26.460]   But it's the deal...
[00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:28.700]   We think we're better drivers than we are.
[00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:31.300]   Google software has been super buggy forever.
[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:32.300]   Yeah.
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:33.300]   Like...
[00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:37.660]   Well, like that guy, the hacker who said I hacked into the entertainment system on the
[00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:41.660]   plane and then I was able to get it to turn right.
[00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:42.660]   Wow.
[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:45.580]   I refused to read that before I got it late.
[00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:46.580]   That's like...
[00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:47.580]   Anyway.
[00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:49.820]   I think that's an interesting story.
[00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:54.380]   It hasn't been confirmed although apparently the FBI is investigating.
[00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:56.620]   His name is Chris Roberts.
[00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:58.780]   He's with One World Labs.
[00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:03.460]   He says he's a security researcher.
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:07.100]   He says he got on a flight last month on United Airlines.
[00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:08.260]   Ha, United.
[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:10.140]   Oh, I think it's probably just...
[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:11.540]   I don't think it's the airline.
[00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:12.540]   Just making fun.
[00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:13.540]   Okay.
[00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:14.540]   Okay.
[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:15.540]   And he says...
[00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:16.540]   I don't know what services on United.
[00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:17.540]   I defend United.
[00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:18.540]   Don't we don't use what services again?
[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:19.540]   So I hope you can...
[00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:20.540]   He says...
[00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:24.860]   He told the FBI during an interview in February he had hacked the inflate entertainment system
[00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:32.420]   on an airplane, overrope code on the plane's thrust management computer while flying.
[00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:36.580]   He was able to issue a climb command and make the plane briefly change.
[00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:38.580]   Of course you can imagine how the pilots go.
[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:39.900]   To one engine.
[00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:40.900]   So it was also...
[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:41.900]   Yeah.
[00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:45.740]   I find that hard to believe because I don't think these things are interconnected on airplanes
[00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:46.740]   today.
[00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:49.340]   I would think there'd be an aircap between the entertainment system.
[00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:50.340]   You would certainly think.
[00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:53.700]   Because the entertainment systems are so awful when I was on the plane today.
[00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:54.700]   And it kept crashing.
[00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:58.060]   The guy sitting next to me was a deadheading flight attendant.
[00:56:58.060 --> 00:56:59.820]   And he kept on trying to reboot the system.
[00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:00.820]   Oh great.
[00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:02.460]   You see the reboot go by.
[00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:04.260]   It's like MS-DOS.
[00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:05.260]   It's Linux mostly.
[00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:06.260]   Usually.
[00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:07.260]   I don't know.
[00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:08.260]   Well it depends.
[00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:09.780]   I saw Linux because I saw a little tux penguin.
[00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:10.780]   Yeah tux penguin.
[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:11.780]   I'm Virgin America.
[00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:12.780]   I'm Virgin America.
[00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:14.740]   They use Linux on there.
[00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:15.740]   The red.
[00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:17.860]   It doesn't make me feel any better about the whole thing.
[00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:23.060]   He says he obtained physical access to the network through this seat electronic box.
[00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:26.980]   So if you're sitting in the right seat you'll actually see the box that is holding the
[00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:28.860]   system there.
[00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:31.900]   These are installed two to a row on each side of the aisle and the passenger seats on some
[00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:32.900]   planes.
[00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:39.380]   He removed the cover by wiggling and squeezing the box attached a CAT6 ethernet cable to
[00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:42.180]   the box plugged in his laptop.
[00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:43.180]   Nobody knows.
[00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:44.180]   Nobody saw this mid-flight.
[00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:47.420]   The guy was like wires hanging off of his seats.
[00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:49.180]   No I'm just fixing the plane.
[00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:50.180]   Don't mind me.
[00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:51.180]   Don't mind me.
[00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:52.180]   He then used to...
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:53.180]   You know what?
[00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:57.380]   The passengers, if he said oh no I'm here to upload some new movies to the flight entertainment
[00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:58.380]   system.
[00:57:58.380 --> 00:57:59.900]   They go oh yeah go ahead please.
[00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:04.900]   He used default IDs and passwords to gain access to the in-flight entertainment system
[00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:08.860]   and from there was able to get into the rest of it.
[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:12.380]   Reaction in the security community of the new revelations in the affidavit have been
[00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:16.620]   harsh according to why I'm saying it's easy.
[00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:21.180]   First of all they're shocked that he attempted to tamper with a plane while flying.
[00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:26.140]   I find it really hard to believe but if that is the case he deserves to go to jail, said
[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:31.300]   Jamie Blasco director of Alien Vault Labs in a tweet, "You cannot promote the true idea
[00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:35.460]   that the security research benefits humanity while defending research that endangered hundreds
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:38.820]   of innocents.
[00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:42.260]   My biggest concern said Roberts is obviously with the multiple conversations I have with
[00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:43.780]   the FBI.
[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:46.100]   I'm obviously concerned that these were held behind closed doors.
[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:48.100]   Apparently they're no longer private.
[00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:49.100]   Oh sorry.
[00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:54.420]   Oh gee his privacy was violated.
[00:58:54.420 --> 00:59:01.660]   Anyway, he's been this guy has been investigating security for he says for six years after he
[00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:05.940]   got a hold of flight manuals and wiring diagrams for various planes.
[00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:08.820]   This is what hackers do, they get the manuals and they start to but you don't want to do
[00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:10.540]   all the planes in flight okay?
[00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:13.780]   He's got to be on the do not fly list.
[00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:16.740]   Oh yeah, now he's slowly.
[00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:17.740]   That guy's screwed.
[00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:20.820]   What's that cat six cable in your bag?
[00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:21.820]   Yeah.
[00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:22.900]   No kidding.
[00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:24.820]   How long now before the TSA says?
[00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:26.460]   Yeah water and cats.
[00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:29.820]   Cats if you've got cat six cables we have to.
[00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:30.820]   Oh no.
[00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:31.820]   You're a cop.
[00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:32.820]   I know that we all use them.
[00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:35.500]   I always bring them along just in case I need one.
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:38.900]   As soon as they're in the cable I see in your bag there you're going to have to remove
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:39.900]   that.
[00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:48.620]   When I flew in New Delhi I had my one plus cable which is really pretty and what was
[00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:49.620]   this?
[00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:50.620]   What is this?
[00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:51.620]   What is this?
[00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:52.620]   You speak court.
[00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:53.620]   He said oh that's cool.
[00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:54.620]   Oh okay.
[00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:55.620]   Okay.
[00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:56.460]   All right.
[00:59:56.460 --> 00:59:57.460]   Yeah.
[00:59:57.460 --> 01:00:05.220]   He did tweet about it so I think his protests that the FBI released the dialogue is making
[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:09.860]   a little hollow his tweet find myself on a 737800.
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:13.620]   Let's see a box IFEI CE Satcom.
[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:18.740]   Should we start playing with the e-cast messages pass oxygen on anyone?
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:19.740]   Smiley face.
[01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:25.180]   The thing in his favor on that tweet is that nobody can understand what he's saying.
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:29.180]   So the thing if you understand what he's saying is that's terrifying.
[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:31.740]   I actually understand what he's saying.
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:34.780]   That's terrifying.
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:35.780]   I don't know.
[01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:39.780]   Although deploying the oxygen message is not as bad as turning the plane because there's
[01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:44.180]   a limited amount of oxygen on the plane and so if it was talking about I don't think
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:46.620]   he's even talking about turning on the oxygen.
[01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:50.220]   Oh just putting up the message on the console in the cockpit.
[01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:51.220]   Oh yeah.
[01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:53.860]   To see if the pilot comes running out.
[01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:54.860]   Hey.
[01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:58.780]   Oh anyway.
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:02.620]   But that is germane to the autonomous car thing because of course there will be people
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:04.420]   who will attempt to.
[01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:06.500]   I mean I'm not actually not that worried about that.
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:12.100]   I'm more concerned right now about the reliability and stability of these systems without a
[01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:17.140]   steering wheel and controls to back up in these fringe situations that Mark described
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:18.140]   like construction zones.
[01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:23.260]   Like I mean look I'm the first one to trust computers but I also do believe that this
[01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:25.580]   is like going to take a while to really get sorted out.
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:28.980]   I mean Google's been making smartphones for a lot longer than they've been making cars
[01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:32.100]   and they still can't make one that doesn't reboot every once in a while.
[01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:33.100]   Exactly.
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:34.100]   Now I'm scared.
[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:40.020]   And phones I mean Apple is the same like you know it doesn't matter who you pick here.
[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:41.020]   Yeah.
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:42.120]   No you're right.
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:46.540]   If there's software there's human error and if software is controlling your car.
[01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:50.460]   Okay see I was all excited about this now I don't want to ever do it.
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:52.660]   I think autopilot let's go pass the autopilot.
[01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:53.660]   I don't mind that.
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:55.220]   And eventually when we come to the auto pilot.
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:56.220]   But that's not fun.
[01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:57.220]   I can't have a nice meal.
[01:01:57.220 --> 01:02:00.620]   I can't read a book because I got to keep my hands hovered.
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:02.620]   No no it'll give you a few seconds.
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:03.820]   And it'll come to a safe stop.
[01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:06.900]   The truck will come to a safe stop if there's no human intervention.
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:08.420]   That's the false they fail safe.
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:13.020]   Yeah what I understand about just auto pilot is it's over do most things for you and then
[01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:15.820]   it'll you know you can intervene pretty easily.
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:20.340]   But I think what is this is going to have the impact of increasing distracted driving
[01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:23.020]   because you're now going to say I don't have to worry about it so much.
[01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:24.260]   Look I'm driving.
[01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:28.780]   I do what you're but you're expected to be there paying attention.
[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:35.980]   I I used the self parking thing on a Ford Ford car to crash into a car behind me.
[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:36.980]   No really.
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:38.980]   Yes you did.
[01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:40.780]   It was fortunately on the Ford test track.
[01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:41.780]   There's video of it.
[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:42.780]   Oh that's right.
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:43.780]   That's right.
[01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:45.820]   I was a self no it worked fine.
[01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:47.780]   Is this a pearl parking thing?
[01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:53.180]   Yeah so we were on the for we were doing a thing with for we were on the Ford test track
[01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:57.220]   and I and it said okay now he said we're driving along and they've had all these cars
[01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:58.220]   lined up and said.
[01:02:58.220 --> 01:02:59.220]   All right.
[01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:02.780]   There's a space up there so put on the press the button that says look for space.
[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:07.820]   So I'm I'm saying okay and then the like the thing goes big when it passes a space I can
[01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:12.180]   fit which is a big car and I said okay and he said now press that button and take your
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:14.780]   hands off the wheel.
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:16.580]   So the wheel goes there it is.
[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:18.260]   So there you found it but that was quick.
[01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:19.260]   Thank you.
[01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:20.260]   Okay.
[01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:21.260]   So watch this.
[01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:23.260]   Go ahead and turn the audio.
[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:26.300]   So so it's going to see that space is going to look for that space.
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:31.580]   And then you just I just follow instructions and watch my hands are off the wheel.
[01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:38.140]   The wheel goes and see that it's a parallel parking me and it does it does a perfect
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:40.460]   job with one exception.
[01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:45.900]   They didn't mention that once your parked put on the brake because you're still rolling.
[01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:47.580]   Oh well that's not.
[01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:53.500]   But that's my point is you trust the system and then you forget that you still have responsibility
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:55.100]   for a three ton vehicle.
[01:03:55.100 --> 01:04:00.220]   And there's the engineers in the back and the car I ran into laughing at me.
[01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:04.580]   I think every automaker should be required to submit their autonomous software to the
[01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:05.580]   Leo test.
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:08.820]   Yeah I want to try and if I can't crash it.
[01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:12.900]   Oh I was so embarrassed.
[01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:18.780]   But you know I felt like they set me up because they were they were sitting in the car laughing
[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:19.780]   at me.
[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:24.340]   So I feel like they maybe they said they neglected to say oh and Leo when you parked put your
[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:28.540]   foot on the brake and turn off the car because it's still rolling you know still idling right.
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:31.060]   Yeah why would they just have a brake automatically.
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:33.420]   Well that's what I thought it's done.
[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:34.420]   I'm here.
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:37.820]   So here's a question is this still drunk driving if the car is driving itself.
[01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:40.940]   Oh well that's another thing right.
[01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:46.940]   If it's driver assist you drunk programmer how about that drunk and drunk programming
[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:49.380]   drunk programming high on weed.
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:53.500]   I'm just saying that the human is the is the weak flink here.
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:58.060]   So this whole idea of oh well don't worry it's just going to be driver assist.
[01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.060]   That's dangerous too.
[01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:05.020]   Well so Mark as you said as a punch line but Google hasn't made a perfect phone yet but
[01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:08.180]   who is more imperfect Google or humans.
[01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:11.460]   It's really at some point it's a risk mitigation question.
[01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:14.380]   Yeah I mean that's that's Google's argument for sure.
[01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:17.820]   I mean I am excited about the prospects for autopilot.
[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:22.700]   I just I haven't fully come around to know I'm scared.
[01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:23.700]   You made me scared.
[01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:24.940]   I'm not going to do it now.
[01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:25.940]   Sorry.
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:27.740]   Our show today.
[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:28.980]   By the way great panel.
[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:29.980]   Love it.
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:30.980]   Jeff Jarvis.
[01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:33.820]   He's slumming from this week in Google.
[01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:36.860]   Buzz machine.com the city university of New York where it teaches journalism.
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:38.060]   I'm trying to stay calm.
[01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:39.340]   I'm trying to stay in that twit mode.
[01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:40.340]   You didn't get angry.
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:41.340]   I'm not in a twit mode.
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:43.540]   I'll find something to get you angry.
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:44.540]   Uh oh.
[01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:47.980]   Also here Mary M. Schwar tank girl at T.N.K.G.R.L.
[01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:48.980]   Hello.
[01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:55.700]   Peace out tankgirl.com and of course from Bloomberg Business Week in their global coverage.
[01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:57.620]   Bloomberg.com/globaltech.
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:58.620]   It's Mark Millian.
[01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:00.260]   Great to have you all.
[01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:02.860]   Our show today brought to you by Linda.com.
[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:05.220]   By the way congratulations Linda.
[01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:08.780]   Known Linda Wyman since she started Linda's and before then when she was writing books
[01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:12.700]   on web design we used to have her on the screen savers.
[01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:17.500]   Right about then she started about 10, 11 years ago she started Linda.com.
[01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:20.540]   The ultimate online learning platform she's done such a great job.
[01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:26.260]   Over 3,000 on-demand video courses beautifully produced.
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:31.380]   Complete with courseware with transcripts so you can search the text of the transcript
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:34.380]   and find exactly that point in the video.
[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:36.020]   And video is about every subject.
[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:37.580]   What is this?
[01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:40.460]   Fixing large rips, tears and other damage?
[01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:42.020]   Oh in Photoshop.
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:43.020]   Okay.
[01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:44.020]   Okay.
[01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:46.540]   Now I understand.
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:50.620]   They've got great courses for photography for Photoshop but also developing if you want
[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:53.180]   to be a programmer developing apps and Swift.
[01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:57.580]   When new programs come out they work closely with the software companies so that they have
[01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:03.260]   day and day the training for the new software.
[01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:07.860]   They already have of course called up and running with Apple Watch, exploring photography,
[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:14.660]   exposure and dynamic range, building a mobile app with AngularJS and iconic, that's the
[01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:17.420]   state of the art, that's the latest stuff.
[01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:18.420]   Code clinic is great.
[01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:25.860]   If you've not done the code clinic stuff there are new installments now in JavaScript CR and
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:28.220]   Swift.
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:31.500]   Watch and learn from experts who are also great teachers.
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:36.500]   People who are working in the field stream thousands of video courses on demand on any
[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:37.500]   device.
[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:39.380]   Learn at your own pace.
[01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:42.260]   You can watch them from beginning to end if that's what you like or you can watch little
[01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:44.260]   bits and pieces.
[01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:47.220]   The nice thing about Linda when you pay for a subscription you don't pay for a course,
[01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:51.540]   you pay for the whole site so you can dip in anywhere you want.
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:54.140]   I love that.
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:55.380]   I want you to try Linda.com.

[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:15.260]   We love Linda and I know so many people who teach at Linda.
[01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:16.260]   Some of the best people.
[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:20.500]   Many people bid on our network including of course the fabulous Bert Monroy.
[01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:23.140]   You've got to see his Photoshop stuff.
[01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:29.620]   Lindalynda.com/twit2 for a free 10-day run-of-the-place trial.
[01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:32.380]   So this is going to be for the next couple of months.
[01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:35.780]   We've got Google I/O coming up in two weeks.
[01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:37.860]   I'm still not invited.
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:38.860]   You're not?
[01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:39.860]   We only got two passes.
[01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:40.860]   No Jeff, look.
[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:41.860]   It was like this.
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:44.980]   When I was in Engadget, of course I was invited.
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:48.220]   You know I kept a very strong relationship with the PR people there.
[01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:50.780]   I still know them very well, Lilly and Co.
[01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:54.980]   But they just don't, you know, they just say that they don't have invites and I just
[01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:55.980]   don't buy it.
[01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:58.780]   They told us two for per publication.
[01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:00.500]   Two per publication is fair enough.
[01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:02.420]   I wind separately.
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:05.340]   And so we got the two for Mike Elgin and Jason Hall.
[01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:06.340]   They'll be going.
[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:07.340]   Cool.
[01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:08.340]   Jeff is coming out for that.
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:10.820]   So we're going to do a twig the day before because it's Thursday, Friday this year at Google.
[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:11.820]   You never know.
[01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:13.140]   I might still get invited the last minute.
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:17.260]   Last year, last year I just got an invite in my inbox randomly.
[01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:18.260]   A few days before.
[01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:19.260]   That's a nice one.
[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:20.260]   Wow.
[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:21.260]   Wow.
[01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:22.260]   Somebody.
[01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:23.260]   Why do you go to Google?
[01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:24.260]   Isn't this just a developer conference?
[01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:25.260]   Why do you care?
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:29.020]   I care because it's an opportunity to play with the products and those features first
[01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:33.860]   to be close to the Google crew so that you can ask them questions in person as a journalist
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:35.020]   that's very important.
[01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:37.300]   And also, you know, it's a networking opportunity.
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:39.500]   You're in person out of conference.
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:46.860]   You get to see other journalists and tech pundits and, you know, basically talk about
[01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:48.340]   stuff and catch up.
[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:51.220]   We also get a makeshift protest that last year's keynote.
[01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:52.220]   That was entertaining.
[01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:53.220]   What were they protesting?
[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:54.220]   That's right.
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:56.260]   There was some Kevin Rose.
[01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:57.260]   We hate you Google.
[01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:58.260]   You're taking over.
[01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:02.900]   No, this is a I think those people were in front of Moscone Center with signs.
[01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:04.340]   This was some woman snuck in.
[01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:05.500]   Oh, is she yelled?
[01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:06.500]   She yelled.
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:09.460]   I guess there was like a Google lawyer who was buying up a bunch of real estate.
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:16.980]   And the city and so security.
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:17.980]   So that might be fun.
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:21.820]   Remember a couple of years ago, Sergey Brin parachuting in.
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:22.820]   Jumped out of an airplane.
[01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:24.820]   Yeah, that was great.
[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:30.260]   That was the was that glass that was the big that was the debut of glass.
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:33.780]   Oh, how how that's fitted off into nothingness.
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:38.060]   I feel like Google has learned a little bit of a lesson that by giving away these expensive
[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:42.540]   items, they drew in a bigger audience than they wanted of people who were really only
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:43.540]   lucky lose.
[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:44.700]   You're trying to get free stuff, right?
[01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:45.700]   Yeah.
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:47.700]   So that's why they won't let you in.
[01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:48.700]   Probably.
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:50.900]   No, I think it's odd.
[01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:54.740]   You know, if you don't get in, come here because we're going to cover the keynotes as
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:55.740]   we always do.
[01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:56.740]   Sure.
[01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:59.740]   I decided I could have said, oh, no, I want to go.
[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:04.220]   But no, we're sending Mike Elgin, our news director, Jason Howell, who's the host of all
[01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:06.620]   about Android and the producer of this show.
[01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:10.180]   And then I and Gina Trippani, who's not going, will anchor.
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:12.940]   I think Aaron Newcomb will join us maybe.
[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:14.940]   I believe you're so happy to join you.
[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:17.020]   You want to come up if you don't get in half hours.
[01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:18.020]   Yeah, for sure.
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:19.020]   Two and a half hours.
[01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:21.580]   It's going to know, are they doing the two day thing again?
[01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:22.580]   No, it's all in one.
[01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:25.020]   Two and a half hour, you know, one massive.
[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:26.020]   Yeah, one massive.
[01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:27.780]   Go to the potty before it starts.
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:30.060]   Starting off hours is an optimistic view.
[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:31.060]   Yeah.
[01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:34.140]   Like the keynote Larry Page will just show up and talk for like two hours.
[01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:37.980]   Like so Bill was like, it was three hours and saying, you know, we debated whether to
[01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:38.980]   cover that.
[01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:42.820]   And I'm glad we didn't because the first hour and a half was like not of it was like, what
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:43.820]   are you talking about?
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:45.340]   It is boring.
[01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:47.580]   But but Google will make this interesting, right?
[01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:48.580]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:53.020]   I'm looking forward to hear some Chromebook news and some Google Android where news.
[01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:55.540]   What do you think the Chromebook news will be?
[01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:58.980]   I want to finally be able to run Android apps in a in a tab.
[01:11:58.980 --> 01:11:59.980]   They're very close to that.
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:00.980]   Standard APKs.
[01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:03.100]   That's not that's not far off.
[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:04.100]   That'd be awesome.
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:05.540]   Kind of there, but it's not really there.
[01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:07.260]   I want to see it like really.
[01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:08.260]   Just did that.
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:09.260]   Didn't you Jeff put Skype on your.
[01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:11.220]   Yeah, boy, that worked well.
[01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:13.500]   It didn't it didn't work out.
[01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:15.060]   No, that's too bad.
[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:16.060]   Grapple.
[01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:18.620]   Yeah, but there's no official way to do that yet.
[01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:20.660]   And so that's not too hard to do.
[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:25.580]   Although isn't Android arm and aren't well, some Chromebooks are arm, some are Intel.
[01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:26.860]   Yeah, that doesn't matter.
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:29.140]   Doesn't matter because it's all in Java.
[01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:33.180]   I think the Intel ones will just emulate the right the Dalvik stuff.
[01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:34.780]   Oh, you need a Java or art.
[01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:36.780]   It's a Dalvik Java or whatever it's called now.
[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:37.780]   It's art now.
[01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:38.780]   Art, yes, thank you.
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:39.780]   I don't know.
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:42.460]   I think Google has always been an interesting conference for 10.
[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:48.100]   So I find it is just kind of an internal rant about being in the media, finding it weird
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:50.580]   how they're trying to limit who can attend these days.
[01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:52.540]   Well, it's a developer conference.
[01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:54.900]   Now, I have to say last year wasn't all that.
[01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:55.900]   Did you go last year?
[01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:57.340]   Wasn't all that interesting.
[01:12:57.340 --> 01:12:58.340]   Yeah, no.
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:12:59.340]   No, but Apple smart.
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:03.140]   See, they do a developer conference and after the keynote, they kick all the journalists
[01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:04.140]   out.
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:05.140]   That's how you do it.
[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:07.740]   If it's a developer conference, a Dalvik conference.
[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:10.020]   All right, so who does the best one?
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:14.380]   You have F8, you have Apple, you have Google.
[01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:15.380]   Apple does the best.
[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:16.380]   I mean, they've been doing it for--
[01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:17.380]   They still do the best.
[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:18.900]   I think Apple's are the best ones.
[01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:20.380]   Who has the best donuts?
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:21.380]   Oh.
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:22.380]   I'm just kidding.
[01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:24.180]   Microsoft used to because of Ballmer.
[01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:25.180]   Clearly, a donut.
[01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:26.180]   Ballmer was a donut guy.
[01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:28.180]   He's happy now.
[01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:32.220]   Apparently, he's running up and down the court at the Clippers games like he used to.
[01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:36.460]   Hey, not as happy as Forstall, who is now doing plays in Broadway.
[01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:37.460]   Yeah.
[01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:38.460]   What?
[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:39.460]   You have never heard of that?
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:40.460]   Scott Forstall is doing Broadway plays.
[01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:42.860]   Scott Forstall is directing Broadway musicals in plays.
[01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:44.580]   Oh, man, the ego of that, man.
[01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:45.660]   That just shows you.
[01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:46.860]   I could do anything.
[01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:47.860]   That's right.
[01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:48.860]   Because I'm Scott Forstall.
[01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:50.860]   I invented the freaking iPhone.
[01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:51.860]   Have you heard of it?
[01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:56.500]   By the way, the Clippers lost, so Ballmer off to take it a break for a while and come back
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:57.500]   next year.
[01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:01.940]   We did a cover story on Forstall several years ago and one of the revelations was that he
[01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:06.500]   was like a star in his school play.
[01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:07.500]   Oh, so maybe he is.
[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:08.500]   He was always the star.
[01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:09.500]   Maybe he's better at this.
[01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:11.500]   That's why he was so good on stage at those events.
[01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:12.940]   He just had that stage presence.
[01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:13.940]   Yeah.
[01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:16.460]   That's why he likes neuromorphism so much.
[01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:21.380]   He was the green beige, green velvet guy.
[01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:22.380]   Yeah.
[01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:23.380]   The wood wood.
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:25.780]   God, that's so glad we're past that.
[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:26.780]   Wood grain.
[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:27.780]   I am so glad we're past that.
[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:31.740]   The only place there is for that is like the urbane where you have the watch faces
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:33.100]   that really have to look out on.
[01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:34.260]   Everybody tells me that that urbane.
[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:37.060]   I wore it and everybody said it's ugly, but ugly.
[01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:38.700]   It's kind of big and I stopped wearing it.
[01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:41.140]   I still think the 360 is the hottest thing.
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:42.140]   Look at it.
[01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:43.540]   Your being has the newest dandroid.
[01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:45.420]   Look, this is an E3 watch face.
[01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:46.420]   It's pretty.
[01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:47.420]   It's good.
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:48.420]   It's pretty.
[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:49.420]   I don't know.
[01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:50.780]   I think the Apple Watch is very nice.
[01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:53.180]   Dvorak says this is the new fascist salute.
[01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:54.180]   Apple Watch.
[01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:55.180]   What's your face?
[01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:56.180]   Yeah.
[01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:57.820]   Mickey just, no, I don't do Mickey.
[01:14:57.820 --> 01:14:58.820]   It's just a boring old.
[01:14:58.820 --> 01:14:59.820]   Kind of like your face.
[01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:00.820]   It's a simple face.
[01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:01.820]   Yeah.
[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:07.460]   You know, I don't feel like Apple Watch is either better or worse than Android Wear.
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:09.500]   They're just kind of the same.
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:14.340]   As a watch person, you know, having had been smart watches professionally for a while.
[01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:15.340]   You worked at Pebble?
[01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:16.340]   Yeah.
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:19.660]   I think that to me, they all do the same thing.
[01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:22.780]   They bring notifications to my wrist and make my life better.
[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:23.780]   That's all I care about.
[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:24.780]   That's all they really do.
[01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:26.580]   The rest is all the rest is the health.
[01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:27.580]   Yeah, the fitness and health.
[01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:30.180]   Can you adjust your hearing aid with your Moto 360?
[01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:31.180]   Not yet.
[01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:33.660]   There's an Apple Watch app for you.
[01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:35.620]   You could worry about that pretty soon.
[01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:36.620]   No, but wait.
[01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:37.620]   You could do it on Pebble first.
[01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:38.620]   The hearing aid.
[01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:39.620]   You can't adjust your hearing aid.
[01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:42.660]   They have an agreement with Sarti, the big hearing aid manufacturer.
[01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:46.580]   I have a friend who wears hearing aids, uses an iPhone app.
[01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:48.180]   This is actually quite cool.
[01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:49.180]   It's a start.
[01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:50.180]   It geolocates.
[01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:53.300]   So you can have a setting, say, for a restaurant.
[01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:56.820]   And when you get to that restaurant, it'll automatically change the settings because it's
[01:15:56.820 --> 01:16:00.060]   a lot of background noise and it'll change the frequencies and so forth.
[01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:03.020]   When you're at home and has a different setting, it's smart enough.
[01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:06.500]   And then you can do it all on the phone too.
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:08.100]   So you can really control it.
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:09.780]   This is interesting.
[01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:12.580]   This is, I guess, the same thing.
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:13.580]   It's a start key.
[01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:17.300]   Do they have hearing aids that pair on your phone and you can like switch over and use
[01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:18.300]   it as a Bluetooth headset?
[01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:19.300]   Oh, that'd be great.
[01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:22.840]   So on the start, what was really cool is that you could mix the music stream coming
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:25.180]   from your phone with the ambient.
[01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:27.940]   I tried hearing aids adjusted to flat, right?
[01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:29.660]   So that it was just like having any of your monitors.
[01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:31.420]   You can use this as a Bluetooth music.
[01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:34.820]   And so it's amazing because you can be having a conversation like right now and listen to
[01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:36.860]   music at the same time.
[01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:37.860]   Wow.
[01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:38.860]   Just what I want.
[01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:39.860]   I know, right?
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:42.940]   People can't apparently have difficulty going through life without having music at all the
[01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:43.940]   time.
[01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:44.940]   Trust me, not.
[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:47.540]   You can't go anywhere without music in the back.
[01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:51.540]   All I'm trying to say is that people with hearing aids are now enhanced.
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:52.940]   They can do more than we can.
[01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:56.340]   They can throw their phone across the table and have that microphone pick up the sound
[01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:58.380]   and bring it to their hearing aid.
[01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:00.180]   That is what reading is called.
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:01.180]   It's bionic hearing.
[01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:02.180]   Yeah, it is.
[01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:04.620]   It's like Daredevil, but for hearing.
[01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:05.620]   Yep.
[01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:06.620]   Wow.
[01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:07.620]   That's what I need.
[01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:08.620]   A Daredevil app.
[01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:09.620]   Yeah.
[01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:10.620]   I can hear a heartbeat.
[01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:13.420]   Imagine two is, goes to Google.
[01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:14.420]   Last territory.
[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:18.380]   But imagine if you could get directions around your house from your hearing aid.
[01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:19.380]   You're blind.
[01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:20.380]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:21.700]   I mean, it's getting there.
[01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:22.700]   We're going to get there.
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:24.860]   10 left, 10 left.
[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:25.860]   Coffee table.
[01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:26.860]   Coffee table.
