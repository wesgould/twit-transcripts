[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   This is Twit, this week in tech, episode 20 for August 28th, 2005.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:29.600]   [Music]
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.400]   Well, this is our, this is our cast of characters it looks like, and a mighty fine cast of characters it is.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.800]   On Skype, again Steve Gibson, this is our by the way, the last Skype Twit.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.800]   Because next week we're using Google Talk, right?
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.800]   [Music]
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.000]   Yeah, Steve and I use Google Talk for security now and it sounded much better.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   You can't conference with that now, can you?
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   I mean, multiple, yeah.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Can't conference.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.600]   So Steve is on Skype as well as Robert Herren, who couldn't get to work today.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.200]   Thank goodness, so he's able to, to, to, to, to, to, with us.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.200]   He's telecommuting, right?
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.200]   He's telecommuting.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.800]   I sent emails off.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.800]   I'm on VPN.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.800]   I've been there all day.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.800]   It looks like you're there.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.800]   It looks like you're there.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.200]   People are asking me to go out to lunch and I'm like, I'm not in the building.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.200]   Oh, you shouldn't say that.
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.200]   You just say, oh, I didn't, I have so much work to do.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.600]   I better stay in my cubicle right now.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.000]   Patrick Norton, who is not at work today.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Did I say that?
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Yes.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.800]   David Cracker is in studio with us producing the, are you?
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.000]   No, in a special capacity with and kind of have producing.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.800]   And David and Kevin are here today, along with Keith, who they're doing a little system.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.960]   Yes, we are.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.040]   We wanted to, there's been so many people out there that want to know how podcasting
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.200]   works.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.400]   And I'd have to say when it comes to the most complex setup, you could possibly have for
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.400]   podcasting.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.400]   Stupidest setup.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.640]   It has to be Mr. Leo LePort with Twitch.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.840]   There's no stupider setup, but it's all going to change.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.760]   None of the listeners though realize what you go through before you start recording the
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.240]   show every week, Leo.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.760]   One time I'm going to accidentally put out the pre-show instead of the show.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.560]   You'd have to bleep a lot.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.800]   Yeah, they'll hear me going right, right, right.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.800]   It's all because of Skype.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.360]   It's all because everybody's coming in different ways and it's just a complicated thing.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.960]   It's going to be so much easier next week.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.320]   We are going to be live in the Apple store downtown San Francisco, one Stockton.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.120]   We'll start setting up at three and we'll do the show at four.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.040]   And then everybody will have a microphone.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.720]   Everybody will have headphones.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.720]   We'll be able to see each other.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.280]   It's going to be a much better.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.280]   I think a much better Twitch.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.120]   Although Devorak, who's not with us today, he's afraid it's going to look like a CES panel
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.840]   and be just about as exciting.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.320]   I don't think that's the case.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.760]   Well, we'll find out.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.960]   Do you think there'll be plenty of interactions still?
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.880]   I don't think we're going to start saying the future of the Internet.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.600]   Does everyone's personality?
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.520]   Is it going to be a more of a roundtable or everyone sitting in a table facing out?
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.680]   No, it'll be more of a roundtable.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.760]   We're not going to have no concessions to the audience.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.760]   Half of us will have our backs to the audience.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.760]   Excellent.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.440]   And we'll all be fighting for that.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.320]   I want my back to the audience.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.320]   Stories today.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.320]   Hot news.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.960]   Anybody, Robert, you had some interesting LCD stuff you wanted to talk about.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.560]   Tell us a little bit about what you've been up to.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.920]   Well, any seat just announced at SIGGRAPH earlier this month, a new display that they're
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.120]   coming up with that uses LED backlighting instead of compact fluorescence, which are typically
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.280]   used in an LCD display.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.840]   And the advantages of basically taking a red, a blue and a green LED to generate that white
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.160]   light is a few things, a few great benefits.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.280]   One, it stabilizes the display quicker.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.440]   So when you turn it on, they claim within a minute you'll be able to have that in its
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.560]   working condition rather than say the 20 to 30 minutes for a regular display.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.560]   Wait a minute.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.720]   It takes only a 30 minutes for a regular display that for the normal color balance to finally
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.040]   settle in and stabilize.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.640]   You shouldn't be watching your LCD TV for 30 minutes.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.280]   No, most people aren't going to wait.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.120]   I mean, for televisions, you know, it's not as critical.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.280]   But if you were going to say, "Pay somebody to professionally calibrate that display for
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.760]   you in your home," you definitely want to let it warm up for half an hour.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.520]   Is that true of computer displays too?
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.080]   Well, CRTs is really where you really have to wait a while to warm up for the days.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.400]   And remember, they're worse than LCDs.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.400]   Sure.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   Sure.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.840]   The phosphors take time to warm up or I'll at least quote unquote, stabilize.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.320]   You're saying 30 minutes, not 30 seconds, 30 minutes.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.760]   No, and it could take literally up to two hours, depending on the environmental conditions
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.760]   in the room as well.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.760]   Hang on.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.760]   It was a lot colder.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.760]   It was longer, right?
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.760]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.040]   So, if I'm a graphic professional and trying to get really accurate color results, I shouldn't
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.560]   be letting my monitor turn off at all.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.040]   I should just leave it all the time.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.000]   No, or at least have it maybe on a timer of some kind or a floor in the hallway.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.920]   Although then you have the reverse problem, which is that the fluorescent tubes are the
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.520]   things in the LCD panels that do ultimately have a short lifetime.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.520]   Totally.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.320]   That's one of the first things to go.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.080]   So these LEDs will warm up faster.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.280]   They won't burn out as fast.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.280]   How about the color accuracy?
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.280]   Is it pretty good?
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.280]   Well, with traditional backlighting for an LCD, you're talking roughly, if you compare
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:16.200]   it to how the NTSC color standard for television production, you can get about 70%, maybe 75%
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.560]   of the color gamut that is used in NTSC.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.840]   Now, with LEDs, they're claiming that they can't and everyone's pretty much in agreement
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.840]   on this.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.440]   They can surpass 100% of the color and actually produce a greater color range than even that
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.600]   is used to TV right now, which is terrific.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.160]   If you're an editor for that kind of thing, or even more important, this particular display
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:44.560]   I didn't see is bringing out is also carries a pretty steep resolution of 3,200 by 1,200,
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.120]   which I believe they're aiming this more toward medical imaging where a doctor would really
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.120]   be.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.120]   It's more important for grayscale, especially if you're looking at something like X-ray
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.120]   picture.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.920]   But if you are getting into any kind of color representation for medical technology, you
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.160]   definitely want accurate color to make either a proper diagnosis or just to make sure what
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.080]   you're seeing is what you're supposed to be seeing.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.320]   3,200 by 1,200, you'd be able to do 1080p really easy.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.320]   Oh, definitely.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.800]   Which is only 1920 by 1080.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.800]   My God, how much is that going to cost?
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.800]   And I wonder if they care at all about power consumption.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.800]   Is it going to be a lot less because it's LED?
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:22.080]   Hey, it's a $6,500 display, so it doesn't really matter how much power it consumes.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.360]   Actually it should be more efficient in terms of, you know, what compact fluorescence have
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.360]   come a long way.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.600]   That's a very mature technology.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.160]   They are very efficient as far as light goes.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.760]   And odds are, depending on how many LEDs are used in the backlighting system, it could
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.920]   actually consume more energy.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.640]   But it's more about A, you're able to recreate.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.560]   You know how it is?
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.280]   For different white points, you know, the color of white has to be a standard as well,
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.480]   depending on if you work, say, in photography or television or PC displays.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.320]   They all have different white point temperatures.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.400]   And with this display, you actually have a variable temperature where you can pretty
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.920]   much set it anywhere you want or prefer it to be on the fly even.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.080]   Are they white LEDs in the background or is it red, green and blue?
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.120]   Odds are they're using an RGB system where they use a red, blue and a green.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:14.000]   In that way, they can either cycle through all three of them at once or individually
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.120]   tweak one or the other in real time to match whatever standard you're trying to go for.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.960]   And other technologies would be like 10-bit internal color processing, which is important
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.280]   to eliminate rounding errors when you're trying to, say, resolve an image that's even
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.040]   greater resolution than what the display is physically capable of.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.720]   Sometimes you run into like dithering errors when it's trying to map that a large image
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.800]   onto a relatively small resolution.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.640]   But in this case, it's...
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.440]   You'll think we see the LED TVs in the future, near future?
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.440]   You know what?
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.000]   They're supposed to be out already.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.120]   And I think it seems to be the biggest problem was getting LEDs of the similar brightness
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.560]   and being able to dial in an array of them to control a similar brightness.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.240]   So you have even luminance behind the manufacturing tolerance.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.240]   Right.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.240]   That's amazing.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.240]   Totally.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.880]   And I know they've worked on ships recently to where they can then simply put each LED
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:14.240]   in front of a little photo measuring device and just dial in each one to a specific setting
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.240]   in lock it there.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.240]   But that's...
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.240]   How about LED projectors?
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.840]   Because what were they talking about LED powerpoint projectors in the near future?
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.840]   Already.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.960]   A couple of weeks ago, I was at a Texas instrument toy tour, they called it.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.600]   And Mitsubishi was there with their pocket projector, which is a very interesting new
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.040]   device.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.600]   It's literally the size of a jewel case, a scene of a jeweler case.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.200]   We're giving away at the next project.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.200]   Yeah, pocket projectors.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.400]   I ordered them, by the way, I'm all worried because I ordered them.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.800]   I don't know if I'll get there in time, but we'll have them at least for the September
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.000]   18th, if not by September 4th.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.840]   But it's one of those things where it takes, you know, they have to print it.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.920]   Those are going to be collectors items I have.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.040]   I didn't, you know, I just said it just has a little twit guy and it says twit.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.680]   It doesn't say a date or anything like that.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:01.600]   Well, I would put a date, but then I thought if we have extras, I don't want to...
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.320]   We can hand write dates on them.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.320]   We'll sign them.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.120]   There's lots of room for autographs.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.120]   We've VIIV.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.360]   It's the new Intel processor.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.240]   We kind of knew they were going to do that because they trademarked VIIV a while ago,
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.640]   but everybody was speculating what was VIIV?
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.320]   You know, the Roman numeral 64 for 64-bit computing.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:26.080]   Well, it's the new Intel and they say it rhymes with Strive.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.680]   They announced that the Intel developers formed.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.040]   Anybody, Patrick, did you read up on this?
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.680]   Any thoughts about it?
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:38.560]   Oh boy, the general reaction was this is the least or the best leaked secret in computing.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:43.520]   Yeah, that was the first reaction I heard from a lot of people and nobody expected them
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.720]   to not release until the end of 2006.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.040]   So it's going to be a long time before it shows up.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.640]   They're saying now, first quarter, 2006.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.600]   That's what they were saying.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:10:00.280]   Then they changed their message since everybody did their briefings three days ago.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.720]   They were saying end of 2006, second half of 2006.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.720]   Oh.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.720]   Sorry.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.720]   We'll have to check that.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.680]   So either that or they gave bad information to the guys.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.080]   Probably not.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.080]   I'm processing reviews.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.840]   Let me see where I read that.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.360]   I thought I read it in one of the articles about that.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.360]   But holding that.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.320]   So it won't be for another year.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:28.640]   Basically, you're looking as far out as the end of 2006, but second half of 2006.
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.640]   They're dual core.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.640]   65 nanometer.
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.160]   They're working on dual core.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.160]   They're pretty heavy.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.000]   They're in full board mode on the.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.960]   It's all about processing power per watt as a thousand interesting sound.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.960]   As a new metric.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:49.760]   As the new metric for it, which is pretty much in lockstep with the presentation Steve Jobs
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:55.880]   did at the Worldwide Developers Conference when they announced that they were going leaving
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.280]   IBM and moving into Intel's processors.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.600]   Here's maybe the source of the confusion.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.440]   VIVE will be launching in the first quarter of 2006.
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.400]   Maybe the ships won't be.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.920]   It's just the brand is launching.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:12.960]   Because a scene that says, quoting Dom McDonald of Intel Digital Home Group VIVE launches in
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.000]   the first quarter of 2006.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.600]   One feature of VIVE, this sixth kind of interesting, is automatic transcoding, ensuring that audio
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:26.120]   or video encoded in one format will be automatically transcoded without user intervention.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.480]   So you'll get a DIVX and it'll automatically transcoded to AVI.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.480]   I don't know.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.960]   Why would you want to do that?
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.680]   Well, because it's confusing for consumers, they download video and they can't watch it
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.200]   until they have the problem with codec.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.200]   Yeah, the transcoding.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.200]   I don't know.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.200]   It sounds like a good idea.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:46.200]   You can't remember Intel had so much success with the Centrino, which was not the process
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.200]   of the ship.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.200]   It wasn't a ship.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.200]   Yeah, it was a tie-in.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.200]   It's smart.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:56.080]   You got to tie into a ginormous, huge advertising campaign if you used an Intel product.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.320]   That's what the end of Intel chips said and an Intel.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.800]   And this is the important one, the Intel 8.0, that's what basically, it's a trifecta
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.800]   for Intel.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:12.880]   They make a ton of money and then the notebook vendors got to tie into the advertising campaign.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:19.200]   Yeah, the VIVE technology, this is basically Intel finally deciding to embrace on a high
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.280]   profile level the idea of a consumer entertainment PC.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.280]   It comes out.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.280]   That's the whole point of VIVE.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.360]   Dual-core processor, you get a chipset, a network, cruise a network controller as opposed
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.360]   to the Wi-Fi.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:34.520]   Well, this is more stuff like VIVE is more like, "Hey, there's going to be a remote control.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.080]   It's going to have cutting-edge technology along with the dual-core processor."
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.520]   It requires Windows Media Center.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:44.840]   So, I mean, obviously, instance shutdown and startup, that's cool.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:45.840]   So that's...
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.880]   It's always going to do it on the regular platform.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:53.560]   I was confusing that then with an actual product.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.760]   So the marketing term rolls out sooner than the actual...
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.080]   Than these new processors.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.360]   The marketing term "Sentrina" worked on me and I knew exactly what it was, but I still,
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.200]   if I see an notebook that says "Sentrina," at least light goes on in my head because
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.280]   at least I know that it's got a penny a month and it's got wireless and still to this day
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.440]   you see that logo and you're like, "Oh, it's got to be better than half the other...
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.120]   A lot of the other stuff that you see anyway."
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.120]   It means you've been well-trained.
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.920]   Well, you know, I'm probably foolishly.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.720]   I and I know we all spend a lot of time trying to explain to people, "Oh no, it's just marketing
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.720]   market."
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.720]   You know what?
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.000]   It does make it easier for somebody to buy and it's...
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.240]   Gosh, it's hard when you go into the store to say, "Well, I need this laundry list of
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.240]   things."
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.880]   You look for one brand, you say, "Oh, "Sentrina, oh, oh, five.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.880]   That's good."
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:34.880]   Yeah.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.480]   But the problem is that in a lot of cases, there's a lot of successful marketing campaigns
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.640]   that are pointing at awful products that you shouldn't spend your own money on.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.640]   Well, I agree.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.240]   Have they started talking yet about the naming convention they're going to use for these
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.240]   chips?
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.200]   I mean, I want a standard.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.680]   There's got to be a standard.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.680]   It's driving me crazy.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:54.920]   I would have liked to say anything like the 8057A or no.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.920]   It's just right now just...
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.120]   I don't remember anything very clear.
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.240]   That actually would be an interesting story to follow up on.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.560]   Well, I'll give you an example.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.680]   It's a new video display processor.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.040]   They're calling the O+MN301.
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.040]   Yeah, but that's a...
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.040]   It fits right into the line.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.320]   People are buying those or people are...
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.920]   Yeah, integrators.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:19.040]   So there's Yona, which is a laptop single-core processor.
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.760]   That comes out the first half.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.000]   That actually is really interesting.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   That's the new notebook processor.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.600]   Is that the code name or is that the actual...
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.600]   That's the code name.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.600]   That's the code name.
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.600]   It's out of Israel.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.600]   So they're using...
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.600]   It's Yona is the book of Jonah.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.480]   Yeah, well...
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.360]   So tell us about that.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.480]   What's interesting about that, Patrick?
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.480]   Not too much.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.880]   I mean, part of what was interesting about that is that for the next generation of the
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:43.280]   desktop chipsets, a lot of it's coming out of the Pentium App, which is coming out of
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:48.320]   the Israeli design teams that have been doing the low power, high efficiency stuff.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:52.600]   Yes, so then it's going to be that plus a dash of the 64-bit stuff that's going on
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.600]   here in the States.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.600]   And what's interesting is they keep saying that net burst architectures definitely in
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.040]   there, but nobody seems nowhere at what level.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:06.840]   Have you noticed too that as they talk about power per watt or performance per watt, that
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:12.600]   it almost quietly slips in that these chips not only do they offer shorter pipelines, but
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:17.320]   as far as processing through the process itself, but it won't allow it to scale up as
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.320]   high as far as gigahertz.
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.320]   That's right.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.320]   And that's how they keep it cool, right?
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.320]   And so they can turn out to be slower parts.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.440]   Well, that's a high-end situation, say like gaming.
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.160]   But that's why you think they'd go dual core.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.160]   What's the point of dual core?
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.080]   Well, that's how Apple handled it.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.200]   When you get lower megahertz, you put two more.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.400]   But you're also talking about some of the specialised applications.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.400]   Great.
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.440]   You don't get any benefit in word processing.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.440]   I agree.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.440]   So then there's...
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.440]   Work gaming.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.440]   The successor to Yona is...
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.960]   Well, you could in gaming, Robert.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.840]   If somebody would write threaded games, but nobody's not.
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:58.000]   I'd take Carmack's take on that back at QuakeCon where he said basically for gaming in particular,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.640]   it's almost a...
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:03.760]   It's better to have a good out of order processor than to try to cram everything and being
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.440]   multi-threaded dual core.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.920]   Well, it works better for a gaming situation.
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:12.400]   In a way, you are multi-threaded already because you have a graphics unit which is taking
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:16.080]   some of the load off and you have a CPU which is doing the calculations.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.960]   You really are dual threaded for all of the...
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.960]   Without a doubt, graphics is the best case scenario for processors.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.960]   Both are processors.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.120]   That's exactly right.
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.120]   That's exactly right.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.120]   It's parallel processing.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:30.920]   But for everything else, I can't think of anything that would benefit from it in terms
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.000]   of the gaming world.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.760]   And that's the word that's coming out from a lot of people who design regular applications.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.240]   I mean, it's...
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.680]   You look at the cell processor and it's a great concept, but isn't this the same thing
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:45.680]   that everybody from the NSA to who knows who all else, massively multiple parallel
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.680]   processing.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.840]   Well, it's not exactly massively multiple parallel processing on the cell processor.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:56.080]   But single thread applications pretty much rule the desktop.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.240]   How fast is the word that you need to run?
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.600]   Next generation after Yona is SUSA man.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.120]   I don't know what SUSA man means.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.920]   Adds memory protection and dual processor because Yona is single core.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.400]   And that's really a server chip.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:17.520]   And then after that, you've got the Zions which are DP and MP, which are obviously dual
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:21.920]   or four or more processors respectively.
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.320]   The Dempsey is a dual core Zion.
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.760]   I'm just running through the roadmap here.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.560]   Just stop me if anybody wants to talk about any of these.
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.280]   There's a platform called Ben'sley.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.000]   You can see why you need a naming convention.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.200]   This is ridiculous.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.200]   But this is the way they've done...
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.200]   Now you remember some.
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.200]   You're talking about the stuff.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.200]   Your code names.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.200]   Your stuff we're looking at is all the code names.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.520]   And the other people who look at that are people like us or tweezers.
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:45.400]   They're like, "Oh, we're all sitting here planning when we're going to buy our next
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.480]   notebook and waiting to find out whether or not Yona is going to be a gaming notebook
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:53.680]   partner, whether it's going to be a standard notebook part, whether or not the multi threading
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.120]   and Windows XP will give us any decent kind of performance out of it so we can finally
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.000]   run a Skype phone call at the same time.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.480]   We have 42 windows open in Mozilla.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.640]   Tell me if this scares you.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:08.080]   This is a quote from Paul Gelsinger, general manager of the digital enterprise group.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:11.800]   They're touting something called active management technology.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:16.840]   We want to embed just a little bit of the IT manager directly into each piece of silicon
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:17.840]   we ship.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.120]   That actually sounds a lot more awful than it actually is.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.560]   I got to talk to this.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:28.960]   Now that actually what they're trying to do is bring more manageability into the chipset.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.520]   And there's some really good reasons for that in terms of how you handle and how you
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:37.880]   start foiling everything from spyware to doing secure transactions.
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:45.000]   There's a long way to go between Hither and Jan, but a lot of that's more like making
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.480]   life easier for people who are administering 50,000 desktops.
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.720]   Meanwhile Sony and IBM releasing more information about the cell processor obviously timed to
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.080]   coincide with these Intel announcements.
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.920]   I read it but it didn't seem like anything particularly new.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.080]   It's a multimedia processor.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.080]   We knew that already.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:08.600]   It's interesting to look at what Intel did with the new chip design where they've upped
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.560]   the bandwidth between the L1 and the L2 cache.
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:16.640]   The multi-core versions are going to share the L2 cache along with the power processing.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:21.400]   They also did a bunch of stuff where they shortened the pipeline.
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:26.960]   So they took chunks of Banyas and again unspecified portion of the penny and four of the net burst
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.960]   architecture.
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:32.800]   It's going to support 64 bits of 14 stage pipeline which should make branch prediction
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:38.520]   less, basically means bad branch prediction should be less brutal on the performance.
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.240]   Well they made a mistake with the pipelines.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.160]   I mean they went too long on the pipelines and they were having real trouble with that.
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.160]   I can understand why they're backing off that.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.920]   Although that lowers performance and theory, right?
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:50.920]   Well they also played around.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.320]   I mean it depends on how you look at it.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:59.200]   If every time you have a bad decision you have to throw out everything into the pipeline.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.480]   It requires optimizing compilers and recompiling your code so the branch prediction is more
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.480]   efficient.
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.520]   And apparently they do a bunch of work on the pre-frats and the branch prediction.
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:12.960]   Do you know if the L2 caches are being made larger still?
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.920]   I'm not sure that they talked too much about the size of the L2 cache.
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.920]   I'm going to think that it was scalable.
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:19.920]   I would predict it.
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.080]   Yeah well that's what they want because then they could keep chips with no cache or low
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.160]   cache.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.840]   But I would predict that they don't want to have too much L2 cache because it does speed
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.520]   up the processor but it also adds considerably the power and heat issues.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.880]   Yeah but I'm worried that if the cores are sharing a single L2 then you really start
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:40.440]   to see more like a hyper-threading lack of performance.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.440]   Right.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.360]   And then true separate core performance.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.840]   You've been saying that for a while Steve.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.200]   Yeah L2 cache is so important.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.000]   That's really the thing that makes a difference in the processor.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   More than anything.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.400]   Yeah it'll be interesting to see how it all turns out.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:59.680]   We've got an external motherboard dynamic memory is so much slower than the on-chip cache.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.240]   You just don't want to go out.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:06.440]   You know you've got to remember they're fighting a trench battle with AMD for the high end of
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.440]   the market.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:13.120]   Especially with the gamers and the power users which means they can't afford to give up a
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.840]   lot of performance at that end.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:18.080]   So I can't imagine they're going to shrink the L2 cache that much.
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:21.760]   This podcast by the way being recorded on an AMD FX64.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.960]   I just want to throw that in.
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.720]   A non centrino machine.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.920]   And by the way I'm not getting paid by AMD or Intel.
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.160]   Which apparently is a big mistake.
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:35.440]   Somebody was telling me that somebody who's intimately acquainted with not only this show
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:39.480]   but how much is kind of the going right out there for these kinds of things.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.800]   We can be making thousands of dollars a show if we accept it advertising.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:43.800]   Well many thousands.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.000]   Might want to change the model.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Nope.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.200]   Just give, just got to remind people that your contributions keep this show alive.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.120]   And when we're going live we're going to have some extra cost.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.720]   But that's all part of the plan.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.960]   Wait we're not paying for the booze bills.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:58.960]   And I'm sure you're right.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.120]   We are paying for the booze bill.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.760]   I'm sure you're right Leo.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.960]   You just don't want to start having ads.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:04.960]   No.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.080]   No, no, no, no.
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.080]   Cuts down 13.
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.320]   Have you followed this story?
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.320]   No.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.320]   Oh my god.
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:12.320]   These are complicated.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.320]   These are high school students.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.920]   They were given iBooks as part of the, you know, you go into the high school you get
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:16.920]   an iBook.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.920]   A lot of schools are doing that now.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.920]   In fact.
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.920]   They were locked down.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.480]   The protection on they were using I think apples.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.080]   You mean like you need an admin password to install stuff type of.
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.080]   Yep.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.080]   Kids said wait a minute.
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.080]   We want to install iChat.
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.440]   What good is a laptop without iChat?
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.920]   So they hacked it and put iChat on there.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.440]   They were charged with felonies.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.440]   Felonies.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.440]   Okay.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.440]   Okay.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.440]   Okay.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.440]   Let's let's let's slow down.
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.440]   Read the you.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:45.760]   There's a lot of really we actually got a letter from a student at the school and the
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.880]   student at the school and this was a while back.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:52.080]   The student at the school pointed out that there's pretty much every new agency that's
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:55.000]   covering this is having a different slant.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.360]   Most of them don't.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.560]   Most of them have very different interpretations of the reality going on.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:04.320]   I think one of the things that's interesting is one of the parents or maybe it's an uncle
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:09.920]   of one of the kids was decided that and this sounds like a pretty legitimate chunk of it
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.920]   was that the school went directly from you know some internal discipline to try to get
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.680]   the kids to stop because what they were doing is they're not just they're basically they're
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.480]   taking all of the browsing controls off of it.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.920]   They're installing extra software.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:25.800]   Supposedly there was also some messing around with other people's computers and some hacking
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:26.800]   of information.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.200]   That's where it starts to get fuzzy.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.560]   They told the kids to not do it because they didn't want them using you know things like
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.080]   chat in the classrooms and stuff.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:39.000]   The kids basically kept doing it and then rather than going to the parents and this is
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.640]   the stuff where I'd really like to you know hear a good local well informed reporter on
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:48.120]   this is instead of going to the parents they called up the cops and the cops basically
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.280]   what they had to work with was a felony charge.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:54.400]   I'm looking at the Associated Press article that according to the AP and again I don't
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.160]   you know that's all I always know so you might write this is completely wrong.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:02.640]   They were charged with computer trespassing computer theft after the school district
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:06.840]   said we tried detentions we tried suspensions we tried other punishments they continued
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.840]   to do it.
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.880]   But computer theft and computer trespass are felonies.
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:17.000]   Well the good news is they have dropped the charges they've offered them a deal I guess
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.400]   in which they'll drop the charges in exchange for 15 hours a community service a letter of
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.760]   apology a class on personal responsibility and a few months of probation.
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.760]   That's true they got their attention.
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:31.040]   Well they did although according to the attorney for one of the students a few are thinking
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:35.320]   about refusing the deal because quote they don't feel they've broken any laws.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:39.160]   But I tell you what if you're facing a felony charge which will ruin your life.
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.560]   Well they're under 18 though so they.
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.560]   I guess it would get expunged.
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:47.280]   So it would get expunged after you hit 18.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.680]   Why would you know about this guy?
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.320]   I have a couple little nicks here and there.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.440]   Just teasing I don't know anything.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:58.120]   I would hope they would take the deal although you know how it is when you're 15 years old.
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.280]   Yeah you do all kinds of crazy stuff.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.760]   Heck I'm not doing that.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:05.720]   How do you get some of the different computer trespass for simply installing an application?
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:09.080]   Well the thing is that they weren't just simply installing that.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:14.360]   That was what was passed on to us from a couple of the at least one or more of the students
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.040]   that were at Cutztown.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:19.040]   This is they were passed words.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.960]   And this is I mean they were probably pushing that.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.360]   Well the obtaining password part was really funny.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.240]   They were pushing it up but they think it was really funny.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:33.320]   It's the original IT passwords to lock down the notebooks were apparently written on a
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.280]   label that was put on each notebook.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.280]   So there's some pathetic security.
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:41.000]   Sounds like security that was being secured in my own high schools network way back in
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   the day.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.240]   Which is not existing.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.880]   And you know what I think maybe they should consider if you're going to hand out notebooks
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:51.840]   to students that are arguably modern and can be used in such a way.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.080]   Have them back in networks secured before you go doing this.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.280]   Well it does also like tempting.
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:01.840]   It also sounds like the school didn't have lots of IT savvy in order to sort of just
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.640]   rip no school does.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.960]   Just control back away from the kids after they knew this was a problem.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.240]   Instead they were using traditional approaches.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.240]   Detention.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.400]   It's a totally reactive.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.720]   It's like the breakfast club.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.400]   I got you next week.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.680]   I got you a week after that.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.680]   I own you.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.880]   Hey according to this AP reporter you there must have been someone who decided they wanted
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:25.200]   to be tech savvy because they said they they had remote monitoring function on some of
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.200]   these computers.
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.200]   So someone who.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.760]   That's right they turned that off because they were watching.
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.960]   But they said if the kids turned it off and then I don't know how they said they were
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.840]   going to do this and and used it to view the administrators own computer screen instead.
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.760]   Apple remote desktop is actually very cool if you it's expensive it's expensive program
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:44.520]   but if you have the administrator version you can see every screen they what it'll do
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:49.120]   is put 16 screens on your screen you can see every screen on your screen and watch what
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.200]   they're doing and it rotates through them.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.200]   So that's what they turned off.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.920]   So you can watch the teacher surf bar.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:57.480]   Yeah and you know what I would turn it off if you had this look at let's put yourself
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:01.880]   in the situation they give you an i-book you're 15 years old you have the skills to do it
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.560]   the passwords written on the label on the bottom.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.600]   Wouldn't you turn it off course.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.640]   First thing I'm thinking that's a little stupid because if you turn it off the teachers obviously
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.440]   you know that you're the one person in the room of 29.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.960]   Kevin would start feeding at somebody else's computer.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.840]   Yes I would create a separate profile and have that be the active of their viewing.
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.800]   I just just just feed it a sound of music video.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.800]   Yeah right I want to hear.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:29.040]   What's wrong with installing chat program I mean that's their computer right I mean
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:33.240]   in a classroom they're supposed to be there's supposed to be involved in the educational
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.240]   process.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.640]   Could be trading notes back and forth.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.520]   Every school class every school is different.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:38.520]   I almost said it.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:42.400]   One of the schools here one of the kids I know who goes to a high school here she was
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.880]   downloading music onto the computer every year they turn in the computer and they get
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:48.800]   a new computer for the next year it's not a new but they get a different computer.
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.200]   Because the heart is fills up.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:54.560]   Right so well that's the thing she said I lost all my music so she asked the minister
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:28:01.200]   can you give me my music back he said no.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:05.400]   What about this the voice over internet providers I don't know if you I use Vonage and Packet
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.400]   A.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.400]   But the FCC.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.200]   Yeah I've got urgent notes from both Vonage and Packet A.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:14.520]   Yeah please go online and sign this 9/11 thing because next week if you have voice over
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:19.000]   internet and you haven't signed this document saying I know the 9/11 sucks.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.640]   If you haven't done that they'll turn off your service the FCC is forcing them to turn
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.920]   off the voice service to all customers who haven't signed this informational notice.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:31.920]   Unfortunately you can do it online you just check a box which I've done.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:35.360]   Leo we are we even though it's sort of old news for us now since Wednesday we really ought
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:41.760]   to talk about Google talk a little bit just to make sure people know they can go to google.com/talk.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:42.760]   It's great.
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:47.920]   Get the new client for for online chat and voice voice connections.
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:52.960]   Steve and I use this for security now episode two and I thought it sounded better than Skype
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:53.960]   don't you Steve?
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.200]   It's a PC communication though right.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.320]   No conferencing PC to PC only.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:02.620]   We do also think it's out of deal over 9/11 is dealing with potentially where it can actually
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:06.640]   connect to an actual landline or a cell phone or a voice or a voice or a voice or a voice
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.760]   or a packet or a 8 or a call or a 5-minute.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:10.760]   But that's different.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.760]   That's a separate.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.560]   What's happened here Steve has brought up his bifurcated.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:16.480]   He's brought up a whole other story.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:20.680]   Let's finish the 9/11 story Steve and then we'll talk a little bit about Google talk.
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:24.760]   But I do want to warn people who are using Vonage or another voice over internet provider
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:27.240]   like that that provides a phone to phone connection.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.320]   You may lose your service if you haven't signed that 9/11 thing.
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.880]   Next week they're trying to get the FCC.
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:34.680]   The FCC actually extended the deadline September 28.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.360]   Okay because that's the last thing I saw was they were trying to get them to do that.
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.080]   So you have a little more time.
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:44.160]   But what isn't that an interesting attitude like well you know what happened is there
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:49.800]   was a pretty famous case where a woman was killed or something bad happened.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:53.880]   She tried to use 9/11 and had no access to it.
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.400]   The problem is you can have access.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:00.560]   I signed up for 9/11 on both systems.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.560]   But you tell it what address you're going to be on.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:06.200]   And because these things are portable I could throw up my suitcase and I could be in Canada.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.880]   If I call 9/11 they're coming to my house in California.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.560]   There's no power fail safe right?
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.560]   If you put it on.
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.920]   And that's what it says on the disclaimer.
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.680]   The information you have to sign.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.680]   Yes.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.680]   My broadband goes out 9/11.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:22.640]   Well the FCC has really strict regulations on I guess being able to get emergency services.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:26.200]   So even a cell phone with no service provider.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:30.200]   If you, well even a cell phone where you haven't paid any kind of bills or anything like that.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.040]   If you type 9/11 on it you're getting through.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.040]   Well that's it sure.
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:38.040]   Well that's also because most cell phones you buy nowadays have GPS receivers and they
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.880]   can actually figure out where you are or even use the cell tracking.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.720]   They can give rough tracking on the GPS.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:49.240]   But the other thing people most people actually use wired or they use wireless handsets inside
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.400]   of their homes right?
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.880]   I got trapped in an elevator in San Francisco.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:56.320]   The first seven numbers I called nobody could pick up because the power was out.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.720]   Which is why one of the reasons why when I have a landline in my house I always have
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:00.720]   a 70s era.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:01.720]   That's right.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.720]   Western electric phones.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:03.720]   That's right.
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.320]   Because those are powered by the phone company not by you.
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.320]   You don't have to plug them in.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:10.000]   Well isn't there a day when Patrick Norton came in late to work at Tech TV because he
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   was stuck in an elevator is this that time?
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   This is that time.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.960]   And the way and what's really I mean you want to talk about scary San Francisco law for
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:20.400]   all those little tiny elevators they put in the smaller apartment buildings.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:24.480]   They're required by they there's no manual weight unlike a big building elevator where
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.120]   you can slide the door back and undo the internal latch.
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.560]   Which is the only Patrick would try this but I'll go ahead.
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.160]   No I grew well I grew up in New York.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.560]   I lived in Jersey there for a while.
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:37.360]   Look the first time you get stuck in an elevator and somebody shows you how to open that door.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:40.280]   Yeah you know compared to spending two and a half hours singing it.
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.240]   We're not recommending this folks.
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.880]   Yeah we're not recommending this.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.480]   Weightless elevator is just a drift to the bottom floor.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.600]   Weight for security personnel.
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.600]   The uh rescue.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.840]   The problem is those with the with those little elevators in the small apartment buildings
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:58.640]   is San Francisco is they're required they're required by law to lock down the emergency
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:02.520]   access on the top of the elevator and the doors can't be opened from outside.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:06.720]   The only way you can get out is if you have a screwdriver to basically take the the locking
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.720]   latch off the inside.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:11.280]   And you have to be you have to have a screwdriver in the elevator with you?
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.360]   Well I happen to have one.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.640]   But what if you didn't?
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:19.680]   But if you didn't you're in there until somebody figures out a way to get you out.
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:23.000]   He would have been he would have been really late for tech TV.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.880]   It was actually it was actually really it was pretty spooky because the the internal light
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:31.200]   was barely functioning because of the battery was weak.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.880]   And there's you know there's a little tiny four inch portal it was actually the last
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.720]   time I used the elevator.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.880]   Did you guys hear about those elevator hacks that came out?
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.880]   Yeah that's cool.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:44.080]   I haven't been trying to use it but here it is it doesn't even go forward.
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.560]   Do you have the Otis the is it Otis elevators?
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:49.280]   If you please take a look at it if you be Otis in three or four others.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.880]   Yeah if you're on a floor and you want to bypass everyone else that's requesting an
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:57.240]   elevator yes you push the floor number that you want to go to and the closed door button
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:01.480]   the exact same time and it'll bypass it'll just go take you all the way to and that works
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.480]   in Otis elevators.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.480]   Yes.
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.480]   Awesome.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:08.960]   That is the best hack that is the best hack I've ever heard.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:14.080]   Yes I saw it on dig dig.com was it linking to Engadget?
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:17.520]   I thought without the four act we wouldn't have it.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:21.800]   I have the makeup for his that is awesome what a great hat.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:22.800]   It is cool.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:27.240]   Has it actually tried it because they had a similar hack posted on that for crossing cross
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:31.120]   signals where you can actually push the button a certain way for the cross signal to have
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.720]   it change it's over to a walk symbol so you can just cross it.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.360]   Oh I saw that as well did you try that?
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:40.360]   I tried it half a dozen times and a couple of times I thought it might have worked but
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:43.080]   I think it was just the timing with the car sitting on the sensor.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:47.720]   Is that the urban dream to have control of you know these all of these annoying.
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.400]   Because both of them made it a felony now to use one of those.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:58.400]   Yes they have MIRT devices for changing signals and rightly so I mean if I'm in that ambulance
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:02.720]   I don't want to be self trying to get to the hospital you know and I totally understand
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.720]   that.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.720]   I do too.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:05.720]   Just not cool.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:11.040]   I love those kind of real world hacks though that's hacking the real world is much more
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.040]   interesting.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.920]   Have you been to life hacker.com that's kind of funny.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.400]   And there are a couple of good sites for that.
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:20.600]   What is it 43 things or 43.
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:21.600]   43 something.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.600]   43 folders.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:23.600]   Folders.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.600]   Has a lot of stuff like that in there.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.000]   Yeah I think I could stuff.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.280]   So now let's talk about Google talk because Steve and I used it for the first time and
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.680]   well came out Wednesday we used it on Thursday to do security now.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:35.680]   I was pretty impressed.
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:36.520]   Were you impressed with it Steve?
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:41.720]   I was extremely impressed and you know when I listened to the MP3 that you produced I
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:46.960]   don't hear any difference between the way you sound and the way I sound and you know
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.480]   we're 500 miles apart.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.920]   And Mark over the over the internet.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:57.680]   What I've learned about it since is that it does dynamically change the compression and
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:03.280]   if you see it can get scared if there's an interruption in the connection into lowering
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:08.320]   the data rate so that it increases compression lowers the data rate and then you start having
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.120]   that underwater sound.
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:13.840]   It didn't happen to you and me Leo we've got a great connection between our two networks
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.440]   is 28 milliseconds round trip.
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:23.360]   But it does actually start out optimistically and then lower the bit rate and increase compression
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.560]   if necessary.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.360]   It's really good quality I have to say.
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.480]   I mean it's just it's really remarkable.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.720]   It does have some disadvantages.
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.600]   I mean of course you can't have more than one person.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.880]   It's only right now Gmail to Gmail.
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.720]   And the lack of encryption.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:39.640]   Although apparently they plan to do encryption on it.
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:40.800]   I'm not impressed though.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.800]   The client sucks.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:42.960]   Well who really needs it?
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.920]   I mean there's a million checklines.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:51.360]   The technology they're using for the voice stuff is not even their own technology.
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.800]   It's done by a company called Global IP Sound.
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.080]   So why are they doing it?
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:57.480]   They're just trying to rule the world I guess.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:01.280]   I mean I hope eventually they'll add a lot more features that will make it different.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.240]   But right now it's just a standard IM client.
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.240]   I mean it's not even that.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.240]   You can't send files.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.080]   It's not holding candle to my trillian.
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.080]   Yeah exactly.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.760]   Well yeah who do you want to own the world?
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:11.760]   MSN AOL Yahoo.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.760]   The one good thing though.
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:16.760]   And who else is using was it the Jabra back in for using Jabra?
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:17.760]   Right.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.040]   Which is the non standard source effort.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:21.840]   Which is nice and hopeful.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:25.400]   Well it's a non standard Jabra in the sense that you can't do Jabra to Jabra.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.640]   Well it works with the Trillion.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:27.640]   Like I can work in.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:31.840]   But you have to have Trillion Pro or Trillion Plus to do the Jabra client.
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:32.840]   Yeah right.
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:36.080]   So it works with other third party clients but you can't do direct Jabra.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:39.040]   Did Jabra supposed to do some server to server point to point thing that it can't do?
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.040]   I don't know.
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.040]   Right.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:45.600]   What actually first bothered me is I wanted to be online with Google talk with Google
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.160]   talk except I use multiple Gmail account.
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:51.160]   So if I wanted to check log out one Gmail account and switch over to the other then it
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:52.160]   screws with the Google talk.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.160]   Right.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.560]   It was weird how to automatically added friends to your list for you.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:56.560]   It does.
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:57.560]   That you had been chatting with over Gmail.
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:58.560]   Oh yeah it's supposed to watch you.
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:36:59.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:02.080]   But if your Gmail activity adds your friends automatically it was weird.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.080]   There's a setting for that.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:06.880]   I think when you installed it too there was a check box to have it not do that if you
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.880]   didn't want to.
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:08.880]   I just click next next next next next next next next next.
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.880]   Yeah right.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.520]   That's the value add that Google can offer though.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:15.360]   The VoIP technology is from where?
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.640]   Global IP sound.
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:21.040]   If you go into GTOC and then do a help about it will say it will say it will say it will
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.040]   say it right in there.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.040]   Cool.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:26.200]   Steve is looking for some form of super high quality.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.280]   You know it stands to reason.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:33.520]   I do the radio show over ISDN using 164 kilobits channel.
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:39.240]   It doesn't require that's enough for CD quality audio for high quality AC audio.
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.680]   Right but the ISDN line is a nice solid point point.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:43.680]   Perfect.
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.680]   There's no latency.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:45.680]   Right.
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:46.680]   There's no zero-lossage.
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:47.680]   Yeah.
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:52.480]   But it stands to reason that if I have a 6 megabit connection that I should be able
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.080]   to somewhat duplicate that.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.120]   So Steve's been looking for something that will do this.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:59.320]   Yeah you're talking about going over the cloud.
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.640]   Well I understand.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:04.120]   But the internet for those of you who don't understand what I'm talking about.
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:07.200]   If I only need 64 good kilobits over the rainbow.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.280]   That seems like I should be able to get that.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:13.440]   Yeah well it all depends on which way your packets get routed or if you have any quality
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.280]   of service, any Q and Q and Q.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:19.240]   Well the Skype and other voice over IP clients we've messed with.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:22.760]   It seems like once you get above three people in the conversation that's where things really
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:23.760]   start to break down.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.680]   And it's because of the upstream bandwidth cap.
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:26.960]   That's what really kills us.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:27.960]   It works well.
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:28.960]   It's still.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:29.960]   Yeah it sounds good.
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:30.960]   We've got three right now.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:31.960]   It's as good as anything.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:32.960]   Sounds good.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:37.600]   And the reason it works in here is because I have 768 up.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.600]   And so the more up you have.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:40.440]   Did you go business class DSO with that?
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.440]   Yeah.
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.440]   Oh you did.
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.440]   Yeah I'm a DSO extreme.
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:45.640]   And the CO is practically next door.
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:46.640]   It's like I'm not.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:47.640]   That helps too.
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:48.840]   Yeah it helps a lot.
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:53.160]   So but Steve have you found, I mean we found this one thing in England which is extremely
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.160]   expensive.
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.560]   Called Audio TX.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:02.680]   And the problem is it uses just a TCP transport instead of using a UDP transport which is
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.200]   really what you want.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:09.120]   So they're going over TCP meaning that they do introduce some deliberate delay in the
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:14.200]   connection to allow the underlying TCP transport to do the error correction and create the
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:16.760]   reliable connection for you.
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:21.640]   But I did experiment with it because they have a demo mode that runs for anywhere between
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:25.320]   five and thirty minutes and then it just drops your connection.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.680]   And it sounds spectacular.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:32.600]   But Leo what you and I did yesterday I thought was completely acceptable using Google Talk
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:36.520]   We'll keep doing that for you and me because there's only two of us and it works very well.
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:39.800]   Yeah it's strange I would think if you went TCP that would be worse.
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:43.240]   I mean I understand this error correction but if the problem does occur.
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:46.600]   If you get in that then if you don't get the ACK you have to resend and that's where
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:47.880]   you get all sorts of problems.
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:54.360]   Exactly and so in fact what I brought global IP sound up and I have been on this site in
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.360]   the last couple of days.
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:40:00.520]   So I did I rummaged around and I found them when I was doing the searching.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:07.520]   So in the case of TCP if you don't mind some latency between the endpoints then you know
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:13.520]   this thing was using it was using MP3 compression instead of a lower bit rate codec and that
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.160]   was really why it was working so well.
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:20.080]   Yeah and I forgot to say that we were running at 320 k bits instead of for example right
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:27.080]   now we're at about 46 because I'm monitoring the bandwidths that we're using for Skype.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:31.160]   What most of these guys are doing is assuming a bad network they're trying to improve the
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:35.960]   compression to the point where you don't need a perfect connection is that it.
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:40.360]   Well yeah in fact you and I have a different goal deal I would like to have a studio quality
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:43.520]   connection to you for the purpose of recording these MP3's.
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:47.680]   Well it's easy to buy an ISD inline and a $7,000 codec and you're set.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:52.080]   Exactly and whereas the goal of most people is just to have a free connection where you
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.080]   can understand the other person.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.080]   It's different there's a different.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:56.920]   You know and it's working I mean here we are with Skype and it works great with Google
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:57.920]   Talk too.
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:03.280]   Last again the last at least for a while I think the last Skype Twit because next week
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:06.440]   we're going to be live at the Apple Store at one Stockton.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.480]   I'm saying it again I just want to make sure somebody shows up.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:11.960]   I'm mentally afraid we're going to go there and there's not going to be anybody there.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:17.520]   That's September 4th 4 o'clock at the Apple Store at one Stockton and then following that
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:23.200]   at Noonan's Bar and Grill I know people show up because they've got booze.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:26.080]   And no Patrick I didn't get a deal with them to get the free booze.
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:27.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:30.680]   I've got all the black coffee you can drink though.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.840]   How about that?
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.680]   Well it's the miracle of a $5 to $20 tip.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:37.080]   You can usually get all the black coffee you can drink.
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.320]   It sounds like you're doing some right now.
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.320]   Go have a cup of coffee.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:42.880]   It's the top shelf lemon drop shorter than I'm afraid of.
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:46.040]   Well I figured you know de Vorex so worried that it's going to be a dull.
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.840]   He says it's going to be like a CES panel it's going to be dull because we're all sitting
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:49.840]   there.
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:53.000]   I think if you know we just get everybody drunk it won't be anything like a dull CES panel.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   It's worked for dignity.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.800]   Yeah and it's worked for that meetup that we did.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.200]   Yeah I wasn't drunk but everybody else was in the hammer.
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:05.880]   Yeah that would be really funny like lineup like what does each individual member drink.
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:06.880]   Lemon drops.
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.280]   Lemon drops for you.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.280]   40s for Kevin.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.880]   No no no no.
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:13.880]   Are you saying you have a beer guy?
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:14.880]   You have a beer guy.
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:15.880]   The 40s only for the broken.
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:16.880]   Yes.
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:18.920]   Well these 40s are a little.
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:19.920]   He's not a malt liquor guy.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:20.920]   He's a beer guy.
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:21.920]   Yeah I like beer.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:26.160]   We'll get you some of this dipsy barley wine.
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.160]   It's good stuff.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:31.040]   It's really strong stuff though like 8% and it doesn't look good.
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:34.440]   The term barley wine doesn't appeal to me but I'll have to try it.
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:35.440]   Just a.
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.600]   Dvorak's going to drink Bordeaux.
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:37.600]   We know that.
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:38.880]   Steve you've got to come up for this.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:41.800]   I can't bear it that you're not going to be able to be part of this.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:42.800]   Prager's a white wine guy.
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.880]   You might get me up there.
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.880]   Good.
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:46.880]   Good.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:47.880]   And cool is out of it.
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:48.880]   Wine coolers.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:49.880]   Wine coolers.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:50.880]   So in the blights.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:51.880]   What's the name of the Zima?
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:52.880]   No I'm kidding.
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:53.880]   I'm kidding.
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:54.880]   Who drinks that?
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:55.880]   I don't know.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:56.880]   12 year olds.
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:57.880]   You know what the stuff is all about.
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:58.880]   Honestly the first.
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.040]   It's aimed at people who are 21.01.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.880]   The first I'll call it.
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:04.880]   Drunk off of was Zima.
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:05.880]   Yeah.
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:06.880]   Boons farm strawberry ripple.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:11.000]   They don't have this anymore but they used to have this candy flavored wine basically.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.440]   Which is clearly aimed at kids.
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.440]   Like box wine?
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:15.840]   No it was strawberry ripple.
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:17.320]   Like deliberately candy flavored.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:18.320]   Yeah you know Steve.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.320]   Wow.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.320]   You're roughly my age.
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:20.680]   You're Boons farm and
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.680]   Roan's still available.
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.320]   Yeah they still make schnapps.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:27.440]   There's some horrible flavors which are totally for the.
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.440]   It's got to be aimed at children.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.440]   I mean now it's my hardening.
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:31.440]   Very good teenager.
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:32.440]   In college.
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:33.440]   It's terrible.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:34.440]   Oh please.
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:37.600]   Who are the biggest consumers of alcohol in this country?
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:38.600]   I know.
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.240]   Those who just read a study that they're almost all binge drinkers by the way.
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.240]   Did you see that?
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:43.240]   People that drink what?
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:45.080]   Teen young drinker under age thinking.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.320]   Well that makes sense.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.320]   You don't have a you don't sip a glass of wine.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.320]   You're there for one reason only.
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:54.280]   I mean they just have a term for the activity that's been going on forever.
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:55.280]   Yeah it's always been.
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:59.320]   See that's the biggest problem is you know you look at like you know all of the great
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:04.440]   beer ads of the last 30 years for all you know aimed at teenagers.
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:05.440]   Yeah I think it's.
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:08.760]   You know it's not like somebody's going to like move to straws.
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:09.760]   Right.
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:10.760]   When they've been drinking.
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:12.880]   Oh yeah they want to hook you young you're right.
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:15.200]   What you start with is what you're going to die with.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.200]   Same thing with cigarettes.
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:19.080]   That's why Joe Campbell right.
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:22.840]   In the biting the hand that feeds us department.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:25.640]   Elliot Spitzer the attorney general literally feeds us.
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:28.800]   Elliot Spitzer the attorney general from New York and the guy who's by the way running
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:36.480]   for governor has won a judgment against America online for a 1.25 million dollars because
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:40.800]   it was so hard to cancel AOL.
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.880]   And you know what they found out.
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.840]   What happens is there were about 300 consumer complaints to his office.
[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:52.000]   They did an inquiry they found the company had been rewarding employees for quote saving
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   subscribers who called into cancel.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.480]   Saving them from themselves.
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:59.800]   So if you so what it was doing was giving these employees incentives to just ignore the cancel.
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:03.040]   It was a social engineering and from there said yeah they were trying to talk.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:06.720]   You have to go through like three or four different hoops to finally cancel your membership.
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:07.720]   And they would offer free months.
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:08.720]   Right.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.320]   They would do all this to try and keep you.
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.720]   And you know that's a problem if they offer you a couple months you're like oh I might
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.040]   keep this around.
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.920]   And then you forget to cancel it of course after two months.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:23.520]   So I have on my credit card bill probably five or six things it just automatically
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:27.360]   be there because you just forget about my gym membership in LA right now.
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:31.040]   Right you're still paying for a gym you know you can't you live there.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:34.800]   And that's why the whole plan behind the twit monthly donation is that people will you
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.000]   know it's toolbox you're going to forget that right.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.160]   Just paying it for the rest of the lives.
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:43.320]   And I have an earthling account I've been trying to kill off for I think ten months.
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:48.360]   I'm embarrassed to say I had a prodigy account that I signed up for when I worked for the
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:57.040]   site in 1997 that I canceled only a year ago and I literally never used it.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.520]   A prodigy still exists.
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:01.160]   That's a down payment on a nice use card.
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.160]   We support our industry.
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.640]   I never ever used it.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:07.160]   Yeah well it kept getting sold somebody else owned and I'd get these letters in the mail
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:08.160]   saying.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:11.960]   The regulations your prodigy account is now dime a dozen ISP.
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:12.960]   It's an SPC now.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:13.960]   SPC?
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.640]   Yeah that's right I got Yahoo.
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:19.440]   And I never used it and finally I called and they said what's your password I said you're
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:20.440]   kidding.
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:23.160]   I said this up in 1997 I have no idea.
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:25.760]   Well David you were telling me the other day about your Netflix account.
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:32.640]   Oh yeah as soon as I moved from San Francisco to LA I stopped using my Netflix account because
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:35.760]   I didn't have an address I didn't know what my new address would be and I just kept getting
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:39.440]   charged I haven't ordered a Netflix movie in a year and I give 20 bucks a month every
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:40.440]   month.
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:41.440]   You used to have three movies that you moved with?
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.440]   Yep.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:46.240]   And now I got to find them they're like just put up in storage somewhere I got to find
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:49.000]   those three movies so I can start getting new ones if I want to use my Netflix account.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   Or you can take 20 bucks.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.560]   Yeah they don't mind.
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:52.560]   They don't mind at all.
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.760]   You can't cause them four bucks or something.
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:57.080]   Tevo turns a profit for the first time.
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:59.080]   Too late.
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:04.080]   Well especially now they're talking about putting ads on the screen when you fast forward
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.080]   through commercials.
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:06.080]   By Tevo.
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:07.080]   Good bye.
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:11.920]   Well they've already been doing that to some degree with pre-caching commercial content
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:15.600]   and then whenever that commercial will pop up on TV you'll get the little thumbs up
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:18.800]   thing in the corner saying if you want more information push thumbs up right now and
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:19.800]   it'll play that commercial.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.040]   It's already stored on the Tevo.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.040]   Yeah I used to go by it.
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:24.160]   Yeah because you don't you could ignore it.
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:28.600]   They made get this okay they revenues of forty six million dollars last quarter they made
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:30.800]   two hundred forty thousand dollars.
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.840]   Hey it's positive though.
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:35.840]   It's better than losing ten million which is what they did the quarter before or the
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:37.720]   year before.
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:44.120]   I think frankly now I have to say I'm starting to see more and more guys who are of a certain
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:46.320]   tech savviness.
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:50.720]   Dump all of that stuff even maybe dump the cable and start watching shows off bit torrent
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.360]   and that's basically how they get their TV.
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:54.800]   I mean don't you think that's cool.
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:56.400]   That's me you know I just I PTV.
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:48:00.920]   I just moved in my new place and the roommates got the cable boxes I was the only one did
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:01.920]   not get the cable box.
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:02.920]   Don't need it.
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:06.680]   Every show that you want to watch if it's not a good show you can't I mean you're not
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:08.240]   going to download Will and Grace.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:09.240]   Oh you could.
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:11.040]   You could though.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.680]   But you're not.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:15.920]   But but but all and all like all stuff that we like like fire fly.
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:19.680]   Yeah actually Will and Grace is a bad example that's a funny show but like fire fly and
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:25.400]   lost and weeds those things are all on bit and they're up before you can get because we're
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:28.480]   on the west coast they are on the east coast they encode them they post them and then you
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:29.480]   can get them on.
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:33.680]   Because the air is on the east coast someone actually captures it rips the commercials
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:37.040]   out right puts it up before you can watch and capture the HD version so you get a better
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:40.880]   quality than I would be getting blown away that many people have these HD capture.
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:46.320]   So my question is now by the way I should underscore that this illegal.
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:47.840]   Okay who cares.
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:52.400]   So my question is what's it what I would I don't know nothing we've referred to here
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:55.960]   is it a republic anyway what I would well that's well yeah but that doesn't count it's
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:49:00.320]   still copyright material yeah you just because it was on the airwaves doesn't mean anything
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:03.960]   that doesn't know it's copyright copyright what I would like is something like a Mac
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:09.280]   Mini a little thing that I could somehow easily control and program to download these
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:13.480]   torrents you know a media device that's torrent focused.
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:16.840]   Has anybody done something like that I mean a torrent a torrent cast a torrent that I could
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:20.840]   just you know I don't know I don't want a Tivo I don't I don't have a cable I don't
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:24.480]   get any TV into my house what about like a myth TV or anything like that no no because
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:27.840]   I don't have to okay so you want to I want to be able to put this on put it plug it into
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:32.560]   the ethernet and I want some easy way to control it so that I could say you know I don't know
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:35.640]   what's running a zurius with a script or whatever but I could say these are the shows
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:40.320]   I want be nice if I had a grid a Tivo like grid on that thing these are the shows I want
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:44.080]   and then I want to play back to I want I want myth TV but I don't want it to be getting it
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:48.960]   from the right table I want it to be coming over Patrick's cloud yeah I want coming from
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:53.160]   the cloud is anybody done that there's a rss plug-in for next system yeah that would be
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:58.840]   a great great topic as long as we don't go to jail for it but yeah well how could you
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:02.720]   get around it well there's plenty of legal bit torrents so just say it's really don't
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:06.120]   don't right guys do this for battle start this is no could you call it the battle star
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:11.520]   Galactica media player well the promises there's no consistent naming conventions no
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:16.040]   that's why you have an interface to trackers and zurius allows you to put in keywords and
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:19.800]   things like that that I can look for and then pull down files there's there's there's other
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:25.320]   problem is that their MPAA just sued a whole bunch of bit torrent users well well I have
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:31.600]   that fixed too because I'm using the I fan them which is is is you know the cable modem
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:35.400]   goes into that and then my router goes in the I fan them and that sends an encrypted
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:41.640]   scrambles it's encrypted IP sec to their servers and then anonymizes it so you don't
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:46.160]   know who I am I look like I'm I fan them I'm also sing a lot I'm also sing a lot of sites
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:52.200]   now offering the magnet link the decentralized bizorous tracker which is another option
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:56.080]   but let's say you're not using a tracking site the truth is in the long run I don't
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:51:00.080]   want to do this for illegal purposes what I'm what I'm hoping is this is the this is
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:05.320]   the way IP TV might play out I'd like to get the system I'd like to get a battle star
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:09.560]   Galactica which is offered legally as a bit torrent or whatever well people decide to
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:13.680]   do would you let's say Comcast offered a service where you'd install an application you could
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:18.960]   choose the shows that you want to pay per show sure I do PC yeah so as long as the PC
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:22.200]   who's hooked up to the TV in the living room right yeah you can get really one as a remote
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:27.000]   control interface on the TV see isn't that their in-demand service I guess it kind of
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.960]   it but then you stop to pay the monthly I mean they don't but it's like a one it's a one
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:35.760]   time fee no it's not saying let's say an all a cart way of right exactly just the channels
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:39.200]   you want about and it's coming there's free stuff but that's what I like I mean I think
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:43.160]   there's gonna be more and more free stuff battle star Galactica is legally distributed as
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:47.200]   a bit torrent that's my understanding that they just I think was Galactica that did this
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:51.120]   that they put up the one and one or two episodes and maybe they don't do it regularly yeah
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:54.800]   they did a couple I think they did to be honest with you quality wasn't all that great
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:58.800]   news and four by three seen the one that's too bad they would be very smart to do this
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:02.760]   because I don't think it hurts your television audience so yeah so basically yeah that's the
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:08.600]   interesting question so is the television industry and broadcasting cable going to be as smart
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:15.600]   ha ha ha as as as the RIA was in eventually moving their content to an online distributed
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:18.400]   legal I certainly hope they're smart enough to do that because if they're not it will
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:22.160]   happen for them but the problem is commercial support because you know we're always fast
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:27.320]   40 through the commercials anyway and as you guys said you know the the shows are being
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:31.120]   being captured and commercials edited out because no one wants to sit through that pay
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:35.880]   a bucket show it takes 60 minutes and drops it down to 40 because it's one third commercial
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:39.680]   I think it surprised me how many vendors I talked to in the industry especially display
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:43.440]   industries that they're talking about now moving back to radio for advertising because
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:48.080]   they know everyone who watches TV is usually using a PBR device to fast forward well good
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:54.960]   because everybody listen to radios now listen to podcasts so that's true or or XM or when
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:59.040]   you guys were talking about having you know your credit cards bled slowly I was reminded
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:04.880]   that I've got three or four XM receivers that I'm licensed to use but I never listened to
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:09.480]   there you go there's another areas baby I think podcasts are gonna here's another example
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:15.200]   of stupid stupid TV executive tricks there's a there's a family guy in a Simpsons podcast
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:19.080]   fact I thought oh Fox is brilliant they're doing podcasts to the family guy in Simpsons
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:23.400]   and you'd think they put the show put the show audio or put a clip what do they do they
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:28.720]   have some more on reading a show synopsis with all the jokes taken out what's that all
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:32.480]   I subscribe to it I saw the family guy in iTunes and the right if even if it only had
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:36.920]   ten minutes you would love it right now just a ten minute clip that you would not watch
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:40.920]   the show or make you watch the show you see I gotta see that show family guy is one of
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:46.240]   my favorite animated maybe it's a maybe it's a right I the kids watch it I have to stop
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:52.600]   them oh it's so much worse now I mean I'm worse bad but foul but I love it I mean it's
[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:57.880]   not foul on like a South Park level but no it's how old the kids Leo it is eleven and
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:01.520]   thirteen they love it it's exactly at their level but I don't want them to start thinking
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:04.600]   so then they didn't know what Peter was talking about when he wanted to play the waiting game
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:09.440]   oh that was I don't know I don't even know if I should belong on this that shouldn't belong
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:14.000]   on this podcast either well all those who know will be appalled and the rest of us are just
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:19.960]   completely clueless that was hardcore you're just not cool watch failing it's a very funny
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:22.960]   show kids know and they love it oh you can get that on bit torn he's but see we don't
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:26.120]   well that's it we don't watch it but we don't bit turn either we just rent the DVDs because
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:30.720]   the first few seasons are out on DVD but it gets worse oh yeah the latest season in Muslim
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:33.960]   is hard but they still on it's still on I guess it must be yeah they wouldn't be yeah
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:38.080]   adults when Barry here's an example of a bad idea though I mean they could really do well
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:42.680]   maybe it's a rights issue maybe they don't have the actors rights to use the actors voices
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:48.080]   or something like that so how many terabytes are nineteen nineteen yeah so I got a downloading
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:52.360]   the mp2 I got a quiz for you Twitter forecast what comes after terabyte petabyte petabyte
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:56.960]   petabyte not exabyte then yeah but knows it exabyte then zeta bite and then the out of
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:03.960]   bite I like the yada bite where's jigabyte yeah there's no there is no jig or jigga
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:09.920]   white there that does not exist so but I think people for a while did say sometimes said
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:15.880]   jigabyte instead of gigabyte is it gift or Jeff I say give I say give but it could be
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:22.160]   I say Jeff have you seen how for measurements though for storage they're impressing upon
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:26.880]   at least in the international community did not say kilo because kilo equals 1000 and
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:33.280]   should be kibi for 1024 no because it's because it's binary not digital yeah that makes talk
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:37.480]   about just make it even more confusing for people but kibbles and bits kibble yeah kibble
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:46.880]   piece kibi bites kibi bites instead of saying kilo kibi I'm trying to mute Patrick I can't
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:53.880]   figure out it's kind of fair not you'll push the wrong button I know I will now I'm using
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:56:01.120]   a stupid money mouse and I can't write click only right click the whole thing is like stupid
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:05.040]   is that the name of them yeah they have a mouse yeah they licensed it it's actually
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:08.360]   a mouse there's not enough feedback I mean you don't know that you're really doing the
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:12.200]   right but no well the problem is I always have both fingers even when I'm doing the right
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:20.600]   button on at the same time you have to consciously lift oh so it's a proximity sensors yeah it
[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:28.120]   knows your finger it's typical over engineered solution for a perfectly good product it sounds
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:31.800]   cool on paper you don't need it it's overkill you know that sounds cool though when they
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:35.200]   came up with the idea they're like oh somebody sensors for your fingers and there's a little
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:41.200]   piezo electric speaker in it to make click sounds it's just talked about over engineered
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:45.320]   it's just anywhere it's their headphones 90% of time I'm using a computer well it gives
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:49.320]   you the audio also gives you a little mechanical feeling okay I mean it kind of because it's
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:52.520]   clicking it kind of feels like there's some mechanical have you guys tried the new G5
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:57.760]   laser mouse from a yes is that the one where you can put the weights in it yes that's
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:02.560]   pretty amazing now that's now that's a mighty mouse it was that's the game or gift right
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:07.200]   there folks you got a serious gamer on your list what makes it so good because the one
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:12.120]   is look it's yeah you can wait the mouse in any of the four corners up there you know
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:15.280]   they include a little set of weights which are pretty cute looking actually but the cool
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:19.880]   thing is just that laser pickup it's 20 times more accurate they claim and I believe it
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:26.560]   then their previous LED based optical sensor system it makes it even larger on your problematic
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:30.960]   surfaces yes Logitech it reminds me like the pine wood derby like you put in a little
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:43.680]   weights and the thing I got third place baby I'm proud of it my son got the second place
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:47.920]   and went to the semi-finals but then we lost to some yeah there's always a kid did you
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:51.240]   do the dads one too because the dads can make one too right well the dads end up making
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:55.160]   them anyway I did not I said no you're making it his look you know like a kid make right
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:58.560]   and then there's some they have a namsel and they're farnished like they look like you
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:01.800]   know it's you know it's but there were supposed to be weight required there are whether or
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:06.160]   not yeah because the guy who ended up winning the one at ours he must have like 15 lag bolts
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:10.200]   bolted screwed into the wood on the cloud they must have weighed four pounds they weigh
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:14.800]   it's like they have a careful way in at the beginning yeah and then thought but you can
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:18.800]   think I get screwed can you still use graphite yeah they use these graphite on the wheels
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:22.880]   they make graphite on the outer graphite baby even shaved off those little nubs on the
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:28.520]   plastic wheels that's right inside the touched yeah reduce friction so funny that you guys
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:34.160]   remember that so vividly I guess my son will do you did the little regatta the no we haven't
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:39.440]   done that yet let me ask you what when is that windows Vista editorial panel that you
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:42.960]   guys are going to do when is that already done that was actually that was on the 26th
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:47.320]   but we do have if you go up to the digital life TV website we've got a link to the video
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:51.800]   I did just a quick walk through taking a look at arrow and glass and some of the security
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:57.280]   features are in there can you give us a summary the basic the biggest thing people are going
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:03.920]   to notice is the new arrow design the glass interface or the glass additions that which
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:09.120]   is essentially adding transparency to the interface pretty windows and then the user
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:14.200]   account protections which is stuff you can lock down gaming and you can lock down access
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:20.520]   but the biggest thing is if you turn the if you turn the security on which is actually
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:25.080]   a pretty intelligent thing to do anything that would normally require and administrative
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:30.760]   level account to install it will request you to type your password in so anytime you're
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:36.120]   installing new software any of that good this is a really a actually brilliant edition I
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:40.800]   will be curious to see whether or not they ship that turned on that's what keeps apples
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:46.720]   oh as 10 safe and that's how it's so it means it's so it means you can now usefully use
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:52.400]   windows without being the ad route count yep yep and that's key and that really I think
[00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:56.480]   that is the bottom line about when why windows is currently in secure is it because everybody
[00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:01.880]   runs a administrator it never asks for permission when it's modifying the system yeah so it'll
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:06.840]   be interesting to see what the final version of that looks like yeah it's got a lot of
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:10.600]   potential it's so tell me what arrow is in what glass is I've heard you say this what
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:15.080]   are you arrow is essentially the new design so that's that's the the new graphical design
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:22.080]   it's like aqua for windows Vista essentially yeah it's it's a it's their version of aqua
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:27.880]   oh man I think glass is just the the transparencies that are employed so you can see the fuzzy version
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:32.280]   of the window right now the panel and the various challenges of the frame alpha channels yeah
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:36.400]   so far they've got nothing new that always tend hasn't had for years go ahead keep going
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:40.360]   that's pretty much with my reaction to it well do you guys like these transparent windows
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:44.360]   where you can like see through the whole surface of the window that's just a noise a lot of
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:49.400]   Linux users do that though they love you as long as you have full control over the level
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:54.200]   of transparency I find there's always a certain point where your eye is okay with it but if
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:58.640]   it's if it's not transparent enough or if it's too light right yeah it's it's either annoying
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.440]   or useless I end up turning it off they talked about who is it that was going to as you're
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:06.520]   using the computer if you don't use a window for a while it kind of fades out in the back
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:12.440]   they're already doing that in that word in office 2003 the toolbars fade away it's the
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:19.960]   most annoying it's just it's typical Microsoft it's like those custom self customizing menus
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:24.040]   where personalized menu yes stoned you always got to click the little double down there to
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:29.960]   get the rest of the items on the menu yes oh it's a father's nose best attitude that and by the way
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:33.880]   apple has it to him and look at the one button mouse it's for some reason these technology
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:40.120]   companies just don't trust users i i lio i think it's that the companies have run out of things to
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:45.560]   do well so they're they're just adding features to make another version number to move everybody
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:51.080]   up and get some more revenue now with new disappearing menus oh watch that what gets for your
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:56.680]   document what this is this is nothing new to the tech industry oh no it isn't you really want to
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:01.320]   see the contents in this folder electronics you don't recommend you change any history oh yeah
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:05.160]   did you see that how far graphics technologies come i'm glad to see operating systems at least
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:10.280]   incorporating the basics of some of that power hopefully and to you know if you're going to make
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:15.240]   it look pretty you might as well take it the entire way and utilize the power the latest
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:20.680]   hardware that's out there i i kind of disagree i i kind of think that keep it simple and use the
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:25.720]   power when it's appropriate in a game or you know but but let's not i'm not saying just add fluff
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:31.640]   for fluff sec but you know if i can have well done transparency that you know doesn't say
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:37.240]   requires a Pentium 4 and half a gig of ram in order to operate properly which at this point
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:41.800]   that's pretty much every system sold right right it's just it's kind of nice just to see that we've
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:52.840]   gotten to that point granted i kind of missed the old days of you know DOS but hell that's what
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:58.600]   Linux is for now i think a little ui sugar is fine but it's just you know i mean you got to do it subtly
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:02.440]   yeah some customizability it'll also be interesting to see whether or not people adopt to the whole
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:08.440]   shared the they basically put share in in every uh every folder window as long as i put
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:14.680]   shunning in every folder window i'm okay with it what what was this deal about the peer-to-peer
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:19.880]   sharing being turned on by default so the computers it's so so these new machines were trying to
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:26.040]   connect to other ones oh presume that that presume that these are beta features that they will have
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:31.960]   the big sense not to ship that would be just nutty yeah i haven't seen any of that yet is that
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:35.960]   some of their avalanche stuff if they have they started to incorporate any of avalanche into uh
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:41.160]   the OS no because pretty much all the they have some sort of peer networking technology that they
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:48.360]   said was also briefly on in in the early XP and that but they decided not to include it but it's
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:53.880]   now back in Vista and it's turned on in these betas so that the beta machines are like looking for other
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:04:01.160]   beta um Vista boxes and hooking up and creating a peer network is it for like quality feedback
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:06.040]   or something or what no it's like they think that peer-to-peer is going to be a next-generation
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:10.840]   important technology and they want to build it into the OS well i kind of agree with that i mean but
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:15.480]   i mean just kind of headless peer-to-peer just for peer-to-peer sake makes no sense yeah if you've
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:22.840]   got a task to do and well i leo it'll be it'll be using uh universal plug and play of course it will
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:27.960]   program the net routers and you know poke holes through our security in order to find a machine
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:31.640]   what do you think of zero conf which is what apple calls it rendezvous and then they called it
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:35.960]   bonjour because somebody else had rendezvous and by the way it's not avalanche it's avalanche
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:42.040]   what do you think is zero conf Steve is that danger you know about zero conf is that dangerous i
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:45.880]   think it seems like a good thing i mean you plug i think i think it makes a lot of sense as long
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:50.040]   as you restrict it to the land and don't let it go out over the land so when you plug in a zero
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:54.840]   conf printer you don't have to install anything it just knows absolutely it works great totally
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:59.080]   cool yeah so that's right keep it to the land only don't you know and they ought to do something
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:05.880]   clever like make all the packets that are admitted have a ttl of two or three so that the packets can't
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:11.400]   no nothing can keep the packet alive as it tries to go out on external routers what a good idea so
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:17.160]   that's enough time to trans transverse your land but nowhere near enough time to go out to the net
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:21.640]   yep what a good idea and no one does that it's like so simple did you think of that
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:28.920]   yeah i would go patent that right now short ttls you see that just you see a microsoft uh
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:31.400]   employee brought a virus back to redmond from malaise
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:38.040]   measles that's the virus in fact i love that really the king county the king county health
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:44.200]   bulletin it says the infected person visited the following areas malais satay hut in redmond
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:48.760]   tie ginger in redmond the microsoft redmond campus in the microsoft cafeteria
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:53.480]   and they give the times and dates that the guy went there so if you were there man go get your
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:06:00.600]   measles shot this is the problem with off-shoring workers to bring back the pieces he was probably
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:05.080]   there to pick up the latest beta of vistas and bring it back to redmond that's that could very
[01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:11.080]   well be okay one last story then we gotta go because we're running out of time halo universal
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:16.520]   they've signed a deal with microsoft to do the halo movie masterfief the back story
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:21.720]   exactly i think that the josh of brentana should sign a deal with them to do the jumping
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:26.600]   trucks trick that he uh figured out oh my god i hope it's a good movie you remember that guy yeah
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:29.640]   that was the funniest thing you take all the little war hogs you drive them around so they're
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:33.720]   all facing each other you know what do you do you launch a rocket into it or something do it this
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:38.440]   terroet yeah so this is all live action though right this yeah well there's do there's a
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:42.920]   do movie coming out with the rock have you seen that gosh the only thing that gives me hope of this
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:48.680]   halo movie it's written by the guy who did 28 days later wasn't that a great movie the zombie movie
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:54.440]   oh see a bunch of us sat down and we tried to list one movie based on a video game that didn't
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:59.160]   suck they've all we came up with so that maybe this is the one that turns it around final fantasy
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:05.240]   my breath i mean in fact not only suck but some of the worst movies of all time lara but think of
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:09.000]   the product figure the product placement opportunities for microsoft
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:16.840]   master chief dahl's master chief headgear speaking of which real quick i know we got to go but i
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:22.040]   just saw a list for the top hacker slash computer movies and i want to know one of what you guys
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:26.280]   think let's do it yeah okay so we got hackers wait wait before you say it yeah let's let's come up
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:30.600]   with our votes so hackers would be in there war games well let me get the list so you know all the
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:34.120]   options because it might be something you forgot about okay it's a big list all right okay hackers

[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:21.480]   i would say war games that's my favorite matrix war games is my favorite war games oh the matrix
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:26.280]   has to be the top of the list don't you make the net it's been it's been unfortunately destroyed
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:29.080]   the net is that santer bullet yeah i was terrible yeah i was terrible
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:35.640]   the the unfortunately matrix's memory is tarnished by the sequels don't you remember best trilogy
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:39.640]   ever don't you remember it she's doubt at the end i'll take that to my grave i still haven't seen
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:43.720]   it in second and third because i don't want it oh don't don't do it yeah it'll spoil it yes but
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:47.880]   don't you remember the feeling well see i saw it before anybody i didn't know what i was seeing
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:52.760]   neither did i don't you remember the feeling walking out of theater going oh my god that was the
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:56.280]   greatest i had no idea my friends were like let's go see this movie oh i don't want to go see the
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:02.600]   matrix what stupid man of real but it was a fantastic idea oh that's it and you walk out going
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:08.440]   what if the world really is yeah a matrix i mean that i'll never have that but the
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:12.680]   other thing is how do you really know that was a great feeling you don't know yeah it is a construct
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:16.200]   the whole world is a construct of course it is and then the end of the movie with a rage against
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:22.360]   a machine oh it's great song yeah i don't even remember that now and when the credits play yeah yeah yeah
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:26.040]   when when when neo flies up out of the phone booth at the end yeah
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:31.640]   see it's too bad they did the sequels they should have just stopped well money Robert you think the
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:36.200]   two and three were pretty good money revolution is an as a whole that was the best trilogy how
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:40.600]   old it has ever spit out maybe i'll get the maybe i don't know god watch us keep brothers rock god
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:45.400]   father was the best i like that more than even say indiana jones star wars you name it godfather
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:50.840]   that's my best of it as a trilogy god i think i'll stand all right we'll go off two and three
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:57.960]   well two great movies okay great movies three great movie great movie but jones they had that second
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:04.120]   one that you just wanted to be like oh oh i want to see this next the next to the end of jones i think
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:08.360]   for the matrix though for the last two star wars the last two back to back star wars yeah trilogy
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:12.680]   of all i'm with you this the this one the first trilogy the second trilogy one two in second trilogy
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:19.320]   any of the trilogies any anyone taken by itself or all three together all right we're out of time
