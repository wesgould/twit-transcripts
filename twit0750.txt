[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.880]   Micah Sartre who is one of our newest employees is here a last-minute replacement
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.440]   I am a last minute replace good friend Lori Giel couldn't make it down from Sacramento
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.200]   Unfortunately, so we had it my sister for me unfortunately it was gonna be me and a bunch of women
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.720]   So this feels more realistic
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.840]   Get in the first thing in hello Stacy
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.800]   She is of course our twig host but also at Stacy on IOT in her own IOT podcast and
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.540]   Mary Jo Foley has joined us all the way from New York all about Microsoft.com
[00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.760]   So Mary Jo came the farthest Stacy came down from Seattle
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.480]   I walked into the room down the hall and
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.240]   Because you're all here we thought we'd prime the pump
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.440]   We've I've hired a very special bartender to bring us some holiday beverages
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.160]   Anthony Nielsen who is our lead editor. I would love to do the honors of passing this also a great bartender
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.920]   Is that Anthony is that that looks to me like that could be a patch Tuesday?
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.880]   That looks like the best patch Tuesday ever man. That's amazing. That's got to be for Mary Jo
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.840]   This is wait. Did you order? No, you have something else? Oh
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.360]   You you were there when the patch Tuesday was I
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.120]   Made it up and then I
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.560]   Can't make drinks and so Paul's wife
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:35.280]   Stephanie's a great job made the patch Tuesday cocktail into an actual thing. What is this? Is this cognacs? Are you ready?
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.280]   That's the is that this one?
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.960]   Okay, so the smoked boulevard here is oh
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.240]   Yeah, so why is it in here is that what you do?
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.280]   It's smoked. Oh, there's smoke
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:55.480]   That's stony point whiskey Campari Carpano Antica sweet vermouth served in a hickory smoked decanter
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.600]   Oh my god, you're working with that's Anthony Nielsen come out when you in a nutshell. Yeah
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:07.080]   Smoking I don't know if you can see it in the TV, but it is smoking absolutely. Oh
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.480]   My god yum yum, it's a boulevard yay
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.320]   And then what it does Stacy get Stacy has are you the smoked rosemary gin and tonic? I am all right
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.160]   That's Griffo Scott stream gin. Oh, yeah, we're using a local
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:31.880]   Gin from just down the road a piece with lime bitter cube boulevard bitters and it's served in a rosemary smoked glass
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.920]   And what is Mary Jo drinking? I think she's drinking a local fruit Mary Jo is drinking a southern 75
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.480]   That is a crooked goat brewing ibex IPA good goat with good
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.640]   Go with a sonoma County. Oh
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:55.480]   That's right. Yeah, all right with Griffo stony point whiskey lemon and lemon oil infused dimmer ara syrup
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.720]   What's in my boulevard? Yeah, I thought I'd already said that one that was
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:07.720]   I do believe that one no before I drink it you've got stony point whiskey Campari Carpano Antica sweet vermouth
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:14.920]   You did say that with the hickory smoked decanter and last but not least is and by the way, it has a twit logo on the top of it
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:21.600]   Gee, where's the camera to show that yeah, how do you do that here? Got a special camera? Oh?
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:30.080]   My goodness. I also have an original recipe courtesy of Stephanie Therat inspired by mica sergeant. This is the most beautiful thing amazing
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:37.080]   The Griffo stony point whiskey lemon barrel aged honey syrup egg white and twits stenciled bitters
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.120]   Those are bitters. I am so impressed
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.240]   I'm bitter too, but that's that's the years. That's amazing Anthony
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:52.800]   I give you good cheer happy holidays and here's to a peaceful and happy 20
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.240]   2020
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:04.360]   Link carefully very careful clean already spilled on my my service virtual desk top cheers. Yes, so welcome everybody to what is always
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.360]   Drunken back and now what is always a fun show to do which is our year-end
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:17.600]   Episode now next week. We're gonna do of course the best of but what we like to do it Christmas just around the corner
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.080]   We're in the middle of hanaka. We'd like to do at the end of the year is oh, you're gonna get a little coffee too
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.640]   Just a little speedball thing going on. What are you? What are you drinking an almond latte? Oh?
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:33.380]   This is an almond milk latte, you know, just just coffee. Yes, thank you Sarah fancy an applause for me to you
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:40.440]   26 people whose entire mission is to serve us beverages. That's what it feels like and I feel no
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:49.600]   What was I what was I saying I think you were talking about whiskey no you're talking about the show favorites
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:57.080]   This week we thought what we realized what I realized
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:04.120]   Independently and apparently incorrectly is that this is the end of a decade mm-hmm the teens the 20 teens
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.920]   Stacy of course immediately pointed out as one does
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:13.880]   That the decades actually 2011 to 2020. I'm that guy we could do that again next year the teens
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.000]   But this is the teens so that's what we're gonna say right not the decade
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.560]   I'll look back at the teens and actually really appropriate because Mary Joe Foley has been covering Microsoft all of that time
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.680]   And there was a lot of Microsoft there was in the 2010s
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:36.600]   Stacy started covering what ball bearings I can't remember. Yes, definitely ball bearings something industrial steel no chips and
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.160]   Wireless policy and spectrum. Yeah, oh chips
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:45.440]   I thought you said ships and I thought that's interesting. There's a lot of that in the teens as well
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:50.000]   Of course IOT comes on strong toward the end of the decade so yeah
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.280]   Yeah, if that yeah, well, we'll get to it
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.960]   2012 and then Mike up was even born
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:05.000]   We thought we you know, I'm glad you're we needed a millennial. Yeah, because your perspective
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.680]   I think technically I'm a zeniel
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:14.480]   Anybody
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.920]   Mark Zuckerberg's age are younger is a millennial
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:22.680]   36 oh, I'm 41. Yes, so I think you but I played the Oregon Trail
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.200]   Okay, well that could that does
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:32.960]   It on an apple - it was actually on like an Atari thing
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.940]   I know it was an old sorry. It was a
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:40.880]   Machine what like a dot like a DOS machine. All right. I wasn't paying attention
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:46.440]   I was paying a video game. Yeah, did everybody die of dysentery? Yes. Yeah, there was lots of that many times
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.760]   So are these the terrible teens are they the terrific teens?
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:55.440]   I'm gonna leave that to us to you at the end of the show we can decide terrible or terrific
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.120]   What what was this turmoil?
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.120]   turmoil
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:06.960]   And techie teens Mary Jo and I both observed that this was a very busy decade especially the first half it was
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.520]   Lots of stuff changed in the first half of the decade
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.560]   We can start in 2010 and I remember 2010 vividly because
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.880]   Well, first of all we were still in the cottage
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.360]   We didn't have the
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:29.280]   fantastic production values we have today and I remember in January 2010 Steve Jobs introduced the iPad and
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:34.640]   We decided we wanted to cover that live on lawn chairs in front of
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.600]   Masakoni Center
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:44.000]   Because you have an invite I wonder if I have I hope no I did in fact that was the last time I had it
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.480]   Because that is the infamous
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:53.740]   Moment when I'm sitting now this is I tell my way. It's different. Hey Steve told me I tell my way
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:57.800]   I'm sitting in the iPad announcement. This is perhaps I think so you're not on a lawn chair
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.960]   I'm actually inside. I got this is the last time I got a badge
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:08.760]   The lawn chairs came later gotcha. I'm sitting inside and I'm looking and I'm thinking this is the most important hardware
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.560]   Announcement of the decade
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:15.660]   Actually even ten years later. You might say it was one of them. It wasn't the most but one of them
[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.660]   okay, and
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:23.540]   We're covering it kind of because they didn't stream it at the time by
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.320]   Blogging it right typing it in
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:33.880]   So dopey and I'm looking behind me and there's Bloomberg TV and all the cameras behind me gone were you know
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:40.040]   It was so long ago. They actually had to turn the crank and I'm looking I'm thinking well. They're gonna broadcast this
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.080]   So I took my laptop
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.720]   I launched Skype. I called the studio and I turned it around. Oh wow
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:54.240]   Wow, this was before vlogging. Oh, yeah, no, yeah, you were
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:59.820]   As it turns out I learned later you weren't really allowed to do that everybody else is recording it
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.660]   But I guess live streaming Steve didn't want that for some reason
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:09.300]   Steve gives me this stink. I know he saw me and actually we looked later in the video of the event and there's a
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.700]   You can see Leo
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:16.540]   unclear whole nervous iPad they didn't kick me out. They didn't do anything
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:20.720]   Wasn't I pet it was a laptop and have one yet. They didn't kick me out. They didn't do anything
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.260]   had it had I you know, I
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.560]   Don't know and so I went out then we sat in front of the lawn chairs
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.860]   Colleen our engineer at the time had made a live
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.700]   broadcasting rig
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.460]   Glassing glue
[00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:39.620]   And we did we did the show from there. So I think that was a pretty important
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:45.060]   Way to begin the decade really was I think it was the very first
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:49.460]   It was in January as a Mac world expo. So it was a very big
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:57.080]   The first big tech event of the decade. Yeah launch the iPad. Yeah, would you I mean looking back now 10 years later is the iPad
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.420]   Success, I think so
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:07.620]   You know a lot of people debate that I mean, it's not like it was a throwaway gadget, but it didn't it didn't change the way we compute
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.120]   It wasn't as big as we probably thought it was gonna be
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:15.860]   Because because right now, I mean, we're just sort of getting to the point where some people well
[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:21.180]   I should say that should be careful because there are people out there who will live and die by the fact that they use their iPad for
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:25.700]   Everything or their tablet for everything, but there are for the most part
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:29.620]   We're just now getting to a place where Mike my grandma for example
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:35.820]   I started her out with an iPad mini that was mine that I gave to her and she used that and then I was happy to get to
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:42.380]   Upgraded to a more recent iPad pro with the keyboard that comes with it and the Apple pencil and she uses that as her
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:47.180]   Computer that's the computer. That's all she needs and I think that you're jingling. Yes. Thank you
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:53.420]   I think that for the most part. We are just sort of in that space in terms of tablets
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:58.420]   But Microsoft is doing pretty well with the with the sort of yeah
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.900]   The the go-between or the all-in-one kind of device that's portable
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:08.460]   so in terms of what the iPad hoped to do in providing a more mobile
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:13.860]   Computing platform. I think that it certainly didn't start out that way. It was definitely
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:19.740]   consumption versus content creation, but we really have seen overall I feel the
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.420]   the whole tech sector kind of
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:29.540]   Digging into that idea and creating products that do that I think even Microsoft would agree that the iPad was a big deal
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.980]   I mean, that's remember when they ported office to the iPad
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:41.620]   Here's Steve he was already very ill and I think I do remember when we walked in there kind of gasping at how thin
[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.340]   He looked
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:51.320]   He's talking about netbooks what's wrong with that's right. We did we call them netbooks tablets
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.740]   What it there were there were lots of things
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.320]   He says you're not watch this. This is a good effect
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:02.220]   netbooks falling apart
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.620]   features still available in power or
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:08.380]   In the keynote thing. Yeah, a lot of the original features. Can you turn Steve up a little bit?
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:13.940]   A lot of the original features of keynote were made for steves the iPad that one - oh, yeah
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:26.980]   Feminine hygiene seemed like a good way more will look you would never do that today
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:34.900]   Look at the size of the right here bezels on this thing. Oh my goodness. It's all bezels
[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:39.620]   That reflection
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:44.020]   I mean we own this it was a game-changing product at the time
[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:48.620]   But now I've got a mini that I use for like CES to shoot stuff
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:53.460]   Your daughter still uses an iPad no she doesn't she does our phone and the
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.580]   Yeah, the phone might have somewhat replaced this huh?
[00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.380]   We use it as a TV basically no one watches
[00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:04.700]   We only have one TV now in the house and then we have an a roving iPad for whomever wants to so it is still
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:09.980]   But in will totally replace it, but it is not it's not a device. We use every day. Yeah
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:15.660]   Well, and it's the fact that you can still use it. You haven't needed to replace it. I think that's something
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:22.100]   This isn't the 2010 oh, I bet you say oh god. No one still has that one. That was the only Apple products. I ever bought
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:29.420]   So what we should say is the last Apple product you ever yes, you didn't have an iPad or iPad
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:35.420]   Yeah, I don't know if you know my problem with Apple, but did you have a zoom? What's your what's your tell us?
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:41.860]   What's your big problem with Apple? I just don't like Apple. I don't like the Mac community. Sorry. I guy. I
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.660]   Love it Mary Jo calls me the eye guy
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:50.460]   Like the Mac community. I don't that's hard. It is it is now
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:55.580]   I just feel like Apple gets away with too much. Okay, and I don't want to be part of that
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:16:01.180]   This is missive. She can't be part of that. Okay, that's all. Yeah, that's fair Apple also
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:04.020]   in 2010
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:07.820]   Got rid of just flash you can thank Steve Jobs
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:12.740]   Very famous letter they put on the front page of apple.com
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.540]   I remember having to explain this to folks. I
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:20.660]   Was on the plane with the woman the other day and she was like
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:27.220]   Why is this asking about flash? How do I watch the movie on my computer? And I'm like I am not isn't it said Steve Jobs is dead
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.980]   But flash isn't yeah, that's kind of a sad statement
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.780]   He had all the right reasons
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:40.140]   A lot of people thought that he didn't like flash because he didn't like Adobe that it was kind of a personal vendetta
[00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:43.640]   Against Adobe and there's perhaps some maybe
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:48.780]   Ways breeze thing to think that but nevertheless
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:55.700]   I mean eventually like we said oh Adobe gets rid of it pretty much as well and and well sort of like as
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:01.860]   Sort of like Microsoft sort of sort of as you say you keep running into it. I keep I keep having to install it
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.860]   I don't want a moon I
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:08.820]   Come across it and now at this point. I just whatever that thing is. I'm not just gonna direct with it
[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:12.260]   I don't care. Yeah, I guess I don't care. Yeah, exactly. Okay. It doesn't matter
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:17.060]   But I remember at the time it was sort of a
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:21.100]   bragging rights thing for folks who had
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:29.260]   devices that could load flash and so where where you had these iPhones or iPods or whatever
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:35.780]   Trying to you know access this website that had flash and oh well. I can do it look at me. I can get on there
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.780]   It's like I don't know what to say so
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:43.360]   I don't want to make it at all apples. So we're gonna give you some stuff Mary Jo. Thank you
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.700]   The Microsoft kin was born
[00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:56.100]   The kin so the kin was a little tiny
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.820]   Computing there was a phone and I think there were two models
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:06.900]   Now now the joke is when anything gets killed quickly we say it got kin it got kin right so cute
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:12.180]   It was a really cute phone super cute, but they didn't kind of clear the path with
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:19.700]   Carriers and so nobody wanted to pick it up. I think you could say the carriers killed well Verizon told me right Microsoft had a flat
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:25.300]   Rate internet pricing on it, which is pretty cool. It looked cute, but it was doomed
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:30.140]   Actually, this is the kin - the kin one was similar though. Yeah, yeah, it is yeah
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.700]   It came out of a lot of the technology came out of there
[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.820]   Deal with danger. I think they acquired dandy. Yes, Andy Rubens
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:45.700]   They use that technology to make the kin and so they launched it with great fanfare and six weeks later boom
[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:49.900]   It was exclusive to Verizon. See made by Sharp
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:56.060]   That's another thing that we're seeing we're getting rid of and exclusive. Yeah in these modern years although the new razor
[00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:00.140]   Yeah phone is exclusive well in wasn't this back when you still
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.980]   You would get a phone for free or a
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:06.980]   Oh my god. Yeah, these were in the days you the days of subsidization
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:12.100]   You probably don't remember this but this some people you're only 12 some people remember it
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:20.420]   That you used to pay typically $200 for a phone no matter what it cost and then you would spread it out the rest of it
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:27.020]   Over you'd have to sign a two-year deal with it. Yeah, and it's about midway through this decade that AT&T said we're not doing
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.620]   Yeah, it's because the phone got too expensive. Yeah, yeah
[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:32.660]   I love the little keyboard though
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:37.820]   I was one of those people who my first one of my first smartphones had a real keyboard and I loved it
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:42.380]   I miss I have the danger hip-top if I could first Google a phone Android phone had a keyboard like that
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:45.500]   I always get slid out. I always coveted the sidekick
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:49.500]   All the cool kids somewhere I got one of those
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.500]   so
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:55.740]   The funny thing subsidies ended but as the prices of phones went up
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:20:00.700]   But they continued locking the phones because the whole point of the locking was what we subsidized
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.900]   It's our phone in that but even if you buy it out right they still lock it and
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.020]   Although the FCC has started weighing on that and
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:11.900]   That deal where you know, we're gonna add a little to your bill every month to pay for the phone
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.900]   They never eliminated that charge
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.700]   So it worked out great for the phone
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.420]   What did not work work out great for Apple?
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:23.420]   2010 was the year of the antenna gate. Oh my goodness
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.340]   The iPhone yes, that's what I hope you'll be saying
[00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:30.940]   I was about to say we're just that's that's what it's gonna be a lot of that
[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:38.620]   This is the iPhone 4 if you hold it funny. You're holding it wrong the battery. I mean the the signal strength meter
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.100]   Slowly goes
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.100]   Down to zero if you hold it just right
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:48.140]   And we demonstrated on the show on the product and I think this too is the introduction of Apple
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:53.180]   Proudly displaying their facilities where they do testing
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:57.100]   So this was let's show you these weird shaped rooms with
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.340]   the foam
[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:04.220]   Pieces that that shaped the signal so that we can show you how detailed we are about this
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:08.060]   And we tested this and we did this and even though we tested it
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:13.820]   Well, there might be something wrong here. So you can get a free bumper and I think that now
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:17.980]   Looking at what apple does that sort of has become a part of
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:25.580]   Every presentation that they do where you get to see the acoustic foam of the of the studios that they're using for
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:32.540]   Shaping the way that their home pod works or what what have you when antenna gate first happened Steve jabs didn't buy it
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:36.140]   Remember that's the you're holding it wrong. Right. Yeah, he said now. I'm not good
[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:41.820]   He was in Hawaii. He was staying at a kona village. There's a beautiful resort and kona
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.020]   on
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.540]   on the big island and
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:50.380]   Was really mad that he was forced to cut his vacation sure and fly back to kubertino
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.580]   He took his son read who at the time I think was probably
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:58.060]   Pretty young nine or ten. He said I want you to see
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:01.020]   How it works in business
[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.260]   And so read sat in on these meetings
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:09.020]   I'd love read for read to tell that story at some point sat in on all those meetings was Steve going
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:13.900]   I'm not I'm not finally apple came up with a plastic bumper to put around and they gave to everybody
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.380]   So that you would not
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:21.580]   Kind of a standard because apple has made a couple other design mistakes and
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:29.900]   Their pattern is let's not own up to it for a while. Oh, okay. We can't ignore it. Right keyboard. Perhaps. Yeah. Yes. Oh my god
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:35.580]   They haven't really owned up to the keyboard. Yes. Yeah, but did they take it out?
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:40.620]   They only took it on one at the new one and all the old ones are still selling my fingers are breaking right now typing on this
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.620]   Got it right now. Yeah, you've got 16
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:44.620]   No
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.660]   Mary Jo is using the new
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.740]   Three
[00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:54.860]   And you like it a lot. Yep. That's a really good keyboard. It's a great keyboard. It's laughable
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:59.260]   My guess one I have one blue suede. Oh my gosh Elvis. He's
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:04.220]   Excellent. I remember taking it out of the box and so pretty here's a blast in the past in 2010
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:08.540]   Facebook hit how many how many users you think Facebook had in 2010
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:14.380]   Now it's now what two billion. It's more than the earth's population somehow
[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:17.580]   There's more yet. There's a live people
[00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:23.340]   It was a big deal when Facebook had half a billion users 500 million users in 2010
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.220]   Wow
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.220]   And they had it's like it was
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.460]   2004 when they launched in like
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:34.220]   Seven when they like allowed people who were not in college. Yeah. Yeah, I do it. Yeah, Mike
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:38.300]   I feel like you would know this because you were about that age. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was well
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:40.780]   I think that I was
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:46.060]   Facebook in college? No, well, I did but you didn't have to be in college to have Facebook by the time
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.020]   I was in college at Facebook
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:51.180]   I was in high school when you had to be in college to have Facebook actually speaking of Facebook
[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:56.380]   The man of the year in 2010 time magazine cover boy mark Zuckerberg
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.260]   That would not happen again. No, no
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:04.300]   Not again. It was also I I was surprised when I saw this in my research
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.260]   That was the year google quit china. It was 2010
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.420]   It was that long ago
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:14.140]   And of course last year there were rumors google was making a custom search engine for the finish
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.140]   Was it this year?
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:19.420]   Yeah, 2019. Yeah, was it yeah, I was like when are we airing this?
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.380]   Back down on it. No, it was just it was earlier this year. Yeah
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.300]   Uh
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.940]   Big deal windows seven came out in 2010
[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:30.460]   Now, which we last right the last great windows
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:35.660]   Yeah, maybe not. It's still running on lots of things now. I'm affected by it. I have it at home
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:40.140]   I use it every every show when I'm at home. Really? Is that what you're using? Yeah, so
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:41.820]   it's
[00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:46.620]   In about a couple of weeks. I know it's gonna be out of support no more tech support
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:50.220]   14 2020 it's all over. We've got a count on time ago
[00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:56.940]   Microsoft gives you 10 years, right? Right 10 years of support free support after that if you want support you have to pay
[00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.660]   Oh another very very big
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:07.740]   Thing that happened that probably none of you remember in 2010 was a exploit called fire sheep
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:14.220]   Now you don't know this one but steve gibson and I talked about this an awful lot because it allowed somebody sitting in a wifi
[00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:23.660]   Open wifi access point with you a coffee shop to hijack your facebook and just start posting stuff on your facebook because fire sheep because
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:28.460]   You didn't have an https connection with facebook at the time it was unencrypted
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:35.020]   So when you first opened facebook on your laptop you would send the cookie that said i'm mary jofoli
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:38.940]   Out through the unencrypted channel the hacker would be able to grab it
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:42.700]   Put it on his laptop and then be mary jofoli or be stacy
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:50.460]   And so but the reason it's important besides the fact that it was a kind of a shocking thing is now thanks to that https
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:57.020]   Ah, yes, https is everywhere. Yes, and there's even now at this point. We're starting to shame for not having a yes support
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:05.020]   That's right. So you can that started in 2010. Thanks to the sheep that was on fire. The other very big story was this was when wiki leaks really
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.820]   Uh came to the foreground because they released
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:11.340]   Uh those us diplomatic cables
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:16.220]   They also released the bradley manning material now chelsey manning
[00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:22.620]   At the time she was an army specialist who released video of drone footage
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:26.220]   Uh killing innocent civilians and journalists
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:32.380]   And that was a real shocker and this at this time wiki leaks was really considered
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:38.540]   A do-gooder. Yes, not a front for the russians. Yeah, and I don't know if they were at this time
[00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:42.940]   Yeah, the material was obtained by wiki leaks 220 cables
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:48.220]   Some redacted at the time wiki leaks cared a little bit more to protect diplomatic sources
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:53.980]   Uh it put out the first installment on uh on november late november, uh 2010
[00:26:55.180 --> 00:27:00.380]   Uh lots of embarrassment the white house condemned it in the strongest terms
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:07.660]   It was the beginning of a decade of revelation about what the us government is up to
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:12.300]   I think that and i'm wondering too if you folks think it was also the beginning of
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:17.180]   a little bit more cultural awareness of
[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:20.700]   uh of of sort of the role that
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:26.620]   technology and and uh especially someone who you know is working with classified documents in this way
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:32.620]   Um how that all works like yeah instead of just traditional espionage where we think of uh james bond now
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:38.780]   We're talking about cyber espionage and I feel like it entered into the public sector a little bit more
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:42.540]   And we became more aware of it because of this and now
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:49.180]   Even more so today we have to think about that whenever we think about what the cia is doing to protect us the fbi etc
[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:52.860]   The other thing that's different cyber edward snoed and we're going to get to him
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.980]   Uh was very careful about how he released the information
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:00.780]   Uh wiki leaks eventually just started dumping it in this case the times which was given
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.820]   More than a quarter million cables withheld
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:09.900]   A lot after consulting with the state department withheld a lot of the information from the articles and from the documents to protect
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:14.380]   Diplomats uh people who would be at risk intelligence agents and so forth
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:19.260]   Um the white house said that the uh wiki leaks would make several hundred thousand cables
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.020]   available
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:24.700]   Sunday night, but 220 were uh or first posted in that first
[00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:30.060]   Tronch of people's and I think that influenced how snoed and came forward working through green wall
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:34.300]   I would argue though. I think you're right. Yeah, you probably looked at that and said, uh, I gotta do better than that
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:39.660]   And there there are ways to that helps protect him too from right there
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:46.140]   But I would say that I think it was actually snoedons revelations that really started people thinking about
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:52.700]   And because I think the nsa was tapping into you know phone lines and that sort of thing
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:58.460]   Even though prior to that we had the atnt revelations, which I don't know if those were in 2010
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:02.380]   Lower. Yeah, I think that was earlier. Yeah, I think it was too
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:06.780]   So we kind of this was the whole deck the story of the whole decade is a complete
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:09.500]   uh reversal of how people
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:14.220]   Felt about government about technology and about government spying that really was one of the
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:19.660]   That is that's a big macro threat. Yeah, I saw through all of it a couple of big launches three big launches
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.460]   Instagram launched wow
[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:27.100]   In 2010 in october remember when it was not instagram by facebook it was peekaboo
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.300]   Is that what it was called?
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.820]   It was first called
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:35.020]   I believe it was called peekaboo. Yeah, wow and then uh that was when it was first launched and then they changed it instagram
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:40.940]   Not too long after that google released the c48. It's first chrome book. This was the debut of chrome OS
[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:44.380]   In fact, this must be the year because I remember getting that chrome book
[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.860]   And I remember talking to sundar patchi at that time
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:52.060]   So this must have been the year I first talked to who the man who is now in charge of all of alphabet about
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.180]   uh
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.780]   Chrome OS and
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:56.780]   I was saying this is stupid
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:00.220]   Who would pay my good money for just the browser
[00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:05.900]   And to his credit and then this is why I think the world of sundar patchi didn't get mad. He didn't he was very
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:10.620]   He was understanding and he explained his and he was absolutely right
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:15.420]   They even came around to windows journalist with chrome books and they said hey you should try this
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.900]   I remember them showing it to me. I'm like wait what?
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.900]   I would you
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:25.260]   And remember the pond stars ads they brought in the pond stars micha's off did say well
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:29.660]   I'm not gonna give you money for it. You can't do anything with it. I remember asking
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:33.420]   Can you but can you use apps offline and they were like why would anyone do that?
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:37.420]   And i'm like i can think of a lot of reasons many reasons i've not talked about an airplane
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:42.540]   But now i mean yeah when i'm offline my computer is i have pages i think
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.420]   That's it. Yeah
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:49.900]   I uh, I also let me go to uh, because this was the last year
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:52.380]   That we were in the cottage
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:53.260]   Oh
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:57.260]   Broadcasting out of the cottage. I think a lot of you probably don't remember the cottage
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:01.740]   Let me see if I could find me. 2010 was the last year. Yeah, we were still in the cottage at that time
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:04.140]   And let me show you why we moved
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:05.820]   2011 was the last year
[00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:11.820]   We moved in 2011 is that right? Oh, okay. Well, we'll get to that then i'll save it one more year
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:16.700]   For some reason I thought we moved in that 2010 we moved in 2011 you're right. Okay, it's because time flies when you're having fun
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.100]   It was the last full year we were in the cottage
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:24.700]   And we moved into the brick house studio in july of 2011. Okay
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:30.380]   I I will show you though because I think uh everybody should see why we moved
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:34.700]   I will show you what a typical twit episode looked like in 2010
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:41.980]   And it wasn't it was it's time for twit episode 3d. I am I am in the cottage with
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.260]   Oh doctor who is a rather large fella
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:49.660]   Joshua toposkeys on the on the skyposaurus behind me
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:52.860]   And then and so is brian ryan block who is at the time?
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:58.140]   I think he just started gadget his new gadget block after leaving in gadget and that's loiek lemur the french
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:02.300]   Who apparently brought wine did that just roll you just rolled that up to the desk?
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:06.860]   Yeah, that desk in front. Yeah that little table that's amazing and that's the same day
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:11.260]   I'm on the same desk, but uh, but we had to fit people in and roll them up
[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:14.220]   Roll up a little table who's that in the little chair back there?
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:18.060]   There's somebody a little chair. Oh, maybe that's now that's just the one down there
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:21.980]   They're often well believe it or not there was enough room in there that there could be people
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:26.140]   On the side on the side sitting there could have been somebody sitting in the chair there
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:30.380]   And I was switching the whole thing. I had a little a little word in front of me
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:34.460]   To switch. Yeah, I was hardly working. I mean working hard
[00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:42.300]   Everybody's got wine. I think yeah, we uh loiek did free which was a innovative broadband business in france
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:47.180]   He's still doing it. It's ilean now, right? Yeah, and remember he did seismic. Do you remember seism?
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:54.060]   That was his first american startup. Joshua now, uh, he started the outline just sold that recently. I think
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:58.060]   Um, so yeah, this it's actually fun going through the old
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:03.660]   Shows because oh a lot of a lot of people under the bridge
[00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:08.060]   Like no
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:11.900]   Let's see
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.900]   Go over the bridge the water goes under
[00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:18.380]   What what was the third product launch? We've talked about I said azure chrome
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:22.140]   I didn't mention azure that was just floating around in your head
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:30.300]   Azure launched all that time ago. Oh, my oh microsoft cloud play. Do you remember the early days of azure?
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:34.300]   I do in fact so here's a little nice piece of trivia
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:39.900]   Codename of azure red dog. Why why it was named after a strip club
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:46.140]   That was the pink poodle, but they were too like scandalized to use pink poodle. So they called it red dog
[00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:51.500]   What not making this up? Wow. So we should let everybody know mary joe
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:56.380]   Used to I don't think you do anymore sneak around at microsoft. It happens. They know
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:58.700]   They know her face by now
[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.980]   Things happen. She is really good at getting those stories
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:08.940]   Yeah, but so 10 yeah 10 years ago azure didn't exist and they just took a bunch of the guys who worked on windows server and they said
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.340]   Guys we want you to build a cloud
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:17.020]   Go do it figure it out. Yeah, cuz amazon's had been out by four like four years by that time. They were like, uh, yeah
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:19.900]   This has happened in trying to get in on this. Yep. That's mega work
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:25.900]   Yep, and it was it was at the time we were like, oh, yeah azure. It's kind of a big deal. I guess who knows, you know
[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:33.180]   And now it's everything it was everything it's they announced it in 2008, but they didn't really make it public in segull february 2010 right?
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:39.260]   Right. Yeah, they were working on it. They went public about working on it. That's when ray aussie was still ray aussie
[00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:45.980]   That was his thing wasn't it was yeah. Yeah. He was the chief software architect who replaced bill gates as a chief software architect. Wow
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:47.580]   So
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:52.700]   That what has really changed is in those days windows 7 was the money maker microsoft office
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:35:00.140]   By now 10 years later those don't make much I mean they might still make a lot of me. They're not important as
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:04.540]   Really the pro originally it was called windows azure
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:10.300]   Window that's right. It was windows azure for long windows azure until a month after
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:11.660]   um
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:18.060]   Satcha nadella right april 2014 they renamed it microsoft azure and this is why I like such a yeah
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:25.740]   He gets it. He got it. Well, we're gonna get to that because that was a topic of long conversations on twit for many months
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:31.820]   Uh, but first let's take a break before we get to 2011. Oh dear. I'm gonna speed it up. I'm gonna speed it up
[00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:36.700]   I gotta tell you it's really it's really bottom heavy because actually that this decade
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:40.220]   was much more the beginning of the decade was when all this
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:45.420]   Fermitt happened and in the last three years. It's a lot of it's just been kind of
[00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:46.860]   coasting
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:49.900]   Consolidation and and mostly trying to figure out what's next
[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:57.740]   Yeah, so uh, it's really if you do this if you go through them one by one as I did the years and gather the stories
[00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:03.340]   You really notice it's slow the innovation seems to slow down about halfway through I did two
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:08.540]   Like how much how many drinks are the first half
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:16.700]   This is the second half. Well, no, it's very detailed in the first half coming up though the worst viral video of all time
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:21.180]   I don't know what that is. No you many they remember this
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:24.220]   No, he's not no
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:30.700]   Uh, but first a word from our sponsor and you know this is another great thing stamps.com has been a sponsor the entire decade. Wow

[00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:08.780]   Did this come out? Okay, you feel 2011. I know come on
[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:12.460]   Play the audio go ahead
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:30.300]   There's even a rap break in this
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.300]   Oh
[00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:41.580]   The perils of youth trying to figure out which seat to take
[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:49.820]   So the story behind is actually interesting she was I feel bad for she pulled it off of youtube
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:52.220]   Because she was reviled
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:59.420]   For it people thought oh she thinks she's the next big thing and she's gonna put it on and but the truth is this was a
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:01.900]   Vanity production
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:04.860]   Parents used to be able to go to this company
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.260]   I think it was probably for her bought mitzvah
[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:10.300]   They'd go to this company and they'd say okay
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:17.260]   Rebecca wants to make a video and they paid the company a thousand bucks and they'd make you know not a great video
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:22.940]   And but it somehow got on to youtube and became huge
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:25.580]   Now I feel like this might be
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.900]   Is this a remake or maybe not?
[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:33.580]   No, that's that's an original song the company did original they did original songs. Oh wow
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:40.380]   I didn't know this whole backstory. Yeah, in fact, they even they must have brought in some sort of rap star. Here's
[00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:43.180]   Here's the break
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:50.540]   I'm thinking
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:56.860]   In the video, I was thinking they made this guy did a hundred names a day
[00:40:56.860 --> 00:41:01.100]   Yeah, right and they so that's why it's her name at the very beginning
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:05.660]   Do you remember that simpsons where home or buys the book for lisa and it's like
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:13.820]   It's like one day a girl and her dog went to the name lisa lisa simpson, you know, it's very funny
[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:17.740]   So I feel bad for yeah, she was 13 years old
[00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:20.540]   It was a huge deal
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:24.220]   Uh, it was the I think probably the viral video
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:29.260]   When you're 13 how trim I mean like so much drama
[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:35.900]   And I don't know if she made money in her or not but uh the chat room says that the person that's doing the rap is the
[00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:42.060]   Is the guy or the video the guy who does it and produces and probably makes sense because who else they're gonna get right
[00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:52.940]   She's okay now. They've done like a where they now kind of yeah, and she's she's
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:56.380]   Did we do that on twig the star wars guy?
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:42:01.020]   Also, it was so humiliated he went to this the high school av room
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:03.900]   This is before this the av room and videoed himself
[00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:09.260]   With a lightsaber fake lifesaver and then some mean kids from the school found it
[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:12.780]   Released it. He didn't forgive them permission and he was humiliated
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:15.660]   Uh, but he said i'm glad it happened now because
[00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:20.940]   Somebody says it's not the viral video of the year, but if you want to give me a nominee in the chat
[00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:23.660]   Yeah, what is the viral video?
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:27.580]   Also, I heard she does not like she doesn't look forward to fridays anymore
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:36.540]   So then that she's okay. She's kind of what goes what comes around goes around it was in 2011 or january that larry page
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:41.260]   The founder of google became the ceo once again eric schmidt
[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:45.580]   Remember it was hired for quote adult supervision. Yes
[00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:49.420]   uh, he stepped down he became executive chairman and larry
[00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:51.340]   took
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:55.180]   Back the role that he had created when he launched google in
[00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:58.060]   1998
[00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:03.580]   Uh, so how and now of course larry and sergé as of last wednesday have decided to step down
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:08.620]   So really that this was the decade of larry page's google i don't think
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:13.740]   It's not as steve bomber bad now, but i don't think it was the best decade for
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:21.420]   A middling affair, but this is their third era. So, you know, he's he's right now. Well, that would actually make him the lowest
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:30.940]   He's only 46. Okay. Well, he's pretty young. I think google's done. Well this last decade. I yeah, I mean, it's not like they didn't make money
[00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.260]   I'm not saying that but I think that
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:38.540]   As we come to the end of the decade, they're not exactly the shining stars of silicon valley
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:42.620]   I know they're not the shining stars of silicon valley. I still can retain that right
[00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:46.220]   But they they did see trends that are going to affect their business coming
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:52.540]   They still reinvested and that's that's tough to do so i'm in there starting to do enterprise stuff
[00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:55.180]   Which we know mary jose loves
[00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:59.180]   Makes consumers just all about the enterprise all it matters
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:08.060]   2011 I I did a little research right before the show because I was curious because we were talking about how everybody here has a 16 by 9 inch
[00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:14.220]   Screening server mary jofoli microsoft when they were started releasing surfaces did three by two screens
[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:20.060]   Which I think was brilliant and maybe a little bit informed by the apple ipad which is also 3 by 2
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:26.780]   But it but 2011 was also when computers stopped coming with 16 with with anything with four by three screens with anything
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:33.420]   But 16 by 9 and I had a quote from the wikipedia article about it from somebody from samsung who said
[00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:40.220]   It's so expensive now to make 16 by to make anything but 16 by 9 that's all we're going to do
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:44.060]   Benny butler product nature yt products
[00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:51.900]   Samsung south africa said all and all monitors capable of 1920 by 1200 are not being manufactured anymore
[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:53.980]   It's all about reducing manufacturing costs
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:58.540]   The 16 by 9 ratio panels are the most cost effective to manufacture
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:00.940]   Capitalism wins again
[00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:07.260]   But you guys are saying it was like 16 by 9 and I took a lot of getting used to
[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:12.860]   To move to the surface. Really? You see so much more information on your screen. It's like way denser
[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:16.620]   My eyes are used to looking across in that. Yeah vertically
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:24.460]   It was it was in 2011 that the alarms were first raised that we would have to stop using ipv4 that we are going to
[00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:29.980]   Remember this? Oh, yes for 10 years. We are going to run out of ip addresses. They're going to run out
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:36.460]   It's happening. Europe just ran out like two weeks ago. It just happened that rypes.com said we don't have any more
[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:40.380]   The problem there were a couple of reasons that we didn't run out
[00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:44.540]   In 2011 when they said we're gonna they called it the ipocalypse
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:47.100]   the oculips
[00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:54.300]   Side note ipv6 was the impetus behind one of my favorite headlines of all time
[00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:57.260]   Which was blob law something about ipv6
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:00.620]   Because I was so tired you wrote that blob law
[00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:05.100]   I was so tired of writing about something that was clearly
[00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:09.020]   Nobody cared about it was not actually happening. Oh, that's great
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:16.540]   And it was after actually microsoft bought a company that had because what happened is people bought ipv6 addresses stockpiled them
[00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:21.820]   And thought they were going to be some sort of investment thing. Right. And the other thing is people were doing fine with nat and other
[00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:25.260]   It was and it was especially carrier nat where the isp
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:28.940]   Did the nat and so it didn't matter it was fine
[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:31.260]   And for some people it was awesome
[00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:35.180]   Because it messed up with geolocation and all of this stuff
[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:41.980]   And this is also personal note to me or for me. This is when I discovered that people in the UK call it a rudder
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:48.940]   Oh really? Yes, it's not a router there. It's also in uh in australia and they so way, but root has a define
[00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:51.980]   I know and so that's a little bit of people in australia
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:57.180]   There's a stacy's article. Yeah, blah blah blah something about
[00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:00.780]   And also this is an excellent picture unless you repent
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:06.860]   It's the stock art era in uh, that is the best headline you win. Yeah
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:09.900]   This is by the way, this is uh on gig ome
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:13.580]   Yes, which is your old home on the internet ome mallex wonderful
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:18.700]   And sorely missed tech blog at the time it was going great guns in fact
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:24.940]   Uh one of the stories from 2011 is how ome just raised another $6 million I think
[00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:30.540]   Um by uh with venture venture capital because he was trying to get into the research business
[00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:33.260]   Oh, and that that went well
[00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:34.620]   Um
[00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:36.780]   I believe it is the reason why we ended up
[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:39.500]   Uh gone folded. Yeah
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:42.140]   Moving ahead. Yes, but boy it was great
[00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:47.020]   And you know what ome's doing fine in fact all of the gig ome alumni seem to be doing pretty well
[00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:49.980]   Including you I mean I have a drinking problem, but other
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:57.020]   I mean we're fine. No, we I think it wasn't a good uh 2011 was not a good year for online
[00:47:57.020 --> 00:47:58.220]   uh
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:47:59.820]   Stop a
[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:04.380]   journalism for instance is there a all bought the huffington post remember that yeah
[00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:06.060]   Uh
[00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:09.180]   Actually probably was really good for Ariana huffington who probably made a lot of money
[00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:11.020]   But it wasn't so great for the rest of the huff poh
[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:15.180]   Uh or its readers rooport moi do you remember this rooport mordock?
[00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:17.980]   beautiful news
[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:25.020]   Studio in New York city to launch the daily which is going to be an ipad only newspaper hired a bunch of kurillas
[00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:26.540]   Yes
[00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:28.380]   went belly up quick
[00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:29.980]   Kind
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:30.940]   Lost the kin
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:33.100]   The kin you're right. Yes lost a lot of money
[00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:38.860]   But I've talked to people worked for the daily who said well you should have seen that newsroom boy was that that was sweet
[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:40.940]   That was fancy. That's sad
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:42.140]   Yeah, I think
[00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:49.020]   What you're what you're seeing at the beginning of the decade is the turmoil that went on that's gone on with all with journalism in general
[00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:52.620]   Online journalism in particular throughout the decade and if jeff were here
[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:56.380]   I'm sure he could give us a crash course and all of it. Oh jeff jarvis knows it all
[00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:59.980]   By the way, he was a regular on our shows in those uh those early days as well
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:02.460]   I didn't know you yet. So that's okay
[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:06.620]   But I have to say I did read you and in all of the folks at gig ole
[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:11.020]   That was a great versus an ome was on a lot. We had ome on all the time at the time
[00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:16.220]   We called him the yoda of tech that is so amro poh for um, yes
[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:20.620]   He's still now. He's the yoda photography. Yeah boy. It's your photographer
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:26.140]   January 2011 ibm's watson wins at jeffordy finally
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:29.740]   Poor watson now, right? Yeah
[00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:37.740]   Watson is drunk somewhere in an alley. Yeah, not doing so well. I played watson in 2012. I did lose
[00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:44.060]   Um, what did you play? How did you play? I played jeffordy with him at the computer history museum. Oh, and the first category
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:50.780]   Was states that are anagrams, which is terrible for a computer. Yeah, or it's great for a computer
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:58.060]   I was like really really they're loading the game against it basically my colleague was a vc who was a
[00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:00.940]   I think he was a nuclear physicist
[00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:03.260]   And we teamed up together
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:11.980]   With the audience and we still lost so yeah watson, but now not so much well, but that actually is a important point
[00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:14.060]   because
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:17.980]   the only really interesting skill watson had was parsing the question
[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:23.900]   Because it wasn't given the questions ahead of time. Well, the natural language understanding because it had a database
[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:29.580]   Of the answers and the ability to compute all of these if you were allowed to play jeffordy with google
[00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:31.260]   Yeah, you'd win
[00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:39.980]   You'd win so the only thing at all interesting about that was was understanding the question it had 200 million pages worth of information
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:45.020]   Uh in its state of back it it you know, and it was an 80 teraflop machine
[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:50.380]   So i'm going to say this because I remember writing after my thing with watson
[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:53.180]   I remember writing about how watson was different from syri
[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:58.140]   So I had to look it up and syri was launched in february 2010. I know we're going back a whole year
[00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:03.820]   Oh, I didn't I didn't have that in here that is very relevant launched with the iphone 4
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:11.100]   Yeah, so there you go. You're absolutely right. That's pretty important. You know, it's you know what great thing was launched in 2011
[00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:13.900]   google plus oh my god
[00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:16.540]   You got my hopes up
[00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:24.940]   It was also the year that the tablets everybody said oh this ipad's gonna eat our lunch
[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:27.820]   Remember the hp touchpad?
[00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:32.380]   We had webOS on it. Hey jay bought they had bought they had bought palm
[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:37.100]   And uh made webOS. Do you remember the motorola?
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:44.700]   zoom x o o m oh definitely my favorite no I remember the blackberry playbook
[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:48.300]   I do remember that actually all of the massive flops
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:49.580]   Yeah
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:54.780]   Uh because they weren't ipads in fact it really wasn't until the next year when amazon came along with the fire tablet

[00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:41.500]   Okay, yeah words with friends cinga they're they're still in our old building also microsoft debuted windows 8
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:43.340]   mmm

[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:49.180]   So i'm gonna take you to trivia night and leave lio behind
[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:52.540]   Good plan. It's all up here mica
[00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:54.460]   2012
[00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:58.380]   She's better than once. Well, there's certain bad dates that are embedded in
[00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:01.900]   And windows 8 was one of them. What was wrong with windows 8?
[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:04.540]   We're to begin
[00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:09.740]   I'm going to show a little video because this was probably steve jobs last
[00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:13.180]   public appearance the city council meeting
[00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:15.980]   of kubertino steve was
[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:20.140]   Visibly ill from pancreatic cancer
[00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:24.780]   Apple has kind of hidden his illness for a long time, but by now everybody knew
[00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:28.380]   Packard has been shrinking lately. He wasn't a great shape
[00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:34.140]   Property and we bought he got the city council to prove we bought the apple spaceship campus
[00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:37.900]   It was his last I think his last great creation and this was his last
[00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:43.180]   uh great appearance of course steve passed away later that year I remember them asking
[00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:43.740]   um
[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:46.220]   So could we maybe get some like
[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:52.620]   Infrastructure built out from you while if we're going to pass this uh if we're going to let you build the spaceship
[00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:58.060]   Could maybe you sort of help us out in the city and I was his response with something about
[00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:02.700]   We're paying a bunch of taxes. So just use those to do
[00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:05.740]   Yeah, did you ever interview him by the way steve jobs?
[00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:10.380]   Uh, no, I'm not a fan of interviewing ceos. We will get to your big unit
[00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.940]   You're interviewing a little bit. Did you really?
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:19.340]   Intelligent remember that. Oh god. Yeah pink. Oh, that was the that was the IBM for the pink poodle
[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:22.940]   No, it was the ill-fated ibm apple collaboration
[00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:26.940]   Right and so when they were I worked a pc week then and they were really trying to promote it and they said
[00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:29.900]   Do you want to come interview steve jobs? I'm like, yeah, I do. Yeah, yep
[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:36.780]   That was very gracious. He was gracious. He was gracious and if you were somebody who could do him a service
[00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:41.740]   He would stroke you he would take care of you. Yeah, mossberg very famously
[00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:48.140]   Uh was you know well loved by steve jobs. Yeah. Yeah, I my only experiences steve jobs is as I spent a
[00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:56.060]   Fourth of july weekend with him when he was at next did you really his family and lisa was there wow his daughter? Oh man, and um
[00:54:56.060 --> 00:54:58.620]   He
[00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:01.340]   I think didn't just didn't think I could do any good for him
[00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:09.100]   So he just kind of ignored me most of the time the only time he really said anything to me is when we were playing volleyball and
[00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:15.980]   He wasn't happy with my performance and he yelled at me a little bit. Um, you need to set better
[00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:18.860]   Just kind of like that. Yeah
[00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:23.500]   Uh, he was there with uh loreen his wife who was wonderful very gracious
[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:29.980]   Um, and she liked your volleyball performance. Some read was there. He was I read I read uh child children's story to read
[00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:36.780]   Oh, that's really wow. This was must have been too sad 1995 or six because he went back to apple shortly after that
[00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:40.940]   Uh, so I can't talk about it because it's not this decade. Sorry. Sorry
[00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:44.220]   Okay
[00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:46.220]   Along
[00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:48.540]   Nukem forever finally came out and who's he?
[00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:55.740]   Yeah, this was an internet. This was like a meme because it never came out and never finally like years after promised
[00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:57.900]   It was it was one of the great vaporware
[00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:01.900]   Okay, cool. Thank you car system
[00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:06.380]   You want to put it on the list? How about mount mount gox do you remember mount gox?
[00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:10.380]   Is that bit the bitcoin exchange? It was hacked and closed
[00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:15.500]   After people lost a lot of bitcoin and that was when bitcoin was maybe a hundred bucks
[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:22.780]   You know, it wasn't it wasn't what it ended up being you will know this stacey in march the first lte phone came out
[00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:26.700]   They call it forg, but it was the first true lte phone from htc
[00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:29.580]   It was called
[00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:33.420]   I want to say the torpedo, but they couldn't oh there was the thunderbolt thunderbolts
[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:37.660]   Couldn't possibly become the torpedo. I owned that you owned the thunderbolt
[00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:44.300]   Yeah, the thunderbolt as well. Here's bonnie chaff from cnet with review. This was argued with the most important phone
[00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:46.300]   the my
[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:49.980]   The hp. What was it? What was the one that sprint launched?
[00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:53.340]   the palm pre or no, uh, it was
[00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:57.260]   The evo the evo first 4g phone
[00:56:57.900 --> 00:56:59.900]   Yeah, this was a 4g
[00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:03.020]   That's I had the htc
[00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:07.820]   No, that was a phone later, okay, but it did have that htc look
[00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:15.500]   I just see it was a big fan sense. That's what it was. Oh my god. I remember the kickstand
[00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:17.980]   That phone used to get so hot in my pocket
[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:23.660]   The battery would in a good way or a very bad way an uncomfortable way
[00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:29.340]   It was in class trying to take notes and this thing's burning my my it was fast people were blown away
[00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:35.500]   Yes, by the 4g speed so 4g started 10 years ago. It's kind of I remember
[00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:37.980]   uh bringing that into
[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:40.860]   Revision 3 and people thinking it was so huge
[00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:49.660]   It's a fablet big it wasn't a fablet, but it was at the time four inches. Yeah, it wasn't that big 4.2 inches
[00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:55.980]   Yeah, by the way, you can also see the subsidy in this cnet review because the mrs
[00:57:55.980 --> 00:58:01.180]   470 bucks, but at verizon it's 125 bucks with two-year contracts
[00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:06.700]   So what you're saying is that like almost 10 years ago phones were half the price of what they are
[00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:09.580]   I mean this phone was half half half and it this
[00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:13.420]   Well, I don't think we even had the term flagship phone at the time, but this was
[00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:18.060]   flagship phone a fancy to go back harlem shake was a pretty
[00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:20.780]   viral trend
[00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:24.620]   A
[00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:26.860]   Did you ever do that?
[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:28.860]   I have video of it
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:34.940]   Uh, was that what year was that though? I don't think that was this year. I uh, we'll get to the harlem shake
[00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:40.060]   I thought they were nominating for most part was a big one and there is a video of me doing the harlem shake
[00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:42.220]   I will never live down
[00:58:42.220 --> 00:58:44.220]   And berg will never forgive me for john
[00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:49.900]   You know it's you know it shipped in 2011 the light row camera. That's all the weird
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:55.340]   Yeah, you didn't have to focus it because it would take a picture in multiple focal lengths
[00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:59.180]   You decide after the fact and it was a it did ray
[00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:04.700]   Kind of like ray tracing and people thought this was the next big thing in photography
[00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:12.540]   I remember ome writing a because I edited it it was like a two or three thousand word blog post about this thing
[00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:14.620]   Yeah, and I just was like
[00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:19.660]   Blah, blah, blah
[00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:21.980]   Blah, blah
[00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:27.260]   It was it was disappointing. I mean it was that wasn't one of the big debuts of the year
[00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:29.580]   We're bigger debuts. We're just reminding you that it happened
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:33.500]   It happened game of thrones came out for the the first season was that was in 2011
[00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:36.620]   And we still don't have the last book, but i'm not complaining
[00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:44.060]   George rr Martin got so engrossed in watching the show that he forgot to write the next the next chapter
[00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:46.300]   Oh, did spotify come in this year?
[00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:50.860]   Spotify now this I think people and people like you probably don't even
[00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:57.500]   Remember a time in your life when there wasn't any spotify mike. I remember when it was not in the us and it came
[00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:01.260]   Yeah, it was a stand. No ex-cited and sweet. I had a I had a
[01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:04.540]   This it secret sweetest account. I read it sweetest spotify
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:11.020]   That reminds me so turntable fm was around this time. Does anyone remember that? I think was that where you could yes
[01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:13.420]   in fact, I left out the stories because
[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:19.100]   But we could talk about it. Sorry. That was so fun though. I loved turntable wasn't it collaborative?
[01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:20.220]   It was the rise in
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:22.220]   DJ. I remember that that was fun
[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:25.660]   And you somebody would be a dj and you choose the songs
[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:26.140]   Yes
[01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:31.740]   And then people in the front would be dancing and making signs and they immediately got sued
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:33.260]   Yeah
[01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:39.660]   And then they pivoted and then they went out wait. I'm reading that spotify could bring back that feature
[01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:42.540]   Yeah, that's next day
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:45.580]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry turntable fm was great
[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:52.940]   Meg Whitman left ebaity become ceo of hp hp had gone through as you remember a rocky rocky few years
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:57.260]   Oh, that was the post heard. Yeah, the hire mark heard who got fired for the
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:03.660]   inappropriate he hired somebody there's actually a funny piece. I was watching with me and de Vorac
[01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:07.180]   Talking about what he did
[01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:13.260]   Somebody said a hooker and I said she wasn't a hooker. She was a greeter and they said oh, that's what you call them
[01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:17.900]   She she had hired a young woman to be a greeter at hp functions
[01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:23.660]   And then he got in trouble with the board because he used company money to take her out to dinner and whatever else
[01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:30.140]   So he got fired larry ellison immediately said that's the stupidest thing I ever heard and hired him to be a great guy
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:36.860]   That he was he rents loracle for a long time. Yep. He passed a show so only recently passed
[01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:42.700]   Uh, and then he was followed by leo apotheca right a whole bunch of scandals. Oh
[01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:47.980]   That's a name. He bought autonomy. Yes. Oh, what was autonomy?
[01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:54.060]   enterprise software. Yeah, well apparently autonomy actually wasn't anything
[01:01:54.060 --> 01:02:02.460]   He believed that they had a product and something useful due diligence on it didn't do enough deal diligence spent a ton of money on it
[01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:06.220]   Nave it was actual fraud and there was fraud in his account. Yeah, and he ended up
[01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:09.740]   They took a big write-off for that. So after those
[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:17.660]   Rough spots. I think there might have been somebody else in there. Wait. This was when hp was this when they were spying on journalists?
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:21.740]   Yes, this was also the tech that where they call a pretexting scandal
[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:26.540]   There were a number of hp scandals with the board of directors as well. This was the pretexting
[01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:30.620]   Okay. Yep. So uh, they they went out and they got Meg Whitman
[01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:36.540]   And you know what? I think that was at least her tenure at hp was not rocky right
[01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:40.540]   HP had gone through some really tough times before that remember the
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:47.500]   Horrific merger with was a gateway. Who did they buy the cow company the cow company?
[01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:49.980]   And they bought the cow
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:56.060]   That's a life you got to the cow box. Yeah. Yeah, I remember having a date. They've done. Yeah, HP's had a
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:03:01.180]   It's been rough a run big launches in 2011 includes snapchat. Whoa
[01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:10.060]   Uh snap actually snapchat was the one maybe I got the name wrong for instagram. I think snapchat was originally peekaboo
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:15.340]   I think I got that wrong. It was it was created by Stanford graduate students
[01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:22.620]   Maybe no, maybe it was instagram that was peekaboo evan spiegel and the other yeah, because oh, okay. Yeah, you know, wait a minute
[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:25.020]   So regi brown
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:28.220]   Found it in april 2011 in a femoral messaging platform
[01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:33.100]   They launched in evan spiegel's living room fathers living room under the name peekaboo
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:41.100]   after evan spiegel and bobby murphy forced regi brown the company in 2012 they renamed it snapchat
[01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:43.180]   And
[01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:44.780]   That is a saga
[01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:53.580]   That's something it was compact by the way compact not not gateway was ca. Oh, the hp compact is merger is a textbook example of a bad merger
[01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:55.980]   A merger that just didn't go well
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:04:00.780]   Uh, yes, of course. What am I thinking about gateway hoopa gateway? I know compact
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:05.580]   It's like a fish eating a fish eating a fish
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:11.900]   Amazon released its first fire tablet. Okay, the only tablet released the year
[01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:18.140]   Acer bought a yes, I'm like who bought a sir. Nobody nobody yet. Nobody yet. Yeah. Yeah
[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:25.100]   This is where memory is not a good servant and so we have this is where google comes in
[01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:29.500]   Like who's my external brain? I want to before we move on from snapchat
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:35.340]   snapchat itself. I feel like this uh that that service sort of launched a whole new
[01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:40.620]   Genre, um, not just of ephemeral apps, but sort of quirky
[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:47.580]   Offbeat that was their philosophy was and I think this was very smart and conscious make it
[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:54.060]   Kind of an impenetrable user interface. How do I what do I there were no controls? Nothing you had to know
[01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:57.820]   Oh, you swipe swipe. So I and here's my theory on it
[01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:03.580]   And I it's never been disproven. I think it's true is that they knew well if you if you don't tell people how to use it
[01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:08.620]   Some bright kid will figure it out and then he'll tell his friends and he'll be the cool kid
[01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:16.220]   And he'll actually virally spread it for you. Whatever they did. It did spread virally very quickly and became it still is I think
[01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:20.460]   Yes, young people. Oh, yeah, the platform of choice. It is which is an interesting
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:24.220]   Really? Yeah, it's I thought they were on on the gram
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:30.700]   Uh, so this is an interesting my youngest brother is an instagram stories guy
[01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:36.780]   Um, my brother born in 90. So he was born in 2000 the youngest brother who's doing instagram stories
[01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:39.980]   The one born in 98 is a snapchat fiend
[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:47.020]   Um, I have a former partner though who's uh just a year younger than I am and he does everything on snapchat
[01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:53.660]   Um, so you get a choice. Interesting. And I use an instagram started each snapchat launches because marx zerkeberg very cat
[01:05:53.660 --> 01:06:00.140]   Oh, yes, copy it. Yeah, try to couldn't buy it. So he said fine. Yeah, we'll just copy it and then
[01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:07.020]   Instagram stories is definitely a copy. Yes, but uh, that was a decision made before marx zerkeberg bought
[01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:12.220]   Instagram they instagrams had uh, the guy that ran instagram
[01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:14.620]   He was the one who decided to copy
[01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:20.460]   Yes kevin's system. Yeah, because there's even I remember this article clearly because I had to write this story before he left
[01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:25.340]   Facebook excited to do that and there's this whole profile where he's like, yeah, we copied snapchat
[01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:27.580]   And he was not ashamed of the fact that he did
[01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:34.380]   Um, and then yeah, I got purchased after that because facebook was still trying to do a couple snapchat clones of its own
[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:37.180]   Before instagram was merged with the company
[01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:45.500]   Other big launches in the year 2011 the first galaxy note the first fabla who first that was a big phone
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.980]   It was I think 5.7. It wasn't giant
[01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:53.740]   Uh, in fact the next year google released the uh, nexus six, which was this the shambo
[01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:55.820]   They call it shambo the killer whale
[01:06:56.540 --> 01:07:00.540]   And it was six inches and it still looks big to me. So there's something going on
[01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:05.660]   Because our screens are bigger than that now, but I think it's the bezels maybe and the size of the
[01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:12.780]   We are only on 2011. I know oh my god. This is this is my face. What I was like the original galaxy note was
[01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:15.980]   5.3 and three
[01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:18.220]   That's the small iphone
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:21.020]   That's amazing. Yeah the current small iphone
[01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:23.980]   uh, and the most important release
[01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:26.780]   of 2011
[01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:31.660]   Minecraft. Oh my word whole generation of kids who've grown up on minecraft
[01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:34.780]   And you know what it's coming back
[01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:41.660]   Thanks to microsoft. We're gonna get to microsoft's acquisition, but boy 2014. Yeah, that really they saved it growing it out
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:44.220]   Three years later. Well
[01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:46.380]   Mojang as it turned out had some
[01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:51.340]   Flaw, it's not the creator of minecraft. Yeah, really and die, but he was a weirdo
[01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:57.740]   To put it nicely. Yes. Yeah, I'm spending the microsoft. No judgment. I hope no one ever says that about me
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:00.140]   he ended up spending the microsoft money to buy a
[01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:07.420]   Mansion in LA that had its own candy room. Yeah, what I'm a room that makes candy or no
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:09.260]   It just had lots of candy in it
[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:14.780]   I rented a house like that once at disneyland and it was awesome and had a candy wall. Yeah, this is a candy wall
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:17.180]   So it's got dispensers of all kinds of candy
[01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:23.660]   I'm gonna tell you the week that I was there were the most hopped up weeks. I've ever had in my life
[01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:28.780]   Everywhere now seems so dangerous to have readily available free candy
[01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:32.140]   And how does it get replenished? That's my thing, right?
[01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:34.780]   We had a person who literally would come a candy person
[01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:39.180]   But now and they checked every two days the candy man came
[01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:45.740]   Oh no, so candy man's scary. I don't want to but now with iot you could actually just automatically send an education. Oh my god
[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:49.020]   You read that see I can live with it if it's just you know
[01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:53.020]   fishes and I love Swedish fish and
[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:57.980]   Good and plenty but if they put her she's kisses if they put chocolate in there we must get tears
[01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:01.740]   Oh, but Swedish kiss Swedish kisses Swedish dishes are so good
[01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:07.580]   I don't want to hear about your love life. Swedish fishes are very Swedish fish are very good
[01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:12.060]   Now can we talk about that for a second? This has nothing to do with any love life Swedish
[01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:15.740]   No, not my love life. There is in recent
[01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:18.620]   years
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:23.660]   An acceptance and this is a linguistic thing. I'm really curious about what you're talking about
[01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:28.060]   to say that the pluralization of fish is fishes. No, it's okay
[01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:31.900]   What is that? So fishes is if you have multiple species of fish
[01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:35.980]   So if you have more than like if you have tetras and catfish, you have fishes
[01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:41.020]   Okay, but if you have Swedish fish then it's just Swedish fish. I'm I have a different theory
[01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:44.060]   What is your theory mine is just right yours is right mine is made up
[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:46.780]   I love this show
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:50.620]   My different and made up theory is it all started with mice
[01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:57.420]   Because this is a mouse right i'm holding the pointing device. What do you call two mouse?
[01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:00.140]   Devices
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:04.620]   No, they're mouse. I would say mice. I would say mouse's. I would say my
[01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:06.620]   They are my
[01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:13.100]   Great theory, but it was a theory. It's ipods pro
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:16.940]   Like attorney's general. It's your pod's prime
[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:22.300]   Yeah, okay. See I like now I know fishes is used when you've got multiple species
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:30.860]   Of species do you remember sopa pippa as we go into 2012. Oh moving on. Yes, sopa pippa
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:33.820]   was
[01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:38.780]   It was a new soap brand sopa it was stop online piracy act
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:43.020]   Pippa was protect ip app. These were copyright
[01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:47.820]   Bills that the internet rose up in protest
[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:50.460]   Go google mozilla flicker
[01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:56.860]   Uh some shut down some went dark. It was the first big web protest
[01:10:56.860 --> 01:11:02.300]   So all of these companies saw that their business model was going to be threatened by
[01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:04.380]   potential lawsuits
[01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:07.900]   And they said holy cow plus their user base
[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:11.820]   Was so against it like everybody on the internet was like oh
[01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:18.140]   And so they actually did these blackouts where they were like in honor of soap pepper stop soap and pippa
[01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:24.380]   You went to these sites now at the bottom you could always click through to get to which we're actually getting to but it was a huge
[01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:30.540]   Deal and we also saw things like twillio was in effect by then but people called their congressmen
[01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:33.980]   And it was like the first big tech activism
[01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:38.300]   I remember going to tumblr and i'm like, I just want to see my feed
[01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:45.500]   I gotta i gotta do something to stop sopa and pippa. Yeah. Well, that's probably why it worked because enough people went there
[01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:48.620]   Uh, we didn't want to go dark
[01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:51.740]   Um, seeing if I can find did you go dim?
[01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:58.460]   We went black and white black and white. Oh, that's fine. I can white. So we did our whole days
[01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:06.060]   Shows on january 18th. Let me see 16th 1718. It would have been windows weekly. I think it was windows weekly. We were
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:11.900]   That's so fun. That's the only thing I remember about this. I'm like, yeah, peppa. No, I think I think you're right
[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:18.700]   We debated in the newsroom like do we go dark? We can't go dark. We were getting the best traffic of our lives on these stories
[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:23.820]   And it also felt like we should probably pay attention to it and get it. Yeah cover it
[01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:26.620]   That's the challenge you want to cover it and I wanted to cover it. So
[01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:33.500]   Uh, by by going black and white, I think that was a really uh kind of good way to handle it because it got your attention
[01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:40.540]   Right. I remember writing a story just about all of the different big sites that had gone black that day and then having to explain sort of what's open pippa
[01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:44.300]   Were um, but we didn't at newsy. We did not go dark or anything
[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:48.860]   I think that would probably you can trace that back to the big web first web activism
[01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:51.340]   And it's not going to be too many more months before
[01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:54.140]   The next fight is
[01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:58.220]   Net neutrality. Mm-hmm. And that was another one we won. Oh the last one we won
[01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:04.540]   But we'll talk about that a little bit raspberry pie came out in february 2012. Less a beautiful little soul
[01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:09.340]   What a great thing that has been. I've got one running right now at my not here
[01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:13.740]   But at my house running the home kit. It's called home bridge
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:16.300]   You're a home bridge user? Of course
[01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:18.780]   Micah, we got a we got a swap seats
[01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:21.500]   I feel so much love in my heart
[01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:26.940]   Yeah, um, so you bridges is that the open source one or no it is an open source one of the open source?
[01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:29.420]   Yeah, so it is an open source
[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:35.180]   Server that runs. Oh gosh, and I can't think of the the platform, but essentially it lets you connect
[01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:42.140]   Have it's not running open. Have no is it running home, brie? It's it's running. Uh, it's like a javascript thing
[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:45.740]   Um, anyway, I can't remember in the at the moment
[01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:51.820]   But uh, the point is that it is it lets you connect non home kit compatible devices to
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:54.940]   Oh, it's no JS. That's what there's a new J server
[01:13:54.940 --> 01:14:00.860]   Um, and so I've got one running right now for some of the devices that I have that are not home kit-enabled
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:06.380]   So that they can connect and it basically turns them into home kit-enabled devices, which is nice for someone who
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:10.300]   For me, I primarily control my home with the use of home kit
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:12.940]   Uh, but I have you heard of hoops?
[01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:17.900]   I have not heard of hoops. So hoops is awesome. It's like a foreign language and
[01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:25.580]   Uh, it is it is a way that's what you hoop is tank fans call that's what we call ourselves actually
[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:31.340]   We are hoops. Uh, no hoops is home kit on oh gosh, what do they call it?
[01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:35.340]   My kid you're working your way into an invite onto my show
[01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:38.620]   You gotta come on mine to we have a home theater and a home
[01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:44.940]   Automation show called smart tech today. Yeah, so we need to like competition. They're just different shows. I'm leaving, right?
[01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:51.180]   Done. Yeah, well, you weren't supposed to mention. Yeah, wasn't that in the writer?
[01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:53.580]   Hey, here's one from c. Yes
[01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:57.740]   2012 we're going back to c. Yes, aunt and I are gonna go to c. Yes
[01:14:57.740 --> 01:15:01.020]   C. Yes used to be the place you go to see what's next
[01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:08.620]   LG showed off the world's largest oled tv oled was just starting oh, let me tell you about it
[01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:12.940]   55 inches it was the largest oled tv ever made
[01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:16.540]   55 inches and was this on my wall? No
[01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:24.940]   Was this the introduction of oled as well or just uh, it was just a big tv with i'm sure it was 10 grand or 20 grand
[01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:27.020]   I'm sure it was really expensive
[01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:34.700]   It was also kony 2012. Do you remember kony 2012 horse? I remember kony 2012. Oh, that was a thing
[01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:39.260]   That was he he's a very jose. I was a warlord, right? Yes. He was a warlord
[01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:41.900]   And so they wanted to make him super know it's a real life thing
[01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:45.740]   They wanted to make him super super famous so that people would
[01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:48.380]   actively try to stop this guy
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:52.860]   Through donations and things like that. So you'd see kony 2012 bumper stickers
[01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:59.020]   You you still see in pedaluma down above the pedaluma pie company somebody is a kony 2012
[01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:01.740]   Thing in his window
[01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:07.980]   Um, I think it's widely agreed that was an internet campaign. It did not go in it didn't work very well
[01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:10.060]   It's not something we're proud of on the internet
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:16.620]   Yeah, yeah, which is a bummer because you'd think that it would have worked as much as I saw so much kony 2012 stuff
[01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:23.420]   But I think it was just the concept they tried there was the idea of if we treat this like it's almost a campaign
[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:30.060]   What happened is it went viral without any context exactly. Yes, you summed up what I was going to say in many more words
[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:32.060]   Good. What do you knew what the hell it was?
[01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:36.060]   They thought he was running for president. There was going to be a presidential election that you're no one he knew what it was
[01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:41.580]   Uh, this was also the year Kodak went chapter 11 and the line
[01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:48.300]   So it's kind of a textbook story of what went what goes wrong in the digital world Kodak new digital was coming
[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:55.020]   They even had some of the first digital cameras. They bought o photo, which was a digital storage and developing site
[01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:57.100]   They said we know it's going digital
[01:16:57.100 --> 01:17:04.060]   The problem was their entire financial structure was based on the very highly profitable sale of film
[01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:08.620]   And developing and once that went away with digital
[01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:13.580]   They just there was no way they could succeed. You'll still see the Kodak name. They've sold the name
[01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:16.940]   But uh, yeah Kodak disappeared in 2012
[01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:20.220]   You know who came up in 2012 who grumpy cat?
[01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:22.620]   Oh
[01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:26.940]   That's the one out the late great grumpy cat little bub just passed away. That's all I wanted to say
[01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:30.060]   Bob
[01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:32.060]   Do you know how little bub is?
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:35.260]   Just checking. I'm on the internet. She's hip. She has children
[01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:39.660]   Remember minecraft came out in like November of 2011
[01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:45.900]   By the spring of 2012 a 16 year old had already made a working minecraft scientific calculator
[01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:50.140]   That's incredible. That's a sign that something is going on, right
[01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:55.340]   Uh, the lumea 900 remember that that came out in 2012 that was getting up to a rough period
[01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:56.380]   Is that a smart phone?
[01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:58.380]   And this it was a windows seven
[01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:00.380]   That's post no idea
[01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:02.380]   I remember I I
[01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:07.180]   That was great. It was beautiful for microsoft bot. Do you know what this looks like what?
[01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:14.540]   Essential companies, uh, andy ruben. Yeah, oh their new deal. Uh, new os on their phone. Yeah, that's interesting
[01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:20.300]   Yeah, sorry windows microsoft had windows phone for years a variety of them up to 6.5
[01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:24.620]   They said back to the drawing board. We know and red's already big
[01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:28.540]   We know iphone's already big but we want to make a phone operating system
[01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:35.740]   We want to rethink the phone operating system and they did. Yep. That's the sad thing. Yep, uh windows phone
[01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:38.380]   Seven this is right was great
[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:43.260]   And then launched in october 2010 windows phone seven
[01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:49.420]   Seven and then nokia made some of the most amazing hardware to go with it. Maybe this is windows phone
[01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:55.820]   Yeah, yeah, seven still it was so pretty actually seven five. Yeah, so this was a big jump at seven five
[01:18:55.900 --> 01:19:00.940]   This was got every in every respect. This was a great phone with great software
[01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:06.940]   But they couldn't get developers to write software for it and most importantly they couldn't get carriers to push it late, right?
[01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:11.980]   I mean android and ios own the phone market and then here comes microsoft. I remember though
[01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:19.420]   They bought a lot of tv slots. They did they did a lot of promotional things. So when you watched um, what was mindie mindie uh, kaylee show?
[01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:25.500]   Um, the obijin one. Oh, um, they always had these phones and I think like minnie projects
[01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:30.540]   The minnie thank you. Yes, and then there was there were a few in fact even in the earliest days
[01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:36.380]   Of the kevin's spacey show house of cards. Yep. They all had windows phones
[01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:42.140]   They paid so much for placement and it really honestly it dates you because if you see a show
[01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:46.060]   It's a generic smartphone. Well, you just don't pay any attention, but if it's a
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:49.500]   Beauty shadow of a windows phone you go wow that's old
[01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:52.380]   Wow, that's gone
[01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:59.580]   Now I had a windows phone. I loved it like it was amazing windows phone k eight came out that year as well in 2012
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:07.580]   And that was another big improvement. So did windows eight. Yeah, not a big improvement. That was the launch more like windows hate
[01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:15.980]   Come on. Did you ever look at windows eight? That was a disaster. We knew it was awful. It was it was bad. It was horrible
[01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:22.620]   They forgot the enterprise speaking of horror horrible. Oh god. Oh, now i forget the enterprise never
[01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:24.700]   speaking of horrible
[01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:31.100]   Bravo thought you know what would be a good idea to make a silicon valley reality show. I never heard of it
[01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:38.940]   No one has this went down fast. I never heard of it. Here are the stars according to business insider of the new silicon valley reality show
[01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:41.660]   Randy zuckerberg mark zucker bridge sister produced it
[01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:44.300]   Hermione way
[01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:46.700]   I'm sorry. It's pronounced. I'm just herme one
[01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:51.980]   Yep
[01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:57.100]   Yeah, kimton none of these people. I don't know where they are today. Who are these people that they were all
[01:20:57.100 --> 01:21:03.260]   That's buck. That's a great name. That can't be as real name mark is loving good
[01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:05.500]   I am
[01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:09.500]   Would you want your real name on that show? No, no, that's a good. He's the fatter of future Lee
[01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:15.340]   No, hello. I'm mark is loving gears. Uh Dwight crow the founder of car sabi
[01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:19.820]   And the only one on the show that can write code
[01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:27.500]   That tells you a little bit about what all right code can code when did code become like a verb code is a verb
[01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:32.620]   Is it not a verb? Yeah, okay. I code you code. Okay, she it codes and there's Randy
[01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:38.380]   And then he's Randy zuckerberg who is singing is that what is that karaoke? That's gotta be karaoke
[01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:45.820]   By the way, I forgot to mention that this was the year that mark zuckerberg announced he was only going to eat food he killed
[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:49.660]   Oh, was that his challenge for 2012? Yeah
[01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:53.260]   Only going to eat food that he killed himself
[01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:56.140]   Well, that that didn't go well
[01:21:56.140 --> 01:22:01.900]   Does it count if you cut like a celery stock from no, no he killed meat
[01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:07.180]   Oh probably with a bow and arrow or his bare hands, you know, that's actually probably true
[01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:10.700]   Yeah, yeah, I could see him definitely now facebook did do something right in 2012
[01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:12.380]   They bought instagram
[01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:15.740]   For a mirror at the time it sounds crazy because it's a snap
[01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:18.460]   $1 billion a mirror
[01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:24.060]   Now that seems like sure that is pocket changing today, but at the time it seems like my god
[01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:27.580]   I remember a saying a billion dollars for an app
[01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:31.900]   I remember the whole newsroom being loud that day. Yeah, wait a billion dollars
[01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:37.420]   I'm like wait. Wait. Wait. You don't understand. Do you remember this at google. I oh
[01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:40.620]   Sergey brin interrupting
[01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:45.900]   Guys, we're gonna do we're gonna do something pretty magical here

[01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:53.900]   So I apologize for anything glass the shower visor
[01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:57.580]   He's seen some really compelling demos here. They were slick. They were robust
[01:22:57.580 --> 01:23:02.140]   Sergey will never leave his downness for here rest of his life is what he's known for
[01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:04.780]   This can go wrong in about 500 different ways
[01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:07.820]   So tell me now who wants to see a demo of glass
[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:11.180]   Last we'd heard a lot about it
[01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:14.860]   Everybody was talking about it. We didn't know what it was. We see him wearing it
[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:17.820]   And we're all like
[01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:22.380]   For a few months Kevin still has his name. I want to show you
[01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:26.300]   Uh, I lent to a friend and and he's going to be here momentarily
[01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:33.420]   Uh, my friends jt. He does a lot of skiing base jumping wind-sooting all sorts of crazy things
[01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:37.580]   And he's actually pretty close by he's just about a mile overhead right now
[01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:39.260]   Was buddies
[01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:41.260]   Um, they have a few glass units
[01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:44.780]   If you guys can maybe afford to wait that couple minutes
[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:48.460]   PNC levels that train hundred dollars each
[01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:51.660]   The red will of the blimp is more than that for however
[01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:56.460]   Uh, we're we're about to get into a hangout here with uh with jt
[01:23:56.460 --> 01:24:01.500]   I'll skip ahead a little bit because there's a little bit of mechanics here, but they're going to jump out
[01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:05.420]   They've got to get the right place and land on the roof
[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:08.220]   Of the
[01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:10.700]   Hall which I think it's is it must be muscony
[01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:13.740]   Oops. So that's a big hole
[01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:18.380]   And serge runs up to the roof there they are they landed on the roof
[01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:23.420]   Hey, so the roof is a little bit big there. So, uh, it would take a while to run out the length of it
[01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:25.420]   They ride a bicycle
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:28.300]   Sorry about that. Uh
[01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:33.340]   Did Alex lindsey produce this? I feel like maybe he did and there they are they rode their bicycles
[01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:36.220]   I think what caribbean don't what is it?
[01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:41.420]   Caribbean are down the side of bongcone center and there it is google.io
[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:44.540]   the debut of
[01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:48.460]   Google glass it's too bad they don't have google glass when you're at that apple event. Yeah
[01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:55.260]   A lot of trouble. Yeah. Oh, yeah, this is I uh so at the time remember you would put in an order for glass
[01:24:55.260 --> 01:25:00.220]   And they would send you a thing of glass with the number that i'm sat with 737
[01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:04.700]   Yeah, it's just not a glass you might try it glass give it a little bite and this is it
[01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:08.940]   Golder pearls my friend. Oh, I think it's glass. It's not gold
[01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:15.260]   Wow, uh, and so this is this is the 1500 dollar google glass
[01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:18.860]   Founders edition or what was called at the time this
[01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:22.860]   We'll get you beat up in a san francisco bar like that. Oh, oh, I and new york
[01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:26.220]   I remember a person came into the old rattle and hum wearing that
[01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:29.660]   And everyone just stopped and people said what is it?
[01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:34.620]   And i'm like it's google glass and they can take your picture if they blank and they threw them out. Wow
[01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:37.420]   Nope, you taddled i taddled
[01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:44.460]   It was google so I didn't care. Oh my god. He's taking so many photos of me right now. Like who cares right now we do
[01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:46.940]   Okay, what about the men's we're on tv. Yeah
[01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:54.700]   Remember the school will shower take I mean are we still so there's some advantage so jason's daughter is was it savanna
[01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:59.180]   Her first steps he recorded on google glass because I gave i wasn't gonna wear this
[01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:04.860]   I gave it to jason to wear for all about an yeah, is it on here? Could I watch it?
[01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:11.580]   Oh, she's looking at that's right because he wasn't right. They could they could interact while he's recording
[01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:15.420]   So there were some there were some cool things. It just was not
[01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:21.900]   It was ahead of its time. Mm-hmm. And I think we still need to have that discussion as a society about
[01:26:23.340 --> 01:26:29.260]   privacy and what to do with things wouldn't it be awesome if people had personal jammers where we could like yes
[01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:36.300]   Be like I want to be private. Yeah, I have to say what did happen throughout this decade. It was round about now that the
[01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:43.340]   Nsa announced this is before the snowed in revelations the nsa announced they were going to do a big face recognition project
[01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:49.660]   And they were going to invest a billion dollars in developing face recognition technology and at the time no alarm bells went off
[01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:56.780]   Well, and this was the year 2012 was the year of so image net was actually created in 2019 image net that was
[01:26:56.780 --> 01:27:04.460]   2009 and that is that was a database of pre-categorized pre-annotated faces and images
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:11.180]   And in 2012 jeff hinton who is now and his team of researchers jeff is now at uh google
[01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:16.300]   They they were at the university of toronto. They entered an annual competition
[01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:23.340]   And they killed it they beat it by like 40 percent. We all thought this is great
[01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:24.460]   Well, yeah
[01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:29.500]   And it was like the first they did it using gpu's and they did it using convolutional neural networks
[01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:31.420]   And now we have like specialized chips for that
[01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:37.660]   But this was the beginning of ai as this like viable technology and thing that was cost effective
[01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:40.940]   And as with a lot of internet and technology stuff
[01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:46.940]   At first people like me and maybe you guys were we're excited about the technology because we were impressed by
[01:27:47.020 --> 01:27:50.140]   What they were able to do. Mm-hmm. We didn't really consider
[01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:58.540]   What it might imply I do consider like I'm I've always been the person and I'll say the reason why and this is why diversity matters
[01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:04.300]   You guys is I had a stalker right in college. Oh, we've all had stalked. We've all had stalkers
[01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:09.660]   I've had stalkers. You have had stalkers. We've all had stalkers married julys enterprise stalkers enterprise stalkers
[01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:13.020]   They go and they go up to her name. They're like hey, but we know about data lakes
[01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:17.500]   It has gravity tell me about the latest advancements in azure
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:24.700]   But yeah, so whenever whenever I saw these technologies I would always run it through the lens of I think a woman is much more sensitive to
[01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:27.420]   Absolutely than a guy is so I think that's really a good point
[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:31.100]   Uh, this was the year 2012 marissa mire left google
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:34.620]   For a job at yaw
[01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:37.580]   And there was a lot of debate was this the right thing to do
[01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:42.620]   But she'd already been demoted a little bit at google from being in charge of search to kind of a marketing job
[01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:46.380]   So I I think I argued I think many of us argued
[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:51.660]   Why wouldn't she do this? What a great challenge yahoo is a great internet name that started starting to fade
[01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:56.620]   Maybe she can turn it around and for the first few years. It looked like she was gonna turn it around
[01:28:56.620 --> 01:29:01.020]   She ultimately failed, but I don't know if that's her fault or just the changing scene
[01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:03.500]   Or both or both
[01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:07.020]   She gave as she joined yahoo every employee a smartphone
[01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:10.380]   Uh the idea being you ought to know about mobile
[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:15.740]   And that was smart right 2012. It was it was the beginning of the transition to mobile
[01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:18.300]   Apple introduced maps
[01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:19.980]   It's oh my god
[01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:22.300]   - it was just a flop just with
[01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:24.940]   The less said about that the better
[01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:30.060]   You know what else actually this is actually an occasion to do something i'm actually
[01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:32.300]   meant to do earlier
[01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:34.700]   I thought he was gonna stand up. I thought it was gonna drink
[01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:40.220]   Well, I've been doing that all along. I hope you have too. Yeah, you're just all you have is melted ice in yours
[01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:45.100]   Well, I did I thought we'd be further along in the decade. It's a long decade
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:49.180]   All right, I am going to move along a little faster, but I did think it'd be kind of fun
[01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:51.580]   We'll be done by the next decade. Yeah by 2020
[01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:53.900]   Not maybe yeah
[01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:57.900]   Uh, I thought it'd be fun to go through all of my kickstarter pledges. You don't mind
[01:29:57.900 --> 01:30:05.740]   You got time you got some time the only reason I mentioned that is because it's really a sad
[01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:09.900]   kind of litany of failures. Yeah
[01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:13.980]   That is a bummer starting with the pebble watch that wasn't a failure
[01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:19.740]   My son still wears one every day. Yeah, the original and now there's what rebel uh software
[01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:26.700]   You can put on your pebble to keep it going and who just who just bought fit bit google didn't google who owns pebble fit bit
[01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:29.260]   So no, sir
[01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:31.660]   No, now google has
[01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:34.940]   Google has pebbles ip so I think that's interesting
[01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:38.140]   uh, I also bought in 2012 the joey bra
[01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:42.940]   Which really wasn't for me. It was the first sexy and comfortable pocketed bra
[01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:48.540]   It sounds like a kangaroo thing. That's I think that was the idea. Oh, oh, oh joey get it
[01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:54.380]   It's got a pocket and neil young. Oh the pony. Yes. Oh, oh
[01:30:54.380 --> 01:30:57.980]   I did want a pony. I thought it was a pony, but all I got
[01:30:57.980 --> 01:31:04.540]   Was a pono pono. That's it. The pono player, which was neil young's attempt to bring the high resolution music
[01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:05.900]   Which he claimed
[01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:09.980]   He could hear the difference and everybody else could hear the difference when I burned my cds
[01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:13.980]   I burned them all as flag files and I put them up in a hard drive. I had enough
[01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:18.780]   I had a but that's a flag files for the best. No, but I mean the cd is see this with neil
[01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:21.980]   Oh cd is only 44 one by twat by uh
[01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:24.540]   By 16
[01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:26.860]   Oh, now why don't you get the yellow one?
[01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:29.420]   That was the one that was advertised but I got the well
[01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:33.580]   I thought it was a little class here to get the brushed metal and look it's got neil young signature on it
[01:31:33.580 --> 01:31:39.020]   It's a limited edition and I ordered that on uh kickstarter and I could tell you what a valuable
[01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:41.660]   Possession
[01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:43.660]   You're using it right now. It's
[01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:48.140]   Yeah, so irs, I'm gonna deduct it again this year if you don't mind
[01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:49.820]   Uh
[01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:50.700]   Yeah
[01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:56.060]   Actually, it's if you want to go back through the graveyard of bad technologies looking at my kickstarter
[01:31:56.060 --> 01:31:56.940]   Is it good?
[01:31:56.940 --> 01:32:00.140]   Do you have a juice arrow in there? Oh my god, probably have an ostrich pillow
[01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:02.700]   I have ghost which was a blogging platform still around
[01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:05.420]   an NFC ring
[01:32:05.420 --> 01:32:07.740]   Uh
[01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:10.460]   Did you fund the robo cop stop like which one I have
[01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:15.660]   I there was quite a few little things like that. I you know, it just felt like it was my duty to support
[01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:21.020]   I also ordered uh and we'll get to it. Uh, well, I guess we can we can do it now. Let's get ahead a bit
[01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:23.100]   Let's do it. No siptoe
[01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:26.860]   No, you're here for all day. Just just live with it. We're here. I'm not going anywhere
[01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:33.260]   I ordered in 2012 my oculus riff. Oh, this is the beginning of oculus
[01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:34.940]   This was the first
[01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:41.900]   I did not look like that by the way the first oculus riff. It's a concept drawing. Uh, they raised I think 200 million
[01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:44.140]   I'm sorry 2 million
[01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:46.140]   Dollars. Oh, I thought that was the cyber truck
[01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:51.020]   They raised 2 million dollars and then 18 months later sold to facebook for 2 billion
[01:32:51.020 --> 01:32:57.100]   And a lot of us said this is another thing I bought on uh, i'm kickstarter. Oh
[01:32:57.100 --> 01:33:01.580]   This is the ostrich pillow. The ostrich is amazing. You know about this?
[01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:05.180]   You know about this? Oh, yeah, I've seen them before but I've never
[01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:08.140]   Uh, this was the experience the ostrich
[01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:10.860]   So the idea is you put this on your head
[01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:15.100]   Uh, you're on the airplane, right and you want to sleep so this this covers your eyes
[01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:18.860]   And your nose can still breathe put your arms in that and then you can sleep like this
[01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:23.820]   Or in the library and it also keeps people away from you because
[01:33:23.820 --> 01:33:26.540]   Look at
[01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:31.580]   Yeah, that's another
[01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:36.540]   I'm telling you in order to do the research for this decade. I had to go through all of my kickstarter
[01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:38.860]   pledges
[01:33:38.860 --> 01:33:41.660]   diaspora remember that was going to replace facebook
[01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:45.260]   Yeah, and now there's an what's the other one that we're all in?
[01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:48.300]   Hello
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:53.740]   I have been through a lot my friends. I've been through a lot all on your behalf for twitter
[01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:54.540]   That was for
[01:33:54.540 --> 01:33:58.620]   I I actually would like to show you this uh, this is uh, ces
[01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:01.980]   Uh, steve balmer
[01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:07.820]   Should I have to skip ahead on this one? Let me get the time code 4150 in steve balmer
[01:34:07.820 --> 01:34:11.980]   Uh, do you remember this it was the qualcom keynote
[01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:14.140]   2012
[01:34:14.140 --> 01:34:18.220]   Uh, 2012 that's pretty cool. Yep. Uh, by the way, father, robert balis air
[01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:20.300]   Just because we talked about
[01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:25.740]   Will's peris and roger jang on the panel. This is the new brick house studio that we had moved into
[01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:29.180]   Maybe it's port trip. Maybe see through and let me uh, let me jump ahead
[01:34:29.260 --> 01:34:30.780]   and
[01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:32.300]   And here is
[01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:34.300]   Here is the worst
[01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:38.140]   Uh, one of the worst this predates the awful sam sung
[01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:40.780]   announcement
[01:34:40.780 --> 01:34:47.340]   I remember that when they uh, they had the people on stage. This is this is qualcom showing the mobile generation
[01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:49.580]   This is supposed to be your generation
[01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:53.100]   Here we go
[01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:55.100]   generation
[01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:57.100]   I
[01:34:57.100 --> 01:35:02.220]   Generation
[01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:04.540]   Better known by tornado
[01:35:04.540 --> 01:35:07.180]   Tornado 92 is your actors
[01:35:07.180 --> 01:35:12.460]   From backstage so he did volcano on 53. Oh, oh no
[01:35:12.460 --> 01:35:16.220]   Have a sweet job and a hot girlfriend and by hot i'm in like
[01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:19.260]   I haven't drank enough
[01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:21.260]   Watch this
[01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:25.900]   Call comps i'm gonna get like a sweet idea punch him in the nose. Yes. Yeah watch he's gonna go

[01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:32.860]   I hate this so much
[01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:35.420]   You got to be mobile if you want to be a talk
[01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:38.140]   The catch faces
[01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:40.780]   It actually got worse
[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:47.820]   I think they used born mobile a couple years. Yeah born mobile. That's right. That's qualcom ceo
[01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:49.020]   That's jacob's
[01:35:49.020 --> 01:35:51.020]   Get ready
[01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:58.060]   Showing on price to interrupt steve
[01:35:58.060 --> 01:36:02.620]   CNN sony's crackles tongs a twitter
[01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:06.860]   Expedia and fit bit they also have plenty of pasta
[01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:21.420]   Oh 2012 what a year it was also the year steve and stonofsky
[01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:26.220]   Left microsoft and I should say that probably had something to do with the release of windows
[01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:28.460]   eight it did
[01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:30.460]   And surface rt came out
[01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:33.180]   Also had something to do with that something to do with that
[01:36:33.180 --> 01:36:39.340]   I I tried to find my rt. I have an rt at home. I couldn't find it. It's probably holding up a window somewhere, but
[01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:43.180]   Or keeping a door from closing. Yes. Yeah. All right now we
[01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:51.500]   I'm do you want me to be the militant time guys? No, no, no, there's no limit because this is a podcast
[01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:56.780]   We can go all day, but I do want to take a little bit of a break before we get into the second year of the decade
[01:36:56.780 --> 01:36:59.180]   No, we're up to 20
[01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:04.700]   13 and we're gonna move faster now. We're gonna move faster. What's really interesting is how much happened
[01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:08.700]   Yeah in the first few years of the decade. It was it was really a big
[01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:11.900]   Few years our show today brought to you by digital ocean
[01:37:11.900 --> 01:37:15.740]   This isn't something new in this decade that has transformed the way
[01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:17.900]   startups
[01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:24.460]   Developers even people like me who are just learning web technologies can get online. It's the most
[01:37:24.460 --> 01:37:31.180]   Developer friendly cloud platform you ever used optimized so that you can manage and scale your apps easily
[01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:37.020]   It has a great API very intuitive multiple options for things like storage
[01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:39.820]   firewalls load balancers
[01:37:40.540 --> 01:37:44.780]   1 million developers use digital ocean. I use it. I know father robert uses it because
[01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:48.540]   What you know? I'm learning different web technologies. You were talking about no JS
[01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:50.540]   Well, I'm not going to set up a no JS server at home
[01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:57.740]   It's very easy in 55 seconds. I can set up a public no JS server on digital ocean with my choice
[01:37:57.740 --> 01:38:00.620]   of operating systems my choice of
[01:38:00.620 --> 01:38:03.100]   one click installs
[01:38:03.100 --> 01:38:08.940]   And you don't ever you never alone they have over 2,000 open source tutorials every because some people use dio
[01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:14.220]   Everybody has written a tutorial on how to do whatever it is you want to do in the marketplace
[01:38:14.220 --> 01:38:17.740]   You'll find everything docker kubernetes cloud bees get lab
[01:38:17.740 --> 01:38:22.940]   You want to have your own get you can just set up a get lab server and it's inexpensive too
[01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:30.060]   I always choose the five bucks a month server because this because I only pay for what I use basically no JS Ruby on rails
[01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:36.460]   You can set up a lamp stack with your choice of operating systems and digital ocean offers simple predictable pricing
[01:38:36.460 --> 01:38:38.540]   So you always know what you're going to pay per month with a flat
[01:38:39.420 --> 01:38:41.420]   industry leading pricing structure
[01:38:41.420 --> 01:38:42.300]   I
[01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:46.140]   At no additional cost you get 24 by 7 by 365 world class support
[01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:51.420]   Monterings alerts, uh, you get 99.99 percent up time sla
[01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:53.980]   You can have team accounts. There's dns management
[01:38:53.980 --> 01:39:02.140]   Digital ocean is on a mission to simplify cloud computing so developers and their teams can spend more time building software to change the world
[01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:04.620]   It has changed the way
[01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:11.180]   We provision and use servers. It's so much better. Go to dio.co/twit today
[01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:15.660]   I think back in 2010 if we'd known about this we would have would have blown our minds
[01:39:15.660 --> 01:39:21.900]   I remember kevin rose round about that time setting up his dig server and it is colo and the oh man
[01:39:21.900 --> 01:39:27.100]   I mean you have to go out there. I was it's so much easier dio.co/twit if you go there today
[01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:31.820]   You'll receive a free $50 credit, which is nice. That's that's really going to cover your costs for a while
[01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:33.020]   That's dio
[01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:38.780]   Dot co/twit free $50 credit at digital ocean designed for developers
[01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:43.500]   Built for businesses and honestly if you're trying to learn web technology somebody like me
[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:48.220]   It's fantastic. You could set up a server in literally 55
[01:39:48.220 --> 01:39:51.260]   seconds
[01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:54.940]   In june google announced loon their balloon internet
[01:39:54.940 --> 01:39:57.500]   Which do we kill that the other day on?
[01:39:57.500 --> 01:40:01.900]   Uh, we did we thought we should I said we should kill it on twig right aunt
[01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:07.260]   But uh, they have not killed it. Okay. Yes. So that's not that's not official. You haven't shot them out of the sky. Yeah
[01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:11.580]   Uh the internet balloons yahoo bought tumblr. Oh
[01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:14.460]   And then proceeded to kill it
[01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:16.540]   But it's back. Well, I'm hoping
[01:40:16.540 --> 01:40:22.460]   You know what? I'm hoping I killed my account on tumblr when that happened and when who bought it. I forgot who bought it
[01:40:22.460 --> 01:40:24.460]   It's ryzen. Oh, you mean they
[01:40:24.460 --> 01:40:27.660]   We're pressed. Just bought it. You're talking about now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[01:40:27.980 --> 01:40:31.900]   Verizon bought yahoo. Yes, so they got tumblr. They sold it because they can figure out what to do with it
[01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:35.900]   Yahoo bought tumblr. So now that we're press has it. I re-signed up. I said, you know what?
[01:40:35.900 --> 01:40:41.340]   I love tumblr. I still love the platform. Yeah, and I think word press will be a good steward. Yeah, that's kind of
[01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:46.140]   G4 did you work for g4, right?
[01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:49.020]   Yes, I did
[01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:52.700]   G4 was starting to fall apart. What is it? I'm glad you asked
[01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:54.940]   It's nothing
[01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:57.340]   literally what was it nothing g4
[01:40:58.300 --> 01:41:05.020]   Was the successor to tech tv a Comcast bought tech tv and then turned it brought it to l.a. And turned it into g4
[01:41:05.020 --> 01:41:07.020]   They renamed the screen savers
[01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:09.740]   Unaccountably the attack of the show
[01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:17.020]   Olivia Munn was a host before she became famous. I had a friend who wrote for attack of the show. That was a good show
[01:41:17.020 --> 01:41:22.620]   Well, it was it was a different show. It was it was not for it. It was not
[01:41:22.620 --> 01:41:26.140]   It was not the screen savers even though they they stopped
[01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:29.820]   Kevin rose was on it and anything was kind of related
[01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:31.740]   Anyway, they wrapped up
[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:33.820]   in 2013 with I think
[01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:38.460]   I feel like a vindicating video for me. We watched it on twit that
[01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:40.780]   that day
[01:41:40.780 --> 01:41:42.780]   So this is the attack of the shows
[01:41:42.780 --> 01:41:45.900]   They had explained them to me
[01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:47.900]   final episodes
[01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:50.300]   This is their farewell miss
[01:41:50.300 --> 01:41:52.940]   49ers switch
[01:41:55.100 --> 01:41:57.100]   Excuse me
[01:41:57.100 --> 01:41:59.740]   She was eating Olivia Munn was eating a hot dog. Don't ask
[01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:03.820]   I just had the weirdest dream what happened
[01:42:03.820 --> 01:42:06.460]   My mouth tastes like hot dogs
[01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:09.420]   I dreamt that tech tv was sold to a cable company
[01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:15.500]   That had a name that was an obsolete apple processor and they moved us all down the Los Angeles
[01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:18.300]   L.a. That's actually worse than hot dog mouth
[01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:20.940]   And we had to stop doing tech news
[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:24.300]   And we started doing this kind of pop culture nightmare gallery
[01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:26.940]   Nightmare gallery my uncle Ted was there
[01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:29.420]   And we were all eating pie
[01:42:29.420 --> 01:42:32.380]   Pie
[01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:35.900]   Never mind it. That's it's just too weird. I I can't explain it. I
[01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:38.780]   What do you think a dream like that means?
[01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:41.900]   See g4 was always fun. Good work. It's all a dream
[01:42:41.900 --> 01:42:44.940]   I wish I had been
[01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:50.380]   First I wouldn't have to it wouldn't have started if they hadn't what's a hype machine. We can we ever review that?
[01:42:50.380 --> 01:42:53.020]   Now this is the screen save
[01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:55.580]   Come on. So they start playing the old theme song
[01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:59.020]   And we this is the future, baby
[01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:01.900]   the tech tv building in downtown San Francisco
[01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:08.060]   How fun so I actually look at there's fly for did you know anything about this first time when they did this?
[01:43:08.060 --> 01:43:14.300]   Kill tech. I forgive them for everything. Did you have something to do with it? No, no, I I was I was actually a friend
[01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:20.220]   I was actually here by then. I like mica's confused slash neutral look. He's like, yeah, this is happening
[01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:27.020]   All right, so that that video has no meaning for anybody who wasn't a tech tv fan and and so I apologize the rest of you
[01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:34.300]   Uh the pebbles shipped in july 2013 we're in 2013. I had one. I love the original pebbles
[01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:39.900]   I still have it. I bought it on kickstarter. Yep, I I recycled mine when I moved the gas
[01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:44.860]   And karsten sun still has his and he wears it every day he wears it every day
[01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:54.300]   You'll remember this the 41 marijo the 41 mega pixel luma lumia 10 20 remember that. Yep. Wow 41 megapixel camera
[01:43:54.300 --> 01:43:59.580]   That's the one that's the big one. Yeah, I tried that out. It was big
[01:43:59.580 --> 01:44:07.260]   And you mentioned you mentioned the harlem the harlem shake. Let me just uh, we did have a brief
[01:44:07.260 --> 01:44:10.220]   Harlem shake. This was that was like
[01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:13.420]   That was a meme video. Were you around during the harlem shake?
[01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:16.300]   period live
[01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:20.380]   He's already talked about stories. He's this was a meme
[01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:26.700]   He was a child product. It was like it was a weird meme where people are
[01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:30.060]   Dancing or something here show the not dancing
[01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:37.340]   They start out and then they end up and then when the harlem shake part hits then you then you dance. Yeah, right there
[01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:43.340]   I don't know why this became a meme. You could turn it up a little bit because people are silly
[01:44:43.660 --> 01:44:49.660]   They're looks uh rather suggestive. Yeah, there's always a piece that in the these guys have got issues
[01:44:49.660 --> 01:44:55.740]   I don't know if she's on the internet. Oh, I thought it was the first one. Yeah, it was one of these people. Yeah, it's like you sure black male material
[01:44:55.740 --> 01:45:02.620]   That maker space where it's a normal environment, but there's one guy doing this stupid dance
[01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:08.780]   And then for some reason, it's needle in the ice and snow everybody's dancing and then it's over like at 15 seconds
[01:45:08.780 --> 01:45:12.700]   The world's shortest bank. Well, thank goodness for that. Yeah, I wish it was over now
[01:45:12.700 --> 01:45:14.700]   We salute you. Yeah
[01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:18.300]   Do you have the office one? Yeah, so well here. Let me find the office one
[01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:23.820]   Norwegian army version is the best here's the office one. This is pretty good. This is a maker
[01:45:23.820 --> 01:45:28.620]   Make yeah, it was just weird. Somebody's standing there dancing
[01:45:28.620 --> 01:45:31.580]   Oh, yeah, it's one person dances. That's right
[01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:34.220]   Opening everybody else's frozen man
[01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:39.260]   Guards are words. I mean, I try to remember there's so many video. I mean like remember this
[01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:43.900]   Oh, I remember the cinnamon challenge and the milk challenge
[01:45:43.900 --> 01:45:49.980]   The challenge oh my god. I'd pods. Sorry. I've tied pod challenge
[01:45:49.980 --> 01:45:52.940]   What is it? There was the hotline bling thing and then there was um
[01:45:52.940 --> 01:46:00.700]   The one where you get out of your car. Oh my god. Uh, that's recent. Yeah, what is terrible? Somebody get run over. What's it?
[01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:03.660]   Which one?
[01:46:03.660 --> 01:46:05.820]   Here you go. Watch this
[01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:07.820]   So we had to do our own
[01:46:08.460 --> 01:46:15.740]   Harlem turn up the sound. You're doing the same thing. It's hoping to get it. There's much in anymore. That's I think he's said that's our intern
[01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:21.340]   So that's you have to do it like that
[01:46:21.340 --> 01:46:28.780]   Somebody stands in dancing and then like and then the base hits right? Yeah, so then everybody's dancing
[01:46:28.780 --> 01:46:32.460]   Yes, oh, that's fantastic
[01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:38.780]   This is this one had an unfortunate ending and the john and berg remember very well
[01:46:38.780 --> 01:46:41.740]   I'm dancing everybody's dancing
[01:46:41.740 --> 01:46:44.860]   And then for some reason
[01:46:44.860 --> 01:46:54.860]   Well, I will never get on the table again. I'm just gonna say that's why that day. I almost sat on this everyone was like no
[01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:58.220]   It's been done. Wait. Is this the same table? No
[01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:02.460]   Is there only duct tape in here? The tables gone
[01:47:02.460 --> 01:47:06.540]   Fans will remember 2013 is the year kevin rose tosta raccoon
[01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:13.420]   I remember that down the stairs all in the security camera to stay the dog. It was so heroic and wonderful
[01:47:13.420 --> 01:47:16.620]   Yeah, yeah, we talked a lot about that kevin was on the show of course
[01:47:16.620 --> 01:47:19.020]   trash pandas
[01:47:19.020 --> 01:47:23.900]   They are trash pandas. Yes in july the chrome cast was introduced by google
[01:47:23.900 --> 01:47:26.620]   I oh that was a big thing
[01:47:28.460 --> 01:47:35.100]   Um we had an entire show built about that. I could do a whole episode on bad pronouncements
[01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:41.900]   In this one from august 2013 larry elison predicts dark days ahead for apple
[01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:48.780]   Without steve joss larry elison also didn't believe in the cloud. So, you know, it was also a flat earther as well
[01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:51.180]   What no still is
[01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:58.140]   It was also the year that steve balmer said i'm out of here
[01:47:58.140 --> 01:48:03.740]   I know you got a very good interview with i got the last interview with steve balmer
[01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:04.860]   Wow
[01:48:04.860 --> 01:48:07.260]   And there's actually some great stories he noticed your shoes
[01:48:07.260 --> 01:48:14.620]   Right, so the way steve balmer would remember people's names was he look at your shoes and eat free associate something about them with your
[01:48:14.620 --> 01:48:18.460]   Name. Mm-hmm. That's excellent. That's how he remembered everybody's name
[01:48:18.460 --> 01:48:21.500]   Like he'd meet people 10 years later and he'd be like, oh, hey, joe
[01:48:22.220 --> 01:48:25.900]   All right, that's a good salesman trick right yeah, steve blomber was the best
[01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:28.940]   I have to say my I interviewed all three micro stuff ceos
[01:48:28.940 --> 01:48:34.300]   He was my favorite really but I was banned from talking to him for 17 years not that i'm mad about that
[01:48:34.300 --> 01:48:40.860]   Well 17 years why she never she was no every time my interview named me said stuff
[01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:46.140]   He shouldn't have and they're like you can't talk to him anymore. Oh, you know how to get him to say he would tell the truth to you
[01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:47.980]   Right. Oh, that's like your fault
[01:48:47.980 --> 01:48:52.380]   No, so that's why I got the last interview because he I said a minute and i'm like look
[01:48:52.380 --> 01:48:56.380]   You didn't talk to me for 17 years can we end this feud and he's like mary joe's getting last interview
[01:48:56.380 --> 01:49:03.580]   That's awesome. What a nice story. I love it. It begins in a long saga of microsoft searching for the next ceo
[01:49:03.580 --> 01:49:08.940]   Man, do you remember all the candidates? Yes, so I was a candidate at one point. Yep, mica was one of them
[01:49:08.940 --> 01:49:14.700]   Um, steve and sanofsky was one of them at one point. He was he had left a disgrace, but there was right
[01:49:14.860 --> 01:49:16.860]   Remember allen malali
[01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:19.260]   Ford was like a leading
[01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:26.780]   Julie larson green was a candidate. She was in house. She was a window windows team steven elop who ran the noke
[01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:31.020]   Business after microsoft bought them. Well, I should mention that that you're also
[01:49:31.020 --> 01:49:33.660]   Microsoft
[01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:35.660]   2 billion
[01:49:35.660 --> 01:49:40.300]   Fired everybody pretty much. Yeah, that was a terrible mistake
[01:49:40.940 --> 01:49:45.340]   We're so awesome. I know and that was one of the reasons steve bomber was kind of eased
[01:49:45.340 --> 01:49:48.620]   Out really was at the final straw that was one of them
[01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:53.020]   You know, he really wanted microsoft to make its own hardware and be a foam player right?
[01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:55.660]   Which could have been a super viable strategy
[01:49:55.660 --> 01:50:01.100]   Maybe it was kind of late for them to get in the game sadly it was late and they didn't have the developer cred
[01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:06.860]   The because they still weren't they were still too enterprising. They were okay. Hey. No, they weren't too enterprising. Hold on
[01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:14.460]   We'll do but at the time there's no such thing as to air there isn't that the mobile world was coming up as a consumer tech
[01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:16.460]   Pradon they missed that they really did
[01:50:16.460 --> 01:50:20.460]   Ballmer thought the iPhone was a joke remember he laughed and it says so expensive nobody
[01:50:20.460 --> 01:50:26.060]   Oh, I was gonna break somebody's iPhone. He took somebody's iPhone from the audience at one of the sales meetings
[01:50:26.060 --> 01:50:29.900]   Put it on the stage. It was just a thing though to show like we're gonna make our own
[01:50:29.900 --> 01:50:34.860]   It'd be better than they have the iPhone funeral on campus. That was a dark moment also
[01:50:35.660 --> 01:50:37.660]   There's a lot of dark moments
[01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:41.980]   But they had a little dark in effigy and they had a procession
[01:50:41.980 --> 01:50:44.940]   You know like a little group
[01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:51.580]   So it wasn't 2013 was not a banner year from microsoft. We're just gonna leave it at that
[01:50:51.580 --> 01:50:59.180]   Apple hired Angela errands to run their stores in 2013 no longer there no longer there, but she did a great job
[01:50:59.180 --> 01:51:01.820]   Right. Yeah, she's CEO Burberry
[01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:03.980]   and I think she left because
[01:51:04.220 --> 01:51:10.380]   I believe that they promised her at some point she would have a CEO or a CEO like a sea level role at apple
[01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:14.860]   And it and I think she just said tims never retiring so i'm just i'm out of here
[01:51:14.860 --> 01:51:19.820]   Facebook announced internet.org which at the time every thought this is great. They're gonna bring me in it
[01:51:19.820 --> 01:51:28.220]   For the records terrible terrible. I recognize zero rating as the prime against net neutrality that it still is you are so smart
[01:51:28.220 --> 01:51:31.100]   We should have had all those losing battles
[01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:39.340]   It was also the year 2013 that the first the first what we consider modern ransomware happened. Wow it was the first
[01:51:39.340 --> 01:51:41.820]   ransomware that
[01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:46.700]   Encrypted all your data and asked demanded for $300 in bitcoin
[01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:50.620]   How many bitcoins was that at the time they must give you a translation in the story or a
[01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:56.060]   Half or something like that. It wasn't you know now it's like give us a quarter of a big coin
[01:51:56.060 --> 01:52:00.460]   Your entire life savings. Yeah, and of course nobody knew what bitcoin was
[01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:08.460]   This was crypto locker. It was the very I think it's the first what we would call modern ransomware and it began a trend that has been the bane
[01:52:08.460 --> 01:52:15.340]   Of the 2010s. I mean just municipal governments hospitals anyone still are running you know old school
[01:52:15.340 --> 01:52:23.260]   Bitcoin was also in the news in 2013 because the feds took down ross orich's silk road
[01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:26.140]   Oh, yes, i bought a house from his father
[01:52:26.620 --> 01:52:32.700]   Right that was the so my first the first house andrea and I bought in austin was kurt orich
[01:52:32.700 --> 01:52:36.540]   Which was his father and we were when we saw this we were
[01:52:36.540 --> 01:52:39.980]   No, we realized it was him
[01:52:39.980 --> 01:52:45.900]   And we were sad for him because they moved to kostorica and the house you guys was really well built
[01:52:45.900 --> 01:52:54.220]   So yeah very yeah, who uh more yahoo news is uh merci mire kind of gets in gear hires katie kurick
[01:52:54.860 --> 01:52:58.700]   in famous news today show host newswoman to run
[01:52:58.700 --> 01:53:01.980]   Something yeah, and they also had that guy
[01:53:01.980 --> 01:53:08.060]   Poog David pog. He's a guy to do tech stuff. Yeah, david was a regular on our shows at the time. Yeah
[01:53:08.060 --> 01:53:12.540]   Um, of course once they hired him. We never wanted to talk to him again
[01:53:12.540 --> 01:53:16.460]   He was too busy to talk to us
[01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:21.260]   jeff bezos on 60 minutes do you remember with I think it was charlie rose
[01:53:22.060 --> 01:53:26.300]   And jeff is showing him the amazon's facility. He says oh in here
[01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:29.580]   we have our drone delivery program
[01:53:29.580 --> 01:53:34.940]   And charlie's like oh you can deliver by drones
[01:53:34.940 --> 01:53:37.660]   And he was all and everybody else was going
[01:53:37.660 --> 01:53:40.540]   How's that gonna work?
[01:53:40.540 --> 01:53:45.020]   Bless the nightly newspeople. Yeah seven years later. We're still wondering. Yeah, how's that gonna work?
[01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:50.940]   They have actually delivered an organ via drone so a human organ or a fight organ
[01:53:51.580 --> 01:53:55.180]   Paper sorry. Oh, sorry. I can't remember if it was a kidney or not
[01:53:55.180 --> 01:54:00.300]   No, there's good reason to deliver blood on human organs that way because they're fast and they can get over tough terrain
[01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:04.220]   We wouldn't have needed also this the famous dog that saved the
[01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:07.260]   children of the last
[01:54:07.260 --> 01:54:13.980]   delivering vaccines to the children of alaska if we had if we'd had a drone actually the dj I fan him the first fan
[01:54:13.980 --> 01:54:18.220]   I came out in 2013. So it really was the beginning of the bane of the ts
[01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:22.540]   Tsa's existence airports everywhere. Yeah and google bought
[01:54:22.540 --> 01:54:25.500]   Boston dynamics
[01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:31.500]   Now they sold it since because they decided this is probably not a good business for us to be in but that's the robotics company
[01:54:31.500 --> 01:54:33.020]   Is that when we started seeing the scary?
[01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:35.020]   Yeah, the scary videos came out shortly
[01:54:35.020 --> 01:54:39.900]   And my nightmares are very upset that we're so mean to their robots. I just saw a story about that
[01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:42.540]   Can you please stop saying they're mean and evil
[01:54:42.540 --> 01:54:47.740]   They're all sad about the fact that yeah, they know that when the robots take over they're going to keep track
[01:54:47.820 --> 01:54:51.020]   Right says they're mean and evil and they don't want to be in that group
[01:54:51.020 --> 01:54:57.420]   All right, so we move to 2014 good what happened in 2014 a big year if this is another big year
[01:54:57.420 --> 01:54:59.580]   This is another big microsoft huge year
[01:54:59.580 --> 01:55:05.100]   The good news is 2015 and after are nothing happened then that's all right
[01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:08.460]   It's kind of amazing what the first half of the decade was amazing
[01:55:08.460 --> 01:55:10.460]   2014 is a big year with us
[01:55:10.460 --> 01:55:13.900]   I'll go quickly the Mac pro the trash can Mac ships
[01:55:13.900 --> 01:55:16.620]   They still haven't shipped this
[01:55:17.260 --> 01:55:23.580]   Microsoft finally settles on the best possible choice of all the people we mentioned Satya Nadella
[01:55:23.580 --> 01:55:25.580]   Who was the head of the azure group?
[01:55:25.580 --> 01:55:30.540]   Because I turned it down so michael said no, then they said okay Satya. He's okay
[01:55:30.540 --> 01:55:34.220]   There's nobody doesn't think that was a brilliant movement and what's happened
[01:55:34.220 --> 01:55:37.500]   None of us. He predicted it. None of us predicted it. It was a surprise
[01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:42.140]   It was a total of no okay, so I will tell you why tell me you predicted okay
[01:55:42.140 --> 01:55:44.860]   No, okay, but in 2013
[01:55:45.820 --> 01:55:48.780]   We were planning a conference so they're Google Docs
[01:55:48.780 --> 01:55:51.660]   Although they're probably gone now because she has receipts
[01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:57.980]   We were talking about doing a future CEO panel and Satya was one of our picks for that
[01:55:57.980 --> 01:56:01.420]   Because he had spoken at a couple of the other cloud conferences and he was a good good
[01:56:01.420 --> 01:56:06.620]   And we liked his vision. Well, he's gonna say that I predicted him being CEO
[01:56:06.620 --> 01:56:09.260]   Yes one day, but you know, okay here
[01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:13.260]   Here was my clue which I didn't pick up on when I got the final bomber interview
[01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:17.260]   They had me interview a whole bunch of his lieutenants and my last interview was Satya
[01:56:17.260 --> 01:56:21.980]   And they said even then they kind of thought they knew they knew and they said to me after his
[01:56:21.980 --> 01:56:26.540]   What do you think of him like, you know, like like you're the reason he was hired
[01:56:26.540 --> 01:56:29.580]   I'm just saying the check can come to I'll give my address
[01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:31.820]   Did you say you liked him?
[01:56:31.820 --> 01:56:33.340]   I said I thought he was good. Okay
[01:56:33.340 --> 01:56:37.740]   I I had interviewed him several times at Microsoft when he had different jobs and I'm like, you know what I love about him
[01:56:37.740 --> 01:56:42.620]   He's so technical. Love it. He's been a good job. He's a nice guy and he's a nice guy
[01:56:42.620 --> 01:56:45.660]   Very nice and you know what? Here's the other thing he listens
[01:56:45.660 --> 01:56:47.820]   Oh, yeah, like when you ask him a question
[01:56:47.820 --> 01:56:53.020]   He actually sits there and looks at you and thinks about it. He doesn't have a can would you say bomber was a good listener
[01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:58.940]   No, but he was he was a great CEO for the time that he was a
[01:56:58.940 --> 01:57:03.820]   Salesman is what he was a very good sales. He was a raw raw guy
[01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:07.100]   uh, blackberry
[01:57:07.100 --> 01:57:11.820]   uh in 2014 blackberry sales in the United States went to 0%
[01:57:12.780 --> 01:57:17.900]   Uh, they shortly afterwards killed their phone division. They're still around but because they make IOT secure
[01:57:17.900 --> 01:57:21.100]   Yeah, they have q and x they have a very good operating system. They make like yeah, well
[01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:25.900]   They were smart. They bought q and x a real-time OS. Yes, it is very popular in a lot of
[01:57:25.900 --> 01:57:28.540]   It used to be popular in automakers. Yeah
[01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:37.420]   uh, Lenovo bought Motorola from uh, Motorola mobility from google google had bought it earlier made the moto x which is a wonderful phone and then
[01:57:38.380 --> 01:57:44.460]   I have that I still loved it. You know why because you could like squeeze it or tap it or shake it and the camera would come up and it was
[01:57:44.460 --> 01:57:46.700]   Amazing. It was like a boppin camera move
[01:57:46.700 --> 01:57:53.820]   Yeah, and then you would have another move for the flashlight the wrist move that's still the camera move and that envy was a flashlight
[01:57:53.820 --> 01:57:55.660]   Or so come on
[01:57:55.660 --> 01:58:03.420]   That's no it was but here's really handy. Here's the best thing the moto x did that no other device has done since then you could change the trigger word
[01:58:03.420 --> 01:58:07.980]   You could record any arbitrary trigger word that's gonna need so instead of saying
[01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:14.460]   Hey slomo. I said help me. I'll be one canobie or my only hope that's such a long. That is very long
[01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:17.740]   It never got triggered by accident except when watching star wars. Oh
[01:58:17.740 --> 01:58:21.740]   So every night around yeah, every night
[01:58:21.740 --> 01:58:24.860]   Facebook bought oculus. We mentioned that already
[01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:30.220]   I thought this was interesting came across this story and nobody mentions this now, but the nsa
[01:58:30.220 --> 01:58:34.780]   Hacked Huawei. Oh, you're not supposed to talk about this. That's why they mentioned it
[01:58:35.820 --> 01:58:37.820]   I'm gonna be in trouble. I'm in d
[01:58:37.820 --> 01:58:42.940]   Trouble. So before Huawei was accused of hacking us
[01:58:42.940 --> 01:58:46.860]   We were hacking them in 2014
[01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:54.460]   Hmm it was very controversial at the time obama's administration decided to give up control of the dns root zone
[01:58:54.460 --> 01:58:57.820]   This was after the Snowden revelations about the nsa
[01:58:57.820 --> 01:59:04.300]   The world said you shouldn't be running the internet and and a lot of people said obamas giving away the internet
[01:59:04.380 --> 01:59:09.260]   With rooskeys you're gonna get it. I think we can say now that the the multi-government
[01:59:09.260 --> 01:59:12.540]   Organizing body has actually done a good job, right?
[01:59:12.540 --> 01:59:16.780]   Except for the dot org domain. Oh my god, but other than that
[01:59:16.780 --> 01:59:23.020]   2014 was the year of the most annoying game of all time which one think
[01:59:23.020 --> 01:59:28.460]   Oh, I don't think it's a new flappy bird flappy bird. Oh wait flappy. I'll call a duty
[01:59:28.460 --> 01:59:33.900]   She just doesn't like paul to ride because it's come on. I had to throw that in there flappy bird. You don't remember flappy bird
[01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:41.020]   I remember it was a bird. No, no, no, no flappy bird was a interested store was created by a vietnamese teenager
[01:59:41.020 --> 01:59:43.740]   Put on the ice apple store for free
[01:59:43.740 --> 01:59:46.300]   He had ads in it
[01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:48.300]   It took off virally
[01:59:48.300 --> 01:59:53.580]   He made a ton of money from ads, but he felt guilty and actually six months later. He pulled it
[01:59:53.580 --> 01:59:56.380]   Said I can't in good faith
[01:59:56.380 --> 02:00:01.820]   Leave this on the store people are losing their lives to this game. I have no recollection there
[02:00:02.620 --> 02:00:06.220]   Money. Oh man flappy bird. I'm sure karston probably can
[02:00:06.220 --> 02:00:10.540]   It's okay. I'm okay. Not really. It's just the most frustrating annoying
[02:00:10.540 --> 02:00:12.380]   Basically, so you you uh
[02:00:12.380 --> 02:00:18.140]   It's a map that moves along while the bird sort of stays in one place and you have to tap to keep the the bird up in the air
[02:00:18.140 --> 02:00:21.180]   And so it's moving through pipes. It's a it's a little bit of a
[02:00:21.180 --> 02:00:23.740]   Cuz it would be kind of a mario with all
[02:00:23.740 --> 02:00:29.980]   It feels fine. No, there's another gaming story. We haven't talked about I'm bringing up a gaming story. Wow. Yeah, let's stop and pay
[02:00:30.780 --> 02:00:37.740]   Second what what's your gaming story? Microsoft bought moojang. Oh, which was the creator of mine. Yeah, minecraft
[02:00:37.740 --> 02:00:40.700]   3 billion
[02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:46.780]   Something like that 3.2. That sounds right. Yep. I remember everybody was like wait. Why did they just buy a mojo? Brilliant move
[02:00:46.780 --> 02:00:51.660]   2.5 2.5. Oh, I said it was and and notchboda candy house
[02:00:51.660 --> 02:00:59.420]   Uh facebook bought what's at for what turned out to be around 22 billion dollars now. That's when people went what the what?
[02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:03.260]   Yeah, but that I don't know if that was a bad move. I think it was a good move
[02:01:03.260 --> 02:01:06.300]   I think they've made their money better will move because I like what's happening right?
[02:01:06.300 --> 02:01:11.180]   Everybody uses it if you go outside the us everybody's on what's that everybody's
[02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:14.060]   This is actually my psa for what's app even though
[02:01:14.060 --> 02:01:16.380]   Facebook does own it
[02:01:16.380 --> 02:01:19.500]   everybody who complains about not being able to group text people on
[02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:25.020]   Android devices on texts period. Don't don't start with me. It's on Android devices
[02:01:25.260 --> 02:01:31.980]   I can I can group message just fine on iMessage. Thank you. Anyway, group messaging on what's at is amazing
[02:01:31.980 --> 02:01:36.620]   Yeah, all of the fancy. Yes all of the fancy chats, but yeah, what's up? It's the way to go
[02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:39.660]   Uh, especially when you have snobby app google bought nest
[02:01:39.660 --> 02:01:47.660]   3.2 billion it was a terrible terrible deal for them. You know, it's it's a funny
[02:01:47.660 --> 02:01:51.900]   It was great for nest but it was a funny picture to see this picture of tony fidel
[02:01:52.780 --> 02:01:57.260]   And uh, larry page and of course fidel eventually became very disillusioned
[02:01:57.260 --> 02:02:03.420]   And left i don't know how long that eventually what i think it was pretty almost instantly became very disillusioned
[02:02:03.420 --> 02:02:09.740]   And left but he did take 3.2 billion dollars in cash and he screwed up valuations for
[02:02:09.740 --> 02:02:17.580]   Years afterwards and made all these companies feel like they had a chance. I don't know if people remember this news week which was
[02:02:17.580 --> 02:02:20.620]   Resuming its print run. Yes
[02:02:20.620 --> 02:02:27.180]   Had a cover story in which they say we have found yes satoshi nakamoto the creator of
[02:02:27.180 --> 02:02:29.740]   bitcoin he's been hiding in plain sight
[02:02:29.740 --> 02:02:32.940]   Dorian nakamoto
[02:02:32.940 --> 02:02:36.380]   Problem was dorian had no experience with mathematics
[02:02:36.380 --> 02:02:41.660]   And there was no way he was satoshi nakamoto. I don't think
[02:02:41.660 --> 02:02:45.900]   Newsweek ever retracted this story. I don't think they did either
[02:02:46.460 --> 02:02:50.460]   It was 64 year old japanese man whose real name was satoshi
[02:02:50.460 --> 02:02:53.020]   Yep, uh nakamoto
[02:02:53.020 --> 02:02:57.420]   Um, this is like if we had an ai go do a news story for us and do the investigation
[02:02:57.420 --> 02:02:59.740]   Yeah, I know this seems
[02:02:59.740 --> 02:03:05.980]   But man it was it got i'm gonna mention the author lea mcgrath goodman. I don't know whatever happened to her but
[02:03:05.980 --> 02:03:07.580]   It
[02:03:07.580 --> 02:03:12.860]   Newsweek has long had long ago lost his luster probably but uh still it's that didn't help
[02:03:13.340 --> 02:03:16.460]   It was also the year of heart bleed which was probably the biggest
[02:03:16.460 --> 02:03:24.140]   It's kind of big security flaw turned out the nsa probably had been using it for years to spy on people
[02:03:24.140 --> 02:03:29.660]   It allowed you to spy on servers because of a flaw that had been in the open ssh for many many many
[02:03:29.660 --> 02:03:30.620]   Not only that though
[02:03:30.620 --> 02:03:34.220]   I think there will be marketing classes taught on heart bleed and i'm not saying that as a joke
[02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:38.220]   The way that this was the way that the brand stuck with it so much
[02:03:38.380 --> 02:03:45.660]   It was it was the first exploit to have a really good name and like a logo really good logo. Yeah, the whole kit and kaboo
[02:03:45.660 --> 02:03:54.540]   Uh, of course open ssh was quickly fixed by the open open ssl I should say was quickly fixed by the open source community
[02:03:54.540 --> 02:03:56.780]   um
[02:03:56.780 --> 02:04:01.500]   The beginning of the fcc's deliberations on whether to kill net neutrality began
[02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:04.460]   This is under the obama administration eventually the president obama
[02:04:05.100 --> 02:04:08.860]   Came out publicly saying no, you should not kill net neutrality
[02:04:08.860 --> 02:04:12.220]   Tom wheeler. It was a chairman of the fcc at the time and a former
[02:04:12.220 --> 02:04:20.140]   Verizon lobbyist who actually was an amazing fcc commissioner. I didn't get to that part
[02:04:20.140 --> 02:04:25.100]   Okay, I was like hold on remember remember uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
[02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:28.460]   What's the hbo news show?
[02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:31.900]   Oh the dingos you're putting the dingos john oliver john oliver
[02:04:32.540 --> 02:04:37.180]   Said it's like putting a dingo in charge of your baby to have tom wheeler running the fcc's
[02:04:37.180 --> 02:04:39.260]   Uh, uh, that's fun
[02:04:39.260 --> 02:04:43.340]   And and by the way tom wheeler was a little affronted that he called him a dingo but
[02:04:43.340 --> 02:04:48.300]   after many many protests after tens of thousands of comments
[02:04:48.300 --> 02:04:51.180]   Tom wheeler did the right thing
[02:04:51.180 --> 02:04:52.380]   comments
[02:04:52.380 --> 02:04:58.860]   Not fake comments tom really did the right thing and net neutrality was preserved at least until the next president when it was
[02:04:59.420 --> 02:05:02.860]   Well, it was preserved then it was destroyed in a lawsuit and then yeah
[02:05:02.860 --> 02:05:05.660]   Uh, I only dedicated 10 years of my life
[02:05:05.660 --> 02:05:14.220]   To net neutrality is this section? What is it section three of the telecommunication title two title two? Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, uh net neutrality
[02:05:14.220 --> 02:05:16.060]   Uh
[02:05:16.060 --> 02:05:18.700]   Also the right to be forgotten in the eu. Yeah
[02:05:18.700 --> 02:05:22.860]   Yeah, the supreme court in the eu said yes google you have to erase
[02:05:22.860 --> 02:05:27.900]   Uh web page references if somebody asks you and it's a legitimate request
[02:05:28.620 --> 02:05:33.980]   That's still the law of the land, uh throughout all of the eu and google still works in the eu
[02:05:33.980 --> 02:05:37.100]   I would just like to point that out for everybody who was freaking out
[02:05:37.100 --> 02:05:43.260]   It was a little nervous google had to create its own tribunal to judge whether it was a legitimate right
[02:05:43.260 --> 02:05:44.620]   Which is weird
[02:05:44.620 --> 02:05:46.700]   But it was the only way that this could even work
[02:05:46.700 --> 02:05:53.660]   Fortunately, most of the requests that weren't legitimate were rejected and only ones where there really was a good case
[02:05:53.660 --> 02:05:58.300]   I guess uh went through apple bought beats in them in may for three billion remember that
[02:05:58.780 --> 02:06:00.780]   I was stunned. I thought what the heck?
[02:06:00.780 --> 02:06:03.580]   What did they deal for them? I mean what?
[02:06:03.580 --> 02:06:09.500]   They got a music service remember that's where apple music came from and they got a fairly lucrative headphone
[02:06:09.500 --> 02:06:14.780]   Yeah, I'm sure they made the money back now. I think that there's a large group of folks who
[02:06:14.780 --> 02:06:17.500]   It's it's a sort of a cultural icon
[02:06:17.500 --> 02:06:21.420]   More so than it is good quality headphone
[02:06:21.420 --> 02:06:23.420]   And have a matter they so well
[02:06:23.420 --> 02:06:27.500]   Yeah, that's what I mean is that for that group of people so folks younger than I am
[02:06:27.500 --> 02:06:35.020]   Right in that group very much fans of the beats the dre beats headphones and happily have those around their neck on display
[02:06:35.020 --> 02:06:38.220]   So all right we're gonna have to do a speed round because we've just run at it
[02:06:38.220 --> 02:06:41.740]   We're running at a time not have ads good news
[02:06:41.740 --> 02:06:46.460]   Uh, so let me quickly wrap up 2014 and then we'll take a break
[02:06:46.460 --> 02:06:48.460]   um
[02:06:48.460 --> 02:06:52.060]   Amazon released the fire phone. Oh winner. Oh
[02:06:53.020 --> 02:06:55.260]   Uh, that was their 3d phone remember
[02:06:55.260 --> 02:07:00.140]   And everything you did with the phone got sent back to Amazon including all the pictures
[02:07:00.140 --> 02:07:07.500]   Nest bought drop cam after shortly after buying a google bought nest. They bought drop cam google technically bought drop cam
[02:07:07.500 --> 02:07:10.060]   Right nest did not want it didn't buy drop cam
[02:07:10.060 --> 02:07:12.860]   Was it google?
[02:07:12.860 --> 02:07:16.140]   Still google dang it
[02:07:16.140 --> 02:07:21.660]   Supreme court kills area. You remember area they had little dime-sized antennas in New York city
[02:07:21.900 --> 02:07:28.140]   I did everybody got to watch tv the Supreme Court said no no no an area shortly thereafter went out of business
[02:07:28.140 --> 02:07:30.220]   Oh my god, you two happened to this year?
[02:07:30.220 --> 02:07:35.660]   This was the year well we'll get to apples event, but I do have to mention one more you were talking about it
[02:07:35.660 --> 02:07:39.420]   Uh, youtube meme the ice bucket challenge
[02:07:39.420 --> 02:07:45.660]   Yep, people dumping, uh ice over their heads then challenging other people it spread like
[02:07:45.660 --> 02:07:51.820]   Wildfire I even did it. I did one. I did it. Oh, such a did one. I remember that
[02:07:52.460 --> 02:07:57.340]   The ice bucket challenge it is not fun. No, it's not it is not fun
[02:07:57.340 --> 02:08:02.380]   And I resisted it for a long time. I was late to do it, but I finally gave in to the
[02:08:02.380 --> 02:08:08.140]   Cool kids all over your newsfeed dumping buckets of ice water on themselves. You're not alone
[02:08:08.140 --> 02:08:13.420]   That's all i'm gonna say about that. That is quite you're not alone quite the uh
[02:08:13.420 --> 02:08:17.740]   Amazon made a good purchase for a long time. I was rumored google was going to buy twitch
[02:08:18.380 --> 02:08:23.340]   And put it rolling the youtube amazon jumped around them and bought twitch
[02:08:23.340 --> 02:08:25.100]   That was a good movie amazon
[02:08:25.100 --> 02:08:31.100]   Not them in the streaming video business twitch turned out to be very valuable as samson bought smart things 200 million dollars
[02:08:31.100 --> 02:08:33.180]   That's a bargain. I would guess
[02:08:33.180 --> 02:08:41.260]   And it was in september that scarlet joe hanson and other movie stars naked pictures leaked out to the internet and something
[02:08:41.260 --> 02:08:47.180]   I hate this. I hate this. It was terrible. It was bad PR for apple. They were all stored on my cloud
[02:08:47.660 --> 02:08:54.060]   Who called it that I never saw it called that that was a reddit thing. Yeah, it was a reddit thing. It's of course it was a reddit thing
[02:08:54.060 --> 02:08:55.420]   Yeah, just
[02:08:55.420 --> 02:08:57.420]   apple announced the apple watch
[02:08:57.420 --> 02:09:04.220]   And at that same event the most personal device you'll ever own at that same event get ready with your finger
[02:09:04.220 --> 02:09:07.020]   Bono and tim cook did this
[02:09:07.020 --> 02:09:13.260]   And pushed the youtube album the age of innocence to everybody's iPhone. I didn't want it
[02:09:13.260 --> 02:09:17.580]   You get an album and you get an album and you and you and everyone said how do we remove it?
[02:09:17.580 --> 02:09:22.700]   I love youtube but boy it pissed people off. Oh man apple had to create a page on how to get rid of it
[02:09:22.700 --> 02:09:25.740]   Never again
[02:09:25.740 --> 02:09:33.180]   Mac world magazine closed that was pc world of closed the year before really we're starting this in this decade to see all the paper magazines just go away
[02:09:33.180 --> 02:09:36.140]   And uh, remember surface they bought
[02:09:36.140 --> 02:09:41.820]   I think 400 million dollar deal to get the nfl to use surface
[02:09:41.820 --> 02:09:44.540]   They still do that deal a sore spot
[02:09:46.220 --> 02:09:51.820]   And bell check through it and in the whole year sports ball all of the deal all of the sports and answers called them ipads
[02:09:51.820 --> 02:09:53.820]   Yes, whole year
[02:09:53.820 --> 02:09:55.820]   On the back michrashof surface
[02:09:55.820 --> 02:10:00.380]   It's a service. Yeah, and you can see the coach there with their ipad
[02:10:00.380 --> 02:10:07.820]   Drawn up the place apple that fall released the first of their big phones the iphone six and the six plus
[02:10:07.820 --> 02:10:14.620]   And remember bend gate. It was such a big phone that if you really tried hard you could bend it consumer reports finally said
[02:10:14.780 --> 02:10:18.380]   It's not more bendable than any other phone. Just stop trying to bend it. Okay
[02:10:18.380 --> 02:10:20.620]   Uh
[02:10:20.620 --> 02:10:26.220]   This is a sad one gamer gate was big briano wu got chased from her home in 2014
[02:10:26.220 --> 02:10:31.500]   Because of harassment from trolls internet trolls harassing women in gaming
[02:10:31.500 --> 02:10:36.780]   shameful a shameful event and during that time as i'm talking about it
[02:10:36.780 --> 02:10:42.540]   People still would say to me they'd be even in the chair must it's not about
[02:10:43.340 --> 02:10:45.340]   harassing people
[02:10:45.340 --> 02:10:47.820]   And games
[02:10:47.820 --> 02:10:49.820]   Better that's all we're saying
[02:10:49.820 --> 02:10:57.260]   No, it was about harassing people in november amazon introduced something that has changed our lives not the fire phone
[02:10:57.260 --> 02:11:01.980]   So that was the first try the amazon echo. Oh my goodness
[02:11:01.980 --> 02:11:06.540]   It's changed our life so much that we have to not say certain words when we talk. Can't talk about it
[02:11:06.540 --> 02:11:09.020]   It's i can't say what it did
[02:11:09.340 --> 02:11:13.500]   And i think this is the year microsoft introduced cortana as well
[02:11:13.500 --> 02:11:19.980]   Oh bless that beautiful soul. In fact, I think I have an article from april 2014 of
[02:11:19.980 --> 02:11:23.660]   Of somebody calling it a a serial killer
[02:11:23.660 --> 02:11:29.580]   A serial killer that wasn't a serial killer
[02:11:29.580 --> 02:11:35.260]   Was it what microsoft was hoping yeah, that was there there were actually had a funeral on campus for a
[02:11:35.260 --> 02:11:37.260]   Yeah, yeah
[02:11:37.260 --> 02:11:39.260]   It was a big over there
[02:11:39.260 --> 02:11:44.220]   It seems like this was more recent, but in 2014 and taylor swift said streaming is bad
[02:11:44.220 --> 02:11:50.140]   i'm not going to put my next album on spotify and any free streaming was that also the introduction of
[02:11:50.140 --> 02:11:53.740]   famous people doing screenshots of
[02:11:53.740 --> 02:11:57.980]   The ios notes app on their phone to post long messages on to twitter
[02:11:57.980 --> 02:12:04.700]   Interesting cultural question right there because it was 140 characters still yeah. Oh, was that a bad
[02:12:05.260 --> 02:12:11.100]   Thing to do it was also in december the year that spain decided to the google news was just not good for
[02:12:11.100 --> 02:12:12.620]   public
[02:12:12.620 --> 02:12:16.460]   And forced them out to the great detriment of spanish newspapers
[02:12:16.460 --> 02:12:21.100]   I don't I guess they're backed by now, but uh, holy cow that was a mess
[02:12:21.100 --> 02:12:27.500]   Uh, so a big year 2014 will go on to the rest of the decade and we'll just do that really fast
[02:12:27.500 --> 02:12:34.700]   And just a bit you know this is a great year to give your friends your family yourself

[02:15:41.500 --> 02:15:46.620]   All right, Lisa's tapping her watch. Yes. By the way, it's an apple watch which is launched in 2015
[02:15:48.460 --> 02:15:53.340]   I I actually was very skeptical. I thought in fact I think I said at the end of 2015. This is a flop
[02:15:53.340 --> 02:15:57.500]   Boy was I wrong, but I honestly it took time it took time and it
[02:15:57.500 --> 02:16:02.460]   Kind of and it you know, I mean it's only now you could actually tell time from the apple watch so
[02:16:02.460 --> 02:16:08.140]   That's good. Look it was as I mentioned they announced it as the most personal device you'll ever own
[02:16:08.140 --> 02:16:16.380]   They didn't know what it was going to be yet and it's only been through the the iterations that they've come across this idea that it's this great personal
[02:16:16.860 --> 02:16:20.780]   Fitness and health device and so now they're really honed in on that
[02:16:20.780 --> 02:16:28.620]   You can't send someone your heartbeat anymore and do weird taps on people when you're not there in per it's it's the stuff that they came out with
[02:16:28.620 --> 02:16:32.540]   In the beginning they thought I was just going to be this personal device on your wrist to communicate with others
[02:16:32.540 --> 02:16:37.740]   Throwing a lot of spaghetti against the wall like yeah walkie-talkie that which seemed like a good idea
[02:16:37.740 --> 02:16:43.020]   But nobody really wanted right but I think they found one app that everybody would love
[02:16:43.500 --> 02:16:47.020]   My copying Fitbit which already had a product in the market. I don't know why I'm getting so
[02:16:47.020 --> 02:16:48.940]   I know
[02:16:48.940 --> 02:16:52.140]   Pretty much kill fit. Oh it's intense. You're a Fitbit lover. I can tell
[02:16:52.140 --> 02:16:54.380]   Yeah, she's learning
[02:16:54.380 --> 02:16:59.420]   What do you do even though Google owns them they bought Fitbit in 2019 we're jumping ahead a little bit
[02:16:59.420 --> 02:17:03.740]   Uh, you don't have a problem with it a lot of people turned in their Fitbits
[02:17:03.740 --> 02:17:08.780]   That's a twig topic and all to get us it'll take us out of here the Fitbit buyback program
[02:17:09.100 --> 02:17:13.660]   I'm excited about it. I think Google's gonna have context based on this that is gonna be interesting
[02:17:13.660 --> 02:17:20.140]   And Google's really struggled, you know, it was only a year later after the apple watch came out the Google introduced Google where and it was never
[02:17:20.140 --> 02:17:23.660]   Really took off. I liked it. I tried to use it
[02:17:23.660 --> 02:17:29.260]   I think they came out with some really neat. We're looking watches, but they were all giant. What about the surface band?
[02:17:29.260 --> 02:17:35.820]   That was a thing. That was a thing. It wasn't a surface band. Microsoft band. Oh, yeah, it was a short-lived
[02:17:35.980 --> 02:17:40.300]   What did they ban when you look at it from a distance like you're in a helicopter looking down
[02:17:40.300 --> 02:17:42.700]   It looks like
[02:17:42.700 --> 02:17:44.700]   After all announces something
[02:17:44.700 --> 02:17:50.540]   And then Microsoft says oh, yeah, we got that and you know what we're gonna do it better and a year later. It's dead
[02:17:50.540 --> 02:17:52.380]   Yeah, yeah
[02:17:52.380 --> 02:17:57.340]   Well, there were a ton of jobber had their band there was the Nike fuel bay. I mean, right?
[02:17:57.340 --> 02:17:59.340]   Oh, I don't know the Nike fuel band. Yeah
[02:18:00.620 --> 02:18:07.340]   Um, USB-C was introduced in 2015. It actually came out that has changed the world in a good way
[02:18:07.340 --> 02:18:12.220]   It has not changed the world as much as it needs to it should because micro USB is still ever
[02:18:12.220 --> 02:18:13.180]   I'm still yeah
[02:18:13.180 --> 02:18:18.300]   I'm still dongling like a mad woman us you get those IOT devices and a lot of them seem to have old
[02:18:18.300 --> 02:18:21.020]   Plus surface, you know, they've been really
[02:18:21.020 --> 02:18:25.900]   It has USB-C now and it charges like look how long that took but it's not thunderbolt. No, it's not thunderbolt
[02:18:25.900 --> 02:18:28.460]   Yeah, and that's the real problem with USB-C it looks the same
[02:18:28.860 --> 02:18:31.180]   But it can do a variety of things and you never clear
[02:18:31.180 --> 02:18:37.580]   They're supposed to be logos are their logos next to your USB-C connector. I hope that no, that's the problem
[02:18:37.580 --> 02:18:44.060]   They're supposed to USB coalition says no you put this and it'll tell you what the functions are
[02:18:44.060 --> 02:18:46.380]   To dictate a font size
[02:18:46.380 --> 02:18:51.260]   Yeah, they're all have to do that. I bet you it doesn't have any labels. I would guess I know the apples
[02:18:51.260 --> 02:18:57.340]   Too pretty to do that. Why not? Yeah, let's leave it blank and what else came out in 2010. I'm sorry 2015
[02:18:57.420 --> 02:19:02.060]   Let's go back to 2010 started. I feel like we missed a lot from the top. What else came out 2015?
[02:19:02.060 --> 02:19:04.940]   Windows 10
[02:19:04.940 --> 02:19:12.700]   And surface surface. Oh my god. I already had been out, but this was the real start of surface
[02:19:12.700 --> 02:19:15.900]   I got so excited. I was like, who is this Microsoft?
[02:19:15.900 --> 02:19:22.060]   I had not seen in the past and to their first Microsoft this wasn't an iPad clone
[02:19:22.060 --> 02:19:25.020]   This was a new form factor for a Windows PC
[02:19:25.020 --> 02:19:31.260]   Yeah, and it so I was kind of excited about it. So as you all know, I tried it on my lap
[02:19:31.260 --> 02:19:32.700]   It didn't really work out
[02:19:32.700 --> 02:19:37.740]   But this finally by you know Microsoft's thing is by their third try of something they get it right
[02:19:37.740 --> 02:19:40.060]   Surface laptop for the Microsoft band
[02:19:40.060 --> 02:19:42.940]   They didn't get it if they would have done the third one
[02:19:42.940 --> 02:19:44.940]   Yes
[02:19:44.940 --> 02:19:46.140]   Yes
[02:19:46.140 --> 02:19:47.820]   So close missed it by that much
[02:19:47.820 --> 02:19:51.260]   Yeah, but Windows 10, you know, they skipped nine went to ten
[02:19:52.140 --> 02:19:54.140]   And as well as version of Windows
[02:19:54.140 --> 02:20:02.220]   We'll see we'll see it was in 2015 that alphabet was created there's where alpha
[02:20:02.220 --> 02:20:08.220]   Pichai now runs Google Larry Page moves upstairs to run alphabet and fail
[02:20:08.220 --> 02:20:14.140]   This was a four-year transition that involved creating a new company
[02:20:14.140 --> 02:20:19.500]   And this is that no one calls doing what we're doing today is actually a really interesting exercise
[02:20:19.900 --> 02:20:25.500]   Because you do have to step back a little bit to see oh, yeah, they started this in 2015 and now this is the
[02:20:25.500 --> 02:20:31.260]   conclusion of it surface started 2015 and now we have really a very credible line of
[02:20:31.260 --> 02:20:37.100]   Hardware from Microsoft beautiful hardware. Let's not forget. This was their first hardware was surface art team and surface
[02:20:37.100 --> 02:20:39.180]   They had never done a computer. Great
[02:20:39.180 --> 02:20:41.260]   So that was a big deal
[02:20:41.260 --> 02:20:46.140]   Tesla turned on autopilot on the model which is still not in the final form
[02:20:47.260 --> 02:20:54.460]   Still a beta still not autopilot frankly. Yeah, it's it's driver assist. That's what it's been. That's what it's always been
[02:20:54.460 --> 02:20:57.820]   But it was a hell of a lot of marketing
[02:20:57.820 --> 02:21:01.740]   Which has caused a lot of problems and some deaths. I think we can say
[02:21:01.740 --> 02:21:05.420]   People trusting autopilot to drive them
[02:21:05.420 --> 02:21:11.980]   Well, that's because it's called autopilot. That's right. If you think it's autopilot, it ain't it ain't there you go
[02:21:11.980 --> 02:21:16.300]   That's the new the new psa. Oh, it looks like autopilot
[02:21:16.620 --> 02:21:18.620]   But it's not
[02:21:18.620 --> 02:21:21.500]   We have it. Is it this or this?
[02:21:21.500 --> 02:21:23.660]   um
[02:21:23.660 --> 02:21:27.260]   Which one I have it in 2016 and 2015. I think
[02:21:27.260 --> 02:21:33.980]   What's the google? I think it was probably there's a couple of cases this where it was announced one year and again
[02:21:33.980 --> 02:21:37.020]   It didn't actually emerge into the year of hollens
[02:21:37.020 --> 02:21:41.500]   Hollens was announced in 2015. I was also very excited about that from the get-go
[02:21:41.500 --> 02:21:44.860]   I'm going when do I get to Minecraft on my kitchen table?
[02:21:44.860 --> 02:21:48.700]   Remember that they showed minecraft and it's only this year
[02:21:48.700 --> 02:21:52.460]   They finally came out with minecrafters to kind of sort of do what they show although mary
[02:21:52.460 --> 02:21:56.300]   Joe foley and paul thorot only used the hollolens to balance their checkbooks
[02:21:56.300 --> 02:22:03.900]   No, you know what so they fixed they they were going in a consumer direction with hollolens and then they had to sell you
[02:22:03.900 --> 02:22:07.100]   Hate consumers. I hate consumers, but also they're doing the right thing
[02:22:07.100 --> 02:22:14.300]   Have you tried hollolens to yes because it's amazing. I like did you do so much better the demo where you like put the wires through the yeah
[02:22:14.620 --> 02:22:18.220]   Yep, they had you like build the wiring of a plain fuselage
[02:22:18.220 --> 02:22:25.020]   A lot of real like things with hollolens too. It's very fun. It still feels like a demo not a product
[02:22:25.020 --> 02:22:33.180]   Futuristic I see so when I tour factories like where people are hardcore making some of them are wearing google glass
[02:22:33.180 --> 02:22:40.060]   No, no, they're not they're using hollolens and I have actually seen these in production environments
[02:22:40.140 --> 02:22:44.300]   All of our editors were google glass while they're working. I will never wear that on the show
[02:22:44.300 --> 02:22:50.700]   Oh, we're hollolens on this show before I did it. We want you know, so one windows weekly
[02:22:50.700 --> 02:22:57.820]   We actually tried the hollolens remember that we were in holland. Yeah, we were using it on the show and shut and broadcasting what it looks like
[02:22:57.820 --> 02:23:06.460]   Oh, that is so neat. That is neat. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it was a developer of uh of hollands. Yeah, we saw the airport
[02:23:06.460 --> 02:23:09.980]   I know that was super cool. Yeah, um
[02:23:10.300 --> 02:23:14.220]   Jumping to 2016 where tesla finally turns on the autopilot
[02:23:14.220 --> 02:23:17.900]   Airpods come out. Can you believe it? They've been around for that long?
[02:23:17.900 --> 02:23:23.420]   Yeah, like three years. Yeah, it was the beginning of the end of the headphone jack. That's what it was, right?
[02:23:23.420 --> 02:23:30.780]   Yeah, rest in peace and the and the and the wireless headphone revolution, which i'm not all that crazy about but I guess i'm kind of accepting
[02:23:30.780 --> 02:23:35.660]   Accepted it. That's how I feel about it too. Yeah, I have not you still you're still wired in
[02:23:36.060 --> 02:23:41.020]   I have both there's a headphone jack on this I think yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it was all here as well
[02:23:41.020 --> 02:23:43.340]   2016 yeah
[02:23:43.340 --> 02:23:48.620]   And did ipads finally get rid of headphone jacks? No, some of them have but the pros don't yeah pros don't wait
[02:23:48.620 --> 02:23:54.860]   Yeah, it was the year the pro emerged. Oh the ipad pro the ipad pro which I think was a very oh my god
[02:23:54.860 --> 02:24:01.900]   Beautiful. Oh my gosh 2016 is the year my family like got back together again through the love of
[02:24:02.460 --> 02:24:04.460]   Pokemon go
[02:24:04.460 --> 02:24:11.020]   I will never forget july 2016 and it was it was all the rage wasn't it?
[02:24:11.020 --> 02:24:13.100]   I mean everywhere you'd go there'd be
[02:24:13.100 --> 02:24:16.460]   Strange people wandering looking at their phones and clumps
[02:24:16.460 --> 02:24:22.380]   Encircing because it would it wouldn't catch it the server would keep going down in the middle of your battle
[02:24:22.380 --> 02:24:24.940]   No, at least you still plays it
[02:24:24.940 --> 02:24:31.180]   Uh both lee said I are peaked level 40 because we couldn't stop playing it still a great game
[02:24:31.340 --> 02:24:34.940]   Gotta catchable 2016 no, but the real big thing in 2016
[02:24:34.940 --> 02:24:38.380]   Microsoft buys linked in 26 billion
[02:24:38.380 --> 02:24:41.100]   Isn't it interesting how the numbers have been going up
[02:24:41.100 --> 02:24:45.340]   They buy the biggest acquisition in microsoft's history
[02:24:45.340 --> 02:24:48.860]   Since they haven't bought anything big they bought that's because they're still trying to make their money
[02:24:48.860 --> 02:24:53.980]   Yes, they bought linkedin for all the emails didn't they they just want to increase their well remember how angry
[02:24:53.980 --> 02:25:01.100]   Benioff mark Benioff was it sales force about microsoft? Why he outbid them and they sold to microsoft
[02:25:01.740 --> 02:25:06.540]   So his contention was well microsoft's just going to use all that data right and we're not going to get to use it
[02:25:06.540 --> 02:25:11.180]   So and they're going to lock us out. That's right. So how's that been? Have they locked them out? No?
[02:25:11.180 --> 02:25:17.980]   And actually they just had a nice little tenatet recently where there was such a little was on stage with my penny off
[02:25:17.980 --> 02:25:22.780]   Okay, so in the rarefied world of ceos you gotta make friends your old friends
[02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:25.420]   Yeah, they want to all go to the
[02:25:26.060 --> 02:25:31.100]   They all shells together and I think they want is they all have yeah, they've paid for their
[02:25:31.100 --> 02:25:36.140]   Paid for the bridge. They've got their own little rooms. Yeah, I got the eye on the
[02:25:36.140 --> 02:25:38.460]   I'm going to say panic panic rooms
[02:25:38.460 --> 02:25:42.060]   They're buying the island of the night was on this rundown
[02:25:42.060 --> 02:25:45.020]   He did do that in this decade his own hawaiian island
[02:25:45.020 --> 02:25:52.300]   And of course mark succuburg famously bought a big ranch on kawai and then started to fence it off much to the disturb
[02:25:53.340 --> 02:25:58.460]   Turbents of the locals. Hey, let's talk about exploding phones. Oh my god. No seven
[02:25:58.460 --> 02:26:01.260]   2016 the note seven
[02:26:01.260 --> 02:26:05.180]   Man that was I thought the end of the line for Samsung phones
[02:26:05.180 --> 02:26:10.140]   I really thought that was going to be such a black mark on Samsung that they would never be able to dig out
[02:26:10.140 --> 02:26:13.260]   Or if they did it would take them a while next year if everybody forgot
[02:26:13.260 --> 02:26:16.540]   We still I mean we still make jokes. I mean, but yes
[02:26:16.540 --> 02:26:21.580]   It's like it didn't slow down sales of the no time. It was a really good phone
[02:26:22.220 --> 02:26:25.660]   I know before it exploded people loved it. Yeah, my parents
[02:26:25.660 --> 02:26:32.700]   They had to like rise it had to cut off their service before my parents were they they charged it at night inside a pyrex
[02:26:32.700 --> 02:26:37.980]   Bowl in face it exploded just in case and that would have been fine on the back porch
[02:26:37.980 --> 02:26:44.460]   I was like what is happening here? They're like well that's the case it explodes here is a surprise
[02:26:44.460 --> 02:26:48.860]   It wasn't till 2016 that google introduced the assistant
[02:26:50.460 --> 02:26:54.540]   So cortana's out this way out. Siri was out through wow previous decade
[02:26:54.540 --> 02:26:57.500]   slo-mo
[02:26:57.500 --> 02:27:04.460]   Guillermo and alia alia ocean. We're out guillermo came along in 2016. Holy moly and yet big speed
[02:27:04.460 --> 02:27:07.340]   Still
[02:27:07.340 --> 02:27:15.820]   Cortana is really kind of faded away. No, so cortana is clippy 2.0. No no wrong you are wrong
[02:27:17.980 --> 02:27:23.500]   Okay, tell me I'm being reborn as an assistant inside of your favorite apps like outlook
[02:27:23.500 --> 02:27:26.380]   So you're gonna just have a good way
[02:27:26.380 --> 02:27:29.500]   That's exactly
[02:27:29.500 --> 02:27:35.020]   Because you're going to have it's a talking clippy. Well, it's never good clippy was bad
[02:27:35.020 --> 02:27:41.500]   I understand that but I in terms of you're making a shopping list in terms of being an assistant that helps you be more productive
[02:27:41.500 --> 02:27:45.100]   That's what clippy was designed to do and it just didn't do a very good job at it
[02:27:45.340 --> 02:27:50.220]   And cortana is going to actually be helpful. We talked about the email like reading your emails helping you move to the next one
[02:27:50.220 --> 02:27:55.180]   Yeah, so when I say sometimes a 2.0 product comes out and it's worse than the 1.0
[02:27:55.180 --> 02:27:58.060]   But I'm saying 2.0 as an improvements made to clippy
[02:27:58.060 --> 02:28:04.700]   2017 it's I got to get one of those calendars. You know how the old movies with the ages are flipping by
[02:28:04.700 --> 02:28:09.420]   2017 fortnight comes oh my god forget pokemon go
[02:28:09.420 --> 02:28:13.500]   About it. You got to do the you got an antenna switch
[02:28:14.060 --> 02:28:17.100]   The oatmeal dance the old thing it's flossing. They call it
[02:28:17.100 --> 02:28:21.100]   Because I think you're making oatmeal
[02:28:21.100 --> 02:28:23.500]   um
[02:28:23.500 --> 02:28:25.900]   Ransomware continues to roll in fact
[02:28:25.900 --> 02:28:30.300]   That's the story of the next three years is ransomware gets bigger and then bigger and the bigger jeff bazos
[02:28:30.300 --> 02:28:34.540]   The richest man in the world not anymore though bill gates is surpassed him again
[02:28:34.540 --> 02:28:39.820]   Back and forth after you know 50 billion or so does it really matter? No?
[02:28:39.820 --> 02:28:42.860]   I think I think to them it might matter
[02:28:42.860 --> 02:28:44.860]   Probably
[02:28:44.860 --> 02:28:47.420]   There's a great story about
[02:28:47.420 --> 02:28:50.460]   I think was it scott mcknilly
[02:28:50.460 --> 02:28:52.220]   and
[02:28:52.220 --> 02:28:56.940]   Jim clark who sold netscape for a lot of money the first big tech ipo back in the 90s
[02:28:56.940 --> 02:29:01.500]   Both have massive yachts. They all have massive yachts
[02:29:01.500 --> 02:29:05.420]   But the race is to who could have the tallest yacht oh brother
[02:29:05.420 --> 02:29:09.260]   There's a problem because if it gets too tall, I can't go under the golden gate bridge
[02:29:09.740 --> 02:29:12.380]   So I as I remember I think is Jim clark got
[02:29:12.380 --> 02:29:19.020]   within an inch or two of the bottom deck of the golden gate bridge and everybody's going
[02:29:19.020 --> 02:29:21.580]   Yeah, yeah
[02:29:21.580 --> 02:29:23.580]   So somebody will come up with a collapsing mask
[02:29:23.580 --> 02:29:27.820]   I'm gonna say a little yeah, yeah or they'll pay to have the golden gate bridge turn into one
[02:29:27.820 --> 02:29:31.580]   Oh, right. Oh just buy the golden gate bridge. Yes. What am I thinking?
[02:29:31.580 --> 02:29:35.660]   Uh amazon bought whole foods in 2017. It's kind of hard to believe it was that long ago
[02:29:35.660 --> 02:29:38.940]   It feels like that was just yesterday. I was on vacation in Costa Rica when that deal happened
[02:29:39.900 --> 02:29:42.540]   Did you so you didn't get a cheap Thanksgiving? I did not
[02:29:42.540 --> 02:29:45.500]   Um
[02:29:45.500 --> 02:29:49.420]   iPhone 10 came out for apple actually we skipped
[02:29:49.420 --> 02:29:52.540]   an earlier iPhone the iPhone 5 which is the uh
[02:29:52.540 --> 02:29:55.100]   when uh
[02:29:55.100 --> 02:29:59.100]   Touch ID came. Oh, that's right. Yeah. I fought 10 introduced face ID. Yeah
[02:29:59.100 --> 02:30:05.820]   Big jump forward and that was anxiety about a couple of years earlier apple bought the company prime sense that created the connect
[02:30:06.220 --> 02:30:13.820]   For microsoft bottom right now from under microsoft and a couple of years later. They've got face ID and microsoft's got nothing
[02:30:13.820 --> 02:30:19.660]   Hey microsoft didn't do windows 9. I found didn't do apple
[02:30:19.660 --> 02:30:23.500]   Correct and galaxy no didn't do 8
[02:30:23.500 --> 02:30:28.380]   Because 789 right that was microsoft's joke
[02:30:28.380 --> 02:30:31.340]   That's right
[02:30:31.340 --> 02:30:35.180]   James day more the famous James day or more memo okay. We're not no
[02:30:35.740 --> 02:30:37.100]   Oh moving
[02:30:37.100 --> 02:30:42.140]   No, that's not famous. Well, it's famous only because it was the beginning culturally of
[02:30:42.140 --> 02:30:47.180]   the the kind of the difficulties the employment difficulties google's still undergoing
[02:30:47.180 --> 02:30:53.900]   Twitter added uh double the character count to you know what my first tweet was when we went to 280
[02:30:53.900 --> 02:30:59.500]   Uh, it was finally the time thumbs up. It was fun. Yeah. No, it was finally the time where I could quote
[02:30:59.500 --> 02:31:05.020]   Michael scott when he's talking about how computers are trying to kill us all
[02:31:05.420 --> 02:31:09.340]   You can get the whole quote in and I could finally get the whole quote in so you can go back and look at that
[02:31:09.340 --> 02:31:15.660]   If you want to do you remember the juicero? I do of course wait you skipped the big story. What was the big story?
[02:31:15.660 --> 02:31:18.860]   Oh, that was the introduction introduction of fuzzy

[02:31:23.020 --> 02:31:25.260]   I don't even know what you're talking about. I'll count our
[02:31:25.260 --> 02:31:26.460]   But keyboard
[02:31:26.460 --> 02:31:27.340]   like
[02:31:27.340 --> 02:31:29.340]   If I had all this I could show you
[02:31:29.340 --> 02:31:31.340]   fabric that they started putting on
[02:31:31.340 --> 02:31:32.700]   keyboards, which is
[02:31:32.700 --> 02:31:39.820]   Horrible, but she stays is a vegetarian. She doesn't like it. So are you she doesn't like the idea of al-kantara's being sacrificed to make keyboards
[02:31:39.820 --> 02:31:43.500]   No, you don't want to kill all the al-kantara. I don't blame her. I'm not a vegetarian. What's it?
[02:31:43.500 --> 02:31:49.660]   What is happening here that whole sentence was species the entire sentence
[02:31:49.660 --> 02:31:56.220]   Every fact in that sentence those live al-kantara sounded good the jungle but actually had nothing to do with anything
[02:31:56.220 --> 02:32:00.540]   Stacy like steak al-kantara is made out of plastic
[02:32:01.260 --> 02:32:04.220]   And it on I am a vegetarian well, pescatarian pescatarian
[02:32:04.220 --> 02:32:13.420]   Alpha go beats lee seed all the go master who just retired just retired because he says there's no point right playing anymore

[02:32:32.780 --> 02:32:38.540]   Didn't you they weren't gonna give us any yeah, they said well, everybody does it then you're only gonna get like five cents
[02:32:38.540 --> 02:32:41.260]   I too
[02:32:41.260 --> 02:32:43.260]   Model three came out in 2017
[02:32:43.260 --> 02:32:48.860]   I still have my reservation. I could get a thousand dollars back anytime. I
[02:32:48.860 --> 02:32:54.780]   Still have my reservation. Yeah, okay, Microsoft now to 2018
[02:32:55.740 --> 02:32:59.020]   Microsoft buys github a mere 7.5 billion
[02:32:59.020 --> 02:33:03.500]   But remember how upset the open source community was a lot of people said i'm leaving
[02:33:03.500 --> 02:33:09.340]   They're still upset. Are they a lot of people are still they've gotten a lot of people pass this that
[02:33:09.340 --> 02:33:14.300]   Microsoft's still the company that called Lennox cancer, but some people still hold on to that
[02:33:14.300 --> 02:33:17.820]   Elon Musk smokes a joint on joe rogan
[02:33:17.820 --> 02:33:21.420]   Wait, hold on when you say on joe rogan
[02:33:22.300 --> 02:33:25.580]   Who was on joe rogan? He's on joe rogan's show gotcha

[02:33:29.580 --> 02:33:36.940]   Elon takes a puff which endangers his department of defense contract, but after due consideration the dio he says
[02:33:36.940 --> 02:33:43.980]   Was this before after the scc investigated him are we there yet? This was after that. Okay. Yeah, that was after his pedo tweet
[02:33:43.980 --> 02:33:49.820]   Which he now says the trials ongoing. It's right now. Yeah, it's a common insult when he was a kid
[02:33:49.900 --> 02:33:54.460]   Everybody called everybody a pedo. Don't you I called you a pedo. I'll Trevor no one. See if that's true
[02:33:54.460 --> 02:33:59.900]   Yeah, it's not true. No, but it's he's saying south because he was south african that was okay. Well, yeah, that's
[02:33:59.900 --> 02:34:06.860]   Uh apple hits a trillion dollars becomes the most valuable company of all time ever
[02:34:06.860 --> 02:34:15.100]   But uh larry elison still says you shouldn't buy any apple stock and I can't even say it seriously google removes do not be evil from its
[02:34:15.100 --> 02:34:16.940]   code
[02:34:16.940 --> 02:34:23.180]   And this is when it sold uh the boston dynamics. Yeah, it got rid of the robot because they said
[02:34:23.180 --> 02:34:28.380]   There's still some defense contracts and really it's a bad look for if we're going to do skynet
[02:34:28.380 --> 02:34:31.980]   We probably shouldn't do that and have oh no, they sold it in 2017 my bad
[02:34:31.980 --> 02:34:33.500]   All right
[02:34:33.500 --> 02:34:35.340]   uh apple
[02:34:35.340 --> 02:34:38.860]   And uh and uh sam san berry the hatchet by the way
[02:34:38.860 --> 02:34:43.260]   Long time in 2010 and I didn't mention a google and oracle began
[02:34:44.060 --> 02:34:49.180]   It is now going back to the supreme court the java fight one last time that is a non-going thing
[02:34:49.180 --> 02:34:54.860]   The sam san thing went through most of the decade. Yep. These court things are just a bad idea
[02:34:54.860 --> 02:34:56.940]   bad idea
[02:34:56.940 --> 02:35:02.620]   Uh microsoft also hits the uh, what is that how many billions is that I can't read all those zeros
[02:35:02.620 --> 02:35:03.820]   A trillion
[02:35:03.820 --> 02:35:07.340]   100 billion annual revenue for the first time that's a lot
[02:35:07.340 --> 02:35:12.780]   Then it also became briefly like one for five seconds a trillion dollar. Yeah, a trillion dollar coming
[02:35:13.660 --> 02:35:19.100]   Uh elan sold the flame thrower. I remember that which is really boring company. Yeah the boring company
[02:35:19.100 --> 02:35:21.900]   and uh melt down inspector
[02:35:21.900 --> 02:35:24.780]   Uh, which still plague intel
[02:35:24.780 --> 02:35:28.780]   Uh the uh the blood bugs in their speculative execution pipeline
[02:35:28.780 --> 02:35:31.420]   Uh, we're discovered in 2018
[02:35:31.420 --> 02:35:37.420]   And we heard a story in 2018 that a chinese physician had used crisper
[02:35:37.420 --> 02:35:42.700]   To edit the genes of two or three or more babies babies were later born
[02:35:43.180 --> 02:35:49.740]   That was never really proven true or untrue. We just still missing though. He disappeared. Oh, yeah, which is
[02:35:49.740 --> 02:35:51.740]   though
[02:35:51.740 --> 02:35:54.300]   Probably what happens if you do that the chinese really
[02:35:54.300 --> 02:36:01.020]   Chinese really, uh, you know, there's an international agreement not to do that and even though the chinese aren't signatories to it
[02:36:01.020 --> 02:36:02.540]   They didn't want the
[02:36:02.540 --> 02:36:04.540]   Embarrassing scrutiny scrutiny. There you go
[02:36:04.540 --> 02:36:10.140]   My uh, by the way, it was in 2018 that mark zucker berg said i'm going to fix facebook
[02:36:10.140 --> 02:36:12.620]   How's that going mark?
[02:36:12.780 --> 02:36:14.780]   Dory i'll fix it. How's that going?

[02:38:47.740 --> 02:38:50.780]   But we had somewhere again worse and worse and worse
[02:38:50.780 --> 02:38:56.460]   Apple really kind of changed his tune and starts to become a service company services service doing well buy it
[02:38:56.460 --> 02:39:00.460]   Uh, it was the I think we'll look back and say it was the year of the streaming
[02:39:01.020 --> 02:39:08.060]   With Apple my god coming out the year of the subscription service frankly peacocks coming out next year that's the cloud game streaming
[02:39:08.060 --> 02:39:11.500]   Yes x cloud stadia. It's all about streaming
[02:39:11.500 --> 02:39:20.620]   Um, samsung galaxy fold came out. Oh, I remember that came out again fold fell like the groundhog. It's so
[02:39:20.620 --> 02:39:29.180]   Uh, they fixed it apparently although I wouldn't spend too grand on it. No, anyway, that's I guess we could say 2019 was the year of the folding phone
[02:39:29.180 --> 02:39:35.900]   The year of the folding flop and sir and microsoft and ask for next year these I think very interesting holiday 2020
[02:39:35.900 --> 02:39:41.340]   Yeah, not a folding phone more like a book with a hinge and two screens, but I think a really interesting green
[02:39:41.340 --> 02:39:47.180]   Yeah, it was also the year and let's not forget this when reddit took over area 51
[02:39:47.180 --> 02:39:51.020]   Oh my gosh. I discovered that there are no aliens unfortunately
[02:39:51.020 --> 02:39:58.220]   This is something my 13 year old daughter cared a lot about she was watching this she was very up on this news
[02:39:58.300 --> 02:40:02.940]   This was very important to her how interesting was she like begging you to go?
[02:40:02.940 --> 02:40:09.580]   No, but she was she thought we would find out the truth. She felt like it might be real the truth is out there
[02:40:09.580 --> 02:40:12.620]   So yeah, I did feel like I should show her the x-files
[02:40:12.620 --> 02:40:16.620]   Yeah, she might be ready. It's time. It's it's that time. Yeah
[02:40:16.620 --> 02:40:20.780]   Uh, I think the guy who created it said it was just a joke
[02:40:20.780 --> 02:40:24.220]   Yeah, uh, but a lot of people took it seriously until
[02:40:25.100 --> 02:40:29.180]   The air force which owns the base there said we have automatic weapons
[02:40:29.180 --> 02:40:33.660]   Yeah, and we still in the area too. We're like, um, we have stound your grand stound your grand
[02:40:33.660 --> 02:40:35.980]   That's the end
[02:40:35.980 --> 02:40:40.380]   Too much uh patch Tuesday and with a little enough stind your grand
[02:40:40.380 --> 02:40:43.020]   You will never get there
[02:40:43.020 --> 02:40:45.820]   Um
[02:40:45.820 --> 02:40:49.980]   I I love going through the years with you guys and I think it's really
[02:40:50.780 --> 02:40:56.300]   I think you learned something from looking at it through the opposite end of the telescope a little bit, right?
[02:40:56.300 --> 02:40:59.660]   We're every day covering this stuff. We're in the forest
[02:40:59.660 --> 02:41:03.180]   The trees are right up against us if you stand back a little bit
[02:41:03.180 --> 02:41:05.900]   You see some trends and we I
[02:41:05.900 --> 02:41:13.260]   Any trends that leap to mind from the last uh 10 years privacy privacy. Yes. This is really
[02:41:13.260 --> 02:41:17.180]   People cared we didn't mention it but gdpr went in effect in 2018
[02:41:17.740 --> 02:41:21.820]   So privacy but also I think this was the year big tech kind of lost
[02:41:21.820 --> 02:41:28.620]   It's a little bit of its luster. Yeah, the public wasn't as enamored by the things that big tech was doing and and pay
[02:41:28.620 --> 02:41:36.460]   Are starting to pay closer attention to those things. Oh, should I say allow allow allow allow allow it was also the end
[02:41:36.460 --> 02:41:39.180]   Of physical media
[02:41:39.180 --> 02:41:47.020]   We began the decade with CDs and newspapers and magazines and books and and and we ended with nothing but bits
[02:41:47.420 --> 02:41:53.980]   It's just it's just big cloud the cloud actually really writ large the cloud is cloud storage, right?
[02:41:53.980 --> 02:41:58.380]   Yeah, but that was a 2006 thing. So we can't talk about it this well
[02:41:58.380 --> 02:42:03.420]   The funny thing is for years people said well this we don't want the cloud. We don't want to go back to the cloud
[02:42:03.420 --> 02:42:07.740]   This is what we got away from with personal computers. We got it. We got our own computer
[02:42:07.740 --> 02:42:12.860]   I don't have to do time sharing. I don't want to I don't want to dumb terminal on my desk. So next year
[02:42:12.860 --> 02:42:14.940]   We're gonna start seeing it go back
[02:42:15.660 --> 02:42:20.780]   To the edge are we that's that's that's that's the stacey on iot side of this
[02:42:20.780 --> 02:42:23.340]   This is not me just marketing computing at the edge
[02:42:23.340 --> 02:42:27.020]   Yeah, I think this is the beginning of the computing at the local is cool again
[02:42:27.020 --> 02:42:34.540]   So little processors all over your house each of them spying on you simultaneously love you love to hear it
[02:42:34.540 --> 02:42:38.860]   And it loves to hear you it was certainly a good year for television
[02:42:38.860 --> 02:42:42.380]   It's so funny because at least half of the time on to in this decade
[02:42:43.020 --> 02:42:48.540]   People were saying apple tv apple tv there was one year at ces. I can't remember what it was 2012
[02:42:48.540 --> 02:42:51.580]   Where the the year after steve died
[02:42:51.580 --> 02:42:58.940]   Nobody at ces was talking about anything, but the apple television set it was like it's imminent. It's going to be here any day
[02:42:58.940 --> 02:43:01.580]   What's his name gine?
[02:43:01.580 --> 02:43:02.540]   Munster, thank you
[02:43:02.540 --> 02:43:08.140]   And it was because in that steve jobs a biography by walter isakson he says in his last days steve

[02:43:18.860 --> 02:43:22.940]   They still and probably never will have an apple television. No, so that was
[02:43:22.940 --> 02:43:27.660]   A dumb screen now you don't need it just bits we got every screen you want. Yeah, yeah
[02:43:27.660 --> 02:43:33.500]   screens all over the place and I think um the last thing I would say is a real
