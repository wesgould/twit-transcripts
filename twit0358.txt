[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   This week we're going to be very serious.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   We're going to be very somber.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   We're going to be full of useful information.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   We're going to be needy.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   And that's because we have a very meaty panel this week, starting with a very serious Ryan Brushwood.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Okay, so he's the outlier.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   I'm glad you labeled me as very serious, not very meaty, because I'm very sensitive about my weight.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I've been doing a lot of stress eating lately.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Ryan Brushwood, the magician, the host of NSFW on our TWIT network at scam school on revision 3.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   How's Discovery treating you?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   You know, I haven't seen any changes yet.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   I'm excited to actually, I know that I feel jealous hearing about all these Discovery events.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   They did some kind of like make the world better day at Rev 3.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I didn't get invited just because I'm 8 states away from you.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   I guess.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Yeah, it was in, I saw Veronica and everybody that were cleaning up beaches or something.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   It was very cool.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Yeah, they were rubbing hermit crabs and giving them massages.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   That's good.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   It's good.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   And you're a dad.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Yes, I am.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   So happy Father's Day.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   We don't have time's over.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   We got one cooking right now.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Hey, congratulations.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Yeah, I'm very excited.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I didn't know that.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   So Bonnie's expecting.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Yes, she is.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Bonnie is your wife, right?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   The invisible wife.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Okay.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   The alleged invisible wife who may or may not exist.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Also, here another dad, Mr. John C. Devorak of channeldevorak.com.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Good to see you.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Well fed today, we brought him a roast beef sandwich and you have a bottle of Pellegrino still.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Of course, yes.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Sealed in the mint in the bottle.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Somebody I think opened and spit in it.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.360]   Chad, I've been asking you not to do that one more time, Leo.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.160]   Also with us, Tim Stevens, who's the editor in chief of Engadget.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.560]   It's good to see you.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.560]   Welcome back, Tim.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.560]   Good to see you.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.560]   Thank you for having me.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.840]   We love having you on the show.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.320]   And finally, all the way to the right, perfectly positioned, Mr. Clayton Morris of Fox and
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.320]   Friends.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.320]   He's the top one.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.320]   All the way to the right.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.320]   That's a good one.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.320]   Well, yes, he's on the right hand side of the screen.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.320]   He's surprised.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.320]   Yes.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.320]   And I'm wearing my serious t-shirt to me.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.320]   I like that.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.320]   I like that.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.320]   Are you excited about Batman Rising?
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.560]   It opens in a couple of weeks.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.200]   Yeah, Dark Knight Rise is in an exclusive iOS app.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.400]   I think that's coming out very, very soon too.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.280]   Apparently there was already an exclusive one for Nokia for the Lumia.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.480]   You could get the Dark Knight Rise's some sort of game trailer thing that's only exclusive
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.280]   on the Nokia and supposed to be fantastic.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.360]   This is the hot new thing.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.840]   I just paid 99 cents.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.440]   I don't even know why I'm paying for a special version of what is that tomb running game,
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.440]   the running running running running temple run for that's got a Disney brave edition.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.040]   So you're the girl in Brave and instead of being chased by monkeys and chased by a bear
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.000]   and I paid a buck extra.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Oh my.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Wow.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.840]   A whole buck for an ad.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.320]   That's the first game that should have paid you a dollar.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.160]   This is a Pixar movie that's targeted to women.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.440]   So no wonder you decided to shell out the extra buck for that because I also am targeted
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.440]   to women.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.600]   It's not working.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.600]   Exactly.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.600]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.600]   I couldn't resist that joke.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.080]   Now see already we veered off from the serious deep content that I was going for on this
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.080]   week.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.640]   And I apologize.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.040]   Let's start with tomorrow because there's a big announcement tomorrow and everybody's
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.520]   wondering what's going on.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.160]   Microsoft sent out invites to all of you I'm sure.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.240]   By the way, Tim, you're a dad, right?
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.320]   I didn't get an invite.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.320]   I might add.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.560]   Tim, are you a dad?
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.120]   I did get an invite, but I'm not a dad.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.120]   No, I'm not a dad.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.880]   Sorry, but everybody else is a father.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.120]   Happy Father's Day.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.120]   That'll be a dad soon enough.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.440]   So you got an invite to the Microsoft event.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.360]   Tell me what the invite said.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.360]   Did you not get one?
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.360]   No, I didn't get one.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.320]   It said basically nothing, which is very, very strange.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.280]   You didn't even have a location on it, which is very, the event takes place tomorrow in
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.960]   Los Angeles and they wouldn't even tell you where they gave you time.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.240]   They said at 10 a.m. tomorrow.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.840]   Show up until you find it.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.840]   It's going to be.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.840]   How are they going to tell you?
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.480]   Are they going to text you?
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.600]   Is this a scavenger hunt?
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.600]   We don't know.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.560]   We were trying to get more information to find out if this was going to be the kind of thing
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.200]   we'd want to live blog.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.280]   We're totally in the dark here about the venue or the size of this event.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.280]   Who's going to be there?
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.760]   Are they going to bring Usher out again?
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.120]   We can only hope.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.520]   We really don't know anything at all about it, but we're going to be there tomorrow.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.160]   We're going to be live blog and we're excited to find out exactly what they have to show
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.120]   for the major announcement that you did decide the live blog.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.120]   That's it.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.440]   Paul Theron, our Windows Weekly Guy, said his invitation.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.640]   I don't know if it was printed on the invitation or they said it afterwards in the email or
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.640]   something.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.040]   He said, "You're not going to want to miss this."
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.040]   You don't want to miss it.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.040]   You don't want to miss it.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.040]   You want to miss it.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.040]   You want to miss it.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.400]   It was only like a few days notice, right Tim?
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.400]   I think we got the invitations.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.400]   It's like on Thursday or something like that.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.400]   It's really difficult.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.920]   It's not a lot of time to be booking your flights out to LA.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.360]   The crazy thing is they have another event in San Francisco that starts the very next
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.360]   day.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.760]   Why they couldn't just push their event up one day and have them both in the same city.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.760]   I have no idea.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:18.120]   They had E3 just two weeks ago in Los Angeles, a big entertainment event.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.120]   But Tim, it's interesting.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.520]   You guys had a gadget thought, "We don't know what this is, but we think it's significant
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.520]   enough.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.520]   We're going to live blog it."
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.520]   Yes.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.760]   Everything that we're hearing is going to be something big.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.640]   The reports we've been hearing over the past few days from TechCrunch and also from All
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.760]   Things Deere's, that is something to do with a tablet announcement perhaps to do with Barnes
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.760]   and Noble.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.880]   Perhaps this will be the first time we really see some proper Xbox Live integration on a
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.120]   tablet.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.360]   This is kind of early 24 hours from now.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.960]   We don't have anything solid yet, but the quote unquote inside sources are indicating
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.800]   that this will be tablet related and something to do with Xbox Live and Barnes and Noble.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.920]   Are you going to fly out, Clayton?
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.560]   You were just out here, weren't you, Clayton?
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.560]   Yeah, I mean, exactly.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.760]   I mean, if it's Xbox Live, to your point, LA, about E3.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.120]   I mean, why?
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.520]   You had everyone there.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.520]   You had everyone there a week ago for E3.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:14.440]   If it's Xbox related and we saw this broader integration on Xbox is really almost like a
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.520]   cable box killer, so to speak, this past week.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:23.320]   So if you're going to do some sort of broader entertainment, you know, infusion in the Xbox,
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.520]   you would have done it during E3.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.440]   You know, there's speculation and I'm curious.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.080]   There's been rumors all over the map, right?
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.240]   The Barnes and Noble rumor, I think, is the latest one right now.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.800]   Yeah, some people said it would be more of a consumption device like a fire.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.720]   Amazon's version of the fire.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.160]   Others are saying, I see E-Week is saying it's a Windows 8 tablet, which is not a fire.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:46.320]   I mean, it's just it is literally you couldn't have a broader range of speculation on this.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.960]   I think they're all missing the possibility that it's the Zoom 2.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.480]   I think we know the Zoom is dead.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.480]   There's no way it's a Zoom.
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:58.320]   I guess it's breaking news on this actually, just in that Microsoft tomorrow is going to
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.480]   announce 3D maps.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:06.240]   Yes, that would only be fitting since Google and Apple have in successive weeks done that
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.400]   week three, I think 3D for Bing.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.720]   No, actually Bing has had 3D, haven't they?
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.720]   Bing 3D.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.240]   Bing has a pretty good 3D.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.240]   So big draw.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.480]   Well, okay, so tell me this guys.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.520]   If let's say that the Xbox part of this announcement is just a small, let's say it's a bigger announcement
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:29.440]   about an ecosystem in which the Xbox plays a smaller role, then it would make sense for
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.640]   them not to include that in the E3 announcement because nobody's going to be there to find
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.320]   out that the Xbox is now going to be a piece of this bigger event or bigger overshadowing
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:43.560]   thing that's going to ruin their games related press event.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:48.040]   Right, but we already saw right the Xbox these days is as much of media consumption
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.560]   device as it is a gaming device.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.920]   So this could be a very media focused event and Xbox is kind of their broad terminology
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.520]   for media services of all sorts.
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.080]   So perhaps it's just another way to access the same content that you currently buy through
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.080]   your Xbox and now you get it on a tablet.
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:08.280]   So it's a smart glass second screen tablet.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.880]   Well, Microsoft is this going to be a Microsoft reference design as in the past a reference
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.640]   design that they'll have Toshiba and others make or is this going to be manufactured by
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.600]   Microsoft Tim?
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.480]   That is the big question that we are eagerly waiting to find out.
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:27.360]   I honestly, you know, having them develop their own tablet, manufacture their own tablet,
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.040]   I don't know if they're ready to jump right in there, but although they did just interestingly
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.560]   say to HTC, you know, we don't really want you to make any tablets for us.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.240]   So that's interesting.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.240]   Interesting.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.160]   I honestly don't know.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.560]   Maybe this will be the unveiling of the Nokia tablet we've been waiting for so long for.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.760]   That would be a very bad idea.
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.840]   They need a push, right?
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.080]   This whole thing is a bad idea.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.080]   But you know, look, I think, you know, Tim brings up a great point and it's also furthers
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.640]   the argument as to whether or not this is going to be a problem for Microsoft if they
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.080]   do roll out their own hardware.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.400]   We saw this with Google, right, embracing their own hardware for Android and you have
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.400]   all of these OEMs.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.400]   Wait a second.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.400]   Wait a second.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.400]   You know, are we going to get preference now?
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.400]   We're not going to get preference in the store.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.520]   We're not going to be on the front page of Google.com like this particular piece of hardware.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:19.040]   And also, I think, raises a specter of, you hear some other companies talking about the
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.320]   possibility and showing some renewed interest in WebOS.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.880]   Does this open the door for the WebOS?
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.880]   WebOS.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.880]   I thought WebOS was dead.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.080]   This is the Palm than HP operating system.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.960]   All the engineers left for Google.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.040]   Right.
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.160]   But if they're going to be showing preference for hardware, does this open the door for
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:47.800]   other hardware manufacturers to say, you know what, there is a very capable, very interesting,
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:52.520]   and very capable piece of software that's out there that we can get our hands on.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.320]   I've been hearing some interesting things about that.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.320]   It is open source.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.680]   I want to argue against this concept.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.120]   I think Microsoft is going to bring out a branded product.
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.280]   They do have a branded product.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.480]   It's called the Xbox.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.280]   Nobody's going to license this thing.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.480]   They're not going to be stepping on channels.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.720]   And they need something to sell in these stores, which they're rolling out like crazy.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.320]   And they need something with their own brand on it.
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.200]   They're really following Apple's model.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.960]   I would be stunned if what they don't bring out is going to be branded Microsoft.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.600]   And I think when they do buy Nokia, which they will, they will brand themselves as they
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.960]   will be a Microsoft phone and they won't be licensing the Windows, or the Windows phone
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.120]   and seven to anybody.
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.920]   I really think they're turning back in on themselves.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.000]   It's the only thing that's going to make them any money.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.960]   In other words, it's Apple Envy.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.200]   Yeah, it's always Apple Envy.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.160]   Are you saying that there's no merit to any of the suggestions that Xbox is going to have
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.680]   anything to do with the announcement?
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.680]   Because if you...
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.680]   No, no, I'm not saying that.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.680]   I think it's going to be an Xbox device.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.680]   I think it's going to be an Xbox device.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.680]   It's going to be in there.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:53.120]   You've got an Xbox set top box and you're going to have an Xbox handheld set to remember
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.720]   they're not licensing the Xbox.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:59.720]   I think Microsoft's given up on the idea that anybody wants their stuff.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.720]   So Tim, I'm so sorry.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.720]   I'm curious because...
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.720]   Xbox is...
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.720]   Xbox is...
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.720]   First-brainer.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.720]   ...in a cold mind with the Xbox.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:11.320]   With the level of permeation they have or penetration into American homes, this device
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:15.840]   is so overpowered for all the things that people want to use.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.920]   People are going out and they're using their Google TVs.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.040]   It's ridiculous that the Xbox is not filling all these niches on their own.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.580]   And if Microsoft is smart, what they'll do is come out with a surprise announcement
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:30.720]   about this entire ecosystem where you don't need to get a sling box because the Xbox will
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.720]   handle it.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.880]   You don't have to get an app TV because Xbox is already doing it.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:38.920]   You can stream anything to your tablet anywhere you are but through the Xbox.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.520]   They need to think of the Xbox as more than a gaming device and I'm hoping that they'll
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.400]   step up and make that happen.
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.400]   Clayton?
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:51.000]   Yeah, I mean, I'm just curious why they would bring everyone back a week later for virtually...
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.600]   Yeah, maybe not virtually, but close to the same sort of announcement that we saw on stage
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.600]   from that week or so ago.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.600]   I can tell you why.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.520]   Because I think that they probably felt there was too much noise at E3, that you've got Sony,
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.120]   you've got Nintendo, it's focused on gaming.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:07.760]   They did the preliminary announcement which is smart glass, second screens are going to
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:08.760]   be big.
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.960]   This is the second shoe dropping and I think they probably wanted to have it all to themselves.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.920]   I think John's right with the Apple Envy.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.360]   They want secrecy.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.360]   They're trying to do an Apple event.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.960]   That's what they're trying to do.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.000]   When you do it by yourself, you don't do it with a lot of noise around you, you don't
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.240]   do it as one of a bunch of other press conferences.
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.400]   I think Apple would at least put where the venue is.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.600]   I think it was such...
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.440]   Maybe such short notice that they couldn't get a venue and I don't understand...
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.960]   We'll be at the Hilton at the airport.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.920]   We don't know where we're going to be, but as soon as we...
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.480]   It's going to be a big geocaching game.
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.800]   They're going to hand us all Garmin geocaching devices and we're going to have to navigate
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.280]   our way around the city to find out where this thing is.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:54.840]   Isn't it amazing, Tim, to see all these different sites with such widely varying points of view?
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:15:01.000]   The wrap and all things digital say it's going to be a Windows 8, Windows RT tablet.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.440]   TechCrunch says they're mostly wrong.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:08.400]   It's going to be a Barnes and Noble Nook kind of a thing.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.560]   Then you have Eworld saying something else.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:15.760]   You've got the Guardian saying Microsoft's going to launch a tablet to compete with the
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.400]   iPad.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.960]   Here's one that's an interesting idea.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.920]   Somebody just kind of suggested it.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.800]   The Nokia Theater is where the event will be and it will incorporate a Nokia announcement.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.720]   It's a big theater that do a lot of events at.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.720]   Maybe?
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.560]   That's where the Nintendo press conference was.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.440]   Any theater where it typically is.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.920]   It's entirely possible that they are all right in some way.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:41.200]   It could be a Windows RT device but running some very customized interface just like the
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.200]   Kindle Fire is running Android but you'd really never know it.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:50.680]   It certainly could be a Barnes and Noble branded device running Windows RT or behind
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:55.440]   some very thick layer that makes it very media friendly just like the Kindle Fire or the Barnes
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.440]   and Noble Nook.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.880]   It's hard to know exactly who's right.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:03.120]   It's interesting to see all this conflicting information.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.920]   Once Microsoft has a really good secret and we're looking forward to seeing what it is.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:13.280]   I think some of the confusion about this reflects the confusion about Microsoft in general,
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.480]   the confusion within and without Microsoft in general.
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:19.080]   We don't know what the hell they're doing because we're doing it.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.080]   We're doing it.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:24.640]   I know why they're being so secretive and especially like 24 hours to the event they still don't
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.320]   even say where it's going to be.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.920]   It's because that's the only possible way Microsoft could get their story to be the lead
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.240]   instead of WWDC on this program.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.240]   Yes, they did it.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.540]   They succeeded.
[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.960]   It was the lead story because I love that spec.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.440]   You're always you buy on the rumor you sell on the news, right?
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.400]   So we're buying on the rumor.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.880]   What's the incentive for it to be a Barnes and Noble divine?
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:47.880]   I don't think that's it.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:48.880]   I don't think that's it.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.720]   I'm just curious.
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.720]   Why would they go that route?
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:52.720]   I think John's right.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.800]   The Xbox is the brand.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.080]   If you're going to do something, you're going to Microsoft brand it.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.160]   It's going to be the Xbox.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.200]   That's the brand they own and control.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.080]   They've already made some big strides forward with the Xbox.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.800]   You do it in LA because it's an entertainment capital.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:12.600]   Maybe you have on stage with you Sony, Universal, you have all the big players.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.880]   You have the movie companies.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.520]   You have the music companies.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.520]   You have the networks.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:21.720]   You have them on stage with you saying we are going to make a compelling home entertainment
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:26.120]   device that all starts with a Microsoft tablet and the Xbox 360.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.400]   Does that sound Netflix people on the stage?
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.400]   Netflix.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.400]   You have Netflix on stage.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.400]   They already support Netflix.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.760]   They're the only they support HBO go.
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.000]   They're the only gaming box of sports.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Hulu.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   They already support Hulu.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.680]   They're very close to having this unified thing put together.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.040]   Tim, does that sound credible?
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.720]   It sounds very credible.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.160]   Really the one missing piece that they don't have in the Xbox is books.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.560]   Maybe that's where Barnes and Noble comes in.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:54.000]   They can bring their magazines and their selection of textbooks and everything else to the table.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.560]   That's the missing piece perhaps of this tablet device, the reading piece that they don't
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:58.560]   have.
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.400]   Interestingly, if indeed it is at the Nokia theater, that's right next to ESPN and Microsoft, of
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.320]   course, at a big ESPN announcement at E3.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:08.440]   Maybe that'll be part of this too, having your all three ESPN channels free being right
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.440]   to your tablet.
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.080]   Clayton, sound like, are you coming?
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.080]   Are you coming back?
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.080]   No, I would have.
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:19.560]   I would have, but with more than four days notice and it not being Father's Day.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:25.480]   I'm going to fly out tonight after Father's Day get together.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.480]   It just doesn't really jive.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.080]   Why don't you have to pick up in the private jet?
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.080]   I got to say Microsoft is not notorious for secrecy.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.520]   In fact, they're the worst.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.360]   How come they've been able to keep this a secret?
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.360]   Because nobody cares anymore.
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.320]   They've seen it work time after time at Apple.
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.320]   Why wouldn't they?
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:43.800]   If somebody's running a money machine sooner or later you figure out like, hey, how's that
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:44.800]   money machine work?
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.800]   Right.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:46.800]   I just mentioned it.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:47.800]   They've tried to keep it's secrets before.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:48.800]   It's kind of brilliant.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.800]   There's never been any good at it.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.800]   Well, notice the Xbox.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.040]   It's kind of brilliant though to do it after E3, right?
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.040]   Because we're like, wait a second.
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.160]   We just got all these, all of these announcements out of E3.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.080]   We've got all these other announcements from Microsoft.
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.280]   So what in the world are they going to squeeze in between these other big announcements?
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.280]   That's the brilliance of it.
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:09.680]   The X says it's going to be the Nook Zumbucks pad.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:10.680]   I like this idea.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.920]   I think Lotus notes on the Xbox.
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.400]   In some ways, what we're saying is that these are all these rumors are true, that it is
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.920]   a Nook, but it's also an Xbox.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.440]   It's going to be all of the above.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.360]   I think that's an interesting compelling argument.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:27.280]   I don't think it's Windows 8 because Windows 8 is far from launch.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.640]   We're not talking till October for Windows 8 to come out.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.360]   Why do you have an event in June to announce an October product?
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.440]   I don't think it is Windows 8.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.960]   Office on iPad?
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:41.720]   I think that's, in fact, pretty sure we know that that's going to be around October as
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.720]   well.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:49.000]   They want to do office, I think, somewhat after Windows 8, so it might even be November.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Right.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.520]   No, I don't think this is a...
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:59.960]   Then we saw this leak, that's actually an old leak, of the Xbox 720, the next generation.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.560]   We do know that'll be out next year.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:02.560]   Photoshop.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:03.920]   Man, this is a memo.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:04.920]   No, this is a memo.
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:08.040]   Yeah, it's in fact got taken down by a law firm.
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.840]   And it has an Xbox 720.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:11.840]   That's pretty good.
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.400]   It's a terrible name, it's a terrible name, and I hope they don't go through it.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:21.880]   Xbox 360 conveys a wide-angle view where you see everything coming in all around you.
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.400]   Xbox 720 implies you're spinning around in circles.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.400]   Sounds like a shit.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.400]   I'm spinning around.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.600]   Oh my God, it comes again.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:34.680]   You're going to have the connect to which will have devices like Nintendo We Mode, I guess.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:40.160]   You can put a little plastic bat in your hand, and then, oh, well, Google has glasses,
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.760]   so we will too.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.040]   Connects glasses, project for Talese.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.640]   I'm sticking with 3D maps.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.680]   I think you might be right.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.680]   I think you might be right.
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:54.680]   I'll tell you what, regardless of whether these are good ideas or bad ideas, I love that
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:58.480]   these are real documents and that people are projecting what will home entertainment
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.480]   look like 10 years into the future.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.480]   Xbox 666.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.720]   Even if these are terrible ideas, the idea that, like, no, yeah, it'll be augmented reality
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:10.640]   and you'll have holographic avatars walking around in virtual real space as you go to
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.640]   the mall.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.760]   A Microsoft's notorious for that.
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:14.760]   There the, aren't they, John?
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:19.520]   They're the company that always has the video about what you'll be doing in 20, you know,
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:27.600]   Mr. Sally will be doing her report.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:27.680]   Remember, you know, to the internet, to the cloud, I mean, this is what Microsoft does.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.600]   They love these, these speculative phony videos.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.200]   That's because they're all about this.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.760]   They spent too much time at home.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.880]   But I wonder if these do the Xbox 2600.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:37.880]   I got it.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.520]   John, you brought up a great point.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.240]   And then it's, it's, I'm always curious about Microsoft in this way, which is I always
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.440]   feel like one arm doesn't know what the other arm's doing.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:50.920]   You've got like multiple PR companies for Microsoft that always don't necessarily talk,
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:51.920]   don't know if they do.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.920]   They have a bunch of them now.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.120]   You've got, you know, you've got like the folks at Bing, I'm sure you've experienced
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.120]   this, right?
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.120]   Where they've got Bing on their business card.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.080]   There's no mention as far as I remember.
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.240]   It's actually worse than that claim.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.920]   It's not that they don't know what they're doing.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.880]   They know exactly what the other hand is doing and they hate it and they're going to
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.880]   kill it.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.120]   These, they're warring within Microsoft.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.280]   You've got all these divisions saying over my dead body.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.200]   That's somebody pointed out to me that's kind of an interesting observation, which is
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.960]   that Microsoft in a lot of these high tech companies, they're not really a one single
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:27.320]   firm like in the olden days where you'd have this, you'd buy, you'd make a Christ building
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:28.720]   and everybody be in the same building.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.680]   Now it's a campus and with like colleges.
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.520]   Well, and Google doesn't have purpose because they're trying to keep this entrepreneurial
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:35.520]   spirit.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.320]   So you get the feeling that you do more sense.
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.680]   But with Microsoft, there was no unity because you're not even in the same building with
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.680]   these people.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.440]   You have to take a bus to the other area of the campus.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.280]   If you want to look into Microsoft's future, look at Sony because Sony is just 20 years
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.040]   ahead of schedule of exactly what Microsoft is doing right now.
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:56.120]   You essentially balkanize all these individual elements and you essentially put them at war
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.120]   with each other.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:01.400]   Sony in the late 90s was putting out hardware devices that directly violated the copyright
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.160]   of their software division.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.920]   It's the, or their music licensing division.
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.840]   I think you're going to start to see more and more of that with Microsoft unless we see
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:14.880]   some fundamental shift in the corporate culture, which I don't smell coming anytime soon.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.880]   You saw the techno buffer.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.080]   This is kind of old, but I love it.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:22.040]   And somebody in the chat room was mentioning the techno Buffalo org chart Amazon, very
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:27.560]   nice hierarchical Google all over the place, Facebook, it's a network, Microsoft, it's a
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.960]   bunch of divisions pointing guns at each other.
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.960]   That's pretty much it.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.840]   That's pretty much it.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:36.840]   I encourage it.
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:43.280]   It's sort of like what we heard that really interesting story about what was happening
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.280]   at RIM.
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.560]   Oh, God, that's.
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.640]   But that happens, right?
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:51.200]   When a company's falling apart, everybody starts blaming the other guy.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:57.640]   And that's why I think tomorrow could be maybe a very important day for Apple, for Microsoft,
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:02.400]   because if they can pull all these disparate things together into a device that's a compelling
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:06.880]   device for the home, this might be a chance for Microsoft to save itself.
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.800]   Maybe be the Microsoft TV.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.800]   Wouldn't that be funny?
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.120]   Finally, they get to jump to it, Steve.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.040]   I got a great panel.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:19.200]   Clayton Morris from Fox and Friends, Tim Stevens, the editor in chief at Engadget.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.840]   We've got Brian Brushwood of scam school.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.320]   His new book, Scamschool 2 is hitting the bookstores.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.680]   When does it hit the bookstores?
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.680]   Tuesday at noon is when the whole world needs to buy it.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:32.720]   If we all buy it exactly at noon, then for one hilarious, awesome moment will be number
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.000]   one in the world.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.640]   And your recommendation, because it's the most vivid, the most beautiful, the audio,
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.880]   the video, the animation would be to get it on the iPad from the iBook store.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.880]   Yeah.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.680]   Well, and I'm going to say that publicly, but between you and me, it's because I suspect
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.640]   that iTunes is the one we can most likely hit number one on.
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.480]   Because it's the dinkiest.
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.480]   So buy it.
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.480]   But it just does look good.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.120]   And I have to say your first one was huge success, right?
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.920]   Dude, I'm telling you, this one is 33% larger.
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.360]   It's got 65 video illustrations.
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.560]   It's got over 70 commentary tracks.
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:09.640]   It includes more tricks that haven't even shown up on on scam school yet.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:13.600]   We teach you how to take coffee creamer and turn it into a column of flame three feet
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.600]   tall.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.600]   It's completely rad.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.600]   That's exciting to know.
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.840]   I'm putting that in my coffee.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:18.840]   Yeah.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.080]   I knew it wasn't milk.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.080]   All right.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.080]   It's good.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.440]   Obviously you're doing very well with the books.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.440]   Congratulations.
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:25.440]   He's buying.
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.440]   He's buying.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.120]   See the more I also hear from channel to work.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:33.080]   I show brought to you today by our friends at Citrix, which has updated go to assist.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.840]   You probably heard about go to assist for 10 years now.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.320]   Pioneers in remote support.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:41.520]   They are the market leader, according to IDC in remote support.
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.280]   It's not even close.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.280]   Why?
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.080]   Because it's always been the best remote support product.
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.480]   Fast, easy to use.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.960]   Eight sessions at once.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.960]   Unattended support.
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:56.040]   But now they've added a new module to go to assist that gives you monitoring too.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:01.280]   Now this has become the IT person's dream come true.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.840]   Remote support so you can fix the problems fast.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:08.200]   Remote monitoring so you know about the problems when they're still little before they become
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.200]   big.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:14.360]   You start by a quick assay of all of the devices on your network, the go to assist crawler.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.720]   And by the way, if you have many clients, you just do this on each network.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:18.720]   It finds everything.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.560]   Hardware network attached devices, software.
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:27.200]   You can then set up a dashboard, custom dashboard showing performance, key metrics, even things
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.720]   like I got the toner cartridge running out dashboard.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.280]   I got a hard drive running out of space dashboard.
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.280]   Get alerts.
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:37.640]   I am SMS email.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.680]   And then you fire up the remote support and you fix it.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.680]   Just awesome.
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:45.560]   This is something that if you're in the IT business and the support business, this is
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.520]   the the tool for you.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:53.760]   You can get it for 30 days absolutely free and decide for yourself by visiting go to assist.com

[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:04.840]   And there's a link that expands out promo code TWIT.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:05.840]   You got to try this.

[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.200]   We thank the good folks at Citrix for making this possible.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.680]   Well Tim, we'll watch with interest.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:16.080]   We're going to do a live coverage of the event as well.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.080]   You know, it's easy for us.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.000]   We don't actually go anywhere.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.320]   We just sit here and we watch and gadget and repeat what you guys say.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.840]   It's going to be easy for me too, actually, because I'm sending a couple of other people
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:27.840]   to do it.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.840]   Yeah, let them do it.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:29.840]   I get to watch your home too.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.800]   Do you find it adorable?
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:36.000]   Those brief moments of complete communication inefficiency were for brief moments.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.720]   It's like you're reporting on the horse races from a teletype over.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.840]   He's going around second.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:42.840]   He's coming into third.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:43.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.360]   The telegraph died.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.360]   He's going around.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.360]   It is like that.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.000]   It's kind of, now I don't know.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.720]   Microsoft, it's Apple, never streams.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.160]   These things are rarely.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.520]   Microsoft has a history of streaming these events.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.520]   Maybe they will stream.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.160]   Did they give us any indication?
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.000]   Is the invitation saying anything like that?
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.560]   No, nothing at all.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.360]   They just stream all of their E3 stuff.
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.680]   So if indeed it is a Xbox related thing, maybe they would.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.520]   But I think they would have been making a big deal with that by now if they were planning
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.520]   on it.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.920]   So I wouldn't necessarily bank on them streaming this tomorrow.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:13.920]   I'm going to come in.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.920]   TNT will be here.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.160]   Tom Merritt and I, as is Sarah.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.160]   So we will be covering this.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.640]   We'll get Paul Theron on the horn and Mary Jofoli as well.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:25.400]   So I think this is, you know, Microsoft's acting as if this is a big deal.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:29.920]   They're going to get a lot of people very upset if they're announcing a new mouse or
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:33.200]   here's the Windows 8 tablets you'll be able to get in October.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.560]   I think it's something much more significant than that.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.040]   And the fact that they're doing it in LA makes me really think that.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.040]   No, I think you're right.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.040]   They've folded it all together.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:43.800]   Well, I think LA Entertainment Capital, I think, is the exact reason they're there.
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:44.800]   It's got some entertainment angle.
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.480]   So we're going to go on the record.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:50.320]   You're saying you're projecting that they're going to announce a full on ecosystem instead
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.320]   of just a gizmo.
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.600]   It's the only thing that makes sense if you're Microsoft.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:57.680]   They need to show that, you know, this is what's worked for Apple, right?
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.560]   It's end to end.
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.200]   So they sell it.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.200]   You play it back on it.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.200]   You download everything.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.200]   It's all Apple.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.960]   It's an Apple universe and you never have to leave it.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.320]   Microsoft can do a, frankly, a more credible story.
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.200]   They've already got HBO, Go, Hulu, ESPN.
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.440]   They could do a more credible story, I think.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:18.000]   Well, and to be honest, there's a number of these entertainment icons that are ticked
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.400]   off with Apple's one size fits all strategy.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:25.800]   Well, like now shout charge $2.99 for HD episodes of all your shows.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.040]   And Apple's too big right now.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:30.080]   And Apple's selling is the number one retailer of music in the world.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:34.520]   So the record industry would love to see some competition from Microsoft, let's say.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.520]   Sure.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:36.520]   No, they could.
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.560]   They could gather together in a version of the Super Friends like the--
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:40.560]   Right.
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.560]   It's the Avengers.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:42.560]   There you go.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.560]   Actually, Sarah Lane will not be here.
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:45.560]   She's in London.
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:46.560]   You're right.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:47.920]   Thank you.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:48.920]   She might be here.
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.400]   Who knows?
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.840]   So, okay, so you're right.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:59.160]   This was all a ploy to get us to forget WWDC, which was just Monday.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:05.000]   Apple announced more information about iOS 6, more information about Mountain Lion.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.040]   They say Mountain Lion will be out next month, which is kind of a surprise earlier than
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.040]   the--
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.200]   Because you were covering it live.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.200]   We did cover it live.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.320]   I thought it was boring.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:19.760]   You know, it was going to be boring until they announced this MacBook Pro with Retina.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.240]   And that was kind of--
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.520]   It's like an upgrade to me.
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:23.840]   Well, I don't know.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.960]   Now, Tim, you probably already-- you got one.
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:26.960]   See, there he is.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:27.960]   Tim's team has got one.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:31.080]   So you're going to be the go-to guy on this.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.080]   What do you think?
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.560]   It's very nice.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.560]   It's a MacBook Air Killer.
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:36.560]   I bought one.
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:37.560]   Mine comes tomorrow.
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:38.560]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:39.720]   But you see, I don't think it's an Air Killer.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:42.320]   I work with that 13-inch MacBook Air now.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.680]   And when I was seeing there, I was actually live blogging on my 13-inch Air.
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.720]   And as I was typing, I actually was planning, OK, which configuration do I want to buy?
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.720]   It's replaced my 13-inch Air.
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.280]   But after I did the review of this unit, you know, I'm not so sure.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:59.000]   It is a pound and a half heavier than the Air, which if you travel as much as I do, it definitely
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   adds up.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   It's four and a half pounds.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   A lot of people said it's too heavy.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   It's too heavy.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   Well, it doesn't look heavy.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.520]   It's amateur travelers.
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.080]   I'm on the road 200 days out of the year.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.080]   I lug around.
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.080]   I see the size of this thing.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.080]   He's a maniac.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.080]   I bring a brick with me.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.800]   It's just another baron power.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:19.720]   So but I agree about the lightness you need it when you travel.
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.720]   No matter what brush wood says.
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.520]   Yeah, but John, you said it's an Air Killer really, isn't?
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.520]   Because if you have--
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:26.520]   I haven't seen it.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.160]   Well, let me just say I haven't seen it.
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:32.360]   I've only seen pictures that looks like kind of like a beefed up air.
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:33.760]   It just doesn't look that heavy.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.640]   It doesn't look like it goes away as much as it does.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:39.000]   Well, that's why it probably feels heavy because it's so thin that the denser you
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.200]   make these things, the more heavy they seem, right?
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.200]   They appear to be.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.480]   I'm talking to you right now over Skype.
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:47.320]   I'm using the Retina MacBook Pro right now.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.600]   And so this webcam is the HD webcam.
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.600]   It looks good.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.480]   Your finger is going to hit us.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:53.480]   It's 720p.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:55.480]   But it is heavier.
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.880]   Certainly, it's like what?
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.120]   4 1/2 pounds I think compared to the air.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:05.400]   And once you-- I think once you play with the 11 inch air or 13 inch air, it's-- unless
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:10.840]   you really need that beefed up speed and you really want that Retina display, I don't
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.080]   see myself forking over the money for this.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.360]   I mean, this is a review unit obviously right now.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.920]   But I think we're in this transitional space right now for Apple.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:23.000]   Apple just feels like they're in between spaces right now, right?
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.120]   Because of the cost of SSD.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:28.960]   So the configurations on the SSD drives on this, if you're jumping up to what is it?
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:29.960]   700.
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:35.520]   An extra 500 bucks, I think, on for these drives.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.440]   And then of course, you don't have the rest of the line yet with Retina displays.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:42.360]   So I think your-- I think next year, we won't be having this discussion.
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.880]   I think you'll have the Retina display airs and you wouldn't even consider picking up
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.080]   the 15 inch MacBook Pro with this, you know.
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.640]   So the air is the MacBook Pro killer when it goes Retina?
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:54.280]   Yeah, very well could be.
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:58.160]   This is fascinating to me that everybody wants to compare the new MacBook Pro to the
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:02.360]   MacBook Air and nobody wants to compare it to the previous MacBook Pro.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:06.440]   Like that is some of the branding genius from Apple because by all rights, we should
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.120]   only be comparing it to the previous iteration on the MacBook Pro.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:12.560]   But instead, you got to realize like their current structure, unless I'm misinterpreting
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:18.880]   it, the MacBook Air is the entry level PC now as far as it's the cheapest and the lightest
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.360]   and the lowest powered.
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.320]   And that's what we're all comparing this to.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.920]   This is phenomenal.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:28.480]   It does slot in between the two in terms of physical size, in terms of performance, it's
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:32.800]   basically on par with the updated 15-inch MacBook Pro.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:33.800]   That's the problem.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.800]   They don't have really a name for either of these two pros.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.760]   There's the MacBook Pro with 15-inch.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:41.440]   And this is the MacBook Pro with Retina display, which is the formal name for us.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:45.320]   It was even difficult to compare the two because it's hard to talk about the two without stepping
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.040]   on yourself.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:51.120]   But in terms of performance, it is actually faster than the Pro in terms of disk I/O because
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:54.880]   we've got these new SSDs, which are about twice as fast as the ones that they had.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:58.480]   And it's a quad core I7.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.480]   The performance is outrageous.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:03.560]   The benchmarks we've run on this are some of the fastest we've ever seen at the laptop.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:07.040]   Of course, the display is usually high res and you can get up to 16 gigs of RAM, which
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.040]   is outrageous.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.400]   But of course, the price is outrageous too.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.840]   You can price this thing up to four grand and above if you want to.
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:14.680]   And that's a lot of money for a slow laptop.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:16.680]   You've got to make sure someone raised the two negatives.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:20.840]   You've got to make sure you buy AppleCare because there are no user serviceable parts
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:21.840]   in this thing.
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:30.080]   In fact, Kyle Wiens of IFixit, writing at wired.com says the new MacBook Pro, unfixable, unhackable,
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.800]   untenable.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.680]   Everything is glued together in this.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:38.440]   The battery, Apple's claiming 1000 charges, but afterwards you have to pay 200 bucks to
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.760]   Apple to replace the battery.
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.200]   You cannot do it yourself.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:47.800]   They have eliminated some of the thickness by, for instance, gluing the screen into the
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:48.800]   lid.
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.040]   So it's not replaceable.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:54.800]   You know, when I bought it, I bought AppleCare because it's not fixable.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.200]   Is this a so this is an interesting trend.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.520]   This is like the iPad, like the iPhone.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:03.120]   It's a consumer device with built in obsolescence.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.840]   I think that's a bad idea.
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:10.080]   Certainly from a upgrade point of view, you can upgrade the rest of the future.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:14.160]   So my question for you all, is this, is this the future and we're just going to live with
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.160]   it?
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.160]   Or is this a bad thing?
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.960]   Am I an old fashioned guy for wanting upgradability?
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.000]   I've been Apple curious for a very long time.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.920]   I'm a hardcore PC to the bone, but I got an iPhone, I got an iPad and I perceive those
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:30.200]   as consumer devices where they're supposed to do one thing and do it exquisitely well.
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.800]   And then, and that's it.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:36.880]   But knowing how much RAM costs I get angry when I see the pricing structure that Apple
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:41.960]   puts out there and seeing that they're locking everything down even more as a consumer, I
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.720]   absolutely hate this decision.
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.800]   I think it's the worst idea they could possibly do as a pundit.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.200]   I firmly believe this is the smartest thing they could do and they're going to make a
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:54.560]   freaking mint because they're going to commoditize the laptop market.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.200]   And I hate them for it.
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:59.760]   Tim, is this a bad idea?
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:00.880]   You can definitely look at it both ways.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.160]   I think this is ultimately giving the consumers what they want, which is thinner and lighter
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.160]   laptops.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:08.120]   And the only way for them to do that is to start using these custom components, which
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.320]   is exactly what they're doing.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:13.480]   The reason you can't replace the SSDs easily is because they're custom SSDs.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:17.240]   If they went with a standard two and a half inch hard drive design, that would mean they'd
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:18.880]   need to make more room in a case for them.
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.440]   They wouldn't have as much room for battery life.
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:23.440]   If they wanted to have the battery life the same, they'd have to make a bigger case.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:27.560]   So this is what they're having to do to deliver these amazing designs.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.040]   And same thing with the screen.
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.040]   The reason the screen is glued in is because they wanted to reduce the number of layers
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.040]   of glass in there.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.880]   They wanted to thin the whole thing out.
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.480]   Because of the reduced layers in there, there's actually a lot less glare than there
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:38.480]   used to be.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:42.160]   So there is a benefit to you, but if you're the kind of person who wants to be able to replace
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.520]   a panel, that's a bad thing.
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:46.120]   I hope that there will always be two schools or thoughts.
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:50.560]   Laptops that people can upgrade and repair and laptops that are basically disposable.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.960]   And certainly, Apple is trending toward a disposable side.
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.280]   The second complaint, as long as we're talking about complaints, go ahead.
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.920]   Clayton, do you want to say something about this?
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.160]   No, no, I was just about to say Tim said it perfectly.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:06.440]   I mean, I think some of the beef with this is in the department of that there are people
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:10.320]   who want to buy and enjoy these products that are simple and they don't have to worry about
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:13.920]   doing anything with them once they have them.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.200]   And there are those to Tim's point.
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.200]   He said it great.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:22.200]   If this is going to be their pro machine, if this is the one that they're going to be
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:26.760]   upgrading because this is their workhorse machine, the one that they're out rolling video between
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.280]   Thunderbolt displays and doing all sorts of things in the field with video editing and
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.480]   photo editing in the field.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:35.920]   And they want to be able to expand something because the new camera that they just got
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.960]   in the field now requires them to have X, Y, and Z.
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.560]   And then they're out $3,000 because they can't expand it.
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:44.720]   So I certainly see the need on the pro side to be able to do that.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.480]   We see that with the Mac Pro, right?
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:50.080]   I mean, that's highly, highly expandable.
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:51.080]   So I can see.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.440]   And probably highly dead.
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:57.240]   They didn't really even update the Mac Pro at all.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:01.960]   I guess I feel bad for a computer or an iPad, I feel the same way, but the iPad, which
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:07.600]   is essentially not upgradable or replaceable, that these things will have useful life for
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:12.160]   years, probably five, 10 years, except for the fact that the battery will only last a
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:16.680]   few years and it's fairly expensive or impossible to replace it.
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:20.400]   And so I feel like Apple is, yeah, I understand they want to make it thinner, lighter, they
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:25.000]   want to make a consumer product, but they're kind of also making a product that would built
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.920]   in obsolescence in an age where that just seems to me anti-social.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:35.000]   One thing I've noticed though with Apple in these components is that I've never known
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:41.520]   anyone, even beyond the year warranty, to ever have, like if my wife takes her Mac
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:46.560]   Book Pro in where it's not retaining a charge at all, it wouldn't do anything with the battery.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.440]   Yeah, the battery was dead.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.000]   Few years long in the tooth, right?
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   She didn't have Apple care.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.200]   She just took it in and she said, look, you know, battery's not working.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.000]   They just ran a test on it, sure enough, and they just replaced your battery for no
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   cost.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.320]   And the same with the iPhone.
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:03.440]   Even beyond the one year warranty time, you go into an Apple store and you say, I don't
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.440]   know what's going on here.
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.120]   They run a test batteries that they replace it, and very often they do it for free.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.120]   They don't even need to do it.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.120]   Often, but you can't count on it.
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.120]   That's not their policy.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:17.560]   That's because she's cute and the Apple genius said, okay, Natalie, you could have a little
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:18.560]   one.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:19.560]   I see one.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.560]   I see one.
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.560]   I think you're very nice.
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:22.560]   It doesn't count.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.760]   But it is not their policy, and it is not always going to happen.
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:29.400]   And most of the time, in fact, if you look at the charge for replacing a battery on the
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:34.480]   MacBook, retina, whatever we help would call this thing, is it's 200 bucks to replace
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:35.480]   the battery.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:36.480]   It's 200 bucks.
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.480]   I'll tell you what, though.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:41.160]   This is Apple banking on the same psychology that makes global warming such a difficult
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:44.720]   nut to crack because it's a vague threat of something down the road.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:45.720]   Right.
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:48.880]   And it's like, well, do you want to not buy an apple just because down the road, you may
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.880]   have shortened battery life that you'll have.
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:53.040]   And the real response is, but it's pretty.
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:58.040]   I want to refer everybody to the PC Magazine column written by me June 13th, 2012, a few
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:01.240]   days ago, called nothing can be fixed anymore.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.240]   That's the question.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:06.240]   And it does end, but you have to take this to an extreme and look at it from the societal
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.240]   level.
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.880]   This includes your automobile.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:09.880]   Right.
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:12.600]   When we were kids, we can't tune up an automobile.
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:13.600]   You can't tune up a Lexus.
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.760]   The cars don't break as much as they used to.
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:16.760]   Well, no, they're made better.
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:17.760]   It's the same thing.
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:18.760]   It's a more reliable now than they used to be.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:19.760]   Well, that's true.
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.760]   Well, that's true.
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.480]   A car, as a durable good, last 10 years or more.
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.080]   Your Lexus, less 200, 300 miles.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:27.320]   I just had the spark plugs changed 125.
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.320]   On the spark plugs.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.120]   Like I said, they should have been changed at 80,000 miles.
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:33.120]   When I was a kid.
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:36.080]   It's very different for a car and a computer, which has a much longer--
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:40.240]   Well, I know, but the fact is you're creating an environment where everybody's dependent
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.240]   now.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.240]   You can't fix anything.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.240]   You can't do anything yourself.
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:48.440]   This is actually a function of the nanny state where everything is done for you.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:49.440]   And you should--
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:50.440]   You're way.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.440]   That's exactly what it's all about.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:53.440]   Read the column.
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:57.280]   You may not invoke libertarian conservative politics.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.880]   To defend this, go ahead.
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:40:59.880]   Okay.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:00.880]   So here's the thing.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:04.200]   First of all, what you want the answer to this is you're thinking about this all wrong.
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.680]   You're not buying a product.
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.040]   You're buying a service.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.080]   And part of the service involves you get a gizmo.
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:13.400]   When the gizmo breaks as part of your subscription to the Apple service.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.760]   Your slavery.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:19.720]   But to bring in the nanny state government talk is crazy talk.
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:20.720]   This is--
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.720]   Read the column.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.720]   I outlined this beautifully.
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:26.440]   I actually bring Facebook into it too.
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:30.120]   I think what John is saying in the column, and I think it's probably true, is that there
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:34.680]   is a mindset where you just go, I'm just going to let you take care of this.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:35.680]   Apple or the government.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.680]   I'm just going to let you take care of this.
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:38.680]   I give up.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:39.680]   I give up.
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:40.680]   I give up.
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:42.120]   I can no longer fight this fight.
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.120]   I give up.
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.120]   Okay.
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.120]   Stop thinking about it.
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.120]   Stop thinking about it.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.120]   I give up.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.960]   And start thinking of it in terms of my time has a value, a price.
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:50.960]   Right.
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.480]   And I'm willing to pay extra to not think about this.
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:57.200]   So I'm willing to pay extra so I can drive all the way to the Apple store with my little
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.280]   device and I drop it off or get it replaced.
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.800]   I think it's a responsible way.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:05.040]   I understand and I agree with you, Brian, that this comes from that attitude.
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.440]   I can afford this.
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.440]   But that's irresponsible.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:11.640]   Or it's just that we just don't want to spend our time.
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:12.640]   This is another thing.
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:17.360]   Part of human psychology is that we cannot tolerate a small amount of risk.
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:23.440]   We will pay extraordinary orders of magnitude more for a device that promises 100% security
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:24.440]   they.
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.440]   There you go.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.280]   Security, you hit the right word.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:31.120]   So instead what Apple is doing is they're saying we're going to vastly overcharge for
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:32.320]   all of our products.
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:36.400]   But in exchange, 100% of the time we'll be able to make things right no matter what's
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:40.800]   wrong and you will never feel like you got stuck with the lemon with our products.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:41.800]   And I understand that.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.480]   And to be honest, I think that's an okay bet.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.880]   It's what all of insurance is based on is 100% protection.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:51.360]   That's essentially Apple's rolling in the cost of insurance to all their products to provide
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.280]   exceptional customer service.
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.280]   I disagree with that.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.280]   I disagree with that.
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:59.040]   When you look at the iPad, no one could compete with the price on the iPad.
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:04.520]   And you had all these, you had, what was it, the zoom tablet that came out that was like
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:06.400]   a $200 more expensive.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:07.640]   They couldn't compete on price.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:10.960]   And so Apple got the price down to a manageable degree.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.800]   And for many people, that was their first computer.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:16.360]   You had 80 year olds for crying out loud using the iPad for the first time.
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.760]   It was the first time they'd ever used email.
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:22.240]   So I don't know that I buy the whole price argument anymore for Apple.
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:25.480]   Maybe that used to be the way and maybe some other product line still is.
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:28.480]   But I think most of the time it's the people just want to be able to use these products
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.480]   easily.
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:33.120]   They don't want to have to pick out and get a little screw device and take off the bottom
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:35.800]   and they're worried they're going to screw up their entire computer.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:40.000]   So for the, the maker fair market, this is a bad thing.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.400]   But for the, you know, for the majority of the people, the 90% that Apple always seems
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:47.640]   to target, I think this is a smart thing.
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:48.960]   That's exactly what Tim said.
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.520]   So we've come full circle.
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.440]   We all agree with you, Tim.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:53.840]   You're right as usual.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:54.840]   All right.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.640]   Problem number two, and I want to talk to the two guys who have this MacBook Pro with
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:06.080]   Retina display, Tim and Clayton, they no longer in the control panel give you screen
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.080]   resolutions.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:13.880]   They give you basically five choices, larger text, best or more space.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:19.200]   But may I point out that even if you choose more space, this highest resolution, that
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.720]   is not the native resolution of the display.
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:25.120]   It is not 2880 by 1800.
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.360]   It's 1920 by 1200.
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:32.040]   You cannot set this display to its native resolution.
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.480]   That is the most annoying thing for me about this laptop.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:38.340]   When we were listening about the presentation of the laptop, I was working with there in
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:41.320]   Murph at the live blog, and we both looked at each other and thought, wow, we're going
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:45.280]   to get four times the screen real estate that we have in our current max.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.400]   But that's not the case.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:49.600]   What they're doing is they're scaling every application to bring it up to be roughly the
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:52.800]   same size as it would be on the current 15-inch Pro.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:56.480]   So if you're running an older application that hasn't been updated yet as the vast majority
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:00.080]   have not been, it's still going to be big as big as it was before.
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:02.560]   You can adjust that slider like you were talking about.
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:05.920]   But even then, it will only be as small as it would have been on the 17-inch with the
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:06.920]   1080p panel.
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:11.040]   So even then, it's going to be bigger than it should be running on the native resolution.
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:16.360]   Only applications that have been updated like Final Cut Pro, for example, or iPhones.
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:18.920]   They're an aperture, which is basically the first party title.
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.200]   Photographers will want this.
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.280]   I can understand why.
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:26.240]   But somebody like me who wants my text editor to be super high res and have, you know,
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:27.240]   80 windows.
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:28.240]   I can't do that.
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:29.920]   At least not yet until those applications have been updated.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:33.120]   It's totally different than on a PC, where if you get a much higher resolution monitor,
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.360]   everything just scales appropriately.
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.440]   Apple's basically doing the reverse.
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:40.680]   If your application hasn't been updated to use this display, then it gets scaled and
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:41.680]   it gets blown up.
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:42.680]   Which means--
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:47.480]   Now, if you set this to their setting that says best for retina display, it's the same
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.920]   resolution as your MacBook Pro.
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.920]   That totally sucks.
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.920]   It's the same resolution.
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:57.440]   It's 1920 by 1200.
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:03.920]   You realize, Leo, that this is essentially Apple acknowledging that they have improved.
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:08.600]   And this is something, the moment I saw WWDC and I annoyed my assistant, John, by suggesting
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:14.000]   this, Apple literally created an enhancement that you need a magnifying glass to even
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.320]   see the difference on.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:19.560]   Because if you're more than three feet away from your screen, by their own definition,
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:23.240]   you can't tell the difference between a regular display and a retina display.
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:27.720]   And the side effect of that, this is them saying, "We don't want you to make it so small,
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:31.960]   because then you'll not even be able to see it because it's too freaking tight."
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:38.560]   But Apple's running a con game because they're saying that our retina display is 2880 by 1800.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:42.960]   And you can't set it to that resolution.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.320]   Unless your application has been updated.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.800]   So for example, in Final Cut Pro, they did update the app.
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:50.640]   So if you're running that, you can get a full 1080p preview of the video, plus all your
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:53.840]   timelines, plus all the menus, plus everything else on the screen.
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:57.000]   So that app, for example, does make use of all the real estate.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.520]   But the vast majority of apps out there do not.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:02.240]   And that to me is a huge shortcoming of this laptop.
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:05.360]   And most of those apps will be updated, I'm sure.
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:08.280]   Is it a shortcoming of the laptop or is it a shortcoming of the market?
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:11.440]   I mean, because I, one of the things I noticed when I'm on the web, it's just how bad the
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:12.440]   web looks.
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.200]   I mean, the web in general.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:16.320]   And you know, ironically, you're still not set.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.320]   Oh, no, wait a minute.
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:19.320]   So Safari is doing 2880.
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:21.320]   So Safari is doing 2880.
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:22.320]   So Safari is doing 2880.
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:25.320]   So Chrome is not.
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:30.280]   Chrome is not, but there are some extensions you can get that help with some of the text
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.280]   rendering.
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:34.840]   But when I go to certain websites, I'm just scaling around here.
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:38.040]   And when you look at some of the assets on certain sites, I mean, they just look
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.040]   horrible.
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:41.160]   And you know, text looks great.
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:45.000]   So once again, the web has to redesign itself to fit Apple.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.560]   Yeah, they killed Flash and now they're.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:54.360]   Well, I'd like to refer people to my June 6th, 2012 column entitled The Worst Thing Ever
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.600]   Retina Display.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:57.600]   And I discussed actually.
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:58.600]   Way ahead of us all.
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:01.960]   It's pretty much what Brian was discussing in a column form.
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:03.960]   It's because you have glaucoma.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:05.520]   So you're worth it.
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:10.320]   Well, I understand that Apple's concern is if you and we were taught, we talked, we knew
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:13.600]   this kind of this was in the rumors that we so we've talked about this for a couple
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:19.000]   of months on Mac break weekly, our Macintosh show on Tuesdays is that Apple isn't going
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.480]   to give you resolution settings because if you said it as most people would to the native
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:25.800]   resolution, I can't read a thing.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:28.840]   All the pixels are so small and I conjured too small.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:30.720]   It makes everything look teensy, weensy.
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:31.720]   Get closer.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:34.200]   So I actually, I actually have a question for you, Leo.
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:40.240]   This seems to me like this is a canary in the coal mine kind of situation kind of a test
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:44.880]   for 4K displays because I've and we go back and forth through this on frame rate me and
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.040]   Tom Merritt about this.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:48.640]   I think 4K displays in the home are a terrible idea.
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:51.520]   If you position them as a TV, I think they're a great idea.
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:55.680]   If you position them as a brand new device called a video wall or something, you need
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:49:00.120]   to do something fundamentally different because as long as we think of it as a TV, we're
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:03.040]   seeing increasingly diminishing returns.
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:07.160]   Well, we did see that when HD came out and people were watching, I love Lucy on their
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:11.980]   HD display and they were going, this looks really crappy because it does because it always
[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:12.980]   looks crappy.
[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:14.240]   You just couldn't see it before.
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.960]   Oh, I still have my parents.
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:17.200]   Thank God they're not watching this.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:18.920]   They don't even know how to find the internet.
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:19.920]   But thank God.
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:23.280]   I mean, they come over and I got that we got them a nice television, you know, we got
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:26.480]   the, you know, they're watching Harry freaking Mason.
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:27.480]   Right.
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:30.880]   And so instead of watching whatever it is, the local NBC affiliate or whatever they're
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:32.520]   watching, you know, if they're watching the Phillies game.
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:35.760]   And I'll look so jaggy on the HD channel.
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:38.200]   They're watching on channel four instead of channel eight.
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:39.440]   Exactly.
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:41.800]   They're not even watching the HD version of the channel.
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:44.360]   I know that's what kills me.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:47.040]   And they're thinking, oh, this looks so much better Clayton.
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.040]   Thank you.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:49.040]   TV is so good.
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.040]   You're so nice.
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.200]   But you're still watching the same thing that you were watching before.
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:54.240]   I know it's crazy.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:56.640]   I see that all the time.
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.080]   You're watching channel four.
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:00.000]   You should be watching channel 207.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.360]   Well, you know, if you go up, make the argument.
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:02.360]   It's all about the content.
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.360]   You really don't care.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:04.840]   My daughter does this.
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:05.840]   She doesn't care.
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:08.200]   Don't why do you watching it on regular definition?
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:10.880]   Put it on HD ad doesn't make any difference as far as she's concerned.
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:11.880]   It makes us angry.
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:13.720]   It only makes us angry.
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:17.840]   We're the only ones even noticing one little sliver of society complaining about this.
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:21.080]   So does it look a little weird, Tim, when you're, when you're, I mean, how does that
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:22.080]   work?
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:26.280]   So you're using an Apple 2880 by 1800 app and then you go to another app.
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:28.160]   Is there, is this a screen reset?
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.160]   How does that happen?
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:33.920]   So all the assets of the OS are always being rendered at the native resolution.
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:37.240]   What you're doing is basically scaling the icons and scaling the text.
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:38.960]   So that's why things look jagged.
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:43.080]   And you run it at something at a non-native resolution and everything looks really weird.
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:44.080]   So it's, it's okay.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:45.960]   But some apps, it depends on how they're written.
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:50.160]   Like if you use Sparrow, which I use for email, the, the content pane of your email is, is
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.160]   in really nice.
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:52.160]   Our resolution looks great.
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:56.480]   But the list of your emails is in super jaggy vision looks terrible.
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:59.200]   So some apps, even within the app are, are, are different.
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.040]   But you are getting the resolution.
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:04.520]   And it kind of ties back to what we're talking about before, where if you can't fix your laptop,
[00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:06.800]   some people can, you know, feel strongly about that.
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:07.800]   Some people don't care.
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:08.800]   It's the same thing here.
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.240]   They're kind of hiding the concept of a resolution from you.
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:12.240]   Right.
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:14.760]   It's kind of the same as you were doing before, but it's now sort of picking a resolution.
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:18.520]   You're kind of picking a size and they're more or less hiding that because people don't
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:19.880]   need to worry about that.
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:24.600]   This is not what happened with the iPad when it went to a screen double display.
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:25.600]   Is it?
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:29.480]   It's pretty similar actually because everything is being skilled on the iPad in much the same
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.040]   way that your apps are being skilled here.
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.040]   Okay.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:36.400]   So if you're comfortable with the new iPad and the way it's handling that, you'll be
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:37.400]   comfortable with it.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:41.040]   But see, isn't it just doubling, always doubling on the iPad here?
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:42.040]   It's not always doubling.
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:43.040]   I don't understand.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:44.040]   Okay.
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:45.040]   Explain this to me.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:46.040]   I'm looking at the control panel.
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.040]   I said it for best for retina display.
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:50.160]   It's 1920 by 1200.
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:52.760]   What is 1920 by 1200?
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:58.400]   It's how that app would look if you ran it on the 17 inch MacBook Pro with the 1080p
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:59.400]   panel.
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:03.640]   That's how large that app would physically be if you launched it on that.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:07.440]   Best for retina quote unquote is basically making the app be the same size as it would
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:10.000]   be if you ran it on the 15 inch MacBook Pro.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.440]   So it's not doubling.
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:13.320]   So you're going to have jaggy's.
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:14.320]   Think about it.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:15.640]   Think about it like you would think about Diablo.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:19.920]   If you want to bring Diablo down to as low as settings, 800 by 600, you're going to be
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:24.760]   able to see even though your display is still, you know, 1920 by 1080.
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:28.000]   And even though the video card is still putting that out, you will just see the individual
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.560]   pixels as though it were 800 by 600.
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:32.560]   That's essentially what it's doing with all of the apps.
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:33.560]   If I understand it.
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:35.480]   Hey, Brian, Brian, so Brian, wait a minute.
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:36.480]   Go back to Brian.
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:38.480]   Who's he talking to?
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:39.480]   He's got somebody over there.
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:42.560]   You're talking to you're like talking off camera.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:43.560]   There.
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:44.560]   He's got a switch here.
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:45.560]   I'm turning.
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:46.560]   I'm turning to face you guys.
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:47.560]   See you guys are over here.
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:48.560]   And now I'm looking at you.
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:49.560]   Why don't you move the camera?
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:50.560]   Oh, gee.
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:56.600]   I will jump in to say that Diablo 3 actually can be run at the full native resolution and
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:53:02.200]   shockingly it manages 30 frames per second at 2880 in Diablo 3, which is pretty impressive
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:03.200]   for laptop.
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:06.920]   I think they actually optimized it for Diablo 3 because they even mentioned it at the keynote.
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:09.080]   It's like, and this runs great.
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:14.320]   I remember at the iPad 3 or the new iPad launch event, you know, picking it up for the first
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:18.400]   time and going to the New York Times website to see how, you know, how that render.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:19.760]   Obviously, text looks beautiful.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:20.760]   It looks brilliant.
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:24.720]   And then you look at, you know, some of the assets on the page, you know, Twitter, like
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:27.920]   button or those sorts of things or even some of the images there.
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:29.520]   And they just looked terrible.
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:30.520]   Yeah.
[00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:31.520]   And they really looked terrible.
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:33.560]   So this is not the first time we've seen this.
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:35.320]   No, and it's still not fixed.
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:38.580]   That's what I guess I wanted to say, which is, you know, the New York Times, which is
[00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:43.480]   often featured like on Apple's website as like a major feature news website that they
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:44.480]   feature on the iPad.
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:50.080]   They still haven't, they still haven't started using like retina assets on their website.
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:52.200]   So I don't know how long if the New York Times isn't doing it.
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.400]   God knows it's going to be taking up his hand.
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:54:00.600]   Is there an issue of bandwidth if you suddenly putting these much higher scale for what you're
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:05.480]   doing is you're making a much fatter site for normal people to accommodate the people
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:09.040]   using the higher resolution displays, which is right now minimum, right?
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:10.040]   Right.
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:13.520]   So I think it's reasonable that the New York Times would say, well, I probably went to
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:16.360]   the designer said, okay, so if we wanted to make this image written on how much bigger
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:18.040]   that's 20 megabytes.
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:22.080]   If we wanted to make, if we want to make the whole site, how much bigger is 38 gigabytes?
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:24.720]   If we, how much more bandwidth are we going to be using?
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.560]   Well, you could use 50% more bandwidth.
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:30.080]   How many images they're sending constantly though with the text is coming over.
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.840]   Well, the text scales fine, right?
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:32.840]   Yeah, those things.
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:37.560]   What we're trying to do on our site to make this work is basically move away from images
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:41.640]   wherever we can and move to sprite based things and text based things and things that can
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:42.640]   scale more appropriately.
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:43.640]   No more pictures.
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:44.640]   People not like sprites.
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:45.640]   Yeah.
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:46.640]   More pictures.
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:48.640]   No more pictures.
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:49.640]   A link space browser.
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:50.640]   It's just text.
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:53.400]   I don't think this is even, this is a species because most of the images that are sent over,
[00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:56.640]   even on a website generally speaking, are never scaled down.
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:58.640]   They're scaled down by the browser 90%.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:54:59.640]   No, no, no, no.
[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:00.640]   I don't know.
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:04.320]   When I post a photo, and especially if it's a linked photo, I look at what the resolution
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:06.800]   is and I say, well, do I want to drink this?
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.320]   Now, let the browser do it.
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:09.840]   Trained professionals work otherwise.
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:12.040]   No, that's bull crap.
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:17.880]   Or they have a smart IT guy who set it up so that they've got resizing built into the
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:19.560]   content management system.
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:23.360]   Because that's not, nobody, you're putting 100K graphics on the site.
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:29.760]   No, you have a lot of size that have, I know what these templates look like and they create
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:30.760]   thumbnails.
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:32.440]   They're not creating thumbnails and downloading them.
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:35.200]   They're just taking the image and thum nailing it on the front page.
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:39.400]   That's still a 500, 600 wide image, even though it's only like 40 pixels wide.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.800]   Yeah, that's, no, and you click on it and boom, there it is.
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:42.800]   I think they're resizing.
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:43.800]   No, no, no.
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:44.800]   I'll tell you.
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:46.800]   You haven't been blogging recently.
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:50.320]   Now, let me ask Tim, because he mentioned scalable vector graphics.
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:53.480]   So are you going to be starting to use SVG graphics?
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:55.440]   I mean, you don't want to get rid of graphics.
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:56.440]   You'll look like it.
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:57.440]   You'll be terrible.
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:58.440]   Right.
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:03.520]   So you can do a lot of amazing things with CSS and HTML5 that previously had to rely on
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:05.240]   actual image formats for.
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:08.880]   So what we're trying to do is come up with interesting ways of using text to replace
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:12.640]   a lot of the graphics, the actual JPEGs and SVG and everything else.
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:14.200]   Tim, I'm looking at Engadget.com.
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:16.960]   I've never seen a more graphic picture-heavy site.
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:17.960]   Yeah.
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:21.960]   I will be perfectly, but honestly, I'm not a huge fan of our current design.
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:24.640]   But anyhow, some interesting, fascinating changes are coming.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:28.080]   It's going to have to look different if you're going to get rid of all the graphics.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:30.040]   Yeah, it absolutely will.
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:34.320]   And then that's kind of upstream from, you know, the competition is, let's say, the
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:37.120]   verge where they have opted for it.
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:38.960]   See, they're going to have a big challenge.
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:42.160]   They've opted for basically the Windows 8 version.
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:45.200]   I mean, it's better in my opinion.
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:46.200]   We definitely.
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:51.080]   I think so this is going to be the web is going to revert to text links.
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:53.120]   I wouldn't say that necessarily.
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:55.480]   Welcome back to AOL, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:56.480]   Get your browser.
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:57.880]   Get your links browser out.
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:58.880]   All right.
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:56:59.880]   Well, this is interesting.
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:00.960]   I'm talking to the VMS.
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:06.520]   But it's true because so many people use the iPad or the iPhone 4S or I guess I don't know
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:09.600]   if they're going to sell a lot of these Mac Pros, but MacBook Pros.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:10.920]   That's the question.
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:15.360]   I was curious how many 17 inches they weren't selling, right?
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:17.000]   Because I mean, they killed it, right?
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   Right.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   Well, yeah, it's dead.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.560]   But so if they killed it, it's gone.
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:23.440]   This replaces that in many ways.
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:27.640]   You know, is this going to all of these little nitpicky things we're talking about?
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:31.720]   Again, I don't think, you know, the student going off to college is going to be buying
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:32.720]   this machine.
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:35.360]   And I don't think, you know, again, my mom is going to be buying this machine.
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:38.080]   This is for the pro user allegedly.
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:41.680]   So I think, you know, those individuals are going to know how to set a display the way
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:42.680]   they need it.
[00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:44.080]   But I also think this is the transitional thing.
[00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:46.320]   I don't think we're going to see that little menu that you were just talking about, that
[00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:48.000]   control panel menu in a year.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   I feel like that's going to go.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   You're not even going to set it.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   It's just going to do it.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   Right.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   That'll be gone.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.760]   Now, Leo, you, I heard you during the announcement talking about how much you wanted a touchscreen
[00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:01.760]   display.
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:03.440]   Are you disappointed that they didn't go with that?
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:04.840]   Well, I don't know about you.
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:06.320]   Maybe I'm weird because I use the iPad.
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:07.320]   I don't use it all the time.
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:12.520]   I'm mostly a Macbook Air user, but I do still find myself touching the laptop.
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:13.520]   Well, everybody else.
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:14.680]   That's what it's all smudged up.
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:18.400]   You got mustard on it.
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:19.920]   You get used to doing that.
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:25.960]   And then, well, especially when they've trained us for what two years now on iPads to interact
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:27.480]   and touch our screens.
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:28.480]   And then they--
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:29.480]   I want to touch it.
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:30.480]   It seems like it would be relatively--
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:31.920]   I want to touch it all the time.
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:32.920]   Hey.
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:36.680]   You just have to add the ability to, you know, scroll and touch and throw stuff around
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:38.400]   on the screen.
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:41.240]   I'm guessing they would have to change some of the internals of the operating system to
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:43.000]   make that really seamless throughout.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:46.800]   So maybe that's something that they're waiting on the actual next major release of the OS.
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:47.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:49.120]   We've been waiting on for a couple of years now to implement.
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:51.320]   Me, personally, I hate fingerprints on my screen.
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:54.040]   I hate it when somebody reaches up and points to something in my monitor and they actually
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:55.040]   touch the monitor.
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:57.040]   Oh, that's me really--
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:59.080]   It's like they're already doing that.
[00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:00.280]   At least they're already doing that.
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:02.280]   At least they would have a reason for it.
[00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:03.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:04.280]   Very true.
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:05.280]   Very true.
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:08.720]   No, I mean, I look at my iPad and it's just-- it's horrible.
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:09.720]   It's disgusting.
[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:13.000]   It's like you-- it's got fingerprints as smudges.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.560]   And I think that just welcome to the future.
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:22.760]   Every Windows aren't most of the new Windows 8 PCs going to have-- what are you doing?
[00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:24.760]   I'm doing-- I'm doing-- how you getting rid of all your figures?
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:25.760]   I'm doing-- this isn't--
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:26.760]   It's good.
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:27.760]   Turn it off.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:29.000]   I guess he touches it all the time, too.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   Yeah, but not talking about that.
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.160]   I think it's been clean as a whistle.
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:36.000]   Mine looks like it's been massaged by a hot dog vendor.
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   Exactly.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   With the hot dogs.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   Whatever.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   So I'm just saying-- I don't know.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:46.440]   I think-- Windows 8, it's not just going to be Windows RT that's going to-- the tablet,
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:48.440]   it's going to-- I imagine there'll be quite a few.
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:50.880]   In fact, we saw in the Computex touch screen laptops.
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:51.880]   I think that's what's coming.
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:54.720]   Yeah, because I think what's more weird about Windows 8 is using a machine.
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:55.720]   A mouse--
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:56.720]   It's so weird.
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:57.720]   It's so weird.
[00:59:57.720 --> 00:59:58.720]   It doesn't work.
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:02.040]   So are we going to talk about iOS 6?
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:03.040]   We are.
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.040]   Hold on.
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.040]   Let's take a break.
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.040]   We're going to come back with more.
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.040]   This is so good.
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:11.600]   And I do want to talk about the Steve Jobs note, the good article on Engadget, that went
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:17.440]   for $27,500 and the Apple One computer that went for 370.
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.760]   So I have an interesting videotape.
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:20.760]   Hold on.
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:21.760]   We'll get to that in a moment.
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:24.000]   But first, the teaser.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.600]   I want to talk about audible.com.
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:26.600]   OK, show of hands.
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:27.600]   Audible users.
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:28.600]   I know Clayton.
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:29.600]   I know Brian.
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:30.600]   I know I-- Tim?
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:31.600]   Tim?
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:32.600]   Yeah?
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:33.600]   John, you don't.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.600]   I mean to.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.600]   He's always wanted to.
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.200]   Here's your chance, John.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.400]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.480]   You can get two books free.
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:41.480]   How about that?
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:44.720]   Or a two credit book like Game of Thrones free.
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:49.840]   Audible is the ultimate in audiobook stores over 100,000 titles.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.320]   Fantastic stuff.
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:53.480]   In fact, it's probably too late.
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:55.120]   Maybe it's not.
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:59.040]   If you didn't get a Father's Day gift for your dad, an audible subscription, or even
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.520]   you could just gift a book is a great thing.
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.720]   Dad loves audiobooks.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:03.720]   Like the Kane Mutiny.
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:06.880]   Don't you think Dad would like to hear the Kane Mutiny?
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:08.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:12.600]   I was sure to shrubber-ish, and I was going down.
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:16.680]   This is-- I probably doesn't sound like that, because that was the movie.
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.240]   But who reads that new Cronkite book?
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:20.920]   I just put that in my Audible view.
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.280]   There's a Cronkite book.
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:23.280]   I should read it.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.280]   Yeah, it just came out.
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.680]   It's a huge--
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:28.320]   I love Cronkite.
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.600]   It's called Cronkite by Douglas Brinkley.
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:34.040]   Oh, George Credall is one of their barest best narrators.
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.720]   Here, I'll play a little bit of this.
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:38.640]   I would-- oh, I'm going to get-- oh, this is the abridged version.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.160]   I'm sure there's an unabridged as well, but let's--
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:46.400]   Down at CBS News Anchorman on a Friday night, one network executive postulated that the
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:53.120]   broadcaster had come to represent God, mother, the American flag, a formative mile, and
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:57.840]   Mount Everest, to an adoring public, traumatized by Vietnam and Watergate.
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:00.120]   I can't wait to listen to this.
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:01.120]   That sounds great.
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.120]   That's Cronkite.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.320]   Let me just see.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.800]   They usually have abridged in unabridged.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.480]   In this case, I think they don't do an unabridged version.
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:10.720]   I thought I saw an unabridged in there for two credits, but maybe I'm wrong.
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:13.200]   It's-- a bridge version is 12 hours.
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.160]   Yeah, it's a thick book.
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.160]   I saw it at the bookstore.
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.160]   I immediately went to Audible.
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:20.320]   I mean, it's a thick, thick, sort of David McCullough style thick book.
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.320]   I can't wait.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:22.320]   I can't wait.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:23.320]   I can't wait.
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:25.760]   I'm going to get on some old iron pants because he could sit there for hours and just-- you
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:30.000]   know-- you guys are too young, but John and I are old enough to remember watching Cronkite
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.320]   with the space launches.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.320]   Yeah.
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.320]   Wow.
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:34.720]   And he'd sit there with a rob another hold.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:40.520]   So let's once again disassemble the model of the Apollo rocket I have sitting here.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.000]   You should have done the voice.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   You should have.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   I could have done it.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   I could have just sustained it.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   I could-- I could sustain that.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.220]   I could go hours talking like this.
[01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:50.700]   Just like Walter Cronkite.
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:51.700]   So anyway--
[01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:55.260]   You ever notice that Amy Goodman on Democracy Now is tries to sound like him?
[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:56.260]   I haven't heard that.
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:57.740]   Re-listen to her and you'll end up--
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:59.260]   That's a good show by the way.
[01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:00.260]   Oh.
[01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:01.260]   Well, I know.
[01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:07.980]   It's exactly why I listened because I can just feel you getting upset.
[01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:08.980]   Audible.com.
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:12.900]   Oh, Michael Schaben's The Amazing Adventures of Cavalier and Clay.
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:14.420]   I didn't know that wasn't out in audio.
[01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:16.260]   That's a great book.
[01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:20.820]   Alan first writes the most wonderful spy thrillers.
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:24.740]   His new one is out Mission to Paris in the Night Soldiers series.
[01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:25.740]   He is really good.
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:30.300]   You're just not going to run out of stuff to listen to with a hundred thousand plus titles
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:32.260]   and more being recorded all the time.
[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:36.340]   Nowadays when a new book comes out, it almost always comes out on Audible at the same time
[01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:37.980]   as the book comes out in the store.
[01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:39.220]   I am just a big fan.
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:42.820]   And now here's a chance for you to try Audible free.
[01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:45.820]   Is it Audible.com/twit2?
[01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:47.860]   Pick two books.
[01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:49.260]   Your first month is free.
[01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:51.260]   Your first two credits are free.
[01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.060]   And you can cancel at any time.
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:56.980]   Pay nothing in the book so yours to keep forever.
[01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:57.980]   Audible.com.
[01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:00.340]   Oh, is the sale over yet?
[01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:04.780]   I don't know if they have a half price sale right now, 40% sale.
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:07.100]   So you might want to check that out.
[01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:08.260]   What are you listening to right now?
[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:09.260]   I'm sorry, Brian.
[01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:10.860]   I think I steered you wrong.
[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:12.420]   I told you to listen to 1Q84.
[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:13.420]   I don't think you liked it.
[01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:15.420]   Oh, no, I didn't.
[01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:17.900]   Mainly because nothing happened, but it was...
[01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:19.660]   And it's really long.
[01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:20.660]   I'm reading that right now.
[01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:22.660]   It doesn't spoil the end of 20.
[01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:24.100]   But there's extended...
[01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:25.300]   The last third of the book is...
[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:26.380]   This is not an exaggeration.
[01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:31.180]   The last third of the book is one person on a stakeout waiting for another person who's
[01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:35.820]   on vacation investigating another person waiting for them to come back.
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:38.340]   It's literally nothing for the last third of the book.
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:39.340]   I'm sorry.
[01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:40.340]   I shouldn't have recommended that.
[01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:41.340]   But it was beautiful.
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:44.700]   What are you listening to right now?
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:46.260]   I'm actually listening to...
[01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:48.140]   It's edited by George R.R. Martin.
[01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:51.580]   I think this happened back in the 1980s called Wild Cards.
[01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:52.940]   And it's sort of...
[01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:58.620]   It's a realistic take on what if an alien virus just mixed up the genes on everyone.
[01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:00.260]   Some people, most of them are jokers.
[01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:04.540]   They draw bad wild cards where they got blue skin or they're missing an arm now.
[01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:06.340]   But then a few of them are aces.
[01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:10.940]   And they got essentially telekinesis or some other powers as well.
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:15.620]   I'm enjoying the world, but I'm frustrated by the nature of it being a collection of
[01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:17.980]   short stories written by all different people.
[01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:22.540]   Because just when I fall in love with a character's situation, it jumps on to something different.
[01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:23.540]   This is...
[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:26.700]   Other people have done this fact that the audible did it too, where they create a world
[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:30.820]   and they get a bunch of science fiction writers together to write stories in that world, but
[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:32.860]   not necessarily connected stories.
[01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:33.860]   Right.
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:34.860]   It's an interesting...
[01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:35.860]   I trope.
[01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:38.020]   I didn't realize that people had done that before.
[01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:41.020]   And actually, there's two books in that series.
[01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.020]   What are you listening to?
[01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:43.020]   Because of my fascinating...
[01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:46.540]   Oh, this James Garfield book I just finished called Destiny, the Republic on Audible.
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:47.540]   And it is fantastic.
[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:48.700]   Tech fans will love this too.
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:53.380]   It's called a Tale of Madness, Medicine, and Murder of a President and how James Garfield
[01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:54.380]   was assassinated.
[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:58.860]   But really, it was the people in there probing around in his body for like four months before
[01:05:58.860 --> 01:05:59.860]   he actually died.
[01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:05.780]   It was all Alexander Graham Bell, who was trying to create this device to find the bullet
[01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:06.780]   in him.
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:07.780]   Wow.
[01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:08.780]   Wow.
[01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:09.780]   Really?
[01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:10.780]   Right.
[01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:12.060]   By Candice Millard, it was a page turner.
[01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:13.060]   It's like a thriller.
[01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:14.900]   I was a history major, maybe that's why I loved it so hard.
[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:15.900]   I love history.
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:16.900]   I listen to a lot of...
[01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:21.420]   I'm listening to a new book called Storm of War that is a new history of World War II
[01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:25.620]   using materials that they got from Soviet Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union.
[01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:27.540]   Adding to my cue right now.
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:30.340]   Really good if you like World War II histories.
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:32.980]   Anyway, we could go on and on.
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:35.900]   The audible ad goes on for hours because it's really not an ad for audible.
[01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:37.780]   It's just like, what are you listening to?
[01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:39.340]   What are you talking about?
[01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:40.740]   Well, stop now.
[01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:41.820]   John's already bored.
[01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:43.180]   He's reading a catalog.
[01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:46.620]   Maybe you can get those on Audible.
[01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:47.620]   Yeah.
[01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:49.620]   Read this catalog on Audible.
[01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:50.620]   Sweetwater.
[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:52.020]   Oh, they've got the best stuff.
[01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:54.620]   They've got great stuff.
[01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:57.820]   $374,500 for an Apple One.
[01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:00.740]   This is one of just a handful of working Apple ones.
[01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:05.220]   Oh, hey, but you also get the manual, the cassette interface.
[01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:09.180]   They thought it would get only $180,000, went for twice that.
[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:15.900]   And then I think even more interesting, the Steve Jobs Atari note that went for $27.4.
[01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:17.260]   So I have a videotape.
[01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:18.260]   Yes.
[01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:19.260]   I have the videotape.
[01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:20.260]   Where is it?
[01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:21.260]   Can I play it?
[01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:22.260]   Is it under work?
[01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:23.260]   No, no, no.
[01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:24.260]   I just found it.
[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:26.660]   I was cleaning up my videotapes and I ran into it.
[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:27.660]   It was the official tape.
[01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:32.300]   It was the one released to the media of Steve Jobs making the announcement of Next.
[01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:33.860]   Oh, I'd love to see that.
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:34.860]   I'll just do that.
[01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:36.100]   Just stay jack the whole thing.
[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:37.100]   Wow.
[01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:38.600]   Well, maybe we should bring it in.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:39.600]   Is it a VHS?
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:40.600]   Yes.
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:41.600]   You have a VHS player.
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.600]   Do we have a VCR?
[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.640]   No, damn, I'm not sure.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.640]   I might have one.
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:46.640]   I might have one at home.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:47.640]   I'll have to check in the bass.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:52.260]   I think I'm going to auction it off to some Steve Jobs' Memero-Belia collector.
[01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:53.900]   If you would sign it, I think you've got it.
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:54.900]   I don't think I do.
[01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:55.900]   I've got to sign it.
[01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:57.540]   It could be all set.
[01:07:57.540 --> 01:08:00.660]   Anyway, Apple making a little bit of a change.
[01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:03.820]   This is really kind of inside baseball, but I'm going to mention it anyway.
[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:08.900]   Podcasts will apparently no longer be part of iTunes.
[01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:10.260]   What?
[01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:17.780]   In iOS 6, apparently there is a separate podcast app.
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:22.780]   So I had heard about this before the event, and I was wondering if we were going to see
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:23.780]   it during the keynote.
[01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:27.660]   And then when we didn't see it during the keynote, I was a little surprised.
[01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:30.780]   And the friend sitting next to me said, "Well, I wouldn't be surprised maybe if it's perhaps
[01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:35.100]   hidden in iOS 6 somewhere, we just won't know about it until people start digging around.
[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:39.980]   And sure enough, Apple usually likes to hold an app or two for their actual physical hardware
[01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:43.140]   launch of the iPhone.
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:48.500]   My sources had said that this is very sort of a radical shift for Apple in the podcast
[01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:52.820]   world where it's going to be pulling it out and creating a separate space for it, but
[01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:57.260]   also not just thinking in podcasts, but thinking of it in terms of changing the paradigm away
[01:08:57.260 --> 01:09:00.740]   in which we're listening to streaming media, getting away from having to physically down
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:04.300]   load different things to our devices.
[01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:06.740]   It's really a whole in iCloud and iTunes match, right?
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:11.340]   You can get all of your songs streaming, but if you subscribe to Macbreak Weekly or subscribe
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:26.140]   to the C-
[01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:30.620]   And remember the last time, I don't think I own devices for over a year now that I've
[01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:33.620]   never once actually synced to a computer.
[01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:35.620]   And it just doesn't fit into my workflow anymore.
[01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:39.300]   And now that even though there's things that are cluedy about podcaster, the experience
[01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:42.620]   of being able to get everything, and you sync all your podcasts right before you get on
[01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:46.900]   the plane and you got plenty to listen to, it's so vastly superior that they needed to
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:48.300]   do this kind of thing.
[01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:52.260]   But I am surprised that they would do the first part, which is kicking it out of iTunes
[01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:54.900]   without following up with the announcement of the new app.
[01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:58.140]   And I wonder if it'll be a big announcement on their next event.
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:09:59.500]   I can't think it'll be a big announcement.
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:03.380]   I mean, I'm a podcaster, but I somehow don't think that it's a very big deal.
[01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:03.980]   That's what I mean.
[01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:07.060]   I don't think it's just going to be podcasts from what I'm hearing is not just going to
[01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:07.340]   be pie.
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:08.780]   I think it'll be streaming media.
[01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:09.780]   So you'll be able to.
[01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:10.980]   Yeah.
[01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:12.380]   Well, I'd love to see that.
[01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:16.500]   It'd be very, very good for us because what it would be is a place that we would be a
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:19.860]   little bit more highlighted instead of buried in iTunes.
[01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:22.940]   And one of the big problems that we have, and I think all podcasters have, is that of
[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:25.380]   discovery.
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:26.940]   How do you find a show?
[01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:27.940]   There's hundreds of us.
[01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:28.940]   Look at Newsstand.
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:32.180]   Look at the success of Newsstand at Time magazine or Time Incorporated just did this week and
[01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:34.620]   added, said, look, they were lent it.
[01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:38.420]   Here we're going to go to Newsstand because we're seeing such an uptick or individual
[01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:43.780]   magazines are seeing such an uptick by just being on that one little skeuomorphic bookstore
[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:47.380]   thing right on the front page where people can't delete the app and they have to go through
[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:48.380]   the store to find it.
[01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:54.500]   I mean, right now on the iPad, if you go into the music app to find podcasts, you have to
[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.300]   go to the, there's a little tab that says more.
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:57.300]   Right.
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:58.740]   It doesn't even, and you can't even edit it.
[01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:00.660]   There's not even a place where you can actually physically put it.
[01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:01.660]   You have to hit more.
[01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:05.700]   Well, also the fact that it's an iTunes implies that it costs something that like you have
[01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:07.100]   to buy and it says subscribe.
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:09.980]   And I think there's definitely a feeling that, well, if I push this, am I going to be
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:10.980]   billed?
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:11.980]   Yeah.
[01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:17.820]   And I think separating it out into just this is, this is streaming or downloadable free
[01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:20.020]   media is not a bad thing.
[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:21.020]   Yeah.
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:22.420]   I hope it's a good thing for us.
[01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:26.820]   Anyway, it's probably a little more inside baseball than anybody else cares about.
[01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:29.620]   So Leo's got a Galaxy S3 here.
[01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:30.620]   Oh, I love it.
[01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.060]   This thing is phenomenal.
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:35.100]   Is it not the best phone you've ever used, Tim?
[01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:36.500]   It's a great phone.
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:39.820]   You know, I don't know if it's necessarily better than the HTC ONE X, but it's certainly
[01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:40.820]   a phenomenal phone.
[01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:43.340]   I'll tell you the one thing it's better than the one X, you can take the battery out and
[01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:44.340]   put a new one in.
[01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:45.340]   Ah, this is very true.
[01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:47.740]   And this goes back to the disposable device thing, I suppose.
[01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:48.740]   Yeah.
[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:52.140]   Well, also the issue of battery life, I can always carry and I usually do a couple extra
[01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:53.140]   batteries.
[01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:54.340]   I tend to as well.
[01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:55.340]   Yeah.
[01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:58.660]   Especially on Android, because we all know that Android devices can be a little hard
[01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:00.060]   on the batteries.
[01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:03.220]   No harder than the iPhone 4S.
[01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:05.740]   You find that you find that better?
[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:10.700]   Well, I think all smartphones really whip through the battery juice these days.
[01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:14.420]   I've always had bad luck on Android, but there's so many opportunities for rogue apps
[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:15.420]   to go crazy on.
[01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:16.420]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:17.420]   That's not your right.
[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:21.620]   Your pocket's on fire because your IM app is going crazy or something like that.
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:26.420]   Well, it was funny watching WWDC holding a Galaxy S3 in my hand because Apple would
[01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:28.660]   keep announcing, "Oh, and now we can do this.
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:30.060]   I can launch apps from Siri."
[01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:31.820]   Well, yeah, I could do that.
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:36.100]   I mean, a lot of the features that Apple adopted in iOS 6 are app features have been in Android
[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:37.100]   for a long time.
[01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:38.100]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:41.100]   I was doing it on Twitter during the event that said, "Are you sure you're not a Google
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:42.100]   IO 2010?"
[01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:45.300]   No, that's next week.
[01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:51.100]   So there was a story about Siri and there's somebody suing or there's some...
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:55.900]   Oh, yeah, guy's suing Apple because not Siri, but the time machine lost his baby pictures.
[01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:58.900]   And so he's suing because of the backup that...
[01:12:58.900 --> 01:12:59.900]   Maybe they're back in time.
[01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:00.900]   Yeah.
[01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:01.900]   They're somewhere.
[01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:02.900]   By the way, there's this thing...
[01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:09.940]   I haven't seen it yet, but siri.kuri.com is some video that Adam did that supposedly ridicules
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:10.940]   the ads or something.
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:11.940]   Well, they're easy to read.
[01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:12.940]   He's pretty doory.
[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:15.700]   OS 10, Mountain Line Dictation doesn't work.
[01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:16.700]   Is this going to be profane?
[01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:18.700]   I will watch it.
[01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:20.500]   The end of June 11, 2012.
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:23.100]   There's that big base voice of Adam Curry.
[01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:27.180]   One of the reasons, because I know that the new OS X would include dictation.
[01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:28.380]   You know, I gotta say something.
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:29.820]   Someone's very interested in it.
[01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:35.820]   It's very obvious that Adam is using a voice processor and has a knob called Big Bottom.
[01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:36.820]   He's...
[01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:39.780]   It was turned it up all the way to the right.
[01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:41.940]   I know, because I've heard the Big Bottom before.
[01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:42.940]   Listen.
[01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:43.940]   Is that a thing?
[01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:45.940]   No, there's actually a device that says...
[01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:46.940]   Like a grown up?
[01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:47.940]   It's called the Big Bottom.
[01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:48.940]   It's the Big Bottom.
[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:50.820]   And listen, tell me if Adam doesn't have a big bottom.
[01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:56.460]   I'm less interested in maps and the snazzy interface and movements.
[01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:57.460]   It's got a turn double.
[01:13:57.460 --> 01:13:58.460]   It's got a turn double.
[01:13:58.460 --> 01:13:59.460]   I have a mutation I find to be something incredibly...
[01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:01.460]   Excuse me, how are these?
[01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:02.460]   They're not starting to filter.
[01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:03.460]   Yeah, since...
[01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:04.460]   The turn's...
[01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:07.260]   It is so hard to interpret exactly what we've heard enough.
[01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:08.260]   Somebody needs to...
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:09.260]   It's kind of...
[01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:10.260]   It's a...
[01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:11.260]   It's a...
[01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:12.260]   I'm gonna show how the dictation...
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:14.620]   Yeah, he shows the dictation doesn't work, I guess.
[01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:15.620]   That works okay for me.
[01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:16.620]   I have to say, Siri works better than the...
[01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:17.620]   I'm out of it.
[01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:18.620]   I have to do with your voice.
[01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:19.620]   I am out of it, it's...
[01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:21.820]   If you have a Big Bottom, you're not gonna do well on this.
[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:23.460]   Well, maybe not.
[01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:26.220]   Let me just try.
[01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:29.460]   Siri, bring my car around.
[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:31.900]   I'm out of 900, never mind.
[01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:35.500]   It doesn't know now your play is it turned on Angry Birds.
[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:36.500]   Oh my.
[01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:37.500]   Oh my.
[01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:38.500]   Oh my.
[01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:39.500]   Oh my.
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:40.500]   Siri.
[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:41.500]   Feelier.
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:42.500]   What factor?
[01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:43.500]   Three, Siri.
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:47.380]   No, I'm really loving...
[01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:49.860]   I'll give you the HTC One.
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:52.060]   I think that's also a very, very hot phone.
[01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:54.060]   It's a very similar, in fact, form factor.
[01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:59.060]   I think between the two of them that you've got a pretty good challenger to the iPhone.
[01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:01.340]   The display is so much brighter and nicer.
[01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:02.340]   I love this display.
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:04.300]   Yeah, both have beautiful displays.
[01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:05.300]   Both are very thin.
[01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:06.300]   Both have amazing designs.
[01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:07.820]   Both are very quick as well.
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:12.100]   So yeah, the Android side, we've got some amazing phones and we'll see what Apple can
[01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:13.100]   come up with this phone.
[01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:14.660]   Well, you got to laugh though.
[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:18.980]   This is a quad core because I got the European version.
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:22.860]   Four 1.4 gigahertz processors in a phone.
[01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:23.860]   For what?
[01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:28.420]   Well, that's why I have fish, a fish background here because I figure I got to give something
[01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:29.420]   for the processor to do.
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:33.100]   So there's always fish swimming through my scene because otherwise...
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:37.340]   That's why you're carrying four batteries in your pair and in your blender.
[01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:39.100]   These fish, by the way, I can feed the fish.
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:40.660]   Let me just show you here.
[01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:41.660]   If I remove...
[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:42.660]   I can feed the fish.
[01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:43.660]   I can feed.
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:46.260]   If I just tap up here, the fish food comes down from the sky.
[01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:48.740]   Yeah, this is the future of technology.
[01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:53.060]   I actually have a column about this.
[01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:57.740]   If you'll refer to my June 4th column on MarketWatch, see the...
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:59.820]   It had to do with wasting time.
[01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:04.100]   The fact that people don't use computers for productivity anymore, they use them to
[01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:05.740]   kill time with this idiotic...
[01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:06.740]   I'm productive.
[01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:07.740]   I can feed the fish.
[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:08.740]   Yeah.
[01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:11.740]   Look at how good that looks on the overhead.
[01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:13.740]   Oh, it's stunning.
[01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:14.740]   It's ridiculous.
[01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:16.860]   It's such a good display.
[01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:17.860]   I don't mean...
[01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:18.860]   This is why this...
[01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:24.220]   The FCC is looking into these brain cancer tumors because there's all this heat and
[01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:25.220]   processor power being...
[01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:26.580]   No, that's actually a good story.
[01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:32.300]   Junilis Genakowski, the chairman of the FCC, has asked that they re-examine the rules about
[01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:34.540]   how much radiation is considered safe.
[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:37.340]   Of course, now all the commissioners have to approve...
[01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:40.140]   Not all, but they have to have a majority of commissioners have to approve this before
[01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:41.340]   they re-examine these rules.
[01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:42.340]   Do you think...
[01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:44.940]   Does anybody think that really these are dangerous?
[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:49.060]   No, on this Father's Day, I'm just worried about our collective testicles.
[01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:52.220]   It depends on where you hold the phone.
[01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:53.780]   I've never put the phone down there.
[01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:54.780]   I got to tell you.
[01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:57.220]   I need to say my pocket non-stop, right?
[01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:58.220]   I mean, that's where...
[01:16:58.220 --> 01:16:59.220]   Oh, I guess you're right.
[01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:00.220]   Do you have a front of the pocket?
[01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:01.220]   Yeah, I wish to...
[01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:02.220]   So you wouldn't put it in your back pocket.
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:03.220]   Wait.
[01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:04.220]   It's a whole other issue.
[01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:09.380]   But you realize, first of all, this is nothing but grandstanding by somebody in a bureaucracy
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:13.140]   who wants to look like they're doing something about a problem that doesn't exist.
[01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:14.140]   Essentially, if you...
[01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:17.900]   There's a fantastic article on Skeptoid.com talking about this.
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:24.460]   The World Health Organization has examined 25,000 studies and concluded that none of
[01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:28.860]   them imply that there's any cancer risk whatsoever from...
[01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:32.740]   Or there's no conclusive evidence that there's a cancer risk from cell phones.
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:36.860]   Essentially, you got to realize that you got this bandwidth spectrum of different types
[01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:37.860]   of radiation.
[01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:39.940]   At the very low end, you got your radio waves.
[01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:44.660]   And at the very high end, you've got your ultraviolet, your X-rays, and beyond.
[01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:47.980]   And in the middle, you've got the visible spectrum of light.
[01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:52.220]   That tends to be the dividing line of where there's enough energy to start knocking out
[01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:56.860]   electrons and physically start altering the chemistry and screwing up your cells.
[01:17:56.860 --> 01:18:02.540]   Everything below visible light, including microwave radiation, is non-ionizing radiation
[01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:05.700]   and it just doesn't have the juice to affect anyone.
[01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:10.900]   And here's the worst part is even if it did, even if you could show that there was a 1%
[01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:15.900]   increase in brain tumors or whatever, which you can't, the fact is it's still worth it
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:19.500]   for the trade-off of everything these smartphone devices do for us.
[01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:24.660]   It's driving me nuts to see how terrified we are of a technology that brings us so much
[01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:25.660]   value.
[01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:27.820]   And I don't understand why they want to demonize it.
[01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:28.820]   Yes, see, I got away.
[01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:29.820]   That was a long way to go.
[01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:32.820]   A treasure chest that opens up when the bubbles...
[01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:34.820]   Yes, we were just saying to him where we're...
[01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:35.820]   There it is.
[01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:36.820]   It is.
[01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:37.820]   It is.
[01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:38.820]   It's a little treasure chest there.
[01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:39.820]   Can you go over that again?
[01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:40.820]   And then...
[01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:41.820]   What was that you said?
[01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:42.820]   You can see the light's filtering.
[01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:43.820]   I was saying your cell phones are fine.
[01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:44.820]   Oh, okay.
[01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:45.820]   It's filtering down from the top.
[01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:47.300]   See, we're feeding the fish.
[01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:48.300]   Never mind.
[01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:49.300]   The treasure chest is open.
[01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:50.300]   Our geese has already gotten a Leo.
[01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:51.300]   And then the bubbles come up.
[01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:52.300]   It's really good.
[01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:53.300]   It's really fantastic.
[01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:54.300]   [laughter]
[01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:56.500]   No, I agree with you.
[01:18:56.500 --> 01:19:00.820]   But it's funny how persistent this issue is of, gosh, is it okay?
[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:03.100]   Because I'll tell you, Brian, you may say that.
[01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:04.100]   And it may even be true.
[01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:05.100]   I don't know.
[01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:06.100]   I didn't understand it.
[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:07.100]   But I...
[01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:08.100]   We don't know what you were talking about.
[01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:09.700]   I do think that's really persistent.
[01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:13.260]   The people are worried because they come to me all the time saying, but is it okay that
[01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:16.300]   I'm holding this radio transmitter to my head all the time?
[01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:17.300]   Yeah.
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:18.300]   And the problem is if it does...
[01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:19.300]   Down the go-on speaker phone that we find...
[01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:22.660]   If it does kill people, we may not know for a few more years, right?
[01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:23.980]   This is fairly new.
[01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:25.300]   What if it takes 20 years?
[01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:27.860]   Then it's natural selection.
[01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:30.220]   This is the problem with all of our intuitions.
[01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:31.220]   We're all stupid.
[01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:32.220]   Well, that's true.
[01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:33.820]   And it's important to remember this.
[01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:37.660]   And it's important that you not rely on what your gut tells you, but it's important that
[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:40.020]   you look at the numbers, you look at the statistics.
[01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:42.300]   Statistically, there's no increase in cancer.
[01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:46.780]   From a scientific standpoint, non-ionizing radiation can't physically harm you.
[01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:48.500]   They've not been able to show it in any way.
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:52.620]   The most it can do, if you do want to look for an effect, look for the fact of your putting
[01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:56.500]   a device that's warm to a part of your body that traditionally doesn't get warmed up
[01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:57.500]   all the time.
[01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:58.500]   And that's about it.
[01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:00.540]   That's about all you should be looking at.
[01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:04.260]   And by the way, I'm writing a new book just for you, Clayton Morris, called Artesticals
[01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:05.260]   Ourselves.
[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:10.500]   And it'll be for the sensitive male in all of us.
[01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:11.500]   And on that...
[01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:13.500]   You want to get that on Audible.
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:18.180]   So by your logic, Brian, does that mean we can stand in front of a high intensity radar
[01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:19.940]   installation of the military users?
[01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:20.940]   No, because that's...
[01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:21.940]   And you stand there.
[01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:22.940]   And that's ionizing.
[01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:23.940]   No, it's a radio.
[01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:24.940]   It's not...
[01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:25.940]   It's non-ionizing.
[01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:26.940]   It's very powerful.
[01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:27.940]   So, but here's the other thing.
[01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:28.940]   And people are pointing out...
[01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:30.340]   Ionizing is radiation.
[01:20:30.340 --> 01:20:35.740]   Right now, I'm already getting tweets saying, "Oh, WHO says, 'Could be possible,' whatever."
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:41.180]   They classified it in their lowest tier of possible causes for cancer where they also
[01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:44.260]   put coffee and carpentry as an occupation.
[01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:48.260]   So if that is terrifying to you, along with pickled vegetables...
[01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:51.540]   I'm talking about standing in front of a radar installation.
[01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:53.300]   But your logic is okay.
[01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:56.340]   Yes, because the science bears it out.
[01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:57.460]   I trust the numbers.
[01:20:57.460 --> 01:20:59.140]   I trust the scientific method.
[01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:01.940]   I trust double flying testing.
[01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:05.620]   Okay, jeez.
[01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:06.620]   Less coffee.
[01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:09.060]   Leo, will the book be a pop-out book?
[01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:10.340]   Yeah, well, I was thinking.
[01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:12.820]   Or it could be one of those books where they have a hole in it and you put your finger in
[01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:13.820]   it.
[01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:16.100]   I haven't decided.
[01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:17.100]   Maybe both.
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:18.100]   Yes, like the old joke.
[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:20.300]   Checking for bees is the punchline.
[01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:21.940]   So anyway, go on.
[01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:23.100]   What were you talking about?
[01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:25.780]   Lady Indians ride side saddle.
[01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:27.460]   No, they were a bearback.
[01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:28.460]   Thank you.
[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:29.460]   Yes.
[01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:31.460]   That's the punchline to that.
[01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:32.660]   Oh, Lord.
[01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:34.860]   Oh, that's right.
[01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:35.860]   That's the prostate book.
[01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:36.860]   I'm sorry.
[01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:37.860]   That's later.
[01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:38.860]   That's book two.
[01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:41.020]   You've had two books, Brian.
[01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:42.460]   It turns out the two is better than one.
[01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:44.020]   It just makes a lot of money next thing.
[01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:45.500]   He's lording it over everyone.
[01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:46.500]   Yeah.
[01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:49.860]   Can I tell you about Ford Motor Company?
[01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:52.260]   So I saw one of those focus titanium's on the road.
[01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:53.260]   That's a cool little car.
[01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:56.580]   Man, they're owning this space.
[01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:58.020]   Is the titanium an electric one?
[01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:01.420]   No, no, that's the focus that's loaded to the gills with all the technology and the
[01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:02.420]   big wheels.
[01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:03.420]   Oh, man.
[01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:04.420]   You blast around town.
[01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:05.420]   I want one of those.
[01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:09.020]   Actually, I'm very excited about the 2012 Ford Focus Electric.
[01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:12.940]   And you know, it's kind of cool because they have a mobile app for the car.
[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:14.700]   When you get the car, you get the mobile app.
[01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:15.700]   Thank you.
[01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:20.300]   Right now to your Ford, you have to go to an EV certified Ford dealer.
[01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:24.820]   Bring your smartphone because then you can test drive it on the Android.
[01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:27.340]   They have an Android, they have BlackBerry, and they have iPhone.
[01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:28.340]   That's interesting.
[01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:30.620]   I don't know why they don't have Windows Phone because a lot of this is actually powered
[01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:31.620]   by Microsoft.
[01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:32.620]   It's kind of curious.
[01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:35.740]   They actually demoed that app on a Windows phone at CES.
[01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:40.700]   I think it was in 2011, but yet they don't actually have the app on Windows Phone available
[01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:41.700]   yet.
[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:42.700]   So it's very curious.
[01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:45.540]   Maybe it's just a small market that I don't know.
[01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:46.540]   It's totally possible.
[01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:48.380]   Yeah, they just didn't bother.
[01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:49.380]   No, Symbian?
[01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:52.260]   No, they passed on Symbian.
[01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:55.420]   Anyway, I could go on and on, but I won't.
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:59.700]   Let's just point out that what this thing will do, for instance, is, okay, well, here's
[01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:01.620]   I'll give you an example.
[01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:04.580]   When you drive a gas vehicle, a lot of the heat comes from the engine, right?
[01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:08.340]   But electric vehicle, you got to use the power and the battery to heat or cool.
[01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:13.660]   So one of the things you can do with the Ford mobile app is set the temperature, the cabin
[01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:17.780]   temperature in your car, while it's still plugged in, you precondition it and you can
[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:18.820]   even set it for the time.
[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:21.820]   Like if you leave every morning at nine, you could say, have that car be 72 degrees
[01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:22.740]   and ready to go.
[01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:24.860]   I think it would do or the phone could catch on fire.
[01:23:24.860 --> 01:23:25.860]   That would warm.
[01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:27.580]   Yeah, I don't think we want that.
[01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:30.180]   You can also use their value charging feature.
[01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:32.300]   This is another Microsoft feature.
[01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:40.060]   The utilities send the data about their prices to the app and the app then picks the best
[01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:42.900]   time to charge based on cost.
[01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:45.780]   You always charge at the lowest cost.
[01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:47.780]   You can see what your current state of charge is.
[01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:49.220]   You can program when the charge will be.
[01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:50.660]   You could find, look at this.
[01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:52.980]   This shows you where charging stations are.
[01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:55.220]   You can even plan the most eco-friendly route.
[01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:57.220]   And then they also have done a gamification.
[01:23:57.220 --> 01:23:59.060]   Is it gamification or gamification?
[01:23:59.060 --> 01:24:00.060]   Gamification.
[01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:05.140]   Gamification would be like something to do with legs or gamirate, gamirate, gamirate,
[01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:06.140]   gamification.
[01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:11.500]   They have a leaderboard online, the my Ford mobile website on who saved the most CO2.
[01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:14.300]   I'm just going to make John throw a brother.
[01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:16.300]   I love it.
[01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:18.580]   It's the kind of thing I'm going to do.
[01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:19.580]   You'll feel good driving.
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:20.580]   It is the kind of thing you're going to do.
[01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:21.420]   It's totally the kind of thing.
[01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:23.500]   I want to be number one on saving CO2.
[01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:25.020]   I'm going to drive the car.
[01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:26.340]   Is it more or less?
[01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:29.500]   I'll tell you, it's going to probably be a lot of, it's going to calculate a lot of
[01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:30.500]   hot air.
[01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:32.180]   I got that.
[01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:35.500]   Go to Ford's website, Ford.com/technology.
[01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:39.420]   Find out more about the great 2012 Ford Focus Electric available now.
[01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:45.060]   Coming in 2013, the plug-in hybrid, the Ford Fusion Energy, I think I'm going to get that
[01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:46.740]   one because I get a little extra range.
[01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:52.460]   Both of these vehicles, just beautiful, elegant, titanium sounds kind of cool too.
[01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:53.460]   It's a high run.
[01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:54.740]   They drive pretty well.
[01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:55.740]   They drive nicely.
[01:24:55.740 --> 01:24:56.740]   Yeah, they're nice cars.
[01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:57.740]   Yeah, the electric drives really well.
[01:24:57.740 --> 01:24:58.740]   Yeah.
[01:24:58.740 --> 01:25:00.500]   Well, you got to drive the electric?
[01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:01.500]   I did, yes.
[01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:04.100]   But you have it for a while as long as you have it for?
[01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:05.740]   Always just a different drive.
[01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:07.500]   You just get to take it for a week or something.
[01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:09.300]   No, unfortunately not yet.
[01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:12.140]   I'm on the list to buy one.
[01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:13.500]   But now I'm thinking I might wait up for that.
[01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:14.500]   I don't know.
[01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:15.500]   I want them all.
[01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:16.980]   How many cars do you need?
[01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:17.980]   Not many.
[01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:18.980]   You've got a hot Mustang.
[01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:20.540]   I'm a block from, I live for you.
[01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:22.580]   And you walk, you can walk to the office.
[01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:23.580]   I walk to the office.
[01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:26.540]   Hey, but if I got some of that Yammer money, can you believe this?
[01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:28.380]   Okay, so Instagram sells for a billion.
[01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:33.380]   So Microsoft buys Yammer for one and a quarter billion dollars.
[01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:38.300]   This is basically a Twitter clone for enterprise, enterprise social media.
[01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:41.580]   No, I wrote a market watch column about this particular deal.
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:43.300]   Do you think this is a sensible deal?
[01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:46.660]   No, no, Microsoft has products like this already just as they did with Skype.
[01:25:46.660 --> 01:25:51.540]   I think it's an insult to the programmers that work at Microsoft.
[01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:53.020]   This was a make-by decision.
[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:54.020]   I agree.
[01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:55.020]   They should have been able to make it.
[01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:56.020]   But they had already made it.
[01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:57.740]   Well, then they asked, sure, they could have repurposed it.
[01:25:57.740 --> 01:25:59.980]   They have stuff in SharePoint that does exactly the same thing.
[01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:02.180]   I think this is just a bad thing.
[01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:06.140]   I think it's a bad signal for people who are investors in Microsoft.
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:08.660]   Yeah, it's a market watch.
[01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:10.500]   We used Yammer for a while.
[01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:11.500]   Really?
[01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:16.140]   And it just got to be to the point where there's more noise, you know, and we couldn't manage
[01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:17.140]   it very effectively.
[01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:19.220]   We couldn't set the policies very effectively on it.
[01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:20.220]   And we moved away from it.
[01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:21.220]   How interesting.
[01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:22.220]   Basically.
[01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:24.020]   There are other solutions out there too.
[01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:26.340]   But Microsoft has some pretty compelling solutions already.
[01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:30.780]   I'm not sure I really understand why they spent a billion and a quarter.
[01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:33.980]   The user ability of the event is tomorrow that we're going to show up there.
[01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:35.980]   They're going to say, hey, we buy Yammer.
[01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:40.380]   Now, do you think, okay, how credible you said, John, that they're going to buy Nokia?
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:41.380]   How credible is that?
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:42.380]   Why would they buy Nokia?
[01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:44.540]   So they could be a standalone phone company?
[01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:49.900]   Well, I believe that's a possibility because I think they want to do the Apple thing, obviously.
[01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:50.900]   Make their own.
[01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:55.780]   But I think they made a deal somewhere along the line to get Nokia to commit to their
[01:26:55.780 --> 01:26:58.220]   whole scheme.
[01:26:58.220 --> 01:26:59.380]   And Nokia did.
[01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:02.660]   And the fallback is, you know, if you do fail, we'll buy you out.
[01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:03.660]   We'll buy you out.
[01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:04.660]   We'll buy you out.
[01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:05.660]   And they are failing.
[01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:08.260]   And Nokia is down to, like, what, two bucks a share?
[01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:09.700]   It's like dirt cheap.
[01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:10.700]   Yeah.
[01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:13.260]   It would be heading to 50 cents.
[01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:16.500]   Was I supposed to have heard of Yammer before this?
[01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:17.900]   Yes, you should have.
[01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:19.580]   No, that's the funny thing.
[01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:20.580]   Nobody ever heard.
[01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:25.140]   Actually, the other reason I've heard of it, Tech Crunch, they won a Tech Crunch crunchy,
[01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:26.140]   you know, they were the number one.
[01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:27.140]   Crunchy.
[01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:28.140]   They won.
[01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:29.140]   I don't know what the thing was.
[01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:32.180]   But they won a couple of years ago, they were the big pick for the Tech Crunch.
[01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:33.180]   Yeah.
[01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:34.180]   This wasn't disruptive.
[01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:35.180]   The other Tech Crunch.
[01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:36.180]   The only reason I know it was it.
[01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:40.740]   It's like, I could almost justify the expense if you're buying a name and a brand that would
[01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:41.740]   be of extreme value.
[01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:43.060]   But it doesn't sound like that's the case.
[01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:45.740]   It sounds like it's technology that they easily could have duplicated.
[01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:48.980]   Well, let me ask the chatroom because maybe it's an enterprise brand.
[01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:51.700]   Is it a well-known enterprise brand chatroom?
[01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:52.700]   You've heard of it?
[01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:53.700]   All right.
[01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:55.780]   No, you've not heard of it.
[01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:57.220]   Some people have heard of it.
[01:27:57.220 --> 01:27:58.220]   Facebook for business.
[01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:03.300]   I mean, according to, I mean, according to reports, I mean, there's over 200,000 companies
[01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:04.300]   using it, including.
[01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:05.300]   Right.
[01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:07.380]   Your last sponsor, Ford using it.
[01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:08.380]   And eBay.
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:09.380]   So I don't know.
[01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:10.380]   I've never used it.
[01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:12.260]   It's essentially, it's Facebook.
[01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:15.700]   It's like it's an intranet, the next generation intranet.
[01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:16.700]   Right.
[01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:21.540]   For people who apparently, you know, I guess Microsoft can't code something like this,
[01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:23.380]   or it's prettier than Microsoft can do.
[01:28:23.380 --> 01:28:25.140]   I'm not absolutely sure why they bought it.
[01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:28.620]   It makes zero sense to me.
[01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:31.540]   Or they may have done it for the customer base.
[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:33.940]   They do get the 200,000 corporations that have.
[01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:34.940]   That's a large number.
[01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:38.500]   And which- I got to wonder how many of them are though, like AOL, which said, well, we'll
[01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:39.500]   try it.
[01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:40.500]   And then, eh.
[01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:41.500]   It gets bigger.
[01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:42.500]   That's, I think, is a big problem.
[01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:46.740]   And so they paid $5,000 per corporation for the product.
[01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:51.220]   And which means you have to have, I think I did this calculation, X number, you have
[01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:56.740]   to have 166 people in each one of these corporations to make it worth their while in terms of the
[01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:59.860]   $30 a head, which is typically what people might buy.
[01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:03.140]   One problem with the hammer, and I bet this is what you were talking about, Tim.
[01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:08.460]   One of our chatters said, the only problem is you can't screen people out because it's
[01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:09.460]   your company.
[01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:10.900]   It's people at your company.
[01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:15.500]   You can't say, I'm not going to friend you, Ariana, because you keep talking about your
[01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:16.500]   dogs.
[01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:18.900]   It's been a while since we decided to move away from it.
[01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:22.900]   But as of about a year ago, it was very difficult to actually go in and manage users and say,
[01:29:22.900 --> 01:29:27.020]   you can't see this discussion or you can't sign in anymore because you're no longer working
[01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:28.020]   with us.
[01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:29.500]   It was impossible to do it at that point.
[01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:32.540]   So that was one of the many reasons that we decided to just move away from it.
[01:29:32.540 --> 01:29:38.540]   Microsoft has a Skype product that's similar to Skype, but also has some chatting features.
[01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:39.540]   Right?
[01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:41.100]   Link is link the same.
[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:42.940]   I mean, it just feels like they had this.
[01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:45.740]   >> I think you've had it very easily.
[01:29:45.740 --> 01:29:47.460]   There's nothing that exciting going on.
[01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:49.500]   You never from a technology standpoint.
[01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:52.340]   So certainly, if you're talking about versus build, I don't see why they don't have the
[01:29:52.340 --> 01:29:54.540]   engineers to build it themselves.
[01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:55.540]   >> Wow.
[01:29:55.540 --> 01:30:00.100]   >> 15 indie developers reimagine Pong for iOS.
[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:01.900]   Pong.
[01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:02.900]   >> Who's the winner?
[01:30:02.900 --> 01:30:05.900]   >> I just like the headline.
[01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:06.900]   15.
[01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:09.180]   They're hoping to win an Atari contract.
[01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:10.180]   It's a 15.
[01:30:10.180 --> 01:30:13.980]   >> It's the Pong indie developer challenge.
[01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:15.420]   They had 90 submissions.
[01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:19.260]   They've paired it down to 15.
[01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:20.420]   I like that.
[01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:21.420]   I don't know why.
[01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:25.900]   >> Do you remember, you probably never saw this, but back in early, like I must have
[01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:31.820]   been late 1993, early 1994, somebody put together Pong combat.
[01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:38.780]   It was Mortal Kombat where you played Pong, but then you could go up, up, down, up, down,
[01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:40.780]   up, down, left and you would throw a fireball.
[01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:42.780]   >> I like that.
[01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:43.780]   >> Yeah.
[01:30:43.780 --> 01:30:45.220]   >> They had Pong with kill moves.
[01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:46.220]   >> Yes, exactly.
[01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:47.220]   >> Just for your name.
[01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:49.220]   >> There are those with fatalities you can do at the end.
[01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:50.220]   >> Fertility.
[01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:51.220]   >> Fertility.
[01:30:51.220 --> 01:30:52.220]   >> Pook.
[01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:54.180]   >> Yeah, those are the games I end up buying.
[01:30:54.180 --> 01:30:57.100]   I think because our generation grew up with these great, you know--
[01:30:57.100 --> 01:30:58.100]   >> You want to see them again?
[01:30:58.100 --> 01:30:59.100]   >> Yeah.
[01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:00.100]   >> Right.
[01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:01.100]   I mean, I think the--
[01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:02.100]   >> The finish.
[01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:07.460]   >> I'm more on iOS or anywhere else on my Mac or whatever is these sort of classic games,
[01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:09.260]   like Bard's Tale now at a real home.
[01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:10.260]   >> That's a great game.
[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:11.260]   >> The Apple Store.
[01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:12.260]   >> That's fun because it's funny.
[01:31:12.260 --> 01:31:13.260]   >> Right.
[01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:15.340]   You know, I want stronghold.
[01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:17.460]   I want stronghold on my iPad.
[01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:19.700]   Although they just were-- and I want Firefly Studios.
[01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:21.140]   I put this call out so many times.
[01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:22.140]   I've tweeted them.
[01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:26.820]   Look, if there's one game that should be built on the iPad, it is stronghold.
[01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:30.100]   Build castles, defend-- but the original stronghold, the awesome, awesome game.
[01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:31.100]   >> I think that's the only one.
[01:31:31.100 --> 01:31:33.260]   Let's have Missile Command where you had the blue up, these things that are coming in.
[01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:34.260]   What was that game?
[01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:35.260]   >> Missile Command.
[01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:36.260]   >> Yeah, Missile Command.
[01:31:36.260 --> 01:31:37.260]   >> Yeah, that was on the Apple II.
[01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:38.900]   That would be perfect for an iPad.
[01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:41.460]   >> I think there is an actual Missile Command on it.
[01:31:41.460 --> 01:31:42.460]   >> Yeah, it's all iPad.
[01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:45.100]   >> There's a Tari arcade on the iPad that has Missile Command.
[01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:46.100]   >> Oh, it's got all that kind of stuff.
[01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:47.100]   >> And it's very true to the original.
[01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:48.100]   >> Missile--
[01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:49.100]   >> It's crap.
[01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:50.100]   >> It's crap.
[01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:51.100]   >> Yeah.
[01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:52.100]   >> Fantastic.
[01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:53.100]   >> That's a great point.
[01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:54.540]   But there is this nostalgia thing.
[01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:57.700]   And this is because your regeneration is starting to grow up, Clayton.
[01:31:57.700 --> 01:32:03.780]   My generation, we didn't have this crap, you know, but we had s'mores over a campfire.
[01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:05.540]   We had Dick Van Dyke.
[01:32:05.540 --> 01:32:10.100]   But you, you grew up with games and so you kind of have this nostalgia, like for Mario,
[01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:11.100]   right?
[01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:13.260]   I don't get the Mario thing, but you guys love Mario.
[01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:16.420]   >> Here, and I said this right after E3.
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:19.620]   I thought, look, Nintendo's hurting, right?
[01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:21.460]   As evidenced by the Wii U.
[01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:27.820]   >> If there's one thing that I think Nintendo could do is put Mario, put their whole lineup
[01:32:27.820 --> 01:32:31.660]   of NES games out for Android and iOS.
[01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:35.540]   I mean, I would play those-- I would play Kid Icarus all night.
[01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:37.100]   My wife would have to yell at me nonstop.
[01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:41.060]   I would play those games for hours if I could get-- I would play Super Mario Brothers on
[01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:43.020]   it, you know, on these devices for hours.
[01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:45.020]   But, Metroid, you name it.
[01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:46.020]   But they're so--
[01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:47.020]   >> What you're saying, saying it, please?
[01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:49.900]   >> They would make a billion dollars overnight if they did that too.
[01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:50.900]   They'd be a huge money maker.
[01:32:50.900 --> 01:32:53.740]   Right now, they're struggling to make money as they're investing into Wii U and there's
[01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:55.980]   a lot of downs that the Wii U is going to be successful.
[01:32:55.980 --> 01:32:57.860]   And they have no playing at all for the mobile front.
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:32:59.980]   At least none of they're willing to tell anybody.
[01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:01.420]   They could do that pretty much overnight.
[01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:04.260]   They could bring in developers to port those things, have them in the--
[01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:07.260]   >> You mean, get out of hardware entirely and just do iOS games?
[01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:08.260]   >> Say, guys.
[01:33:08.260 --> 01:33:09.260]   >> Surely.
[01:33:09.260 --> 01:33:11.220]   I mean, this could be an augment to their hardware business.
[01:33:11.220 --> 01:33:12.220]   >> Yeah, they--
[01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:13.220]   >> What are they now?
[01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:14.580]   >> They always said, you know, we don't want to make hardware.
[01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:17.980]   We want to make great games and maybe it is time for them to get out of the hardware business.
[01:33:17.980 --> 01:33:21.900]   >> They had Sonic, they had a few big titles, but Nintendo has--
[01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:24.380]   >> The Dreamcast was a killer product.
[01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:25.380]   >> It was.
[01:33:25.380 --> 01:33:26.380]   >> It was.
[01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:29.820]   >> And the guy on a whim, the CEO, we're out, we're done.
[01:33:29.820 --> 01:33:31.220]   >> No, no, no, it wasn't on a whim.
[01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:35.300]   It was because they had made too many products and too short of a time because the years
[01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:39.500]   leading up to the Sega Dreamcast, Sega Dreamcast gets a bad rap because before that you had
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:43.100]   Sega CD, was it the SGX, is that what it was?
[01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:44.100]   You had the--
[01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:45.100]   >> Sega Saturn was the one for us.
[01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:46.100]   >> The Saturn was the bad one.
[01:33:46.100 --> 01:33:50.060]   They were coming out with something new and then finally when the Dreamcast came out, they
[01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:53.700]   just didn't have the capital, even though everybody loved it and then it was way ahead
[01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:54.700]   of its time.
[01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:56.220]   >> Yeah, that was the big problem.
[01:33:56.220 --> 01:34:00.100]   It was internet-based and that was really before there was much of an internet to go
[01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:01.100]   to really.
[01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:02.540]   It was definitely ahead of its time.
[01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:03.740]   It was launched early.
[01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:04.740]   It was a great console.
[01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:09.140]   I mean, I did my college thesis writing games for the VMU, which was that tiny little Game Boy
[01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:10.660]   thing you could plug into the intro.
[01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:15.580]   I love the Dreamcast, but yeah, sadly, that was the end of the road for Sega.
[01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:16.580]   >> Wow.
[01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:17.580]   I'm getting sad now.
[01:34:17.580 --> 01:34:18.580]   >> I'm getting sad now.
[01:34:18.580 --> 01:34:19.580]   >> I'm getting sad.
[01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:21.580]   I want to talk about Vizio in a second.
[01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:25.740]   A very interesting article, Ninh Ly Patel wrote for the Virgy.
[01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:28.980]   He visited Vizio and Vizio is coming out.
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:29.980]   I'm sure you've seen these, Tim.
[01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:35.100]   I haven't seen him yet with an all-in-one computer and some pretty compelling looking laptops
[01:34:35.100 --> 01:34:41.180]   and some very interesting philosophies, including no crap and no stickers.
[01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:42.180]   >> No crap.
[01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:43.180]   >> I know.
[01:34:43.180 --> 01:34:44.180]   >> No stickers.
[01:34:44.180 --> 01:34:45.180]   >> It's unheard of.
[01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:46.980]   >> No computer without crap and stickers.
[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:50.700]   >> We'll find out how they're crap-tizing to their light bulbs at this so that they'd
[01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:51.700]   be making.
[01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:52.700]   Last year, that was their big first.
[01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:53.700]   They're going to make light bulbs.
[01:34:53.700 --> 01:34:54.700]   >> Oh, really?
[01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:55.700]   I guess they dropped that.
[01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:56.700]   >> Yeah.
[01:34:56.700 --> 01:35:01.300]   I remember seeing them at the, like, CVA in New York and they had the home sort of these
[01:35:01.300 --> 01:35:02.300]   light bulbs.
[01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:04.500]   I think they didn't have like speakers built in or something.
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:05.500]   >> Yeah.
[01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:06.940]   Hey, we've got this great new thing.
[01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:07.940]   We're going to this new market.
[01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:08.940]   It's going to be amazing.
[01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:10.860]   It sounded almost like this Microsoft thing.
[01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:11.860]   Hey, we've got this great event.
[01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:12.860]   We're not going to tell you anything about it.
[01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:13.860]   You've got to come see it.
[01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:14.860]   >> It's light bulbs.
[01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:18.660]   >> Yeah, it was sort of like what Google announced with that home automation stuff.
[01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:22.260]   You have like a light bulb that talks to you and stuff like that.
[01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:23.260]   You're like, "Really?"
[01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:28.460]   >> So that they pivoted apparently and they decided the PC is really where it's at.
[01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:29.460]   >> In the right direction.
[01:35:29.460 --> 01:35:30.460]   >> Yeah.
[01:35:30.460 --> 01:35:31.460]   Good pivot.
[01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:33.980]   Well, we'll talk about that in a second, but I want to mention it quickly.
[01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:34.980]   FreshBooks.com.
[01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:41.100]   The easy, really easy to use online invoicing app for small businesses, you know, but really
[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:43.420]   was always a problem for me making my own invoices.
[01:35:43.420 --> 01:35:47.220]   I had, you know, I had it set up to make it as easy as possible, but I just, it was
[01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:50.980]   such a pain I would put it off and then I wouldn't get paid.
[01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:55.940]   Then Amber MacArthur in 2004, I remember this very well, told me about freshbooks.com.
[01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:56.940]   It's online.
[01:35:56.940 --> 01:36:00.020]   It's one of the first web 2.0 sites.
[01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:03.940]   Makes it really easy to create invoices, email them.
[01:36:03.940 --> 01:36:07.020]   The clients can view invoices and pay you right on the spot with a credit card, which
[01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:08.020]   is fantastic.
[01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:10.540]   It turns out it's not the clients don't want to pay you.
[01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:14.300]   It's just as much of a pain for them to go through all of that as it was for you to create
[01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:15.300]   the invoice.
[01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:16.300]   Make it easy for them.
[01:36:16.300 --> 01:36:17.300]   They're going to pay you.
[01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:21.180]   If you do time and hours, billable hours, you could turn time sheets instantly into invoices.
[01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:22.580]   All sorts of great reports.
[01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:24.100]   In fact, come tax time.
[01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:25.980]   It couldn't be easier if you've been using freshbooks.
[01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:28.700]   Your accountant will absolutely love you.
[01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:31.980]   And if you do have the clients that are a little slow to pay, they can have automated
[01:36:31.980 --> 01:36:33.700]   late payment reminders.
[01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:37.020]   You set the date, you know, 30, 60, 90.
[01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:40.660]   And for a small fee, freshbooks will even print and mail physical invoices.
[01:36:40.660 --> 01:36:45.100]   There are a few clients that like that paper complete with a return envelope.
[01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:47.780]   iPhone app will track your time and hours as well as their web based.
[01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:48.900]   I want you to try it free.
[01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:49.900]   You sign up right now.
[01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:54.140]   You'll get 30 days of unlimited use, everything, all the features, as many clients as you want,
[01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:56.660]   as much staff, everything, no limits.
[01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:58.100]   You just go to freshbooks.com.
[01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:00.540]   If they ask you, I think there's one point in the sign up and say, "Where did you hear
[01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:01.540]   about it?"
[01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:02.980]   Mention to it.
[01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:05.260]   And we'll get a little credit for that.
[01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:07.860]   30 days free of the best invoicing service out there.
[01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:12.620]   Which since I started using it in 2004, 3.5 million people have.
[01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:15.340]   And I'll tell you, freshbooks has been a great experience.
[01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:17.380]   I'm sure you will love it.
[01:37:17.380 --> 01:37:18.380]   Freshbooks.com.
[01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:27.340]   So according to Mike McCray, who's the CTO at Visio, you know, we've all seen Visio in
[01:37:27.340 --> 01:37:28.660]   the big box stores or Walmart.
[01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:30.620]   They were the kind of second tier TV stuff.
[01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:32.980]   It was really good TVs, very good price.
[01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:35.140]   I've always liked the Visio TVs.
[01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:42.780]   We've announced PCs and he said it was really hard to convince Intel and Microsoft not to
[01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:43.780]   put stickers.
[01:37:43.780 --> 01:37:49.460]   He says, "I really hate opening a PC and stealing stickers and flashing LEDs all over the place."
[01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:55.100]   They also forego the crap where that most PC manufacturers put on there because they
[01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:56.500]   make some money.
[01:37:56.500 --> 01:37:58.340]   So you don't have all, I think this sounds great.
[01:37:58.340 --> 01:38:01.740]   And I haven't, have you guys, anybody received any of these Visios yet?
[01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:02.740]   They look gorgeous.
[01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:03.740]   What do you think?
[01:38:03.740 --> 01:38:07.420]   We have in our studios the other day and they look, they are beautiful.
[01:38:07.420 --> 01:38:10.180]   I mean, look, it's like you're looking at MacBook.
[01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:11.180]   Yeah.
[01:38:11.180 --> 01:38:14.540]   Let's be honest, it's like you're looking right at a MacBook Air.
[01:38:14.540 --> 01:38:18.260]   The only one that's really, really stunning and that, you know, it's a really compelling
[01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:19.580]   desktop look.
[01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:22.060]   There were complaints early on about the keyboard.
[01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:26.180]   They did swap that out and tried something else.
[01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:28.500]   I haven't gotten to play with it.
[01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:32.180]   The laptops look cool, although I think all of the UltraBooks kind of look like MacBook
[01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:33.180]   Airs to me.
[01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:35.460]   I mean, is that bad?
[01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:37.500]   Well, no, the Air is exactly that.
[01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:40.220]   When you get down to that size, you don't have much of a choice in design.
[01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:41.220]   Yeah, yes, that's true.
[01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:45.740]   But you don't have to do, I mean, it's unibody, aluminum, it's wedge-shaped.
[01:38:45.740 --> 01:38:46.900]   I mean, there's some choice.
[01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:49.700]   You don't have to make it look exactly like a MacBook Air.
[01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:52.700]   Well, I thought was really, really interesting about Neelai's piece.
[01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:56.020]   And by the way, congratulations Neelai, who just got married today.
[01:38:56.020 --> 01:38:57.940]   This week, yeah.
[01:38:57.940 --> 01:38:59.940]   So it was a really good piece.
[01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:03.900]   And I thought it was interesting about it more than anything else was the amount of people,
[01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:07.420]   at least, I think separate from the piece, but who just do Google searches to find out
[01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:08.860]   where Visio was made.
[01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:12.100]   Because everyone assumes it's a foreign company.
[01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:13.100]   And it's not.
[01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:18.660]   Well, he says that, but we should point out it's made in China like everything else.
[01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:20.700]   It's just that the people who designed--
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:21.700]   The marketing people.
[01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:25.460]   And most of the employees are in the air in Irvine.
[01:39:25.460 --> 01:39:26.460]   True.
[01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:27.540]   So you have 400 employees.
[01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:28.540]   I think the point--
[01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:29.540]   Right.
[01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:30.540]   It's a US company.
[01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:31.700]   It's a US company.
[01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:33.420]   But I don't think a lot of people knew that.
[01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:37.020]   No, nobody knows that, I think.
[01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:40.140]   What do you think, Tim, have you played with the new Visios?
[01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:41.180]   I haven't had a chance to get.
[01:39:41.180 --> 01:39:45.500]   I was out in San Francisco for WWDC during the announcement.
[01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:47.140]   So no, I didn't get to see them myself.
[01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:49.780]   But the impressions-- we had Sarah Silver to go out and check them out.
[01:39:49.780 --> 01:39:51.420]   And she said they were looking fantastic.
[01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:54.380]   So one question I have is about durability.
[01:39:54.380 --> 01:39:57.100]   Apple's had issues when they first introduced the air.
[01:39:57.100 --> 01:39:58.900]   They had a lot of liability problems.
[01:39:58.900 --> 01:40:01.180]   This is a big first step for Visio.
[01:40:01.180 --> 01:40:03.340]   I don't want to be down on the brand.
[01:40:03.340 --> 01:40:04.340]   It's a great first step.
[01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:05.340]   They look fantastic.
[01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:06.980]   But we'll see how they hold us.
[01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:07.980]   It's more than just looks.
[01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:09.420]   I agree with you on a percent.
[01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:10.420]   And in fact--
[01:40:10.420 --> 01:40:11.420]   Well, it's distribution.
[01:40:11.420 --> 01:40:12.420]   I mean, they got Walmart.
[01:40:12.420 --> 01:40:13.420]   Right.
[01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:14.420]   I mean, that's the big, big deal.
[01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:17.980]   I mean, the fact that we have a Visio television in our living room.
[01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:18.980]   Yeah.
[01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:19.980]   And love it.
[01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:20.980]   Absolutely love it.
[01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:25.540]   And we spent a lot of time doing research on different TVs that we wanted.
[01:40:25.540 --> 01:40:26.540]   And we ended up going with this one.
[01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:27.540]   And we love it.
[01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:28.540]   You go into Walmart.
[01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:29.540]   It's there, Visio, Visio.
[01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:31.260]   And now they're going to have the distribution in Walmart.
[01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:33.980]   And that is huge.
[01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:35.500]   That's a very good point.
[01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:36.500]   Yeah.
[01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:38.940]   If you ask me, they can't rip off Apple fast enough.
[01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:39.460]   I am like--
[01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:41.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:41.460 --> 01:40:43.940]   You want a Windows 7 PC that feels like a MacBook Air.
[01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:45.420]   There are quite a few now.
[01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:50.580]   It's disgraceful that it's taken the PC market this long to rip off
[01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:53.060]   what are obviously great ideas from Apple.
[01:40:53.060 --> 01:40:56.740]   And it's like finally, you got like the closest I've seen
[01:40:56.740 --> 01:40:58.340]   is the all is the razor.
[01:40:58.340 --> 01:40:59.620]   I'm showing it to you right now.
[01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:00.740]   The razor blade.
[01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:01.740]   You see this?
[01:41:01.740 --> 01:41:03.340]   It just clearly looks like a MacBook Pro.
[01:41:03.340 --> 01:41:04.540]   Only it's got like--
[01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:06.180]   It's priced like a MacBook Pro.
[01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:07.740]   Holy cow.
[01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:08.740]   Right.
[01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:09.740]   And it's gorgeous.
[01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:10.420]   It's amazing.
[01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:13.780]   And also underpowered and overpriced, much like Apple.
[01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:14.740]   So it's like--
[01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:15.740]   They've caught up.
[01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:18.820]   The faster we can bring this to the PC, the happier I'm going to be.
[01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:19.660]   I think--
[01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:20.740]   And the less--
[01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:21.420]   Oh, anyway, go ahead.
[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:26.660]   Most of us are in agreement that the Asus transformer is the one, right?
[01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:28.420]   Actually, this is not it.
[01:41:28.420 --> 01:41:31.820]   There's another one that's more of a Asus seems to own this.
[01:41:31.820 --> 01:41:34.260]   What ultra book do you like, Tim?
[01:41:34.260 --> 01:41:35.580]   Is there one that you like?
[01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:38.020]   The Samsung Series 9, I guess, will be the next choice.
[01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:39.020]   Well, the 9.
[01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:39.020]   Yeah.
[01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:42.940]   I'm very intrigued about the Lenovo's upcoming ultra book,
[01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:44.460]   which has a carbon fiber case.
[01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:46.020]   And I'm a big Lenovo fan.
[01:41:46.020 --> 01:41:47.100]   So I'm curious about that.
[01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:48.660]   When I haven't had a chance to play with that myself.
[01:41:48.660 --> 01:41:49.180]   Right.
[01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:50.460]   Now I'd say this is the Series 9.
[01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:51.460]   I agree with it.
[01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:53.460]   I use the Dell with the carbon fiber case.
[01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:54.780]   Yeah, the Dell's pretty nice.
[01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:55.740]   We've looked at that.
[01:41:55.740 --> 01:41:56.980]   I haven't seen the--
[01:41:56.980 --> 01:41:58.940]   either the Lenovo or the new Samsung.
[01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:00.980]   So we'll have to take a look at those.
[01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:03.780]   Somebody reviewed the Samsung, I think, here.
[01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:04.260]   No?
[01:42:04.260 --> 01:42:05.100]   We haven't got that one yet.
[01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:06.580]   We'll get it.
[01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:10.020]   Good article by Roger Chang at CNET 5 Blunders.
[01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:11.980]   I don't think you could disagree with any of these
[01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:14.460]   that put Nokia in the hot seat.
[01:42:14.460 --> 01:42:19.020]   Number one, they never jumped on the flip phone bandwagon.
[01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:21.420]   They kept making candy bar phones when Motorola was eating
[01:42:21.420 --> 01:42:23.940]   their lunch with the flip phone.
[01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:25.900]   Number two, it ignored the US market.
[01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:28.820]   Remember, Nokia, you ended up having to buy an unlocked,
[01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:30.820]   unsubsidized Nokia phone because they didn't have any
[01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:33.580]   carriers for the smartphones anyway.
[01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:34.580]   For me.
[01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:36.900]   Now, I think that's the biggest mistake that they made,
[01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:41.060]   because they've had to really work really hard to develop
[01:42:41.060 --> 01:42:42.860]   all these relationships that they could have and should have
[01:42:42.860 --> 01:42:45.460]   had for years now with these launches of the Lumia products
[01:42:45.460 --> 01:42:46.020]   in the US.
[01:42:46.020 --> 01:42:48.820]   They've had to go back to these wireless carriers in the US
[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:50.220]   and develop all new deals from scratch.
[01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:52.300]   And they found that they haven't been getting much respect
[01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:54.260]   from these carriers in their retail placement and everything
[01:42:54.260 --> 01:42:55.100]   else, too.
[01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:57.140]   I think that's all endemic of them,
[01:42:57.140 --> 01:42:58.740]   ignoring them for all these years.
[01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:00.340]   Now, how you like us?
[01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:02.980]   It failed to recognize the threat of the iPhone.
[01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:05.580]   They weren't alone in that.
[01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:08.300]   Buying these arguments.
[01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:09.260]   You could got to agree with this.
[01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:10.940]   Clung to Symbian too long.
[01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:13.380]   Well, that's because they owned it and they figured, well,
[01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:14.100]   we paid for it.
[01:43:14.100 --> 01:43:15.500]   We might as well--
[01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:17.460]   We bought it.
[01:43:17.460 --> 01:43:20.580]   And finally, it chose the wrong next generation platform
[01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:23.140]   to back, Meramimo or MAMO.
[01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:25.180]   And then they made the MIGO.
[01:43:25.180 --> 01:43:28.220]   And then I had an N9.
[01:43:28.220 --> 01:43:29.660]   I don't know what happened to my N9.
[01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:32.340]   I actually bought an N9.
[01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:34.300]   What a fool I was.
[01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:35.180]   It's a great phone.
[01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:36.500]   It is a great phone.
[01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:37.740]   If you like MIGO.
[01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:38.460]   Dead platform.
[01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:39.460]   Yeah.
[01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:40.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:40.140 --> 01:43:43.580]   Well, the Lumia is basically an N9 with Windows Mobile on it.
[01:43:43.580 --> 01:43:44.100]   Windows 4.
[01:43:44.100 --> 01:43:44.740]   Yeah.
[01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:46.700]   Unfortunately, with some of the hardware
[01:43:46.700 --> 01:43:48.780]   stripped back a little bit to support the restrictions
[01:43:48.780 --> 01:43:49.700]   of Windows Phone.
[01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:52.340]   But yeah, ultimately, in terms of design and design language,
[01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:53.620]   it's much the same device.
[01:43:53.620 --> 01:43:56.500]   Tomorrow, they won't get any credit or publicity.
[01:43:56.500 --> 01:43:59.740]   Nokia is going to announce the emergence of this new--
[01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:00.100]   what is it?
[01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:03.420]   43 megapixel phone in the US?
[01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:04.340]   Leg.
[01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:06.580]   That's stupid.
[01:44:06.580 --> 01:44:08.900]   I keep a picture of you make a pixel phone.
[01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:09.500]   I play with it.
[01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:14.660]   It's actually a very-- the Pure View 808.
[01:44:14.660 --> 01:44:15.980]   I love the Pixel count.
[01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:17.420]   It's 43 megapixel.
[01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:23.820]   We got a little plastic lens and 46 and 40 plus megapixels.
[01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:25.060]   And it's kind of thick.
[01:44:25.060 --> 01:44:26.580]   They're not showing the side view.
[01:44:26.580 --> 01:44:27.100]   But it's actually--
[01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:28.260]   It's got a huge sensor in there.
[01:44:28.260 --> 01:44:29.780]   A big sensor.
[01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:30.900]   41 megapixels.
[01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:32.060]   What happens, though, with it?
[01:44:32.060 --> 01:44:37.500]   Is it down samples it to a smaller size?
[01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:38.500]   What do you think?
[01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:42.220]   Is this going to be-- Tim, you got your hands on the hot, pure
[01:44:42.220 --> 01:44:43.860]   view?
[01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:47.220]   No, unfortunately, we're running a limited operating
[01:44:47.220 --> 01:44:47.720]   system here.
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:49.500]   It's not any of the big three, which is unfortunate.
[01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:50.860]   The camera is outrageous, though.
[01:44:50.860 --> 01:44:54.140]   And I think that this is probably more of a statement
[01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:56.220]   about what you're going to expect from Nokia devices going
[01:44:56.220 --> 01:44:57.140]   forward on Windows Phone.
[01:44:57.140 --> 01:44:58.500]   And in that regard, it's a great thing,
[01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:00.380]   because the sensor is unbelievable.
[01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:01.980]   We did a lot of testing with the thing.
[01:45:01.980 --> 01:45:05.860]   And the photos are far and away best of any device
[01:45:05.860 --> 01:45:08.260]   that we've seen, any smartphone, I should say.
[01:45:08.260 --> 01:45:10.300]   So hopefully, Windows Phone will be having something
[01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:11.620]   like this in the future.
[01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:15.380]   Tim, there's no way-- OK, when you start leapfrogging
[01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:18.460]   the number of megapixels from DSLRs,
[01:45:18.460 --> 01:45:22.980]   there's no way that the physical optics are able to match it.
[01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:28.500]   Is this a smart move to move into the turf of dedicated camera
[01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:29.940]   devices?
[01:45:29.940 --> 01:45:30.980]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:33.500]   I mean, ultimately, it doesn't lead for thicker devices.
[01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:34.100]   You mentioned Leo.
[01:45:34.100 --> 01:45:36.180]   It is a kind of a chunky phone.
[01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:38.500]   But absolutely, people are taking more pictures
[01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:40.500]   with their phones than with any other device right now.
[01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:43.020]   They've pretty much killed the compact camera market.
[01:45:43.020 --> 01:45:45.340]   And if you can take DSLR quality images,
[01:45:45.340 --> 01:45:46.860]   which this isn't quite there.
[01:45:46.860 --> 01:45:47.540]   It's pretty good.
[01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:49.300]   It's better than point and shoot, I'd say.
[01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:52.020]   If you can really leave your camera at home
[01:45:52.020 --> 01:45:54.020]   and be comfortable that you can get great photos.
[01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:55.740]   And if you can have it such a high resolution
[01:45:55.740 --> 01:45:57.380]   that you don't really need an optical zoom,
[01:45:57.380 --> 01:45:58.820]   I think that's part of it, too.
[01:45:58.820 --> 01:46:01.620]   Because it's hard to fit an optical zoom in a phone
[01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:02.540]   and have it be pocketable.
[01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:04.900]   But if you have a ridiculous amount of megapixels,
[01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:07.860]   you can just do a digital zoom and still have it look fantastic.
[01:46:07.860 --> 01:46:10.180]   And that's part of the thinking here.
[01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:11.420]   I'm going to go out on a limb.
[01:46:11.420 --> 01:46:13.580]   I'm going to say this is going to be as big a success
[01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:15.060]   as Microsoft Kin.
[01:46:15.060 --> 01:46:16.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:19.100]   I wish, you know, I saw somebody had one of these Kin's
[01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:19.900]   and they sent it back.
[01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:22.380]   I said, is it the collector's item of all time?
[01:46:22.380 --> 01:46:23.180]   I actually like this.
[01:46:23.180 --> 01:46:26.260]   Microsoft won't confirm that they only sold like 500 of them.
[01:46:26.260 --> 01:46:27.540]   So I'm going to--
[01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:28.740]   I'm hanging on to the Kin.
[01:46:28.740 --> 01:46:29.380]   You have one?
[01:46:29.380 --> 01:46:30.420]   I think it's going to come back.
[01:46:30.420 --> 01:46:31.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:32.180]   Oh, good.
[01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:34.100]   I'm jealous.
[01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:36.900]   I need more junk in my house.
[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:38.420]   You see, the photos that thing takes.
[01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:41.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:46:41.060 --> 01:46:41.980]   Kin.
[01:46:41.980 --> 01:46:47.180]   First PC only game at the top of the list since 2010.
[01:46:47.180 --> 01:46:51.420]   Diablo 3 Blizzard proves the PC is not dead when it comes to gaming.
[01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:54.140]   No console version of this one.
[01:46:54.140 --> 01:46:56.340]   I actually have a lot of fun playing it.
[01:46:56.340 --> 01:46:57.940]   What do you have time to do this?
[01:46:57.940 --> 01:46:59.580]   I actually have been doing it on the air.
[01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:00.620]   You played on the air?
[01:47:00.620 --> 01:47:01.220]   You played on the air.
[01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:01.740]   Yeah.
[01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:03.580]   You know, in fact, we had somebody come in.
[01:47:03.580 --> 01:47:05.140]   There is a cow level for this game.
[01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:05.980]   Did you know that, Brian?
[01:47:05.980 --> 01:47:07.700]   There's a cow level for Diablo 3?
[01:47:07.700 --> 01:47:08.900]   No, that sounds awesome.
[01:47:08.900 --> 01:47:09.540]   Cow level.
[01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:10.020]   Cow?
[01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:12.940]   I already finished it once with a multiplayer,
[01:47:12.940 --> 01:47:15.660]   but I'm going back and playing it again, hardcore version.
[01:47:15.660 --> 01:47:18.340]   I'm in nightmare mode myself, 37-month.
[01:47:18.340 --> 01:47:19.740]   Stand back.
[01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:21.940]   I call him Grasshopper.
[01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:25.900]   So the real story on this one, if you ask me,
[01:47:25.900 --> 01:47:30.980]   is this is a loud acknowledgment of the failure of NPD group
[01:47:30.980 --> 01:47:32.620]   to measure the right statistics.
[01:47:32.620 --> 01:47:34.660]   Because the reason that this is news
[01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:38.540]   is because NPD only measures physical hardware sales,
[01:47:38.540 --> 01:47:39.860]   or physical software sales.
[01:47:39.860 --> 01:47:42.180]   Like, you have to go to GameStop and buy stuff.
[01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:42.980]   No, everything that happens.
[01:47:42.980 --> 01:47:46.740]   Everybody's software anymore does not get counted.
[01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:50.540]   Everything that's sold as virtual goods in Farmville
[01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:51.820]   does not get counted.
[01:47:51.820 --> 01:47:54.700]   So for years, you've heard these bogus claims
[01:47:54.700 --> 01:47:57.260]   that NPD is saying like PC gaming's dead, bro,
[01:47:57.260 --> 01:48:00.860]   because the areas that we're looking at that are not the ones
[01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:03.940]   where all the actions are happening, there's no action.
[01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:06.180]   So therefore, that means PC gaming is dead.
[01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:07.820]   And I'm glad that this story's out there.
[01:48:07.820 --> 01:48:11.220]   And for no other reason than to say, number one, yes,
[01:48:11.220 --> 01:48:15.820]   even buy those horribly skewed metrics by NPD.
[01:48:15.820 --> 01:48:17.140]   PC gaming is still doing fine.
[01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:20.540]   But on top of that, understand that this does not even count
[01:48:20.540 --> 01:48:23.580]   steam, and steam is the number one gaming platform.
[01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:24.740]   It's bigger than Xbox.
[01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:26.540]   It's bigger than Sony.
[01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:29.420]   It's bigger than Nintendo.
[01:48:29.420 --> 01:48:30.780]   PC gaming is doing fine.
[01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:31.660]   Thank you very much.
[01:48:31.660 --> 01:48:33.460]   Hey, can I ask you a question?
[01:48:33.460 --> 01:48:36.220]   What is that behind you?
[01:48:36.220 --> 01:48:37.420]   The BB logo?
[01:48:37.420 --> 01:48:38.540]   That's my initials.
[01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:39.260]   Brian.
[01:48:39.260 --> 01:48:40.020]   Yeah, no, I get that.
[01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:41.020]   But what is this?
[01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:41.740]   Is it a logo?
[01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:42.140]   Is this a wall?
[01:48:42.140 --> 01:48:43.580]   Or is this a green screen?
[01:48:43.580 --> 01:48:44.900]   You've got something rigged there.
[01:48:44.900 --> 01:48:45.740]   You seem to have--
[01:48:45.740 --> 01:48:46.820]   You're in a studio.
[01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:47.300]   It's just a set.
[01:48:47.300 --> 01:48:48.820]   He does a show from there.
[01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:51.340]   I'm deep in my underground bunker right now.
[01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:51.740]   This is--
[01:48:51.740 --> 01:48:53.740]   Why is there only the bricks and the cement?
[01:48:53.740 --> 01:48:55.740]   It looks like somebody didn't even take the grout out
[01:48:55.740 --> 01:48:56.780]   after they'd done this thing.
[01:48:56.780 --> 01:48:57.940]   Very cheap production.
[01:48:57.940 --> 01:48:59.740]   We had to build a very--
[01:48:59.740 --> 01:49:02.900]   I think you better-- you could call that contractor up.
[01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:04.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:49:04.820 --> 01:49:06.980]   That's skeuomorphism right there.
[01:49:06.980 --> 01:49:09.260]   This was built by Chad Johnson.
[01:49:09.260 --> 01:49:12.340]   He designed this set, and it's fantastic.
[01:49:12.340 --> 01:49:12.820]   I love it.
[01:49:12.820 --> 01:49:14.220]   Chad, is that actually mortar?
[01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:15.940]   I spray painted that BB logo.
[01:49:15.940 --> 01:49:17.060]   Is that actual mortar?
[01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:21.620]   It actually uses the magic of television.
[01:49:21.620 --> 01:49:22.340]   It's--
[01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:24.220]   You tell him, Chad.
[01:49:24.220 --> 01:49:27.820]   Chad was going to build this out of actual concrete
[01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:31.300]   until his high school teacher was like, are you high?
[01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:32.620]   That's the worst idea.
[01:49:32.620 --> 01:49:33.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:49:33.140 --> 01:49:33.620]   Yeah.
[01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:34.060]   Yeah.
[01:49:34.060 --> 01:49:35.820]   So that's actually foam.
[01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:39.060]   It's made out of styrofoam, and there's more foam.
[01:49:39.060 --> 01:49:39.580]   That's what the grout was like.
[01:49:39.580 --> 01:49:40.700]   It's very good looking.
[01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:41.580]   You really did a good job.
[01:49:41.580 --> 01:49:42.580]   It looks very realistic.
[01:49:42.580 --> 01:49:42.580]   Yeah.
[01:49:42.580 --> 01:49:45.540]   It took like seven hours to stencil out that BB logo.
[01:49:45.540 --> 01:49:47.260]   And then right after that, you quit Brian
[01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:49.220]   and came to work for us.
[01:49:49.220 --> 01:49:50.380]   Yeah, I don't blame you.
[01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:52.860]   Good move, Chad.
[01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:55.500]   So finally, the other shoe drops.
[01:49:55.500 --> 01:50:00.700]   Draw something is going to be a prime time TV show.
[01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:06.060]   Now we know why Zinga spent $210 million for OMG Pop
[01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:09.620]   for a game that was at its peak and declined immediately
[01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:11.460]   after they bought it.
[01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:13.540]   It's going to be a TV show.
[01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:18.100]   Ryan Seacrest Productions in a joint venture
[01:50:18.100 --> 01:50:21.540]   was Sony Pictures Television, an embassy row.
[01:50:21.540 --> 01:50:22.860]   What could go wrong?
[01:50:22.860 --> 01:50:24.020]   No, you know what?
[01:50:24.020 --> 01:50:25.100]   It's a winner.
[01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:25.900]   Wasn't there--
[01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:26.620]   Remember the picture?
[01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:28.620]   Yeah, wasn't there a picture TV show?
[01:50:28.620 --> 01:50:29.540]   It was a TV show.
[01:50:29.540 --> 01:50:31.380]   You're back in 1997 or something.
[01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:32.380]   Win-loser draw.
[01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:34.420]   That's it.
[01:50:34.420 --> 01:50:35.380]   Yeah, no, but there was a--
[01:50:35.380 --> 01:50:38.140]   There was a Pictionary television show.
[01:50:38.140 --> 01:50:39.900]   So they've tried this before.
[01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:40.940]   Yeah, and I remember being--
[01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:41.540]   I loved it.
[01:50:41.540 --> 01:50:44.460]   They, I think, was like Alan Thicke hosted it or something.
[01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:44.980]   Remember that?
[01:50:44.980 --> 01:50:45.980]   I hope--
[01:50:45.980 --> 01:50:48.580]   They had the big paper and they had celebrities on the couch.
[01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:50.140]   That was Win-loser draw.
[01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:51.060]   Wasn't that?
[01:50:51.060 --> 01:50:51.500]   No.
[01:50:51.500 --> 01:50:52.380]   No?
[01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:53.220]   That was Pictionary.
[01:50:53.220 --> 01:50:55.900]   All right, OK.
[01:50:55.900 --> 01:50:57.940]   15 years in prison, if you're caught using Skype
[01:50:57.940 --> 01:51:00.180]   and Ethiopia, just a word of warning, John.
[01:51:00.180 --> 01:51:01.380]   I was just heading there, too.
[01:51:01.380 --> 01:51:01.820]   Stop it.
[01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:02.660]   Can't do my show.
[01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:04.260]   Can't do the show there.
[01:51:04.260 --> 01:51:04.980]   Well, it's over.
[01:51:04.980 --> 01:51:06.980]   So is there a rationale for this?
[01:51:06.980 --> 01:51:08.380]   Idiacy?
[01:51:08.380 --> 01:51:09.260]   I don't know.
[01:51:09.260 --> 01:51:10.100]   It's a bad--
[01:51:10.100 --> 01:51:11.620]   Well, essentially, it's to keep--
[01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:13.660]   it's so the government can have the power.
[01:51:13.660 --> 01:51:15.900]   And this is something I had to talk about on No Agenda.
[01:51:15.900 --> 01:51:17.100]   It's so the government can--
[01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:19.260]   No AgendaShow.com.
[01:51:19.260 --> 01:51:21.900]   To listen to every single conversation,
[01:51:21.900 --> 01:51:24.860]   because they have the telephone company in their pockets.
[01:51:24.860 --> 01:51:26.660]   And they don't like the fact that people
[01:51:26.660 --> 01:51:29.860]   can use the internet to conduct phone calls.
[01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:33.060]   83 million people are now essentially
[01:51:33.060 --> 01:51:37.420]   behind this great firewall, where they can't talk--
[01:51:37.420 --> 01:51:37.780]   That's terrible.
[01:51:37.780 --> 01:51:40.420]   --without having the government monitor their conversations.
[01:51:40.420 --> 01:51:41.340]   This is horrifying.
[01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:46.420]   And this is why we need the internet to be free.
[01:51:46.420 --> 01:51:47.780]   They can't use Google Voice.
[01:51:47.780 --> 01:51:51.740]   Any internet phone conversation is illegal.
[01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:53.900]   And it's punishable by three to eight years in prison,
[01:51:53.900 --> 01:51:56.460]   plus fines.
[01:51:56.460 --> 01:51:59.220]   That's terrible.
[01:51:59.220 --> 01:52:03.780]   Necessary to protect against security threats.
[01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:05.020]   Deafy, opiates.
[01:52:05.020 --> 01:52:07.060]   Yeah.
[01:52:07.060 --> 01:52:09.460]   I want to thank you so much for being here, Mr. Brian
[01:52:09.460 --> 01:52:13.900]   Brushwood's Scam School Book 2 is out, or will be out,
[01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:14.460]   when?
[01:52:14.460 --> 01:52:15.460]   Tuesday.
[01:52:15.460 --> 01:52:16.700]   OK, so here's the thing.
[01:52:16.700 --> 01:52:19.780]   You know, Leo, that we tried to scam our way
[01:52:19.780 --> 01:52:21.980]   to the top of the charts by having everybody
[01:52:21.980 --> 01:52:23.140]   buy on the exact same day.
[01:52:23.140 --> 01:52:24.620]   How that work for you?
[01:52:24.620 --> 01:52:25.980]   I'm making no bones about this.
[01:52:25.980 --> 01:52:29.620]   This is a fraudulent effort to try to cheat our way
[01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:32.900]   to the number one spot on either Amazon or iTunes.
[01:52:32.900 --> 01:52:35.180]   And it's probably illegal in Ethiopia, which just
[01:52:35.180 --> 01:52:36.660]   warn all our Ethiopian viewers.
[01:52:36.660 --> 01:52:37.860]   Correct, correct.
[01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:39.060]   But are you ready for this?
[01:52:39.060 --> 01:52:42.140]   We figured out a way to take the scam one step farther.
[01:52:42.140 --> 01:52:46.460]   Because somebody said-- and this is essentially voter fraud,
[01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:48.140]   which is why I'm excited about it.
[01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:51.420]   Somebody said, how do I buy more than one copy?
[01:52:51.420 --> 01:52:54.020]   And the answer is, well, I guess you could gift it to people.
[01:52:54.020 --> 01:52:55.660]   It's like, well, who do I gift it to?
[01:52:55.660 --> 01:52:57.900]   And the answer is, you know, it's like you could gift it
[01:52:57.900 --> 01:53:00.020]   to fake accounts, and that would be cheating.
[01:53:00.020 --> 01:53:03.100]   But there's tons of people who want the book for free.
[01:53:03.100 --> 01:53:07.220]   And so that's why we've created the Scamschool Scholarship
[01:53:07.220 --> 01:53:09.740]   Fund.
[01:53:09.740 --> 01:53:13.780]   If you go to scamschoolscholarship.com,
[01:53:13.780 --> 01:53:16.940]   you can either apply for a scholarship
[01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:21.740]   to get the book for free, or you can sponsor someone
[01:53:21.740 --> 01:53:25.620]   and buy the book for them, either on iTunes or on Amazon,
[01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:28.060]   head on over to scamschoolscholarship.com
[01:53:28.060 --> 01:53:32.700]   and let's defraud Amazon to make this the number one best
[01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:33.580]   seller.
[01:53:33.580 --> 01:53:34.980]   I wish you luck.
[01:53:34.980 --> 01:53:36.580]   Gosh darn it.
[01:53:36.580 --> 01:53:38.620]   Creative, as always.
[01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:43.060]   Brian Brushwood, NSFW continues to harass the hams
[01:53:43.060 --> 01:53:46.060]   every Tuesday night at 7 p.m.
[01:53:46.060 --> 01:53:49.140]   Pacific 10 p.m. Eastern time on twit.tv.
[01:53:49.140 --> 01:53:54.780]   It's the worst collision of cultures ever in broadcast media.
[01:53:54.780 --> 01:53:57.900]   And by the way, I've got to give a huge thanks because Bob
[01:53:57.900 --> 01:54:01.060]   Heil is the one who tuned in to NSFW.
[01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:03.540]   I was like, you guys aren't using Heil microphone.
[01:54:03.540 --> 01:54:05.300]   That's a disgrace.
[01:54:05.300 --> 01:54:06.700]   Just give me your address.
[01:54:06.700 --> 01:54:07.380]   Let's fix that.
[01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:09.260]   He's good about that, I got to say.
[01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:10.700]   Yeah.
[01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:15.940]   So right after Ham Nation, it's at sfw.
[01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:20.740]   The punks run the old guys out of the shop and take over.
[01:54:20.740 --> 01:54:21.900]   Thank you, Brian, for being here.
[01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:24.220]   In all seriousness, Leo, this is a real thing.
[01:54:24.220 --> 01:54:26.220]   You can go and look in.
[01:54:26.220 --> 01:54:29.740]   You type in your name and then you're able to get a free copy
[01:54:29.740 --> 01:54:34.140]   or you're able to get, let's say you wanted to sponsor someone.
[01:54:34.140 --> 01:54:35.900]   You could sponsor someone there.
[01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:39.140]   And then we're going to hit number one, where I'm going to die trying.
[01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:40.580]   Yeah, pump it.
[01:54:40.580 --> 01:54:41.580]   Pump it.
[01:54:41.580 --> 01:54:42.580]   Skips.
[01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:43.580]   Cool.
[01:54:43.580 --> 01:54:44.580]   I should find that.
[01:54:44.580 --> 01:54:45.580]   Love it.
[01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:46.580]   Pump it.
[01:54:46.580 --> 01:54:48.740]   John C. Devorak pumps it on no agenda show twice weekly.
[01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:49.940]   Now, twice weekly.
[01:54:49.940 --> 01:54:52.100]   Yeah, we just started to do it on Thursday now.
[01:54:52.100 --> 01:54:54.940]   So you Thursday and Sunday.
[01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:55.940]   You're crazy.
[01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:56.940]   Yeah.
[01:54:56.940 --> 01:54:57.940]   You're crazy.
[01:54:57.940 --> 01:54:59.460]   Google no agenda and you'll see what we're talking about.
[01:54:59.460 --> 01:55:00.900]   I have a big bottom in the basement.
[01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:05.900]   I'll give it to you and you should you should next time you're on with Adam, turn it on.
[01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:08.900]   And he'll go, what the heck happened here?
[01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:12.340]   You've got a big bottom.
[01:55:12.340 --> 01:55:13.340]   Big bottom.
[01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:14.340]   I know the device.
[01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:17.780]   Tim Stevens is the editor in chief of Engadget.
[01:55:17.780 --> 01:55:19.260]   Really, really done a great job.
[01:55:19.260 --> 01:55:24.460]   In fact, I just read an article recently and said that you are the unsung hero of tech
[01:55:24.460 --> 01:55:26.060]   journalism.
[01:55:26.060 --> 01:55:28.300]   So thank you for the job.
[01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:31.700]   Yeah, it's true.
[01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:32.700]   Thank you for being here, Tim.
[01:55:32.700 --> 01:55:34.180]   Really appreciate it.
[01:55:34.180 --> 01:55:38.540]   Thanks to Clayton Morris, who is the tech guy on Fox and Friends.
[01:55:38.540 --> 01:55:40.620]   You have a weird schedule.
[01:55:40.620 --> 01:55:41.620]   You like work today.
[01:55:41.620 --> 01:55:43.340]   You work Saturday, Sunday.
[01:55:43.340 --> 01:55:44.940]   Oh, God.
[01:55:44.940 --> 01:55:45.940]   Every day.
[01:55:45.940 --> 01:55:46.940]   You work every day.
[01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:47.940]   I don't know.
[01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:49.180]   I'm covering tech in some capacity.
[01:55:49.180 --> 01:55:51.260]   So yeah, but this morning I did the show.
[01:55:51.260 --> 01:55:53.100]   So 6 AM to 10 AM.
[01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:54.500]   But you did get beer donuts.
[01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:56.100]   I had beer donuts.
[01:55:56.100 --> 01:55:57.100]   That's right.
[01:55:57.100 --> 01:55:58.780]   And then I got on the road and came and did this show.
[01:55:58.780 --> 01:55:59.780]   Thank you.
[01:55:59.780 --> 01:56:00.780]   Always great to always great to.
[01:56:00.780 --> 01:56:03.060]   Well, I appreciate it because I know it's Father's Day and I'm sure you have stuff to
[01:56:03.060 --> 01:56:04.340]   do and you're at your dads.
[01:56:04.340 --> 01:56:08.900]   And gosh, I just I feel very grateful that all of you could be here on Father's Day.
[01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:10.380]   So thank you Clayton for being here.
[01:56:10.380 --> 01:56:11.380]   Sure.
[01:56:11.380 --> 01:56:12.380]   Thanks for having me.
[01:56:12.380 --> 01:56:14.460]   Tom Merritt has a look at the week ahead.
[01:56:14.460 --> 01:56:15.460]   What's coming up, Tom?
[01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:16.460]   Hey, thanks Leo.
[01:56:16.460 --> 01:56:19.780]   Here's a look at some of the things we'll be covering on tech news today.
[01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:25.540]   The week ahead, Monday, June 18th, AT&T Samsung, Galaxy S3 starts shipping and Microsoft has
[01:56:25.540 --> 01:56:27.820]   a secret major announcement in LA.
[01:56:27.820 --> 01:56:28.820]   Is it going to be a tablet?
[01:56:28.820 --> 01:56:29.820]   Who knows?
[01:56:29.820 --> 01:56:32.300]   Tuesday, June 19th, Lueb kicks off in London.
[01:56:32.300 --> 01:56:34.140]   Sarah Lane will be there reporting.
[01:56:34.140 --> 01:56:39.820]   And Wednesday, June 20th, the Canon EOS 1D X is set to launch, but supplies will be limited.
[01:56:39.820 --> 01:56:41.740]   And the Windows Phone Developer Summit starts.
[01:56:41.740 --> 01:56:45.460]   We're supposed to get more details on the next version of the Windows Phone operating
[01:56:45.460 --> 01:56:46.460]   system.
[01:56:46.460 --> 01:56:50.940]   Also on Wednesday, Gigahome Structure takes place Friday, June 22nd, the HPN V Spectre
[01:56:50.940 --> 01:56:55.980]   XT ships and the iPhone 4S comes to cricket wireless in the United States.
[01:56:55.980 --> 01:56:56.980]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[01:56:56.980 --> 01:56:57.980]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:56:57.980 --> 01:56:58.980]   Thank you, Tom.
[01:56:58.980 --> 01:56:59.980]   Tom will be here tomorrow afternoon.
[01:56:59.980 --> 01:57:04.780]   We'll cover live beginning at 4 p.m. Pacific 7 p.m. Eastern time right after TNT.
[01:57:04.780 --> 01:57:08.820]   I guess what we'll do is we'll just do tech news today, which is at three every afternoon.
[01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:12.620]   Right after tech news today, we'll go into our live coverage to find out what Microsoft
[01:57:12.620 --> 01:57:13.820]   is going to announce tomorrow.
[01:57:13.820 --> 01:57:16.620]   Don't we all be chagrinned if it's a new mouse or something?
[01:57:16.620 --> 01:57:21.140]   That'll be interesting, but you do tune in tomorrow for live coverage.
[01:57:21.140 --> 01:57:23.740]   And thanks to everybody for being here.
[01:57:23.740 --> 01:57:24.900]   Great studio audience.
[01:57:24.900 --> 01:57:27.260]   Again, I tell you, we get people here all the time.
[01:57:27.260 --> 01:57:28.340]   It's really fun.
[01:57:28.340 --> 01:57:32.140]   Email my sister Eva, Twitter.tv, if you'd like to be in the studio, as we love to have
[01:57:32.140 --> 01:57:33.140]   you.
[01:57:33.140 --> 01:57:34.140]   And of course, we love having you watch live.
[01:57:34.140 --> 01:57:39.300]   We do a 3 p.m. Pacific 6 p.m. Eastern time, 2,200 UTC every Sunday.
[01:57:39.300 --> 01:57:43.340]   You watch live, be in the chat room, and that's a lot of fun.
[01:57:43.340 --> 01:57:46.980]   If you can't, of course, we make audio and video available after the fact that twit.tv,
[01:57:46.980 --> 01:57:54.660]   we are changing the format of the smaller of the two video files next week or this week,
[01:57:54.660 --> 01:57:55.660]   next week, I think.
[01:57:55.660 --> 01:57:56.660]   I'm not sure.
[01:57:56.660 --> 01:58:00.300]   You can find out more at twit.tv/watch.
[01:58:00.300 --> 01:58:05.780]   That format will still be in H.264, but we're using a more modern profile and that will,
[01:58:05.780 --> 01:58:13.300]   unfortunately, break some older devices like, for instance, the second generation iPod
[01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:14.300]   touch.
[01:58:14.300 --> 01:58:19.140]   So if you go to twit.tv/watch, we've got all the information there, including the devices
[01:58:19.140 --> 01:58:24.660]   that we know won't work, and most modern devices will, and some sample files so you can see
[01:58:24.660 --> 01:58:25.660]   if your device will work.
[01:58:25.660 --> 01:58:31.540]   And the reason I mention this is because iTunes, if it says, "Oh, I can't play that
[01:58:31.540 --> 01:58:34.900]   back," won't tell you, won't warn you, and won't sink.
[01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:39.220]   So you just won't get a file and you won't be able to listen to the show or watch the
[01:58:39.220 --> 01:58:40.220]   show, I should say.
[01:58:40.220 --> 01:58:44.980]   Check that out if you do have an older device, an iPod classic, an iPod touch, 2G or older,
[01:58:44.980 --> 01:58:54.660]   iPhone 3G or older, a Nano 4G or older, Android 2.0 or older, some Android 2.1 and 2.2 devices,
[01:58:54.660 --> 01:58:56.700]   and Windows Mobile 6.5 and older.
[01:58:56.700 --> 01:58:59.180]   Those devices will not be able to play back that feed.
[01:58:59.180 --> 01:59:01.380]   The mobile feed will always work, so you can subscribe to that.
[01:59:01.380 --> 01:59:02.860]   That'll work on all devices.
[01:59:02.860 --> 01:59:03.860]   Thanks for watching.
[01:59:03.860 --> 01:59:04.860]   We'll see you next week.
[01:59:04.860 --> 01:59:06.860]   Another twit is in the can.
[01:59:06.860 --> 01:59:06.860]   Bye-bye.
[01:59:06.860 --> 01:59:13.860]   Dead silence from the audience.
[01:59:13.860 --> 01:59:20.860]   [Laughter]
[01:59:20.860 --> 01:59:30.860]   [MUSIC]
