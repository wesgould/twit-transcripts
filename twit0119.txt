[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.480]   who was deeply missed but we had a filling Devorek,
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.200]   a cranky geek in his place last week, Mr. Jerry Prennel.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.200]   Hey John.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.200]   Hey there.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.360]   Jerry did a good job of representing the cranky side.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.360]   Good.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.360]   He's good at that.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.920]   Also here Don Reisinger who is the C.net author and he's been on before and we were always
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.920]   glad to have him back.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.240]   Waiting for Will Harris to, I think he passed out.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.680]   He's in England and it's late at night there and I think he probably, he just fell asleep.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.120]   He's, I'm going to call him every few seconds.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.040]   I think I slammed Reisinger for some crazy thing he wrote last week.
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.920]   Oh he wrote that thing about how Microsoft should give up on Vista.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.920]   Was that it?
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.920]   No.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.920]   What did you give me for?
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.920]   What crazy thing did you write?
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.920]   Oh God.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.320]   It could have been any number of things.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.400]   Don, that's a mark of success.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.400]   You got this right?
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.240]   Oh yeah, you got Devorek slamming you.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.200]   That's how I got my start.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.920]   Oh, just slam me.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.560]   Now what did you write about lately?
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.560]   I don't know.
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.240]   I wrote a follow up to what John, John wrote about Google OFS.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.120]   I did not, everything you write, I like.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.880]   No, it was some wacky.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.560]   You should be had some off the wall thing you said that it was just, I just, I just
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.720]   you blame, he blames IT, IT, AT&T for the iPhone, breaking.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.280]   No, I don't know.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.880]   Why Microsoft must have been in Vista?
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.560]   Who else has stopped caring about the Blu-ray HD DVD war?
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.560]   Me?
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.360]   Yeah, I bought both though.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.360]   So I should.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.360]   Maybe that was it.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.360]   Maybe there's something he said in there.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.360]   I don't know.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.720]   The problem is it was on a podcast and you know, my Tech Five podcast and I don't
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.720]   can't remember.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.720]   You can't refer back to it.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.400]   I can't refer, this is the problem with all audio stuff.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.400]   I agree.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.800]   There's no, it's no random access.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.800]   It's all linear.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.160]   And you know, the only time you were, I'm sorry, you had a little random access when
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.880]   Patrick does this show and actually documents every word we do, but that's over.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.880]   That's gone.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.680]   He stopped doing that years ago.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.680]   I remember that.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.440]   He used to take show notes, didn't he?
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.440]   They were great.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.680]   You could tell what was on the show.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.680]   Now it's nothing.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.240]   You're right.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.840]   Well, you know, it's my fault because I should be doing something with show notes, but I
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.480]   just don't, I got once the show's over.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.720]   Why can't you find a minion?
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.720]   Can't you find a minion?
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.760]   We have many offers of minion dim.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.760]   All right.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.800]   Anybody who's a minion who wants to take show notes, listen up, will give you a super secret
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.720]   special access to Twit as we record it.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.520]   So you can, you can take notes as we go.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.360]   Don John, now my mail box is going to fill with minion boxes.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.360]   What difference does it make?
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.400]   Whether your mail box is filled or not filled, you don't answer a mail anyway.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.080]   Yeah, but I like the idea of no mail.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.240]   Anyway, we'll see if we can find a minion.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.200]   I'll find a minion just for you, John.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.360]   By the way, congratulations to Patrick who did have a baby, Sheamus.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.720]   That was his wife.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.320]   His wife did most of the work, but he was involved.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.320]   He played a part.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.320]   He got the fun part.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.320]   We know that for a fact.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.040]   Oh, oh, I won't tell Patrick you said that.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.840]   Also, and I'm Merlin Mann's wife had a baby.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.800]   Merlin and Madeline had just today, I believe, or last night had a little baby Eleanor.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.600]   So congratulations to Merlin Mann.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.920]   Now there's one more Twit baby awaiting in the oven, and it should be any day now.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.600]   And that's Alex Lindsey's baby.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.680]   I'm sorry, Alex's wife's baby.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.680]   Now you go and there you go.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.680]   I'm learning.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.480]   I think Mimi's got you brow beat, John.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.120]   And she'd say the same thing.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.120]   I mean, come on.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.120]   I know she would.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.560]   You're channeling her now.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.880]   So, you know, another person's having a baby.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.040]   I'm not from the Twit family, but from the old tech TV family.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.040]   Who's that?
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.040]   Actually, there's a couple.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.040]   Sumi Doss is having one.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.080]   Oh, that's wonderful.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.360]   And your pal Becky's having two.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.360]   She's having twins.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.360]   She's having twins.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.400]   Well, if there were a woman who could carry twins, it would be Becky Worley.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.360]   Well, congratulations to Sumi and Becky.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.120]   And of course, Kat had a baby about two years ago.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.640]   It's a baby time.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.640]   Baby, baby, baby.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.640]   It's baby.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.640]   It's baby.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.640]   It's baby.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.640]   Getting down to business.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.640]   And Will Harris is getting married any day.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.640]   And maybe that's where Will is right now.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.640]   And he's off getting married.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.640]   I'll keep calling him.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.640]   He keeps connecting.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.240]   No, that's me doing that.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.880]   I'll ask you a few minutes.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.720]   I try to connect to him.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.720]   OK.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.720]   Well, he'll come on later.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.720]   So let's get to the news.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.080]   The news, of course, one of the biggest stories which happened on Friday, Apple puts leopard
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.600]   on sale, OS 10, 10.5, 6 o'clock.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.000]   And believe it or not, once again, lines at the Apple Store not necessary.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.680]   Anybody could walk in at any time and get a copy of leopard still.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.160]   In fact, if you go to copyOSA, I'm told it's 99 bucks instead of 129 bucks.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.640]   I installed it as soon as I was able to get a copy from Apple on Thursday.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.880]   And I've been loving it.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.480]   I have to say this is--
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.480]   Right.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.440]   I think leopard is what Vista Auto have been.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.440]   It's reliable.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.120]   The upgrade is very smooth.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.040]   Some people have been reporting problems with the upgrade.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.760]   If you do the default, just upgrade on top of the old operating system.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.840]   But an archive and install fixes that.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.720]   It has some nice new features.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.280]   It's the time machine backup is very impressive.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.040]   Don and I were talking before we began about spaces, which is their workspace, which--
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.360]   I'm not a big fan of workspaces, but it works, doesn't it, Don?
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.280]   Oh, it's great.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:20.360]   And it's a multiple workspaces where you have as many screens as you want and you just go
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.120]   from one screen to the other.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.600]   And so I'll have my-- for instance, I'll have all my internet stuff on one screen, my screen
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.600]   screen.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.760]   Shades of task switching.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.240]   It's basically it is.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.280]   But somehow this works in ways that-- I don't think it did work.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.720]   I've tried many different workspace programs on OS 10.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.160]   And this is the one-- first time I've ever really liked it.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.880]   Yeah, and one of the nicest features that I found was when-- let's say you click on
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.880]   something on your desktop and then you can even do it in cover flow.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.240]   You can do it in cover flow.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.480]   But you click on it and hit the space bar and it shows you a nice little picture of it
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.280]   in full screen and it's really nice.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.280]   That's a quick look.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.600]   In fact, not only do you see the first page, but you'll see if you have a presentation,
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.200]   a Microsoft Office document, you can see all the subsequent pages.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.160]   You get a preview of the whole document.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.880]   I'll tell you what.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.080]   They did a nice job with this operating system space.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.760]   Like you said, space is great.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.040]   I use-- see, you know, you can go up to 16 spaces.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.040]   But to be honest, I think it's a little hairy after 10.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.840]   How many do you use?
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:23.840]   10?
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.280]   No, I tried 10 and it didn't work out too well.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.240]   I'm using the default 4 and I guess I could use 6 maybe.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.680]   What would you need all those spaces for?
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.640]   You know what's most useful on a laptop where you don't have a lot of screen real estate?
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.640]   Exactly.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.640]   I put on my iMac, my 24 inch iMac.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.160]   So on that one, I have, I think, 4 or 6.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.280]   But yeah, you know, like you said, in a small MacBook or something like that, I could see
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.920]   you using it easily.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.560]   The other thing that I think makes a big difference is you can assign applications to
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.560]   a space.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.560]   So they automatically go there when you launch them.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:00.680]   And that was the problem I've had with other multi-screen interfaces before, is that you
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.040]   kind of had to do a lot of organization.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.040]   This way.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.480]   How many applications would you have running in each of these spaces that they couldn't
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:12.240]   just be standalone apps running in one space and reduced and sized, minimized as it were?
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.800]   You could click through them that way.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.640]   I don't see what the advantage of this is.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.640]   You could do that.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.080]   It's just kind of a little faster to have it already open and running.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.320]   Now, as a journey in the background, can I have like two compilers going back there?
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.320]   On two different spaces?
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.360]   In fact, that's why I thought the same thing.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.360]   Go ahead.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.600]   And as soon as I started using it, I just loved it.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.640]   I thought, well, what am I going to use this for?
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.640]   Yeah, it just works.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.640]   I agree.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.640]   I agree.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.480]   The new Leopard is 64-bit and does a much better job with multi-processing.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.720]   The Finder is much faster.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.720]   Everything seems a lot snappier.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.280]   I think that's really, it's things like that really that are more significant in an
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.680]   OS upgrade.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.520]   But I think the thing that's most--
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.520]   It's snappier than the old--
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.520]   Let me get this straight.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.520]   Hold on a second.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.520]   Stop everything.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.720]   So you're telling me it's snappier than the old version?
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.720]   You bet.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.240]   I think Microsoft could learn from them.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.080]   No kidding.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:07.560]   On a PowerPC, with less than a gig, it will be slower.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:15.320]   But on any Intel Mac, and I include my original single core Mac book, it runs very well.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.800]   I have to say it's much faster than it was before.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.320]   It also has really great remote access features.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:26.500]   The file sharing and the back to my Mac, which allows you, if you're on a .Mac to connect
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.320]   and other Macs across the internet works very well.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.720]   I think they're using VNC.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.040]   I was told they're using IPsec, so it's a very secure tunnel.
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.440]   Be good for VPNing.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.360]   The only thing I don't like about that is that they require you either have NAT, PMP
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:45.760]   installed or use UPNP because it has to do a lot of router configuration to work.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.640]   Yeah, there goes half the audience.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.400]   Well no, it does it automatically.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.400]   But I--
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.200]   We're talking about this discussion.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.480]   No, people love this stuff.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.700]   The more geeky we get, John, the more they love it.
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.860]   Don't you know that?
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.020]   I think we should-- you know, why don't we do the following?
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.300]   Let's just say if you have a Mac or if you're thinking to get a Mac, you should get this
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.300]   operating system.
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.300]   No questions asked.
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.140]   There's nothing more we can say.
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.780]   Let's go even further and say if you have a Windows box, it's time to get a Mac.
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.340]   It's really that nice.
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.340]   Oh!
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.140]   I hate to say it, but it's true.
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.940]   I actually know right now that's what I recommend to people.
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.100]   People ask me, what should I get?
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.340]   I always say, I tell them right now.
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.340]   I mean, I hate the email.
[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.420]   I use PCs mostly myself.
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.300]   But I say, get a Mac.
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.080]   Well, I mean, why go through the aggravation?
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.280]   It's kind of silly at this point too well.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.240]   There's a few reasons you might want to use a PC.
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.240]   It's better for gaming.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.400]   I can't think of it more than maybe-- I can't think of one.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.400]   It's better for gaming?
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.400]   Gaming.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.400]   No, for gaming, yeah, sure.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.400]   But that's a specialized machine.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.480]   That's a different story.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.560]   It's-- there's business apps you need.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.200]   But of course, you could run those in Windows in emulation.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.120]   You can run all the business apps on a Mac.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.120]   Only games.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.640]   The only thing-- the only got you is the game thing.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.620]   I'd say, and maybe you're right, I should be more forward.
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.020]   I say Windows for Business Mac for the home in general.
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.020]   Mac.
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.020]   Now, you don't even say that.
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.020]   No.
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.020]   You say all business--
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.220]   You bet that a guy the other day I was giving a talk, and the guy says, what do you--
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.220]   what should I-- you know, what should I guess?
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.220]   Well, you should probably get a Mac.
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.940]   So I got to upgrade all my machines in my company.
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.260]   I said, how many workstations you guys said?
[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:10.260]   10.
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.260]   I said, just go with a Mac.
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.260]   Wow.
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:13.260]   Why go through the aggravation?
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:17.220]   He says, oh my god, this is my wife will be giving me nothing but crap because she's been
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.420]   recommending this for years.
[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.420]   She--
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:20.420]   So you can't do it.
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.840]   Why the switching hasn't happened is because people don't want to admit that they've been
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.440]   wrong all this time.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:31.200]   Now if you're like myself, and I got a lot of PC gear I write for PC Magazine, I talk
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:36.600]   about PC stuff, and I like the moan and groan about Microsoft and everybody else by the--
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:42.640]   I mean, there's no reason-- if you're-- if you have any skills like we all do, yeah,
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.640]   PC's not a big deal.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.040]   We know how to run virus scanners and all the rest of it.
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.820]   I'm talking about the guy on the street, the average new guy, or some guy who's a bonehead,
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:54.140]   which is 99% of the users, they don't read computer magazines.
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:55.660]   They don't get virus scanners.
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:56.660]   They don't get--
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.660]   You're right.
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:58.660]   You're right.
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.980]   They just get a Mac and get it over with until somebody attacks that platform, and then
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.180]   it's a different story.
[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.780]   Well, you know, according-- by the way, Apple and Microsoft had great results, but let
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.300]   me just focus real quickly on Apple's quarterly results.
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.660]   They sold more Macs last quarter than they've ever sold.
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:16.520]   100,000 more Macs than they've ever sold, something like 2.5 million Macs.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.480]   Their profits were through the roof.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.640]   But here's the interesting stat from this quarterly report.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.480]   There are a couple actually I thought they were quite interesting.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:28.080]   One is that half of the new buyers at the Apple stores, half of the people going in
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.720]   there to buy Macs, not the new buyers, all buyers are new to Mac.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.760]   They're either coming from the Windows platform or have never owned a computer, half.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.320]   So I think the switch is starting to happen.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.560]   The other thing I thought was very interesting is they admitted that about a quarter million
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:46.940]   of the iPhones sold, 1.6 iPhones sold, million iPhones sold, about a quarter million of them
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.740]   were never activated and are very likely unlocked.
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:56.740]   Yeah, well, at least some people have some brains, which brings us to another story.
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:57.740]   831 bucks.
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.180]   Yeah, why don't you tell us this one?
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:05.580]   I think this is from an analyst at Piper Jaffrey published in the New York Times.
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.560]   So I can give it some credence.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:16.760]   He says the deal Apple made with AT&T gives them 18 bucks a month from the AT&T fees.
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:21.080]   That means that Apple besides making the 400 bucks up front on the iPhone makes another
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:24.000]   $431 over the two year contract.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.200]   No, it is an 831 over two years.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:33.040]   It's 831 bucks over two years, including the 400 bucks in the iPhones or the $399 in the
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.920]   iPhone purchase.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:39.640]   So Apple, those quarter million unlocked phones are costing Apple a pretty penny.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:45.320]   So basically the dummies who buy these iPhones are spending $1,200 for the phone.
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.520]   No, wait a minute.
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.000]   Any phone you buy, you're going to have a two year activation and you're going to be
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.080]   spending that kind of money.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.480]   No, not the phones I buy.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.560]   Yeah, because you buy burners.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.960]   You're like a drug dealer.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.960]   No.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.200]   I'm like a sensible person.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.400]   The only reason the drug dealers buy these things is because they can't afford to have phones.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.400]   The point is-
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.400]   No, because they're for security.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.400]   So they're not being-
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.400]   They can afford phones.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.440]   I think they can afford phones, yes.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.440]   Oh, okay.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.440]   So why not wear it, Matt?
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.440]   Don't you watch the wire?
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.440]   I was misled.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.960]   But whatever the case is, they-
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.080]   Well, that's another good reason to have these things if you can't be traced.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.440]   I mean, who wants somebody to dog in your phone?
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:26.760]   Just go down to the streets of Oakland and you'll see cell phones on the gutters everywhere.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:27.920]   Just throw it away.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:28.920]   Burners.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.960]   Yes, but that's what these phones are worth.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:37.120]   They're cheap, but sure is a lot cheaper than paying 1200 bucks.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.120]   I don't know.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.120]   I think this seems awful.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.120]   That's what those service-
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:44.800]   Do you think 18 bucks a month is not what Apple's getting?
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.080]   No, there's no way anyone knows, to be honest with you.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:52.040]   But maybe in the beginning, but over time are they really paying $18 per-
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.840]   Over the course of a two-year agreement-
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.840]   This analyst-
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.840]   24 months.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.680]   Gene Munster, this analyst says he's poured over Apple's financial statements, gone over
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:04.080]   it with a fine-tooth comb, and he believes he's got the smoking gun that proves it's
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.560]   $18 a month.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.200]   I'm no CPA, I can't tell, but-
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.360]   I'm sure he's right.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.360]   Makes sense.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:14.880]   Well, that's why Verizon turned their backs on Apple.
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:15.880]   And you know what?
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.440]   It's been to AT&T's benefit.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.200]   It's their number one selling phone.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.520]   I think they estimated about a third of all the people who buy iPhones are new customers
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.520]   to AT&T.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:30.320]   So remember, Apple's getting 18 bucks, but AT&T's getting 42 bucks, at least.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.560]   Yes, so we're not only like getting ripped off on the phones, but we're also supporting
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.880]   a crummy company, unresponsive company like AT&T.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:38.880]   Good work.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:39.880]   Did you see the story?
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.400]   And it's a great story, unfortunately.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.080]   It's not a real story anymore.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:49.320]   But during the fires in the Southland, a couple was on their honeymoon, the house burned down,
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.320]   terrible.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:55.320]   Apple from AT&T for the cable box or the dish saying, you know, it's-
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.320]   Pay up immediately.
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.320]   Pay up because you lost the day or else.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.520]   Now, yeah, but they asked them to take away for their insurance to pay for it.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.240]   The AT&T spokesperson said, "No, pay now."
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.320]   Now, AT&T's backpedaled a little bit.
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.720]   They said, "Oh, that was a customer service rep who didn't know what he was doing, but
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.620]   I have to go one-
[00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.120]   Oh, yeah, they backpedaled because it got on the news.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.120]   Yeah, that's exactly right.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.120]   That's the only reason they backpedaled.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.120]   Give me a break.
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.760]   The customer service rep was reading right out of the book.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.760]   I guarantee it.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.520]   Yeah, that's all they do.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.520]   Yeah, he made it up.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.320]   Oh, no, let me make up a policy.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.120]   Yeah, give it to us.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.720]   We want the money.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.960]   They're not freelancing like that, I don't think.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.440]   So Apple's great results, very good results.
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.440]   Microsoft, excellent results.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:38.560]   In fact, the Microsoft stock, both Apple and Microsoft stock at new highs, it was a good
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.480]   quarter for PC manufacturers.
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.640]   Why was Microsoft stock up, John?
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:46.000]   You've been harping on the weakness of Microsoft stock for years now.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.280]   No, I've been harping on the weakness of Microsoft.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.280]   Oh, that's right.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:53.760]   I actually think that the stock is undervalued because it hasn't moved for the last five
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:54.760]   years.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.200]   It's probably not a bad thing to buy.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.520]   I've also changed my tune on what I think Microsoft's going to become.
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:04.120]   I'm thinking because there's so derivative, I wrote this column for MarketWatch describing
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.520]   this, there's so derivative that they're always trying to copy somebody else and who
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.320]   has Bill Gates's best friend?
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.600]   Warren Buffett.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.840]   And what does Warren Buffett do?
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.720]   He's basically just a full-time investor with Berkshire Hathaway.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.640]   They just buy companies and sell companies.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.120]   This is essentially a giant holding company.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:25.480]   And Microsoft can do this just as easily as Buffett and there's no reason that they won't.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.440]   And that's what I think they're going to end up becoming.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:31.520]   And that's why some of the stuff you've been hearing with Ballmer and some of these other
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.760]   guys talking about making more money and advertising, 50% of their revenues can come
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:36.920]   from advertising.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:41.000]   It sounds like they're already starting to downplay their core business and they're starting
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   to think about other things.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.760]   Get out of operating systems and get into Google?
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:50.920]   Well, they just say, and I'm just listening to what he says and that's what he's going
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:51.920]   on about.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.360]   They want to become another Google and I think they're going to become another Berkshire Hathaway.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.840]   And look at this Vista thing.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:01.800]   It's all they say they've done well, they got sued by that big chain in England that
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.120]   for $40 million saying that nobody's buying Vista.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.360]   And yeah, Microsoft sells a lot of this just because people have to put it on, they bundle
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.360]   it.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:14.480]   But for the most part, this operating system's a joke compared to what Apple just came out
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.480]   with.
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:22.720]   A story that just came out of the independent in the UK, which is a reliable newspaper,
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:29.840]   the British Educational and Technological Agency, Becta, is warning schools don't buy
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:36.680]   Microsoft's software because of Microsoft's anti-competitive practices.
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:43.360]   They're concerned the talks are going so badly with the Office of Fair Trade that these
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:46.680]   programs may be pulled.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:52.040]   They're saying also the interoperability with existing software is going to be a problem.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.760]   The watchdog reminded schools they must buy law have licenses for software, but urge them
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.880]   to look for a perpetual deal that did not involve extra costs.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.960]   In the interim, our advice to schools considering moving to Microsoft's school agreement subscription
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:08.080]   licensing model is they should not do so.
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.720]   You know, I've never in the last final Microsoft's been hated for years now.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:17.800]   But in the last five years, and especially even this year, I've never seen anything so
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.520]   bad, such a PR nightmare for one company.
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.360]   You know, first you have Vista and it's a flop.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.960]   They're not necessarily a flop yet, but you know, it's a disaster, like John said.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.360]   And you have this issue.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.400]   And like you said, the left side's not talking to the right.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.400]   You know, half of the time they're talking about how wonderful Vista is, how wonderful
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.400]   the company is doing.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.520]   The other time they're talking about, oh, the next Windows is going to be great.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.240]   Windows 7, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.240]   What's going on?
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.240]   It's just falling apart.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.240]   Don't you think so?
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.440]   It's just pile on.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.960]   It's, you know, everybody hates a winner.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.800]   We build you up to knock you down.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.200]   You don't, you don't think it's that?
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.640]   I mean, Google's a winner.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.640]   No one hates them yet.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:52.640]   It will.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.640]   It's just a matter of time.
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.640]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.840]   Now, Microsoft's winning days are over.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.680]   I mean, it's not that everyone hates a winner.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:03.840]   Everybody hates a, hates a company that's unresponsive and then they're arrogant and
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.000]   they have all these issues.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.640]   That's not just being a winner.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.640]   Everybody hates a winner.
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.640]   And I don't think that's true.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.640]   People love winners.
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.680]   The Dallas Cowboys were America's team.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.080]   People love the Boston Red Sox.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.080]   These are winners.
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.640]   You know, and I think if anything speaks to that, go Sox.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.640]   Go Sox.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:22.080]   We're recording this before the game, but I would love to see the Sox sweep.
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.160]   I think that, you know, I'd be hard for them to not sweep.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.120]   Don, you're not a Sox fan.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.120]   Leo, I'm from New York.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.120]   I'm a Yankees fan.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.120]   Come on.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.120]   I'm so sorry.
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.120]   Yankees, are they still have a baseball team?
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.120]   Barely.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.120]   I think they do.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.600]   Hey, I got a question for you, Mr. Yankees fan.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.600]   Oh, here we go.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:39.840]   I'm going to get dinged again.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.640]   Should never have said that.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:47.480]   So I mean, some years ago, there was a team in Florida that got into the World Series
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.480]   and then they won the Marlins.
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.600]   Yeah, that's the name of them.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:57.360]   And they had a picture named Josh Beckett, who was just a total stopper in that in two
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.360]   games.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.360]   There was nobody could touch him.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.400]   Beckett, of course, they broke up the team and Beckett went elsewhere and started floating
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.400]   around.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.960]   And then they over some years later, the Boston Red Sox picked him up.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.160]   And now he's the stud of the year.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:14.640]   Why didn't the Yankees in all those years notice this guy and put him on their staff?
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.800]   They're too busy spending money on garbage is what the problem is.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.800]   They're spending money.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.800]   That's what I wanted to do.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:20.800]   That's what I wanted to do.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.600]   And Dr. Annie Johnson and the rest of those losers.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.600]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:24.600]   I just don't understand it.
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.600]   They're just watching.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.600]   I just don't know where that's going.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.920]   The team's going, but I'm still going to love them.
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:29.920]   How can you?
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:30.920]   I don't understand.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:31.920]   I got rid of that.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.400]   Everybody loves a winner.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.120]   How can you love the Yankees?
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:40.320]   They bought in all of these World Series one after the other.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.360]   Most of the time they wasted their money, Leo.
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.520]   And then half the time they do it stupidly.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.520]   Exactly.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.520]   How could you love the Yankees?
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.520]   I don't get it.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.520]   He's a local boy.
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.520]   He's like, I got to do it.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.520]   I got to do.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.520]   I love the Mets.
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.520]   They're the underdogs.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.520]   In the 90s, it wasn't like that.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.160]   So that's where I was really a huge.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.160]   All right.
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.160]   It was a whole team.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:04.280]   So you like that thing that was done on ESPN with the Yankee story from the 70s with Reggie
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.160]   Jackson character and the rest of them.
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.160]   I watched that.
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.160]   That was interesting.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.160]   Did you watch it?
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.760]   I haven't seen it, but I thought it was just hilarious because I was, you know, what happened?
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.320]   What's the gist of it?
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.920]   Oh, is that Billy Martin was a psychopath?
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:20.920]   He was.
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:21.920]   He was.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:22.920]   He beat up a toilet.
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.320]   Beat it in submission.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.320]   Just killed it.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.320]   Dead.
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.560]   Actually, it was the little urinal in the dugout, right?
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.840]   Anyway, back to Microsoft.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:32.840]   They did have it.
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.840]   Look, they had a good quarter.
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.480]   They had a very good quarter.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.640]   They always have a good quarter.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.400]   They're in really good shape and they're in the Xbox.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.400]   They are.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:44.280]   The Xbox is making money for the first time ever 300 million worldwide for Halo in its
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.200]   opening week.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:50.320]   I mean, their revenues for the quarter, 1.93 billion on Xbox.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.200]   I think Microsoft really gets gaming.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:57.000]   More than anything else, I think what we've learned is they know how to win a gaming because
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.880]   they go off to software developers.
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.880]   They don't.
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.200]   They don't ostracize them like Nintendo does.
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.440]   They know what they're doing in gaming.
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.400]   If they can do that everywhere else, then they'll be okay.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.880]   Obviously they can't obviously do it anywhere else at all because that's not the way they
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.880]   come to the operates.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.320]   Let's bring up one point that you make.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:18.480]   It wasn't until last week because I was a big Xbox supporter and I've been following
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.720]   the Xbox story from the get-go.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:26.000]   The Xbox 360 arcade comes out, right?
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.920]   To be honest about, until I was reading an article mid last week, I didn't realize that
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.240]   this was a little box.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.240]   I thought it was a game.
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.280]   Oh, it's not a game for the Xbox 360?
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.280]   No, no.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.280]   It's a.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.280]   Oh, see, you're in the same boat.
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.280]   I am.
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.280]   This is how bad they're being.
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.280]   It's a week.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.280]   It's a week clone.
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.200]   That's a bad name then.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.560]   It's a totally bad name.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:52.120]   It's a completely bad name because when I first heard I thought Xbox 360 arcade, oh, okay.
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.760]   It's going to be some sort of a game package.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.640]   I can play Pac-Man on my Xbox 360.
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.640]   Right.
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:58.640]   You saw it.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.280]   See, you were thinking the same thing I was thinking.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.280]   It's a separate console?
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:08.840]   Yeah, I mean, I think I'm pretty sure it replaced the core bundle.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.360]   But it's still an Xbox 360.
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.360]   Oh, no, it's a little weed.
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.040]   It's designed for the Wii market.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.920]   Well, it's a cheap Xbox 360.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.480]   Yeah, I mean, I think it goes for like $2.79 or something like that.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.880]   It's a cheap little machine.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:27.280]   It's a cheap little machine designed to attack the Wii market.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.280]   Well, somebody's got to.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.280]   Nintendo is just on fire.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:35.720]   Well, Microsoft doesn't, they've already made noise about the fact that they're not going
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:39.720]   to compete with the creative gaming, new gaming ideas of Nintendo.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:48.600]   And instead they're going to license a bunch of cartoon characters from Disney and elsewhere
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.880]   and think that's going to draw the kids in.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:54.600]   You know, licensing has been the death of gaming time and time again.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:59.240]   The only licensing that's ever worked in gaming has been major, major sports.
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:06.040]   Every time they license a, I mean, look at James Bond, none of this stuff is any good.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.040]   Harry Potter maybe.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.920]   All right, Harry Potter might have been a little bit of a success.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.440]   Well, what else was nice?
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.840]   The old Republic was big at the time.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:13.840]   What was that based on?
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.640]   Is that a movie?
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.840]   No, I thought was a Star Wars.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:18.840]   I don't know.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:19.840]   Oh, Star Wars.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:21.840]   You know what?
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:22.840]   The Star Wars stuff hasn't been too bad.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:23.840]   All right, I take it back.
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:24.840]   Let's not get good either.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:25.840]   Not compared to the original game.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:26.840]   It's not Halo 3.
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:27.840]   It's not Halo 3.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.840]   Yeah.
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.920]   It's Halo 3.
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.600]   So let's see moving on.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:41.400]   The US tops the list, Mr. I get no spam of spam offending countries according to Sophos,
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.920]   which Friday released its quarterly report on the dirty dozen, the countries that send
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:46.920]   the most spam.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:54.840]   The US is responsible for 28.4% of all spam, then South Korea 5% China 4% Russia 4% Brazil
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:55.840]   3.7.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.440]   Yeah, but you got to remember for people out there.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.960]   It's not coming from us.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.720]   This doesn't mean that we're the guys that are right.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:06.160]   We don't mean that doesn't mean we're the originators of the spam.
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:10.480]   It's the fact that these are the zombie bot machines that are infected.
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.560]   That's why I tell people by a Macintosh.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.560]   It's worse.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.560]   We're not making any money on it.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:15.960]   They're just using us.
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:16.960]   Right.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:21.000]   The people that have their machines are robotized by these spam guys because they're stupidly
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.240]   downloaded of Trojan horse and clicked on yes to install.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.760]   And the next thing you know, the machine what night, by the way, people turn your machines
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:30.760]   off at night.
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:31.760]   Oh, really?
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:32.760]   Is that the key?
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:33.760]   Is that going to solve it all?
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.760]   I think that's the main key.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.600]   If you keep the machine off when you're not using it, it's not going to start sending spam
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.600]   out.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:47.000]   Did you guys see the guy in the, I think he's worth 47% of the Viagra spam in the world?
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.800]   He was killed by the Russian mafia.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:49.800]   Good.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:50.800]   And he put it in.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.840]   Because he had an erection for four years.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:53.840]   It was.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:54.840]   That'll do it.
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:55.840]   That'll do it.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:00.320]   The joke I heard a communist says, if you have an erection lasting for more than four hours,
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.320]   call your doctor.
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.760]   And the guy says, call my doctor.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:03.760]   I'm going to call everybody.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:04.760]   I know.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:05.760]   Yeah.
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.200]   So they killed him for what?
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.200]   I don't know.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.200]   They never really got into it.
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.720]   I guess it was some spat with the Russian mafia.
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:16.280]   And I guess they're really into a cyber crimes, the Russian mafia is and he did something
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.280]   to piss them off.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:20.360]   And the next thing he knows, he had a bullet lodged in the back of his brain.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.720]   I guess that's the calling card.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.800]   The guys you don't want to mess with are the Chechens.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.400]   I don't think I don't mess with anyone.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.840]   I think you want to mess with any of them.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:31.080]   Oh, no, I'm not so worried about the Russian mafia.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.880]   It's the Chechens that worry me.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:33.880]   Hey, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:34.880]   I didn't say that.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:35.880]   That was Will Harris talking.
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.760]   Will Harris joining us for Moxford, England.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:38.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.760]   Did I wake you will?
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.120]   No, you know what?
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.600]   The time difference just changed.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.600]   Oh, I forgot.
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.400]   Our clocks don't go back.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.400]   Yours do.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.400]   I'll do.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.920]   So I completely got the timing wrong.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:54.520]   Thanks to the genius of the US government who is trying to save energy.
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.120]   We don't set our clocks back till next week.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.120]   Right.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:01.600]   So we can have a nice Halloween night where all the kids it's daylight.
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:02.600]   Right.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.600]   Yeah.
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.600]   No, vice versa.
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:05.600]   It's dark at three in the afternoon.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.160]   No, that's after.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.480]   No, Halloween's going to be before we switch the clocks.
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.480]   Right.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.480]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.480]   You know what?
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.480]   I think the fact that nobody ever understands time change.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.880]   Clearly, that's my problem.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.080]   Maybe we should have something about it.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.080]   Totally.
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.080]   And I think as you never learned, do you?
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.080]   No, you go ahead.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.080]   You're going to say, "Yeah, you do it."
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.080]   Yeah, you don't know.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.080]   So you're right, John.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.800]   They would have more darkness because it's instead of six o'clock, it's five o'clock
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.960]   and it's pitch black.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.120]   I get it.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.880]   So it would be better for Halloween except we don't really want Halloween to be longer
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.080]   and darker, do we?
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.840]   Well, it's always been traditionally.
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.000]   I mean, there's only this year that's going to be one hour more of sunlight.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   Right.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   So I don't know.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.600]   More daily, just to aid your house.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.600]   That's all.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.600]   We'll have you and sweet.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.480]   We missed our discussion on leper just at the early part.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:57.840]   But I just, out of curiosity, was there a big line in Britain, a leopard popular?
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.240]   Did you install it?
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:05.560]   Well, they had the Apple store closed down and then reopened at six o'clock.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.000]   And there was a bit of a queue outside.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   What is that?
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.640]   No, I haven't had a chance to install it yet.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.640]   Oh, you haven't?
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.640]   Big.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.160]   Well, John and I have both concluded we love it.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.600]   Well, it's, but it's not that much.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.600]   Oh, no.
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.000]   We're not starting the discussion over.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.040]   Hey, but there is a story.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.040]   There is something will.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:30.240]   What was the story we talked about earlier, Leo, where something was going on in England?
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.400]   Oh, yeah, the schools and Microsoft.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.800]   Yeah, back to his toldy schools in Britain.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:39.160]   Don't buy the Microsoft education subscription package.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:43.920]   We're not sure we're even going to be able to support Microsoft if this anti Microsoft
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:46.600]   that prosecution goes forward.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.800]   They really didn't like hearing Europe.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.880]   You know, Microsoft get a kicking down there.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.880]   Little American.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:52.880]   Yeah.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:53.880]   Please.
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.880]   Well, it's funny because in America, we've gone through this since 1998 and it's kind
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.440]   of all been settled.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.200]   And now it's just started up again for Microsoft with the EU.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.000]   Yeah, I think it's pretty harsh.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   I think it's going to be looking at Google closely with Microsoft.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Why?
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.400]   Microsoft is not the evil giant that it was in 1998.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.680]   I mean, they're less of a monopoly.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:15.840]   They're their monopolistic practices seem to have gone away.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:16.840]   Huh?
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.840]   Huh?
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.160]   And then I was evil OEM deals anymore.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.160]   Oh, they can't.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:24.640]   They're more like the Russians and Google's like the Chechens now.
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:28.880]   Well, what is Google doing bad that you think they should be watched closely?
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.000]   Yeah, well, what's Google doing?
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.120]   No, don't get me wrong.
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.120]   I love Google.
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:40.200]   I drink the Kool-Aid like everybody else, but it does seem like the privacy stuff is
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.920]   something to keep an eye on.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:48.440]   The problem I have with Google is they are so good at offering us stuff we want that
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.480]   we just go like lambs to the slaughter.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.160]   Yeah, Google, I'll put I'll give you all my data.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.440]   Just give me eye map on my Gmail account.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.240]   Anything you want.
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.320]   I love you, Google.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.000]   Do you guys all get upgraded this week?
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   I did.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   I keep waiting.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   I'm excited.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   I want I'm excited.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   What?
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   Google is at an eye map to Gmail.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   Yeah, I know who cares.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.720]   That is the most geeky that people kept saying in the chat room on the radio show.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.320]   The radio show is a general purpose show for everybody.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.880]   They keep saying, "When are you going to talk about eye map on Gmail?"
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:23.200]   And I said, "I don't think anybody even knows what that is."
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.360]   But the Twitter audience does.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.840]   I pay right now.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.040]   I pay fast mail.
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.720]   What do I pay?
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.720]   Like 30 or 40 bucks a month?
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.160]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.160]   A year.
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.600]   I'm sorry for eye map.
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.720]   And I would love to have it on Gmail.
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:40.480]   Plus for things like the iPhone, it'll be a real boom.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:41.480]   I would love for you.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:42.480]   Yeah.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.480]   Fast.
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.480]   Why?
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:45.480]   Why are you paying for any email?
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:47.480]   You never answer your email.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:50.480]   It's like a storage locker.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.160]   It's like the study.
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.120]   You just pay 30 bucks and you tie it away.
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.640]   And let me tell you something.
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:32:00.120]   If the new mail unleopard, you know, it has a bunch of new features.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:03.760]   One of the things is it allows you to make notes as your...
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.160]   Really, the notes are basically, I think, draft messages.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.440]   But if you're on an eye map account, it stores them on eye maps.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.640]   So they're available everywhere.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.640]   I love that.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.640]   And the to-do lists.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.920]   I like the new mail a lot, actually.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:15.920]   But no, I don't have it.
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.520]   Do you have eye map on your Gmail?
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:18.520]   Will?
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:22.680]   And I put it on my iPhone and it's rocking.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.680]   Brilliant.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.680]   Look at the plates.
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.880]   I like eye map.
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:26.880]   How about you guys?
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:32.280]   I just pour my mail from Gmail to my real account and then let that be an eye map account
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:33.720]   run by somebody privately.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:34.960]   Yeah, you're using pop.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.120]   But see, now you can use eye map.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.120]   You wouldn't have to do that.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.120]   No, not using pop.
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.120]   I use eye map.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:43.800]   And I use squirrel mail to get my mail 90% of the time on the web.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:47.120]   And I do it through Mark Pechel's computer time down here.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.480]   And he's the one who keeps me from getting spam.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:50.480]   I use pine.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:55.320]   That's how I do it.
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.720]   Mark Pechel, you get no spam.
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:02.120]   See, maybe if I got no spam, I'd answer my email.
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:07.120]   I actually wrote a big page on my blog that explains why you shouldn't send me an email
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:10.520]   email and it pretty much resolves down to because I'm not going to read it and I'm not
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.720]   going to answer it.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.920]   You know what's weird?
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:14.920]   People still see that.
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:17.200]   They read that and they still send me mail.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.200]   Yeah, it's weird.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.360]   It's true that you don't read your email.
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.560]   I don't read it and I don't answer it.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.960]   It's a dog send me email.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:28.080]   Did anyone else get inundated with PayPal messages?
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:31.440]   Yes, I got 500 PayPal messages to my account.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.520]   And I was wondering what is going on here?
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:34.720]   Anyone else getting that?
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:35.720]   No.
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.480]   You know, spam goes in waves like that.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.480]   And I don't know.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.640]   It's like you got on a list.
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:45.120]   All of a sudden, I'm getting a lot of Nigerian 419 scams.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.120]   I love those.
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.680]   I get those too a lot.
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.600]   But these are new ones.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.600]   They're actually-
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:51.600]   Yeah, no, save them.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.600]   Save them.
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.600]   Save them.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.600]   I'm collecting them.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:55.600]   Oh, I'll send them to you.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.600]   Yeah, I mean, they're clever.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.240]   Now they're coming from Canada and they sound more reasonable.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.560]   You almost want to fall for them.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:06.000]   But I could make a lot of money.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.960]   If only it was $1,000 cheaper.
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.320]   I won the lottery on believable.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.960]   Who does Sanke?
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.640]   Well, I also believe she might stay with me if my member gets larger.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:17.640]   So there you go.
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.160]   I don't know.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:24.400]   And I'm just looking right now through my email.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.800]   That's where that came from.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.560]   Let me see if I can find you some of these 419s.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:33.760]   Actually, why is Sanke getting in my spam bucket?
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.960]   I think Google does a pretty good job with spam.
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:41.080]   But for some reason, the 419 scams seem to get through a lot.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.480]   Is the PayPal stuff on your Google account, Donner?
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:44.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.480]   Yeah, Gmail.
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.480]   Oh, there you go.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:47.720]   There you have it.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:49.080]   So much for that.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.080]   Next.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.040]   I'm looking through it here.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.520]   Trying to find some good 419s.
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.840]   I'll save them for next time.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.840]   You're going to like this.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.960]   Well, first of all, we talked about the internet's tax and good news.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.680]   The House of Representatives that found the wire at the last minute, they extended the
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:11.600]   internet tax moratorium in the US for seven years, which is kind of a good compromise.
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.440]   So seven more years, no tax.
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.640]   John, you'll be happy about that.
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.640]   I'm happy.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:16.840]   I'm sure you're disappointed, Leo.
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.840]   No, I think we need more taxation.
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:19.840]   Right.
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.840]   Because it builds roads.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.840]   It protects our society.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:28.840]   It helps pay to our elective officials who work so hard for us.
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:31.200]   I got a pot hell.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.760]   A pot hole out in front of my house.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.760]   No, John, can you convince me last week or two weeks ago, John?
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:39.240]   I am now anti-tax.
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:42.560]   That and the fact that I had to write a massive check to the federal government on October
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.880]   15th, the Court of Appeals, get this, get this.
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:51.320]   The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued a ruling last week approving the FCC's
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:59.360]   new order, eliminating the requirement that large phone companies provide access to independent
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:02.920]   ISPs at set non-discriminatory rates.
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:08.440]   It's the end of the independent ISP in the US.
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:16.960]   Essentially the FCC ruled in the court upheld unbelievably that the big telcos could just
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:21.280]   say to an independent ISP, no, it's going to cost you three times more to offer a tax
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:26.200]   DSL than we have to, than we charge.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.520]   That's it for the independent ISPs.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:28.520]   I'm just devastated.
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.920]   I don't know why this didn't get more coverage.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:33.800]   I'm actually reading this in the register, which is a British website.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:38.880]   I'm excited to hear about it until today myself.
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.480]   Somehow it got under the radar.
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:44.480]   It should be people should be squawking like there's no tomorrow about this.
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.640]   I use an independent ISP.
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.680]   I use, in fact, two different independent ISPs.
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.040]   At home, I have sonic.net.
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.040]   I have DSL extreme here.
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.640]   That's what we're using in the office.
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:56.400]   Both these guys are going to be in big trouble because up to now they've been protected by
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.600]   the FCC.
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:02.320]   The phone company who provides the copper into the house has had to give them access to the
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:06.040]   central office, allow them to put their DSL switches in there and had, and given them
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:10.240]   a reasonable cost so that they could provide competitive services.
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:13.640]   But now there's nothing to make the phone company give them competitive prices.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.400]   They could say, "Well, no, if you want to put your switch in our office, it's going
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:20.720]   to cost you 180 bucks a customer."
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:23.840]   This means our choices are going to dwindle.
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:28.960]   By the way, this works really nicely with a whole move by big ISPs towards blocking things
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.960]   like BitTorrent.
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.040]   Folks pay attention to this stuff.
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:36.600]   If all of a sudden you can't download Leopard via BitTorrent next month, you'll know why.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:37.760]   It's the FCC.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:38.760]   Wait a minute.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:39.760]   That doesn't come out right.
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:40.760]   No, it is the FCC.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:41.760]   They suck.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:46.360]   It's FCC combined with the public utilities commissions.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.640]   Things that don't do anything is a disaster.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:51.640]   What about Oink?
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:54.200]   Now this guy is a Brit, right?
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.200]   Well, yeah.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.880]   Alan Ellis, he's 24 years old.
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:03.280]   When he was 21, he created an invite-only file sharing site called Oink.
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:07.840]   That might have been his mistake, the name.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.240]   That's maybe where he went wrong.
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.240]   He's been shut down.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:15.120]   He has 180,000 members were shut down on Tuesday.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.840]   And he's being prosecuted.
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.720]   It's part of an inter-Paul-led investigation.
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.080]   I mean, come on.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.560]   Hasn't Interpol got something better to do than-
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:25.560]   Well, they're doing their-
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:26.560]   Well, they're doing their-
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.760]   They're doing their track-down 20-some things, you know, sharing TV shows.
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:29.760]   They're doing it.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.840]   What about white slavery or something like that?
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.160]   That might be more interesting.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.160]   It's really- it's if-
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.160]   But it's doing it, of course.
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:38.960]   The International Federation of the Photographic Industry.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.520]   Because it's the record companies are trying to get these- and the movie companies try
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:42.680]   to get this guy shut down.
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:43.760]   He says, "I haven't done anything wrong.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.880]   I don't believe my website breaks the law.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.840]   They don't understand how it works."
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:48.920]   It's a bit torrent tracker.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.680]   The website is very different from how the police are making it out to be.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.040]   There are- there's no music sold on the site.
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.800]   I'm doing nothing wrong.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:01.920]   So it's the same argument that, you know, people at the Pirate Bay, everybody else use,
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:05.120]   which is we're not hosting downloadable content.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.120]   We're not-
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:07.120]   It's not Googling.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.120]   We're hosting anything illegal.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.120]   We are pointing links to stuff.
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.120]   It's a file finder.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.360]   Yeah, the argument is that it's the same as Google.
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:13.680]   You know, why not go after that?
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.680]   It's Google, which quite-
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:15.680]   Well, it's a file.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.680]   It's a file links to illegal content.
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:18.240]   Because Google's not named Oink.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:21.160]   Well, I think there's more to it than Google's use for other things.
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.160]   This is only used for that.
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:27.160]   And I think that's how there's some point of the law that that that applies here.
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.160]   Well, yeah.
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:31.640]   In fact, remember the decision against- I think it was Grokster and E. Donkey where
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:40:01.640]   the U.S. Supreme Court said it's- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In- In-
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:06.880]   you got to like the Pirate Bay guys because of course they come right in and they say,
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.840]   "Okay, we'll take it over from here."
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.640]   Where is he?
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:13.840]   You can't get us here.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:18.080]   This is more of that war on the IFPI and the roughly hijacked the domain.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:23.680]   These guys, you have to love Pirate Bay because they miss no opportunity to immediately stick
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:24.680]   it to the guy.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.680]   They've renamed it Boink.
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:27.680]   From Boink.
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:32.800]   And it's Boink.cd if you want to go there.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.800]   Boink.cd.
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.760]   I haven't gone there yet.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:39.840]   Now I think if you are a Boink member, you might be a little nervous because of course
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:44.720]   he's got logs of all 180,000 members and what they downloaded.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.000]   That's kind of silly.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.600]   I'd be a little nervous if I were a Oink.
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:52.720]   Do you actually track what they download or what they looked for?
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:53.720]   I don't know.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:56.000]   That's a good question.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   I don't know.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.520]   I think people who are Oink members are a little nervous.
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.680]   But it's unknown what's going to happen.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:03.680]   Have you gone to Boink.cd?
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:06.200]   Yes, I can't get it up.
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.200]   It doesn't come up.
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.200]   Wait a minute.
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.040]   I've got a spam just for you.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.040]   You're right.
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.040]   It doesn't come up.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.880]   Maybe that's an error.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:15.680]   Is there even a .cd domain?
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.680]   I've never heard of it.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:17.680]   I've never heard of it.
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:19.320]   Go to Google and ask for a Boink site.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:22.640]   Nowadays everyone just goes to Google.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:23.800]   College sex by the people.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:24.800]   Boink.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:28.240]   Boink is an magazine of erotica.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.240]   Boink.
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:32.160]   College sex by people having it.
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.160]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.160]   Oh wait a minute.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.160]   Here it is.
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:36.160]   Riding attire for women.
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.960]   No, that can't be it.
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.520]   Boink at Questri and that's what you're looking at.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:41.520]   Boinkcatalog.com.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:45.760]   Progressive Boink at Sesame Street.
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.920]   I guess they haven't got Boink up yet.
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:48.920]   Let me look at this.
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.920]   It doesn't look like it's running.
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:59.960]   There is a delay between the time a new site pops up and how quickly Google gets it though,
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:00.960]   right?
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.760]   I don't like the picture.
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:05.480]   No, that's not true.
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:12.480]   Yeah, it is true but within hours generally speaking if things start to hit it.
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.720]   So it would be here.
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:15.720]   If it was running, I guarantee Google.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:20.880]   Unless they put a block on it, which could be, you know, you can have a little bit of
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:24.920]   a little message to the robot saying, no, I don't want to be tracked by Google and Google
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:25.920]   won't look at it.
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:26.920]   Yeah, the robots.txt.
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:29.920]   There is a blog wire.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:30.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:31.920]   Okay.
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.200]   There is a .cd domain.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:37.800]   It's the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:38.800]   Wow.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:39.800]   This is interesting.
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:40.800]   This is interesting.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:49.000]   There's a very, there's a, there's a like a newspaper for P2P people called the wwwP2PNet.net.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.240]   And they have all the information about this.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:56.960]   Along with other stuff, it's actually quite a nice site.
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:59.120]   So what do you think?
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:02.400]   Does the Oink guy deserve to be prosecuted?
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:06.800]   He, he, all he did is provide a tracker, a bit torrent tracker.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:07.800]   Exactly.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.200]   You're going to be doing this stuff.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:11.640]   He doesn't deserve it but if you're going to be doing this stuff.
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:12.640]   He knows.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:14.640]   He knows what he's doing.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:18.480]   You know, unless you're in Sweden, you know, you're just asking for trouble.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.480]   Yeah.
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:23.840]   And also you should know better than to keep logs of everything.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:27.000]   And people who use these things, I want to say right now, if you're going to use these
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.320]   things unless you're just, you know, doing some like research for whatever reason, like
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:36.720]   for whatever reason, if you're going to use these things, find some systems out there
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:41.840]   that are anonymizing that get your IP and all the rest of it buried somewhere.
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:42.840]   You know what I use.
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:43.840]   Or go to a friend's house.
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:44.840]   Go to a friend's house.
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:46.840]   I use my neighbor's.
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:47.840]   I use my neighbor's open Wi-Fi.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:53.520]   But I will point out, go and figure that out, Leo.
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:54.520]   You're safe.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:55.520]   You know what I do?
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:56.520]   I use the news groups.
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:57.520]   The news groups are great.
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:03.000]   And I use a news group server, easy news that keeps no logs.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.360]   The problem with BitTorrent is it's you have a connection, IP to IP connection.
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:11.920]   Your IP is perfectly visible to the person you're downloading from.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.560]   But the news groups, no, people post that stuff up there.
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:18.520]   You download it as long as the news group site does not keep logs.
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:19.720]   You're safe.
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:25.200]   You know, a lot of people still pirate music through the IRC.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.320]   The IRC has a number, like a number.
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:30.280]   They have hundreds of music chat rooms.
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:33.440]   And everyone's populated by maybe 50 to 100 or 200 people.
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:36.000]   And people freely exchange music.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.760]   And I asked an IRC administrator once about this.
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:42.120]   I said, you know, and this was during the heyday where everyone's really freaked out
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:43.120]   about this.
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:49.560]   Everyone ever said anything to you about all these chat rooms that are just for music
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.200]   swapping.
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:54.600]   And he said, no, never, no one's ever said anything to anybody.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.080]   We don't know about that.
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:59.840]   And he says, yeah, and he says, you know, if they'd say something, we'd probably take
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.440]   them down, but nobody seems to care.
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:06.000]   I guess the numbers are just too small because they're looking for the thousands, you know,
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.560]   rather than a few dozen jokers.
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:10.960]   They're looking for the jammy Thomas is of the world.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.520]   Right.
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:14.040]   Or somebody, I don't know what it does.
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:15.040]   I don't quite get it.
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:21.280]   Or maybe they have looked into it and IRC users tend to be some of them tend to be, you know,
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:22.840]   they hide behind firewalls.
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:23.840]   And so I don't know.
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:26.040]   I think with IRC, your IP address is known.
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.040]   Yeah.
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.040]   Yes, bro.
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:29.040]   I mean, get your IP address real easy.
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.040]   Someone I know.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:36.080]   I don't know if I should say it for a fear of just don't say his name or her.
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:41.880]   Well, no, he runs one of those IRC file swapping or music swapping.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:45.560]   And he's been doing it for, I don't even know how five, six, seven years.
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:49.200]   And it's thinking he has like a thousand followers and stuff.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.200]   They're all swapping stuff.
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.960]   I'm just thinking to myself, where the hell is going on?
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:56.600]   It's just one day I met his house and he goes, look at this.
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:01.400]   I maybe the issue is this is more like the old school, you know, hey, I've got some music
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:04.920]   you want to listen to it kind of swapping and not the wholesale.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:08.840]   I want to put a song on my hard drive and make it available to everybody in the world
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.440]   kind of piracy.
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:13.680]   And that may be a distinction the record companies are willing to live with.
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:15.520]   You know, this is just one.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:19.640]   You know, be honest about Leo, I don't think they're willing to live with anything, but
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:22.200]   I think it's a prioritizing thing.
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:26.440]   It's obvious that if you're not a list of everything you want to crack down on, the IRC
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:29.200]   is probably at the bottom of the current list.
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.920]   It's one Z2 Z's.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:34.040]   And how different is it from bringing a CD over and sharing with your friend?
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.040]   Exactly what it is.
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:36.040]   Right.
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:38.680]   You know, and I think that's less of an issue, but you're right, John.
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:40.520]   They don't like that either.
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:41.760]   They shut it down if they could.
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:45.480]   And they don't want you to bring in a disc over and sharing it with your friends either.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:49.200]   Except that's got to be at the dead bottom of the list, but they crack down on that if
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.200]   they could.
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:51.200]   If they would, they could.
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:54.800]   Now, you guys have the same thing over here this week.
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:00.840]   There was an announcement that the record companies are going to sell music on USB sticks.
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:03.240]   Yeah, but they're not doing it in the States.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:07.680]   They're only doing it in the UK because apparently UK teenagers are stupid enough to buy this.
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:08.680]   This is lutely stupid.
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:09.680]   It's a cool thing.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:10.680]   Right.
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:15.040]   I mean, it used to be the CD singles cost, like £4.
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.040]   Right.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:18.800]   How much are these bracelets with the USB keys on them cost?
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.440]   Well, they've gone up to £10.
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:21.440]   Oh my God.
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:23.480]   And you don't even get a lot of CD?
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:26.240]   You could buy a gigabyte for like £10.
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:28.240]   You get a CD singles.
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:31.920]   And you get like the music video and some screensaver.
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:33.200]   And a ring, a ringtone.
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:34.200]   A ringtone.
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:38.920]   And so you think, well, why would you ever pay like up to £10 for a single?
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:42.840]   When you buy, I choose $20 US for people out there who want to do the calculation.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:43.840]   That's 20 bucks.
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:47.680]   Mommy, mommy, I'd like to buy this new Madonna single on a USB key.
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:48.680]   Okay.
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:49.680]   Smack.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:50.680]   What are you stupid?
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:53.960]   Oh, mommy, don't you love me?
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:54.960]   It is done.
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:56.920]   And it's going to be a flop and it's going to go away in about three seconds.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:57.920]   I don't think so.
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:01.400]   I think they're going to find a price point for it and it's going to be a huge success.
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:05.760]   Well, if they put them in cereal boxes, if the price point is low enough, sure, not
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:06.760]   20 bucks.
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:10.480]   No, 20 bucks is out of control.
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:11.920]   Take talking about out of control.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:17.480]   Microsoft buys a 1.6% stake in Facebook.
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:19.240]   Unbelievable for $200.
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.240]   Right.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:21.240]   It's gone.
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:31.320]   $240 million valuing the three year old company started by the Harvard Junior at $15 billion.
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:32.320]   Please.
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:33.320]   I don't know.
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:34.320]   Go ahead, John.
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:38.680]   Well, I did all the math on this in a column that I just ran in market watch.
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:41.040]   I think it's either on a Friday or Monday.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:45.560]   Anyway, I started to do some of the numbers and what it says is basically what you buy
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:50.360]   when you buy a company, typically you, you know, and if we're going to value it at $15
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:54.800]   billion, if you buy a company and we know that they probably do about $150 million in
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:59.120]   revenues and typically you'll buy a company at one time revenue, maybe 10 times revenues,
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:01.280]   not profits, but revenues.
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:02.280]   And that's the most you'd pay.
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:07.720]   They are paying 100 times revenues and it also values each customer, each individual
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:09.360]   customer who's not really a customer.
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:13.000]   They're just somebody who uses the website, not somebody buying anything and they're
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   valuing those people at $300 a head, which is completely out of control.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.520]   That's interesting math.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.520]   Wow.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:22.680]   300 bucks per user.
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:26.520]   This, you know, two, two parts of this are the most ludicrous things I've ever heard
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:27.520]   in my life.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:30.000]   One, like John said, $15 billion.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   I just don't see it.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.800]   Number one, he's in a business where the users are fickle.
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.160]   I mean, this will be popular.
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:37.600]   To be honest with you, I don't see this ever, you know, it's not going to be something
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:39.760]   that he said in the story, "Oh, we're going to go public.
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:40.760]   We're going to do this and that."
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:42.400]   Number one, he's not going to go public.
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:45.240]   Number two, you know, to be honest with you, sell now.
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:49.400]   You know, I mean, this, these things have a shelf life of say, you know, maybe five
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:52.080]   years, you know, because my space was big.
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:53.080]   Now Facebook is big.
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:55.160]   You know, years ago, live journal was big.
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:56.160]   Now it's a nothing.
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:57.960]   I mean, these people, they find new things.
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:59.440]   They say, "Wow, this is cool.
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:00.440]   This is better than Facebook.
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:01.440]   I'm going to leave."
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:02.440]   I mean, he's in a space book.
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:04.120]   I've gone to USBK with McDonald.
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:07.520]   No, I think you're absolutely right.
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:12.200]   Although from Microsoft's point of view, 240 million chump change, right?
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:13.200]   Absolutely.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:16.280]   And I mean, and it gets them maybe some cache.
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:17.800]   I mean, does it, here's the question.
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:21.520]   Is there anything, clearly it's overvaluing Facebook.
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:25.080]   I was stunned when he turned down 1.6 billion from Yahoo.
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:28.720]   There was obviously a deal done that gives Microsoft the sum.
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:29.720]   They're getting sum.
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:35.840]   No, yeah, no, they get the, it looks like the sole rights to buy, sell, broker, do whatever
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:37.480]   they have to do for all the advertising.
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:39.320]   See, this is what you were talking about, John.
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:41.240]   They're moving into the ad business.
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:42.800]   Microsoft's got this new ad platform.
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:43.800]   They got dig, remember.
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:47.480]   In fact, Dig's got to, Kevin's got to be kicking himself.
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.120]   Because really that's what they're buying on Facebook.
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:51.880]   They're buying the exclusive rights to do the advertising on Facebook.
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:53.080]   Yeah, it's a bribe.
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:55.360]   It's well worth 240 million.
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:58.160]   And Mark Zuckerberg's going, yeah, I'm worth 15 billion.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:01.000]   No, it's just they're buying the rights to, that's what they're buying.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.160]   They're not buying a stake in Facebook.
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:04.360]   They couldn't care less about the stake.
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:08.040]   And you know, you got to wonder, they did the same thing with Dig.
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:13.280]   They ousted Dig's, I guess it was Google and an FM or whoever, but they bought Mike,
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.600]   they bought into Dig, same thing.
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:17.440]   I don't think they gave him as much money.
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:21.040]   It's a way of Microsoft making themselves the kind of cool, hip advertising.
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:25.120]   You know, Microsoft, I think the number wasn't, I don't have this one correct, but it's worth
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:26.120]   looking into it.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:31.800]   Microsoft, I think they lost something like $77 million last year selling ads.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:33.920]   And I think they're just, it's a big loser for them.
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:36.680]   Well, I don't know what they hope to turn it around, right?
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:39.040]   Well, yeah, but we're worried about how do you lose money?
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.440]   This is a software company for God's sake.
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:42.920]   How do you lose money selling ads?
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:44.480]   I don't understand that.
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:47.840]   They're spending too much money marketing themselves to sell the ads, I guess.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:48.840]   I don't know.
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:53.600]   That's a $4,000 salesman.
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:55.080]   How could you lose money selling ads?
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.080]   I don't understand.
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:59.440]   You could lose money running a business, running a company, but selling ads.
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.720]   I'm just saying this is a number I ran into now that-
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:05.640]   No, I believe you know, if Microsoft could lose money at it, they will.
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:08.040]   And it's just constant Google envy is what it is.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:11.440]   I mean, just because of Google, just because the success of Google and what they've been
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:14.720]   able to accomplish, they don't even care about being a software company.
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:18.520]   They want to be the biggest, the baddest, the worst company, they're not worst.
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:20.120]   They're the baddest company in the world.
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:21.520]   And because of Google, they just don't seem-
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:24.280]   They feel like they can't do it because Google has MySpace.
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:25.960]   So now they need Facebook.
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:30.520]   When Google bought DoubleClick, they bought some unknown DoubleClick clone, right?
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:32.280]   Just because we have to have it now.
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:33.280]   Exactly.
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:37.080]   The thing is I'm convinced, and I think I've heard this from other people, that Google
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:42.240]   actually suckered Microsoft into this Facebook deal by showing interest, bidding it up like
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:47.000]   a shill at a crappy auction, and then pulling out laughing at themselves.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   You go, Eric.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   I like that.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   I like that story.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.480]   Now remember, Microsoft's got a lot of money.
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:53.160]   I love this quote from Charles DeBona.
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:55.680]   He's an analyst at Stanford C. Bernstein.
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:59.080]   He says, "Microsoft sneezes that much up in a day."
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:01.120]   It's not a big, big money for Microsoft.
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:05.640]   Well, they used to be pretty tight-fisted with their money, but now they're throwing
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:06.640]   it away.
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:07.640]   This is not a good sign.
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:09.280]   I don't care how much money they've got.
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:14.880]   I mean, the thing is, you know, everyone says Microsoft's only $100 million here and $200
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:15.880]   million there.
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:18.520]   You do enough of these deals to try and get hip.
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:22.200]   And suddenly you're looking at $1 billion that you've just thrown at, you know-
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:23.200]   You know what?
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:24.720]   You're suddenly looking at being Yahoo.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:25.720]   Look at-
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:26.720]   Yeah, Yahoo.
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:27.720]   Didn't work for Yahoo.
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:30.600]   Can I give you a Yahoo story?
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:37.560]   I had just one of these bizarre Yahoo things this week where I was sat in Starbucks, right?
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:43.120]   And there's this guy next to me, and he's yammering on to this girl who's sitting opposite
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:49.880]   him, who's clearly bored, and he's saying, "So I had all my photos on Yahoo, and then
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:52.400]   Yahoo said, 'Well, we're closing down the photos.
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:55.280]   You have to go to this site called Flick R.'
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:57.240]   I don't know what Flick R is.
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:58.240]   What the heck is this-
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:00.240]   I don't want to go to Flick R.
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:06.280]   Tell me, I transferred my photos, but now it says I can only look at 200 photos every
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:07.280]   month.
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:11.000]   And if I want to look at all my photos, then I have to pay 12 pounds a year.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.240]   Why do you want to pay 12 pounds?
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:14.240]   Who is this Flick R?
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.680]   And why did Yahoo close their photos?
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:18.040]   It's all right, dear.
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:20.920]   Let's go to the wreckage store and buy a USB key.
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:22.920]   It'll be okay.
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:23.920]   So I remember you-
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:27.360]   This all begs the question of why are you putting these photos on some online anyway?
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:31.120]   Don't you have- you can buy a terabyte at Costco for $150.
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:32.120]   Put the photos on your own-
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:35.600]   Because you want everybody to see pictures of your breakfast, that's why.
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:36.600]   Yeah, well, I'm just-
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:37.600]   Everybody cares.
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:40.320]   I'm sharing my photos with the world.
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:45.800]   I say this, by the way, as somebody who pays 12 pounds a year to post more than 200 pictures
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:46.800]   of a month-
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:47.800]   Yeah, it's a flicker.
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:48.800]   You have a bunch of-
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:49.800]   Oh, that's right.
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:50.800]   You have a lot of- but they're mostly pictures of you, Leo.
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:51.800]   That was kind of weird.
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:52.800]   I know.
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:53.800]   I'm pretty good- looking, all right?
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:54.800]   You like that one?
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:55.800]   Here's another one.
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:56.800]   Let me upload another one.
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:59.080]   You know, I'm streaming video of this podcast today.
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:01.840]   They can't hear you, but they can hear me.
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:03.000]   That's all they want to hear.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   They're happy.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.600]   That's a new voice for you.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:09.120]   You think I'm mocking- you think I'm not telling the truth.
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:10.120]   That's actually true.
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:11.360]   We are streaming this on Stick 'Em.
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:13.800]   And I couldn't figure out how to get your audio on it.
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:17.560]   So all they're doing is they're sitting and listening to me listen.
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:19.320]   Video on the internet, they say it's the future.
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:20.320]   It's the future.
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:22.320]   So you're on Stick 'Em, let me check that out.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:24.200]   Yeah, I'm probably on the front page.
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:27.320]   This is the most excitement Stick 'Em's had since that 12-year-
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:32.160]   From what I can tell, there's a lot of excitement on Stick 'Em, but it's mostly in private rooms,
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:37.360]   if you know what I mean.
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:38.360]   I like it.
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:39.480]   This is good.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:41.280]   This is good podcasting.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:44.520]   And now we listen to Dvorak type.
[00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:45.520]   There it is.
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:46.520]   You're watching your feature.
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:47.520]   Hi, John!
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:48.520]   I'm sitting up.
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:49.520]   There it is.
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:53.720]   There are 350 viewers watching you do whatever you do.
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:55.360]   Listen to you guys.
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:57.240]   Yeah, why should you listen?
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:58.880]   Well, I'm not listening that much.
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:00.280]   That's probably why it works.
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:05.720]   You're slightly ahead of Show 'Em Tell and John Hock.
[00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:06.720]   John Hock.
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:08.960]   At least puts on a porn show.
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:12.880]   You don't want to watch a show called Show 'Em Tell by a Guy.
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:15.560]   I don't see Show 'Em Tell on my thing.
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:16.560]   Maybe it's a...
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:19.160]   I'm getting Leo LaPorte, John Hock, NHB radio.
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:20.360]   I have no idea what that is.
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:21.360]   It's Elliott and Ben.
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:22.360]   But it drops off.
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:27.400]   It's like your 350, John Hock is 235, and then 34, 31, and 27.
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:30.280]   This is the sad state of the video on the internet.
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.000]   So what about this story?
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:39.720]   Apple has decided that if you bring cash to the Apple store to buy an iPhone, they're
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:41.040]   going to turn you away.
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:42.920]   You can only buy with a credit card.
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:43.920]   No cash.
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:44.920]   Oh, that sucks.
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:45.920]   No cash sales.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:46.920]   You're kidding me.
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:48.840]   They say because they're afraid people are buying.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:51.320]   Also, you can buy no more than two phones.
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:55.120]   They say the problem is they're worried about people coming in and buying phones and reselling
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:56.120]   them.
[00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:58.440]   What's that got to do with cash buying?
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:00.360]   Well, I guess these people don't want to be on record.
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:03.920]   If you use a credit card, then at least they kind of know it's you.
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:06.240]   Is there any, well, I mean, that's phone or whatever.
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:07.240]   This is 1984.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:09.800]   What are we talking about here?
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:12.960]   I'm sorry your cash is no good here.
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:16.640]   Go down the street and buy a USB key.
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:19.480]   Apparently it's legal to do this.
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:24.040]   I actually had somebody send me an email explaining that it is legal to do this.
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:28.160]   You can't turn down cash in payment of a debt.
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:31.640]   But you can turn down cash to buy a new article.
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:34.240]   I think Storm Jenkins for filling me in on the law.
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:35.840]   I wonder when that law.
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:36.840]   That's interesting.
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:37.840]   Isn't it?
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:42.240]   Cash is no good anymore in this country because we can't track you like a dog.
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:43.640]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:44.640]   Yes.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:49.440]   But I mean, there's nothing illegal about buying something and selling it on, right?
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:50.440]   No.
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:52.280]   It's just because Apple doesn't like you doing it.
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:54.280]   So they just sort of you laughing.
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:58:00.120]   I can't believe all of you Apple fans that just praised this company when there's one
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:01.120]   thing after another.
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:02.120]   It seems to me.
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:03.440]   They're getting worse and worse.
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:07.800]   But what do they I mean, it's very clear as a company becomes more and more successful,
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:09.520]   they have to turn to more and more.
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:13.160]   And I think the real problem with Apple and Don, you said this on your column, is that
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:14.640]   they did a deal with AT&T.
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:16.000]   You do a deal with a devil.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   You're in bed with the devil.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.960]   You're going to have to act like the devil.
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:19.960]   Exactly.
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:23.720]   I mean, just all these moves are just so unappled like.
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:29.640]   If that's a word, it's just so unappled that it's just what's going on.
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:30.800]   There has to be a reason for it.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:34.880]   And all of it stems from the deal with AT&T.
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:36.880]   And that's why I said it.
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:39.720]   I just, hey, they've bricked iPhones.
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:41.920]   They've turned you away if you try to pay cash.
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:45.200]   They're only letting you do two or buy two iPhones.
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:46.560]   It has to do with AT&T.
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:47.720]   They never did this before.
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:48.720]   It was never like this before.
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:49.960]   This isn't a all-impressive.
[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:56.240]   I mean, what if the Patriot Act starts requiring you to pay by charge card at the grocery store
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:58.640]   so they could track your hummus purchases?
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:02.240]   I mean, I think this is really scary, frankly.
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:05.960]   Not that I care whether Apple knows what I'm buying an iPhone or not.
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:09.280]   Now, there's no limits to buying at the AT&T store, right?
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:10.280]   Well, that's a good question.
[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:14.400]   When I bought it at the AT&T store, but that was on the first day, you could only buy one.
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:16.040]   I don't know what the limits are now.
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:18.440]   And I don't know whether you could pay cash or not.
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:19.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:23.880]   I mean, if there's no limits, you want to just go out and sell 20 of them, just go down to
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:24.880]   the AT&T store.
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:26.480]   And if there's no limits there, go buy them there.
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:29.720]   If not, go drive a mile down the road to find another one.
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:34.280]   We've come to a strange state of affairs that where a company will turn down a customer
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:38.040]   who wants to buy too many of their products or pay cash for it.
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:41.320]   Sorry, you want to buy too much of what we sell.
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:42.880]   Sorry, you want to pay cash?
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:43.880]   Can't do it.
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:45.880]   That's just bizarre.
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:47.920]   I was actually reading a fantastic...
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:56.600]   No, that's a mini profile of Steve Jobs in a book by Felix Dennis of all people.
[00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:58.600]   Who's Felix Dennis?
[00:59:58.600 --> 00:59:59.600]   Felix Dennis.
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:00.600]   Are you on the book?
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.440]   Yeah, he's a British magazine publisher.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.440]   He started up like a...
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.440]   He's still getting a good Mac user.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:06.440]   He used to be my publisher.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:07.440]   Oh, okay.
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.440]   Yeah.
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.440]   And so they had...
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:14.520]   So one of the quotes out of it is, "It's not true that there is a large sign on Steve
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:17.760]   Jobs' desk at Apple, which reads my way or the highway.
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:21.120]   But the fact that so many people believe there is, tell us it's own story."
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.120]   You don't need the sign.
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.960]   You don't need no sign to say that.
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:26.320]   That's just the way it is.
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:29.720]   And it's just a fascinating look at how Steve Jobs saved the company.
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:37.320]   Steve Jobs' Apple's sort of savior, but he's also his arrogance and his sort of one-wayedness
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.120]   is also its major downfall.
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.120]   Yeah.
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:44.160]   I read a great icon I think it's called, and I don't think he likes, in fact.
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.480]   No, that's the one he pulled from the stories.
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.480]   Yeah.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.480]   That one talks all...
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:52.000]   Oh, he spends half the book talking about how he acts and how he is and how arrogant
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.720]   he is and how people don't like him.
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:54.720]   They're scared of him.
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.720]   Nobody disputes him.
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:56.720]   But they're not...
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:57.720]   It's true.
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:58.720]   Nobody disputes this.
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:02.440]   He's the kind of boss effect I've heard from an Apple employee who was in an elevator.
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:03.680]   Steve Jobs gets in the elevator.
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:08.440]   People are quail when Steve Jobs gets in the elevator, looks at a guy, fires him in the
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.440]   elevator for something.
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:13.600]   I can't remember what it was, but on the spot fires him, walks out.
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:17.600]   The guy standing there in a puddle in the elevator, Steve's...
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.680]   I guess he's got a handler with him at all times, comes back in the elevator and says,
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:21.680]   "No, no, don't worry about that.
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.040]   Steve does that all the time."
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:25.040]   And they leave.
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.120]   What a guy.
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:29.440]   And he's like the...
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:32.160]   The people genuflect that is all through every week when he moves up.
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.920]   Well, but he's a brilliant guy.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:35.720]   He's got a great design sense.
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.440]   He's taken that company and turned it around.
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.880]   Apple was dead.
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:39.880]   Apple was out of business.
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:46.240]   So, you know, Waz is interesting, because Waz, while he's cagey about talking about Steve,
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:47.480]   Waz knows Steve's flaws.
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:50.360]   And Waz actually said that it was his opinion.
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:54.200]   Gil Emileo had already turned the company around when Jobs came back.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:57.680]   I'm not sure if that's the case.
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:58.680]   That's pretty wild.
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:01:59.680]   Isn't that an interesting theory?
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:05.520]   He says, "Gil had put into place all of the things that, you know, liked that IMAX and
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:06.880]   the move to OS 10.
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.360]   They didn't have an operating system yet.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:12.800]   Steve brought it with him when he rejoined from next, but the move to replace OS 9, I
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:13.800]   guess.
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:18.400]   All of these things were already in process through Gil Emileo when Steve comes in.
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:21.400]   And you know, that is true at Pixar.
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:26.320]   Steve bought into Pixar and ignored the company until it had a hit called Toy Story.
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:29.360]   And all of a sudden, he's the genius behind Pixar.
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:30.880]   I'm sure you read that in icon.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:31.880]   Yeah.
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:33.760]   It's a very interesting story.
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:38.560]   But I've actually spent a weekend some years ago when Steve was not back at Apple yet with
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:44.160]   Steve and was, you know, as a human being, he's not an awful human being.
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:50.240]   But he certainly has a high opinion of his own judgment.
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:54.360]   I think he thinks no matter what, he's always the smartest guy in the room.
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.360]   But doesn't Bill Gates feel the same way?
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:59.880]   And isn't Bill Gates and aren't Steve Jobs and Bill Gates usually right?
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:06.160]   No, the thing is most of the great CEOs in history, I mean, if you look back, a lot
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:07.160]   of them are like that.
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:08.160]   And indicators.
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:09.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:12.320]   Stalin and, you know, Hitler.
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:13.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.960]   Hey, there you are.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.320]   Finally, damn, I had this chat.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.440]   It took me forever to sign in to say I have an account there.
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.920]   I see you now you're smiling.
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:22.520]   Hey, how you doing?
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:26.200]   And you got a twit, a twit logo there, which is a show.
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:30.440]   I got a fake twit logo because really underneath here, it says KFI and I didn't really think
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.440]   that was appropriate.
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.440]   So great.
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.600]   Now I'm hearing you five different ways.
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.440]   John, turn the audio off on stick them or this isn't going to work.
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.960]   It sounds good.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:40.960]   Say something.
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:41.960]   Hello.
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:42.960]   How are you, John?
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:43.960]   Hello.
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:44.960]   How are you, John?
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:45.960]   Okay.
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:46.960]   Just turn it off.
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:47.960]   All right.
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:51.560]   And now page two, a sprint, an interesting deal.
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:57.400]   They settled a class action lawsuit that alleged the company was anti-competitive by locking
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.400]   handsets.
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:03.400]   Sprint agreed to provide unlock codes to current and former customers so they can use their
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:09.600]   sprint phones with other CDMA carriers either upon deactivation or after deactivation of
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:12.360]   the account.
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:17.280]   And they're going to train customer service personnel on how to do it.
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:23.320]   Furthermore, they've agreed to prorate the cancellation fees.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.320]   This is great news.
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:29.640]   I mean, finally some consumer, some good news for consumers in the cell phone industry.
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:34.520]   So who are these poor souls, these 362 people that are actually watching you?
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:37.160]   I'll ask them right now.
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:41.920]   Hey, guys, John wants to know who are you and why are you watching?
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:47.240]   What I find amazing is that, you know, this is such big.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:52.480]   Big news to you guys to see a whole, "Oh, you can take your cell phone and do something
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:53.480]   with it."
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:57.960]   Because that's just been the way over here for almost ever since.
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:58.960]   Right.
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:04:59.960]   Yeah.
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:02.400]   Like you buy your phone and you do your contract.
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.120]   And when your contract is up, you say to the company, "Right, I'm taking my phone.
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:06.800]   I'm taking my phone number.
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.600]   I'm taking my business to another network."
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:11.760]   And they are legally obligated to give you a code to let you do it.
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:14.520]   And we have no idea if you've got a protection in this country.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:18.400]   Well, especially in the telecom area.
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.880]   And it's just we're like in the Gulag here.
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:21.880]   It's very strange.
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.680]   Is it for historic reasons?
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:24.680]   Is it something we inherited?
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:29.320]   Well, I mean, the thing is you guys inherited the monopoly of the bell and then the bell
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.520]   got split up.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:35.960]   And then it seems like nobody really did much to try and...
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.120]   It's corruption is what it is.
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.760]   Let's get it to you here.
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:42.960]   Because over here we had British Telecom, which was the same thing.
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:45.440]   British Telecom got privatized, split up.
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:48.160]   But the competition commission over here has just been really...
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:52.960]   Don't you have the lobbyists in Britain, don't you?
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:56.960]   That's what's gone wrong here is that the election system is dominated by dirty money.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:57.960]   Yeah.
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:06.840]   So the thing over here is that the amount that you can spend on political campaigns, for
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:12.160]   political parties, is severely limited by the fact that you can't advertise on television.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:17.160]   So because there is far less money needed to be spent on political campaigns, lobbyists
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:21.240]   have far less influence because that money is less needed.
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:22.240]   I think that's it.
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.240]   That's it.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:26.920]   And that's not going to change because these broadcast networks, if they ever...
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:28.840]   I always get the biggest kick and I've written about this.
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:33.600]   In fact, there's an essay on the dvorak.org/blog about this, which is like...
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.880]   People always say there's always...
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:36.880]   Yes, plug.
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:41.880]   Anyway, people are always saying that all this didn't campaign finance reform, campaign
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:43.120]   finance reform.
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:47.000]   And they don't understand that, yeah, both parties talk a big game about it, but it's
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.160]   actually the TV networks, the magazines, the newspapers and everybody else would be the
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:54.760]   ones who really suffer from it because they count on all that cash coming in.
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:07:00.080]   So they want more less campaign finance reform because they make a ton of money.
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:03.880]   And of course, all the people who would vote for campaign finance reform are being paid
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:09.240]   for by illegal or illegal, but inappropriate campaign donations.
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:17.040]   And the beauty of this is for the telecom industry is nine out of ten people probably
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:20.360]   aren't even going to pay attention to unlocking and all this going on.
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:22.400]   And so what they'll do is...
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:25.080]   And so the politicians will say, "Well, I'll take the money because no one really knows
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:26.080]   it."
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.080]   Nobody cares.
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:28.080]   Like a stituent's nose or cares, exactly.
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:29.080]   So I'll take the money and I'll be fine.
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:30.080]   Yeah.
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.080]   Who's going to say anything?
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:32.080]   Nothing.
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:33.080]   It's just a few guys have an old podcast somewhere.
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:37.560]   By the way, there was somebody pointing something out that was interesting to me in some political...
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:42.880]   Either it was a political blog or it was on TV, which is that when did we start analyzing
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.280]   the campaigns?
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:46.640]   For example, you have Obama versus Hillary.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:47.920]   It's not about the issues anymore.
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:50.200]   It's about how much money they've collected.
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:51.200]   It's a horse horse horse.
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.200]   This guy's ahead of that.
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.200]   He's got another...
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.880]   It's the horse race mentality and that's exactly what's wrong with it.
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:56.880]   Yep.
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:57.880]   It's unbelievable.
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:58.880]   But whoever collects the most money wins...
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:07:59.880]   Who's winning?
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:00.880]   Yeah.
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:03.880]   No, that's absolutely true.
[01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:05.200]   What can we do about it?
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:06.200]   Let's all move to Britain.
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.200]   Nothing.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.200]   Yeah.
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.200]   Right.
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.720]   Where there's a camera on every corner.
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:11.720]   Yeah.
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:15.240]   At least I have good dental care here.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:19.040]   So a little Austin Howers dig.
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.040]   Halloween is coming up.
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.040]   It's a good joke.
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:22.040]   Yes.
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.040]   I got it.
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:24.040]   You got it.
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.040]   I think we're done.
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:26.040]   I don't have any other stories.
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.040]   Anybody have any other stories?
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.040]   I don't think that's about it.
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:30.040]   Oh, I don't think you can't.
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:33.560]   Any more indignation, any more righteous indignation to tap?
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:37.160]   Have we eschewed enough pretense, John?
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:38.160]   John C. Dvorak?
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.160]   I don't know.
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:41.040]   I think I've already burned out on screaming and yelling.
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:46.040]   John, did anybody complain about the University of California Golden Bears?
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.040]   No bears.
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.040]   That's another story.
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.040]   Go ahead, Will.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:53.360]   Did anybody see the crisis demo that just came out?
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:55.560]   Everybody's talking about downloading crisis.
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:56.560]   I have a lot.
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:57.560]   Tell me.
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:58.560]   It's CRY SIS.
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:08:59.560]   Yes.
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:00.560]   And what is it?
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:01.560]   It's sweet.
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:02.560]   Sweet.
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:07.120]   It's just the new first person shooter from the guys that made it.
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:08.120]   It made Far Cry.
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.120]   Oh, Far Cry's beautiful.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.120]   It's got all the latest.
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:15.400]   Is it World War or is it sci-fi, right?
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:16.400]   It's sci-fi.
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:17.400]   Yeah.
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:22.840]   And it's got the most advanced graphics engine basically in a first person shooter ever.
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:23.840]   It just looks insane.
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:26.400]   Fire up your bit torrent kids.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:29.240]   And if you're not on AT&T, you should have no trouble getting it the next four or five
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:30.240]   days.
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:32.320]   You know, I wait for Duke Nukem forever.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:34.320]   I'm not planning what you're thinking about.
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:36.600]   It might be a long wait, John.
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:37.600]   I'll download.
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.160]   Have you played it yet?
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:40.400]   Well, yeah, it's cool.
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:44.320]   I mean, the demo is just that you can just go and get it from like File Planet or wherever.
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:46.240]   So you don't need to be tired of it.
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:48.440]   How big it is.
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:49.440]   It's pretty big.
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:51.680]   I think it's like, you know, a bit over a gig or something.
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:52.680]   Wow.
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:55.640]   But you do need a pretty stonking PC to get the most out of it.
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:57.640]   I have a stonking PC right here.
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:59.680]   Well, then you'll enjoy it.
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:00.880]   I have to do something with it.
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:01.880]   God knows.
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:05.400]   So I've never been able to get into computer gaming.
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:06.400]   I don't know what it is.
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:07.400]   Is PC gaming?
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:08.400]   I can't do it.
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:09.400]   I've never been able to do it.
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:10.400]   I don't know.
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.400]   Maybe this will be it.
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:12.400]   Are you an Xbox guy?
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.400]   A PlayStation guy?
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:15.000]   I mean, yeah, I've always been a console guy.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000]   You know, it's just the beginning.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.560]   I have to say, you know, for instance, BioShock choice between Xbox 360 and the PC looks better
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:23.760]   on the PC, but it's also got secure ROM on it in the PC.
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:26.680]   And I don't want to put all that copy protection on my PC.
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:28.640]   So you kind of, you know, it's so much easier.
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:31.600]   You just put the disk into the console and it always works.
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:32.800]   You don't have to update your drivers.
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:35.800]   You don't have to worry about DRM and just works.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.560]   Of course, my PlayStation 3 dies.
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.000]   So that's a story for another day.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   Oh boy.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.800]   Hey, when it dies, what does it do?
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:44.040]   I mean, we've got the three rings of death for the Xbox.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:45.600]   What does the PS3 do when it dies?
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:47.120]   You know what the weird thing is?
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:48.120]   Nothing.
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:53.560]   I try to put in a disk and you can hear it start worrying and then it just stops.
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:55.240]   Stop spinning and then I'm out of luck.
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:57.320]   So I have to call up Sony and see what they have to do.
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.800]   That thing gets so hot.
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:01.840]   You know, we put it in, I shouldn't have, but we have put the TVs in a cabinet.
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:05.280]   So we put the PlayStation 3 above it in the cabinet.
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:09.200]   My wife closed the cabinet with a thing on and it sounded like there was a jet engine
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:12.720]   in the cabinet and I opened it up and it was like 110 degrees.
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:15.400]   There was like a blast of heat comes out of the cabinet.
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:16.400]   Thing is hot.
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:18.560]   Yeah, you know what?
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:23.920]   Right now, right now I'm doing a monthly feature for information week and this next
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:27.040]   feature is going to be about projectors, super high-end consumer projectors and there's
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:28.480]   one from Optima.
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:34.160]   I was sitting next to it trying to fix it, you know, get it right on the screen and I
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:35.680]   purify my hand.
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:38.960]   It was so hot and I couldn't believe how it was.
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:40.440]   It's a nice project.
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:43.600]   Yeah, well, those, you know, these high-loom and bulbs get extremely hot and you need a
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:44.600]   fan.
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:48.720]   The overlooked feature about these, I love projectors, by the way, but you got to find
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:52.720]   one with a very, with the most, probably the most expensive item in the thing should
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:58.600]   be a really high-end, super quiet fan because those things are just noisy if you don't get
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:11:59.760]   one with a nice, quiet fan.
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:00.760]   And nothing worse than that.
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:04.120]   Yeah, you're in a home theater and you're, it's not good.
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.320]   Yeah, that's the one like it is in the optimum.
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:08.000]   It's unbelievably loud.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.160]   The following sprint story, by the way, Verizon is settling $1 million for people who had their
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:19.280]   broadband service disconnected, wrongfully disconnected.
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:25.640]   Verizon, of course, has been saying unlimited broadband turns out it was limited, five gigs
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:29.560]   and disconnected people for over, going over the limit.
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:31.560]   The five gigs.
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:33.320]   Five gigabytes a month.
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:34.320]   That's nothing.
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:35.920]   Yeah, it's not unlimited.
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.520]   That's for sure.
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:39.000]   All right.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:44.120]   So the New York attorney general, your guy, Andrew Cuomo, he's been, you know what?
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:47.160]   I have to say, he's been pretty good at pursuing this kind of stuff.
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:49.080]   It's obviously for the pre, for the headlines.
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:54.040]   Oh, but that same thing Spitzer did when he got that Spitzer was great that way.
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:55.040]   Yep.
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:56.760]   He was, Spitzer was all about getting in the papers.
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:59.440]   And of course, now he's in trouble, big trouble, but does he?
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:00.440]   What happened?
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:03.000]   Ah, there's a whole trooper scandal with state troopers.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.480]   And he did this and that and the Republicans are going, it's a whole, it's a whole thing.
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.880]   It's not every night in the news.
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:08.880]   Oh boy.
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:14.560]   Anyway, Verizon will halt the deceptive marketing of its broadband as unlimited because it
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:19.960]   ain't took a nine months of investigation by Cuomo.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:23.480]   And it really, you know, we've always said, Oh, come on, it's not unlimited.
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:27.000]   All these companies are doing, you know, I have to say though, in their defense, and
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.720]   this is the same, this is also about that story with Comcast locking BitTorrent.
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:36.280]   You can't build a physical plant large enough to handle all of this traffic all at the same
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.280]   time.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:40.200]   You have to kind of estimate, you know, how many people are going to be online and how
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:42.360]   much they're going to use.
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:46.200]   There never really has been unlimited because if everybody got online at once and used it
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:47.800]   unlimited, it just wouldn't work.
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:48.800]   Well, which is fine.
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:53.400]   But they're cool and I'm sure is that Comcasting ever been proven because they keep denying
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:54.400]   it.
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:56.520]   They keep, no, you know, what's happened is now.
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:58.280]   We talked about last week you weren't here.
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:05.680]   It's pretty clear they're using a service out of Canada that a lot of ISPs use that,
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:13.000]   you know, promise to reduce bandwidth consumption, to control the monitor to optimize bandwidth
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.360]   consumption.
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:15.760]   Sandvine is the name of it.
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:20.880]   And this is how Sandvine works at the AP story, I think is held up.
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:23.560]   Comcast is they're doing a lawyer's denial.
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:29.480]   They're saying we're not doing anything, we do however use services to optimize bandwidth
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:30.960]   consumption.
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:33.680]   So it's pretty clear they're using Sandvine.
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:37.120]   But again, you know, I mean, I'm playing devil's advocate here because I don't want to
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:38.120]   be limited and so forth.
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:41.200]   But at the same time, it is hard for them to build an unlimited plan.
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.120]   What were you going to say about that?
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:49.000]   Well, just that I think everybody understands that you possibly can't, you know, have all
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.360]   the bandwidth all the time.
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:56.040]   Everybody is fine with that, but okay, but then don't call it unlimited.
[01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:59.560]   Call it virtually unlimited or massive capacity.
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:06.400]   Somebody pointed out that you can't really do an ad that says guaranteed 26 kilobits.
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:11.160]   You know, it doesn't sell very well.
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:16.320]   Well, that's just, you know, the trouble is if everyone was forced into the same basket
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:19.760]   is because, you know, everyone wants to be unlimited, everyone wants to be the biggest.
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:23.400]   Well, the problem is there, let's face it, there are bandwidth hogs and probably all
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:26.840]   of us on the panel count as bandwidth hogs.
[01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:30.840]   And you know, if you're not one, you want to have access to the internet, you know, you
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:35.240]   don't want it to be slow because some guys torrenting the last, you know, six episodes
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:41.600]   of the office, they do the new ads now say they don't say anything about unlimited.
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:44.880]   They just say broadband access.
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:46.360]   I'm looking at the new Verizon ad.
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:48.360]   They've actually completely eliminated the unlimited.
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:49.360]   They had to.
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:51.760]   Can you hear me now?
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:55.720]   Speed claim based on our new, on our network tests with five megabit FTP data files without
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:58.040]   compression actual throughput speed varies.
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:00.880]   Broadband access is available, but they don't say anything about unlimited.
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:01.880]   Yeah.
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:02.880]   Can you hear them now?
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:05.040]   Can you hear Cuomo now for rising?
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.600]   I use Comcast.
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:07.600]   Good.
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.240]   How's your bit torrent been?
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:10.240]   I don't use bit torrent.
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:12.720]   I don't download stuff like that.
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:13.720]   I just don't do it.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:14.720]   I don't have time for it.
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:16.160]   I mean, I've got a dish network thing.
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:19.400]   I get all the media I want to get over the satellite dish.
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:21.680]   I don't see why I have to overdo it.
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:22.680]   Right.
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:24.120]   I mean, I suppose it's handy.
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:26.200]   I mean, some people like, I think most people just collect stuff.
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:30.080]   I don't think it's practical to be honest about it, to download movies.
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:31.320]   Oh, it's practical.
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.960]   You just start the download and you go to bed.
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:36.120]   Yeah, no, I'm saying, but then you watch the movie.
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:37.840]   I mean, you can watch the movie on the dish network.
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:41.760]   It's just, I mean, unless there's some thing you really have to see immediately.
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:42.760]   Well, it'll be an example.
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:45.760]   Eventually, it's the IPTV and you'll be able to get everything you want quickly.
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:46.760]   Right.
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:47.760]   And that's what we're doing.
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:51.680]   We're kind of trying to make pretend IPTV.
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:56.400]   But I mean, I can't buy the office anymore on iTunes and I love watching the office,
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:58.160]   but I don't want to see all the commercials.
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.040]   I'd be willing to pay for it if NBC have let me.
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:02.160]   I'm not going to use Hulu.
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.960]   Is Hulu up yet, Don?
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:05.200]   I don't think so.
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:08.640]   I think it's got a few more brilliant nitwit.
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:09.880]   Thought that up.
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:10.880]   What's Hulu?
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:14.200]   They said it's, it says, you know, beta coming in October.
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:16.800]   So they've got like three more days to get it going.
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:17.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:18.800]   Right.
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:21.560]   And what he said, ladies and gentlemen is what Americans would say is beta.
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:24.080]   Oh, I thought it was like a beat farm or something.
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:31.000]   No, the Hulu is NBC's ill advised idea to instead of letting YouTube and iTunes put
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.640]   their videos up, they're going to sell them themselves on a website with the stupidest
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:35.960]   name in the world.
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:41.600]   And by the way, they've now pulled them off of all of those clips off of YouTube too.
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:42.840]   I don't get this thing.
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:43.840]   Nuts.
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:44.840]   I wrote it, I wrote it on CNET.
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:47.280]   This thing is going to be a, it's going to be over in a year.
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:48.280]   It's as simple as that.
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:51.000]   You're going to have, they're going to start touting this as the most wonderful thing in
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000]   the world.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000]   Look at what you can do.
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000]   You can watch all of your favorite shows.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000]   Exactly.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000]   No one's going to use it.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.080]   And then they're going to say, but they see, this is the problem with this company and
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:01.640]   these company, the news corp in NBC, they have this mentality that they need to commercialize
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:02.640]   everything.
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:03.640]   They need to find ways to make money.
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:06.440]   They need to, any data with advertisements and everything else.
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:08.280]   So within six months, that'll happen.
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:09.560]   People will get even more upset.
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:11.040]   There's a few people are going to use it.
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:15.000]   And then in a year, they'll go back to Apple and beg them to take them back.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000]   It's simple.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000]   Oh, and they'll be losing money on it too.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.640]   Let's don't forget that part of it.
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:19.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:20.640]   Lots.
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:22.920]   Think of all, I mean, I literally bought the first three seasons of the office.
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:27.480]   I want to buy the office, even though, and this is what they forget, I can easily get
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:29.960]   it for free in higher quality.
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:31.880]   And I am because they're not offering it.
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:34.000]   I'm not letting me buy it.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.360]   Can someone please explain to me why?
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:38.160]   Obviously, I'm a little because of the reason.
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:43.800]   But why in your wildest dreams that you want to pull your programming off of YouTube, the
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:46.600]   most popular video sharing site where people are going to go, "Oh, wow.
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:47.600]   That's a great clip.
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:48.600]   This is a pretty nice show.
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:49.600]   It's a funny show.
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:50.600]   I like the clip.
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:51.600]   Maybe I'll go down to iTunes.
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:52.600]   I'll buy it.
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:53.440]   Or maybe tonight I'll watch it on TV.
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:55.280]   I just don't understand the mentality.
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:56.360]   It's just we own everything.
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:57.360]   We have to keep it.
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:58.360]   We have to maintain it.
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:18:59.360]   And it's simple as that.
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:00.880]   And it's just, it's awful.
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:01.880]   It's ridiculous.
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:02.880]   Amen.
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:09.280]   Once again, we have a shoot obfuscation, but we've ended up the show with a downer.
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.480]   I'm sorry I'm just happy.
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:12.480]   As usual.
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:14.480]   I don't have anything happy to share with you.
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:16.120]   We've got to have something upbeat.
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:17.120]   Surely.
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:19.120]   No, we don't.
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:25.680]   Chatsy Devorak says, "No way down."
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:26.680]   I don't care.
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:27.880]   I think it's a fun show anyway.
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:31.560]   Don C. Devorak is at devorak.org/blog of course.
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:33.040]   Take a drink.
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.880]   And you'll find all of his rantings there as well as on CBS.
[01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:37.400]   It's not CBS anymore is it?
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:38.400]   It's just MarketWatch.
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:39.400]   Dow Jones.
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.840]   Dow Jones MarketWatch.
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:45.080]   Also Cranky Geeks at crankygeeks.tv.
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:46.680]   And what's this new one you were just talking about?
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:47.680]   This new podcast.
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:49.840]   I have a five minute daily podcast called Tech5.
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:50.940]   You can find it.
[01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:53.720]   You can link to all this stuff from my blog devorak.org/blog.
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:54.720]   Cool.
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.120]   I have to start listening to that.
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:58.120]   It's just a daily rant.
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:01.080]   I can only do five minutes of this screaming and yelling every day.
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:02.080]   I love it.
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:04.080]   I have to find out what he's saying about it.
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.080]   Yeah.
[01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:06.080]   I think it was like last Tuesday.
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:07.080]   I'm not sure.
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.080]   Hey, John Loeger.
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:12.280]   It was something about something you wrote that really ticked me off.
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:13.280]   I love it.
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:17.720]   Hey, once you've been ranted about by Devorak, you've been ranted about by the best.
[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:22.640]   John Risinger writes for CNET at the digital home column and a whole lot more.
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:24.280]   Just Google Don Risinger.
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:25.360]   That's what he said to say.
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:26.360]   I'm not kidding.
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:27.360]   Do you know where?
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:28.800]   Make it really easy.
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:31.800]   I got the daily done, but you're not posting nothing on it.
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:32.800]   Oh, I know.
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:37.000]   Someone's building a site for me, so I'm happy to see that because I just don't have time
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000]   nor the skills to do it.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.200]   He's too busy playing crisis.
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:43.480]   No, no, that's not you.
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:44.480]   That's Will Harris.
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:46.480]   Digitalhome is at cNET.com.
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:48.480]   Blogs.cNET.com.
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:51.080]   They should really get you blogs at cNET.com/don.
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:52.240]   Can you arrange that?
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:53.480]   Make it so much easier.
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:56.080]   You know, every week they change the URL.
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:57.880]   Last, right now it works.
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:20:58.880]   Get at cNET.com.
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:00.960]   You can go both ways and it tends to work.
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:09.720]   The problem is they've got this weird CMS that gives you this 3,800-13506-1_17_b71.
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:12.880]   I think that CMS is an old throwback to Vignette or something.
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:13.880]   It looks like Vignette.
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:15.560]   Remember, that's what we used to use.
[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:18.840]   I mean, you know, it's Halsey that was the original investor in Vignette.
[01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:19.840]   Oh, there it is.
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:20.840]   So it is Vignette.
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:21.840]   Absolutely.
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:24.120]   But if I ever saw Vignette URL, it is.
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:25.880]   This is so 90s, Don.
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:26.880]   Stupid.
[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:27.880]   Yeah.
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:31.880]   It used to be blogs.cNET.com/digitalhome and that where I think it still works.
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:35.440]   But now it's WWCNET.whatever the hell they put at the end.
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:37.880]   So you know, I think it's blogs.cNET.com/digitalhome.
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:38.880]   That works.
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:39.880]   That still works.
[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:40.880]   Blogs.cNET.com/digitalhome.
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:41.880]   There you go.
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:46.360]   That's Don Reisinger's digital home on the information superhighway.
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.600]   He rides the tubes.
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:50.960]   He also writes, "For information week, FEC will look forward to that new product review
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:52.160]   on that projector."
[01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:53.160]   That sounds cool.
[01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:54.160]   And as a write call.
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:57.760]   You don't think, I mean, it seems a little bit harsh on the bottom of your blog post.
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:00.760]   It says, "Don Reisinger's a freelance technology journalist.
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:02.440]   He is not an employee of CNET."
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:03.440]   Oh, no.
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:04.440]   That's cold.

[01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:58.280]   She takes it all off at the end too.
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:00.560]   Make sure you watch the entire episode.
