[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.080]   And we've got some opinionators today, starting
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.800]   with opinionator number one, Mr. Ray Maxwell,
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.960]   all the way from Vancouver, British Columbia.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.720]   Hey Ray, it's great to see you again.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.640]   Hey, Lou.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.040]   It's great to be on Tuit.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.280]   Yeah, thank you for joining us.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.160]   Ray is color guy on Tuit.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.240]   And we have some important questions for you color guy.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.120]   So don't go away.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.880]   Also with us from New York, New York,
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.320]   where she's visiting her brother.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.640]   Isn't that nice?
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.400]   Cheryl Azar of Stage and Scrantz, CBS.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.000]   Hi, Cheryl.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.440]   Hey guys, happy to be on.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.040]   I love having you on the show.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.280]   Also here from gadget.com, GDGT.com, Peter Rojas.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.200]   Hey, Peter.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.040]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.880]   It's great to have you on.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.280]   We were scheduled to have Ryan Block, your partner on.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.640]   And Veronica, his partner, is playing tennis
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.800]   against Maria Sharpova.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.720]   So he felt it would be disloyal to come do this show
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.960]   and not watch Veronica beat Maria Sharpova.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.400]   What is that?
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.880]   I'm Ryan standing, basically.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.480]   No, we love having you on.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.800]   But I'm just curious how that happened.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.120]   I don't know.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.160]   You're going to have to ask them.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.440]   It's a very--
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.760]   that's wild.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.600]   Are they playing in the Bay Area or something?
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.000]   I think they were down in Palo Alto.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.680]   So maybe they were playing down there somewhere.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.440]   That's very cool.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.400]   That game's probably over.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.880]   He could probably have been on.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.640]   I mean, how long is she going to last against Maria Sharpova?
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.960]   She's a brilliant tennis player.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.880]   It's entirely possible.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.800]   I've never seen Veronica play tennis, but--
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.440]   Wait a minute.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.840]   Now you're going to.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.960]   Ladies and gentlemen, Maria Sharpova and Veronica Belmont
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.840]   preparing to play tennis.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.800]   Wow.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.360]   That proves it.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.560]   That is hilarious.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.600]   I didn't make it up.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.360]   Isn't that wild?
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.240]   That's weird.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.240]   They're going to see something about that either she's
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.800]   trying to get into tech more or--
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.840]   there's always something when you see people that
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.560]   aren't traditionally in this scene hanging out with people
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.960]   in the scene.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.880]   It's because I don't know.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.320]   They're trying to get into it.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.840]   Like Ashton, like Kutcher, right?
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.080]   I guess, well, yeah, Ashton, when he started-- now he's
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.440]   I guess part of the scene a bit more.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.120]   But when he started getting into it a year and a half
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.320]   or two years ago, he started hanging with people
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.760]   like Kevin Rose or Michael Arrington.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.120]   You're like, hm, what's going on here?
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.840]   That's how they get to know each other.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.160]   That's how he gets into the media.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.520]   He gets to know the players.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.020]   Players.
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.360]   Playa.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.920]   Kevin's a player.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.280]   So this was a week that many of the big tech companies
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.360]   announced their quarterly results.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.240]   Apple announced the biggest quarter, I think,
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.720]   in its history.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.080]   In fact, there was some thought what Apple announced first,
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.520]   that they might beat Microsoft for the first time ever
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.600]   in revenue, not profits, never in profits, but in revenue.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.240]   Nope, Microsoft pulled ahead and had one of its best quarters
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.720]   ever with a profit of $16 billion--
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.360]   I'm sorry, a revenue of $16 billion in three months.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.560]   That's kind of a astounding amount of money.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.120]   And a good amount of that profit since Microsoft just sells
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.440]   bits, they say they sold--
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.280]   they have sold 175 million copies of Windows 7.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.600]   That is 10 copies-- wait a minute, let me get this right.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.960]   I'm going to get the numbers right.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.400]   10 copies of Windows 7 every second since it came out.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.200]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.840]   Anything to say?
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.000]   Nobody has anything to say.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   It's like--
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.520]   Well, I mean, it's their cash cow, right?
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.280]   I mean, I think that we expected that this new vision of Windows
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.680]   was going to sell a lot.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.240]   They have a lot of support from the OEMs.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.240]   But I think they also came out with a much better version
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.560]   of Windows than they did last time around with Vista.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.880]   And so there are a lot of companies that sat out Vista,
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.280]   so to speak, especially the big enterprise
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.680]   customers that decided to skip a generation and wait.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.320]   And so they were doing the big upgrade from XP to Windows 7
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.600]   now.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.320]   And so I think that's why they sold so many copies of the capacitor.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.600]   You'll notice that I started the show with a computer story.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.480]   And the reason is this is the last time
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.480]   we'll talk about computers for the next hour and a half.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.240]   It seems like computers are gone, right?
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.880]   All we ever talk about--
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.200]   and anybody talks about these days is cell phones, maybe iPads,
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.480]   maybe mobile computing.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.080]   But computers themselves--
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.120]   It's going to become like a CD.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.120]   Like for us.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.680]   It's obsolete.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.320]   Totally a commodity at this point.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.360]   Here's a thanks to Bauataba in our chatroom,
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.920]   the chart of the day from Silicon Alley Insider,
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.440]   Microsoft's online operating income.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.840]   And this is a loss.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.800]   All those reds, a loss.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.720]   They made money in September and December 2005.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.600]   And they have lost money every quarter
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:32.360]   since this quarter, online $700 million in losses.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.440]   Wow.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.240]   But when you have 16 billion in revenue,
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.560]   moving 100 million here or there is no big deal.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.760]   It just shows you, though, that these big computer PC
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.640]   companies, like Microsoft, are having a hard time
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.400]   making this transition to the modern world, the online world
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.360]   and the portable, the mobile space.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.280]   I wonder what percentage of their product
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.440]   was delivered over the internet versus delivered
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.760]   in a cardboard box store.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.080]   Well, that's got to be it for the bottom line, right?
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.640]   I don't think there was any money on here as Bing.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.160]   They're investing literally hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.080]   in Bing right now.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.520]   And they see that the success of Bing
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.160]   is critical to the future of the company.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.200]   And so what are they inching up towards--
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.520]   I mean, they're the number two player.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.400]   But I think that they have a chance of getting above 25%,
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.960]   30% market share in search, which is super, super important
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.960]   to them.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.680]   And so they'd rather lose $500 million, $700 million
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.560]   right now rather than be completely shut out
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.640]   of that market down the road.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.080]   So I think that most of that money
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.440]   is related to Bing and to live.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.120]   Excellent point.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.640]   In fact, we talked last week about the fact
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.920]   that Bing is gaining share, considerable share over Google
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.200]   and Yahoo.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.240]   But the way they're doing it is by buying share, which
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.160]   is not a tenable long-term position.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.000]   I don't know if it's not--
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.960]   I mean, it is tenable in the sense
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.560]   that they can cut these deals.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.200]   I mean, you look at something like AOL, which
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.600]   is going to ready to renegotiate its deal with Google.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.240]   And so they're looking to Microsoft
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.560]   to offer them a better deal.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:14.040]   And AOL is only about 2.5% of web search.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.560]   But because it's AOL users, it actually
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.280]   accounts for about 6% of paid clicks.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.440]   So if Microsoft were able to sign up AOL as a search client,
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.480]   they would actually be able to get closer to that 30%.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.360]   But they actually, from a revenue standpoint,
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.760]   would be able to make more money off those users than an average
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.040]   percentage point of search.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.920]   Right.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.760]   What was it, Jason Calicanis, used to say,
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.400]   of every percentage point of market share in search
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.560]   is worth a billion?
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.840]   Yeah, something like that.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.680]   So spending $700 million, even if all of that
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.880]   was spent in a quarter, to get 1% market share,
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.160]   would still be in that gain.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.840]   Eventually in theory.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.760]   Yeah, in theory.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.920]   Microsoft think they're going to compete with Apple
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.520]   in terms of hardware.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.320]   I mean, I feel like they spent so much time focusing on,
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.960]   obviously, huge communities.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.960]   We're minorities, some of us, to use Apple products.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.720]   Most of the country and most of the world who don't have the money
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.240]   do still use Microsoft products.
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.400]   But doesn't mean that that is an innovative product.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.520]   Well, I guess that's why the stock is so flat-lining.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.560]   Given this huge profit, this huge revenue, Microsoft stocks never--
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.040]   it's always flat.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.600]   And I think probably the market perceives Microsoft
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:31.160]   as last year's technology, not the future of technology.
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.680]   And that would also explain why Microsoft's putting so much money
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.400]   into online.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.240]   I mean, they've got to become a cloud company.
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.240]   Well, maybe they realize they're just not
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.000]   going to compete against Apple.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.480]   I mean, every time they do try to put something--
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.000]   No, sure.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.800]   I've got to point out, they have 95% market share
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.400]   in the operating system.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.280]   They'll compete with the products, the basics,
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.160]   and still win.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.320]   I definitely think, in terms of what Peter said,
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.600]   Bing is the way to go.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.640]   And they're doing it right.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.720]   I mean, it's only been around for what are you so?
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.160]   And they already see a lot of progress.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.120]   Any of you use Bing?
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.120]   I use it sometimes.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.800]   The travel sometimes, the comparison travel is pretty good.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.600]   But we saw Google's response to that,
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.760]   as they bought-- what was it-- IATA,
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.240]   so that they get all this database,
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.080]   this huge database of travel information,
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.280]   so that they can do exactly what Bing's doing.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.200]   If you enter in a search on Bing, it gives you fairs.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.120]   It gives you more than just search results, right?
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.280]   Is that why you use it, Shira?
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:30.920]   You use it--
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.680]   Yeah, if you're in a marathon, you could basically--
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.440]   you could find it also when the best time is
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.440]   to buy the tickets or the hotel.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.520]   So if you say you need to be traveling at a certain point,
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.880]   they'll say instead of buying it today, maybe wait two more
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.080]   days.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:43.880]   Right.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.000]   Hey, I want to talk--
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.080]   before we get too far down the road with this,
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.680]   and we're going to come back to this Microsoft and Apple's
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.240]   quarterly results-- Amazon's as well-- Intel's last week,
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.480]   AMD's last week, and there's a lot to say about that.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.240]   But Denise Howell is going to call us in just a bit.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.040]   She's an attorney.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.360]   Of course, the host of our show this week in law.
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.200]   And there's an interesting new iPad application.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:09.000]   Robert Scobel said it's the page maker or Excel of the iPad.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.480]   In other words, the killer app that's
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.160]   going to make the iPad the next best thing in the world.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.000]   It's called Flipboard.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.520]   And when I mentioned this-- I was on this week in law
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.320]   this week when I mentioned this to Niele Patel, who
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.320]   is within gadget.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.360]   Of course, you know him very well, Peter.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.280]   Niele went ballistic.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.800]   He says, yeah, we don't like Flipboard so much.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:37.760]   The idea of Flipboard is it scrapes the web to create a
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.120]   beautiful-- I mean, nobody denies this-- a beautiful
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.400]   magazine of content.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.400]   But here I'm looking at Boing Boing, but this isn't the
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.080]   Boing Boing site.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.760]   Notice there are no ads.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.320]   The articles are from Boing Boing.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.080]   It's a beautiful magazine with a great page turn.
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.840]   But is this what Boing Boing intended when they created a
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.800]   website?
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.080]   Now, you're no longer in that business particularly.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.000]   I mean, they're not going to scrape gadgets, Peter.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.200]   What do you think of this?
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.720]   Yeah, there wouldn't be-- I mean, the way gadget is
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.200]   structured, it wouldn't make sense to really scrape--
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.160]   I mean, you guys could scrape the front page view or
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.080]   something like that, which wouldn't be hard.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.080]   And you wouldn't mind that.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.800]   Well, it'd be like-- I mean, it's like, well, I mean, big part
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.720]   of what Flipboard does is it scrapes people's Twitter
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.320]   feeds, right?
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.360]   And the copyright related to individual tweets is very
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.440]   unclear, let alone the issue of a feed.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.840]   But if you look at, you know, in gadgets, terms of service
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.840]   for RSS feed, which are terms of service that I helped
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:37.680]   create originally back when I was there, was that--
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.000]   you know, we-- whoa, sorry about my video there.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:40.360]   That's all right.
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.800]   It's a very intriguing look.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.360]   Yeah, it's going to sound on a what's going on.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.560]   I've just become disassociated from your head.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.440]   The video coming out, I can see the video on my own Skype
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:48.640]   looks fine.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.760]   It's called a Skype thing.
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:50.200]   You know, it's--
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.000]   Yeah, it's-- but what I was going to say was that, you know,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.080]   the RSS feed is a full text feed that Engagit does.
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.280]   And a lot of sites don't do that.
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:58.480]   Right?
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.480]   A lot of sites do truncated feeds, which are maybe
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.440]   headlines and an excerpt to force you to click through
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.240]   to their website, where you can see ads.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.840]   Engagit is one of the few sites, you know, big tech new
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.200]   sites, which does full text feeds.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.720]   And they do that, you know, as a service to the reader.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.200]   And I think that it's something that is very positive.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.800]   But the condition of use is that it's not meant to be
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.440]   republished on the web.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.720]   It's not meant to be used in a commercial context.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.080]   And I think you could argue--
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.600]   and I'm sure Neelite does--
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.240]   that Flipboard is a business.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.920]   And that them using Engagit's full text RSS feed
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.360]   constitutes a commercial, a non-licensed commercial use
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.080]   of the feed.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.120]   And I think that's legitimate.
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.040]   Flipbook-- Flipboard says it's--
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.040]   by the way, they had a rocky launch because it was so popular.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.840]   Initially, the idea was when you first get it, you sign
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.560]   into your Facebook and Twitter account.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.160]   It aggregates content from the people you follow on those
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.680]   sites, as well as from other sites.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.040]   And you can easily add--
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.360]   it's actually kind of fun.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.040]   You can easily add other sites or subtract sites.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.000]   The founders of Flipboard say, no, we're paying attention
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.160]   to the RSS.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.240]   And when the RSS only does a truncated feed, we do a
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:08.960]   truncated feed.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.640]   We try not to put more into the magazine into Flipboard than
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.800]   you'll get on the RSS.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.040]   But that's actually not true in some cases.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.160]   People pointed out that the Boston Globe, which has that
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.720]   big picture feature, which I love--
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.040]   if you love photography, it's fantastic.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.960]   The problem with it is those pictures appear on Flipboard
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.400]   in its entirety, even though they come from--
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.160]   I think it's the Associated Press.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.760]   And they're not licensed to do this.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.400]   I mean, it's great if you love photojournalism.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.240]   It's fantastic.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.840]   But I wonder how the Boston Globe is with this.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.360]   Wow.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.360]   Aren't they great?
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.360]   I mean, one thing you can't deny is this is a great
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.040]   presentation.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.640]   I mean, it really is a great way.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.080]   Yeah, it's an interesting issue because I think we're
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.480]   talking about the future of this in terms of curation.
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.640]   And it's like, who's going to come up to really curate
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:54.440]   things properly?
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.240]   And this is a platform that's doing that for us.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.560]   But then it brings up the issue of what's kind of taken
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:05.400]   content and how are you going to be giving credit where
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.560]   credits do?
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.800]   I mean, look at having imposed.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.720]   A lot of it's pretty much taken from other sources as well.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.360]   Right.
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:11.560]   Right.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.040]   I've had a little problem with that, frankly.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.240]   I mean, they do link back to the original source.
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:19.080]   But really, the Huffington Post is like a newspaper built
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.720]   of feeds it didn't pay for.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.080]   Here's an interesting-- this is an interesting use of this.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.680]   Here's the Daily Dose of Imagery image.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:32.000]   And then to the right of it, Twitter, people who are talking
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.600]   about this on Twitter-- now, presumably, if you had your--
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.880]   I can't get in because I don't have an account because it's
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.240]   been overwhelmed since it came out last week.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.080]   But if you had signed into your Twitter account, you could
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.160]   add comments here.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.360]   And you could see the comments, particularly, I would presume
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.960]   of your own social graph.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.000]   This is a very interesting idea.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.360]   It's kind of compelling.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.960]   It's very real.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.480]   It's a high level.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.760]   I mean, it's social viewing.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.320]   I think that's the future, whether it be in video form
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.360]   or in text form.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.480]   It's all about watching or reading something together
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:09.280]   and being able to have all those other social tools alongside.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.880]   And this does that.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.080]   Peter pointed out that Dave Weiner, the creator of RSS,
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:19.280]   has posted on his blog on scripting.com about Flipboard.
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.400]   I hear Denise calling it.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.880]   So we're going to get Denise on in just a second.
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.360]   But let me read a little bit of what Dave Weiner says
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.080]   to set the stage for Denise.
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.360]   He says, with no disrespect-- first of all, he says,
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.480]   he knows Mike McHugh from Netscape days.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.760]   Mike McHugh founded Tell Me.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.040]   He sold that to Microsoft.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.400]   And then went on to found Flipboard.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.600]   He says, with no Dave Weiner says, with no disrespect,
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.200]   Flipboard-- and here I am scraping Dave Weiner's blog.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.680]   I hope Dave doesn't say.
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:43.800]   That's in line.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.000]   With no--
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.640]   Send Dave to all of some money.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.120]   I will.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:47.720]   I love Dave.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.520]   Dave, I love you.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.240]   Is that enough?
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.800]   With no disrespect, Flipboard is a scraper.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.440]   It takes content flows that weren't intended
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.040]   for this kind of presentation and repurposes them.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.040]   How could it do otherwise?
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.240]   It's a chicken and egg situation.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.840]   Right now, there's no content that is specifically
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.840]   designed for a Flipboard-like environment.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.440]   But now that their product exists,
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.320]   it seems we have one half of the puzzle in place.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:13.120]   Why not put out a proposal to the content tool vendors, of which
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.040]   Dave says, I happen to be one, and say this.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.600]   If you want to produce content flows that
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.600]   look beautiful in our environment, here's how to do it.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.040]   In other words, create a kind of a new kind of RSS
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.080]   for programs like Flipboard.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.080]   He says, put hints in the source code,
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.080]   or create new renderings of the source code specifically
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.600]   to be viewed in the new environments.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.600]   So I think this is typical of Dave,
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.640]   and I like this about Dave.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.160]   He's generative.
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.160]   He says, well, OK, maybe there's a problem here.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.240]   Here's the solution.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.400]   Let's account for it.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.440]   Denise Howell is on the line.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.720]   She's the host of This Week in Law
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.440]   and practicing attorney.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.320]   He knows a little bit about these particular kinds of subjects.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.800]   And she's poolside right now.
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.560]   Thank you, Denise, for joining us.
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:54.920]   You're welcome.
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.440]   I appreciate your taking time out from your pool party
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:57.920]   to be here.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.160]   I wanted to get you on the whole show.
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.800]   But at least we can get a little bit of what you think on this.
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.240]   I know this is a new story for you.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.640]   Now that you've looked a little bit at this--
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.560]   I looked a bit at it.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.040]   I looked at Dave's post and started
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.880]   to look through the Gizmodo post, which started to unpack
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.520]   the legalities a little bit more.
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.840]   And I don't know if Gizmodo is the first person I go to
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.400]   for rulings on legality.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.680]   But yes, they were the first thing that questioned this.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.840]   What do you think?
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.200]   I think we're in a brave new world here.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:34.880]   I think that the iPad as a platform and pad tablet
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.840]   computers in general are going to open up a lot of issues
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:39.920]   like this.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.960]   Because they're the same kinds of issues
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:46.040]   that we had when the browser first into being.
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.280]   Like deep linking, things like that.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:53.400]   Yeah, deep linking and search engines and copying and
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:57.200]   re-displaying, repurposing content in various ways and
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.120]   exceptions that had to be carved out from copyright law to
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.320]   make that happen.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.960]   Because as a policy matter, the courts and ultimately the
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.240]   legislatures when they've been asked to look at this have
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.840]   decided, you know, it's a good idea for us to be able to
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.840]   search the web.
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.240]   This makes sense for us as a culture and a society.
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.760]   And there have to be some exceptions to what otherwise
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.560]   would be technically copyright violations.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.560]   You copy, you reuse for a commercial purpose.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:30.880]   You're technically in violation of the law.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.680]   But maybe there's a new thing developing here.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:35.600]   And thank you, Leo.
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:39.760]   I really like Dave's suggestion that perhaps rather than
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.800]   leaving this to the courts and legislatures that can take
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:46.160]   their time with these issues, there should be some addressing
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.600]   of the fact that there's a legal issue here up front.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:55.280]   And moving that out rather than just forging ahead and going
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.440]   forward with a product that, you know, it's going to
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.520]   tick some people off.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.040]   Well, it reminds me of YouTube.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.560]   I mean, YouTube picked off a lot of copyright holders.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.880]   And Google, when it bought YouTube, knew that there was
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.920]   going to be an issue with copyrights.
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.240]   We talked about this on this week's Twill, and I encourage
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.400]   people to listen to it.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.400]   Of course, the Viacom decision kind of vindicated Google.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.240]   The court said, well, no, you're protected by the
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.880]   safe harbor provision of the DMCA.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:24.400]   And so Google is actually now OK with YouTube.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.640]   I don't know if this is directly comparable.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.080]   It's not really.
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.720]   But you're right.
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.880]   We're still in that brave new world of, you know, it's
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.040]   something that perhaps should make some sense that there
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.520]   should be a way to do this.
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.080]   Now, I just started--
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.600]   I downloaded the app this morning from about 5 a.m.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:45.720]   and haven't really gotten the chance to do it.
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.760]   It's very compelling.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:47.240]   Watch out.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.880]   I'm reading The Economist, for instance, right now.
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.200]   I don't know why you would subscribe to The Economist.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.520]   Now, admittedly, this is the stuff that The Economist puts
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.000]   online.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.120]   So the paper version may have other stuff.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.760]   And it's not the full article, but it's enough of the
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.920]   article that I kind of don't feel like I need to read more.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:06.000]   And it's a mashup too, because as you can see, there's
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.040]   Twitter comments here with further links in, although you
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.560]   can't click those links, which is really kind of too bad,
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.200]   that give you deeper--
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.080]   it's almost a gloss on this.
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.840]   This is very compelling.
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:19.240]   Right.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.600]   And the fact that they're scraping and not using RSS, now
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.960]   I'm greening that from the articles I read.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.280]   That's what I think too, yeah.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.480]   I don't know enough about Under the Hood.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:35.520]   But that's an issue too, because RSS is syndication that
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.800]   implies some reuse in various contexts.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:44.160]   There's been a lot of legal trauma over RSS as well, because
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.960]   as soon as you're syndicating something, people think they
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.200]   can use it for any purpose.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.400]   Does it let them off the hook that they don't charge for the
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.360]   app, and there's currently no ads in it?
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.160]   They're not, in other words, monetizing it?
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.200]   It certainly helps.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.960]   As you suggest, there's no guarantee that that's going to
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.240]   remain the case.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:09.560]   But the copyright law looks at whether you are interfering
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:14.240]   with the creator's ability to have a market for their work.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:19.480]   And as you just said about the economist, even with the
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:25.320]   free no ads scenario here, it seems to me that you are.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.800]   And a lot of--
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.120]   I mean, the real issue here is that a lot of these sites
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:35.560]   like the economists are attempting to have a market
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.960]   around their work in various ways.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.280]   And they have certain things behind a paywall.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.480]   This is not stuff from behind the paywall.
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.640]   This is stuff that's freely visible.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.640]   So that's where I think we're in a brave new world here, that
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:54.240]   this is not technically a web browser or an aggregator, but
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.600]   it's sort of a hybrid of both.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:02.840]   And maybe there needs to be some sort of exception in the
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:09.200]   free no ad context that makes room for something like this.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:13.040]   What about a technical solution to this situation?
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.520]   I mean, basically the copyright holders are having a problem
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.000]   with controlling their media.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.640]   What if we change the HTML protocol or whatever and the
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:28.240]   code in browsers such that the copyright holder can say, do
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.240]   not link to this piece?
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:35.640]   And none of the browsers would link to it.
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:40.680]   Put the control entirely in the hands of the creator.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:44.760]   That's a wild off the top of the head suggestion, but
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.320]   wouldn't that be possible, or at least a signal?
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.960]   I don't want to--
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:54.320]   I consider this proprietary or whatever, only my site.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.360]   Yeah, that's the question.
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.840]   Back to what Leo was talking about, how there was a lot
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:00.920]   of litigation in the early days about whether you could link
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:04.520]   to someone's site, whether you could deep link past the
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.480]   front door page.
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.360]   What is the status there?
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.200]   Because I know that some people have been forbidden from
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.840]   doing that, right?
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:16.440]   The status there is basically if there's a link and it's
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:20.480]   discernible or publicly available, there's no problem
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.360]   with linking to it.
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.240]   At least not in the United States.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:27.840]   There's been some rogue decisions in other jurisdictions.
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.440]   But basically, the linking cases have all come out.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.720]   Are you kidding me?
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.560]   Of course you can link.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.360]   It's the web.
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.360]   It's a link.
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.200]   What do you want?
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.280]   It's a link.
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.600]   And yet some people like Ticketmaster, I know, quote,
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.440]   forbid deep links.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:47.440]   Well, there was some litigation about that, so a while back.
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.880]   And--
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.160]   They say you can't, but technically you can, because
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.160]   the courts say you can.
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.000]   Is that it?
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.240]   I think that's basically how I talk them out.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.800]   Yeah, they say no deep linking.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.400]   Because what happens, people leak to concerts directly
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.600]   instead of going through the front door of Ticketmaster.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.200]   And they want you to go through the front door.
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.320]   For some actually legitimate technical reasons,
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.760]   they're trying to keep people from doing robotic ticket
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.560]   purchases and things like that.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.080]   Uh-huh.
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.640]   Well, yes, if you are circumventing somebody's technical
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:21.560]   measure that has prevented you from readily getting to a site,
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.440]   that's a different matter.
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:29.040]   But if it's a URL that is either publicly out there,
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.560]   or you could figure it out without too much problem,
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.680]   then linking is pretty much fair game
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.160]   as far as the law is concerned.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.680]   Do you?
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.040]   Yes?
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.000]   Denise, I'm going to let you get back to the pool.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:41.520]   Yes.
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.840]   Thank you so much.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.960]   And thank you for bringing this to my attention, too.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.520]   It's a super interesting topic.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:46.920]   It is.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.080]   And I can guarantee you we'll be hearing about it on Friday
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.520]   on This Week in Law.
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.000]   Yes.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.600]   Well, we'll take it up then, too.
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.160]   Thank you, Denise.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.440]   And I just heard today from Dan Gilmore,
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.600]   who's going to join us on the show.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:58.280]   I loved him.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:58.960]   That's going to be fun.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.000]   That'll be great.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.200]   Well, I did it this week.
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.120]   So if you want to hear me make a fool of myself,
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.840]   listen to this week's show on iTunes or other podcast
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:07.880]   aggregators and--
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.680]   It was wonderfully fun for us.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.600]   My only regret was it's your one day off of the week.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.200]   And it's all right.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:14.960]   That's all right.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.200]   For you, Denise, anything.
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:16.680]   Thank you.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.760]   Look, you're at the pool and you're calling.
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:19.560]   Thank you, Denise.
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:19.960]   Take care.
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:20.600]   All right, take care.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.160]   Have a great day.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.320]   Denise Hall, her blog is--
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:27.240]   blogs and blogarithms and bags and baggage.
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.120]   And look who's joined us in the lower right corner
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.560]   to block Callie Lewis is here.
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:32.040]   Hi, Callie.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.720]   It's great to see you.
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.440]   It's great to be here.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.040]   I just got back from a pool party.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.520]   You too, huh?
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.720]   Sorry.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.240]   It's all all around.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.880]   Well, we're so glad you could be here.
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.280]   We were talking about Flipboard.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.040]   And we're going to get back to talking about that
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:47.920]   and all the tech news.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.480]   I will tell you, Callie, since you're just joining us,
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.400]   that we've bookmarked the stories we're going to talk about
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.200]   today, as to the degree that we end up following any rules,
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.280]   on delicious, delicious.com/twit/25a.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.200]   Because this is episode 258.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:05.520]   And we will get back to the news in just a bit with Ray Maxwell,
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.240]   color guy on Twitter, Shura Lazar from CBS, Peter Rojas
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:13.800]   from gadget.com, Callie Lewis, from the new geek beat.tv.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:14.920]   It's great to see you.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.560]   We'll talk about the new show, too.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.000]   That's really exciting.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:18.480]   Really?
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.280]   In just a little bit.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.600]   But before we go any farther, I want
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:25.000]   to mention our good friends at Ford Motor Company.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.480]   I don't know if you know this.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.880]   We're going to be going to Detroit on Friday and Saturday.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.200]   We're covering Maker Faire.
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.720]   On Saturday, Friday, we're getting a great tour
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:38.080]   of the Ford Rouge plant, including the amazing virtual reality
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:43.520]   equipment they use to test and design cars ahead of time.
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.200]   It's really a remarkable technology.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.520]   We'll be streaming that live Friday, right after, actually,
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:53.760]   as we can come to think of it on live.twit.tv.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.960]   I drive a Ford Mustang.
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.880]   But I have to say, before I bought the Mustang,
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.520]   I took a look at the Taurus SHO.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:02.920]   And now I'm thinking about it again,
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.520]   this new Ford EcoBoost engine.
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.320]   I don't know if you're aware of this.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.960]   An amazing engine.
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:12.400]   This is a 3.5 liter V6 twin turbocharged
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.160]   that delivers-- get ready for this--
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:18.640]   365 horsepower, 3.5 liters, 365 horsepower,
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.880]   and a V6 with unparalleled fuel economy.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.160]   Two, it's standard on the new 2011 Taurus SHO.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.800]   And I'm kind of thinking, boy, I might want to try this.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:32.440]   EPA estimated fuel economy, 17 city, 25 highway.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:36.200]   But let me tell you, when you hit the gas pedal on this thing,
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.080]   it roars to life.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.640]   The twin turbochargers increase the air density.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:47.120]   It's using direct injection to increase fuel efficiency.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.760]   I don't need to explain this to the auto buffs out there.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.440]   But the fuel is pressurized into the combustion chamber,
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.320]   so it's more efficient than other injection methods.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.640]   Ford's using really amazing state of the art technology
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:02.320]   to design the most efficient engines in the industry
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:05.480]   and give you performance of much bigger engines
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.760]   with a fuel economy of a smaller engine.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:08.640]   It's truly amazing.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.840]   And of course, you know, the SHO will
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:14.240]   have the voice activated sync that I love so much.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:17.040]   Hands free calling, turn by turn, voice directions.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.240]   911 Assist, voice activated music and podcast browsing.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:24.320]   By the way, it works great with your iPhone 4.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.280]   Absolutely flawlessly.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.080]   I tried it.
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.000]   It works great with my Android.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.480]   And I have to say, my Android X, I use a T1 headset.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.400]   And I'll give you a secret.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.440]   This blue ant T1, there's a free Android download
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:43.480]   that's supposed to use with the T1 that reads text messages
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.120]   to your T1.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.520]   It works with a sync.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.800]   So now my Android, when I get a text message, reads me.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:52.120]   The Ford Sync reads me my text message.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.640]   And I can then choose from some pre-can messages
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.800]   to send back.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.800]   So pretty amazing.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.480]   Ford Sync, the Ford EcoBoost engine,
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.080]   combined to make an amazing automobile.
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:07.600]   Try the Taurus SHO at a Ford dealer near you shop
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.600]   at a Ford dealer this week and drive one yourself.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.320]   You will be blown away.
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.840]   They are in store now.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.240]   Drive one this week, the Ford show
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.120]   with the new EcoBoost twin turbo engine.
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.240]   Amazing.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.880]   And don't forget to watch our special broadcast.
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.600]   From Dearborn, we're heading out on Friday.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.080]   We're going to take a look at the Ford plant, the Rouge,
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.520]   the very famous Rouge plant, which
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.360]   was where the Mustangs were made, but not anymore.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:35.160]   So I won't be able to visit my baby's birthplace anymore.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:38.760]   Sheer Lazar, Ray Maxwell, Callie Lewis, Peter Rojas.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.240]   Great to have you here.
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.840]   I mean, I'm just curious.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.440]   I bet you, I'm going to guess, you're
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.600]   all iPhone 4 users, yes?
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.400]   No.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.080]   What do you use, Telly?
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:52.480]   I'm still on a 3GS, but waiting to switch to an Android.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.480]   OK, that's interesting.
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:54.480]   For you.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.240]   What about you, Peter?
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.240]   What are you?
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.240]   What are you using, Peter?
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.480]   I carry two phones, a Droid X and a BlackBerry 9700.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.200]   I got to tell you, I have never loved a phone more.
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.520]   Not any iPhone.
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.400]   This Droid X is fantastic.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.600]   It's really nice.
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.520]   It's really, really nice.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.520]   The screen is great.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:14.040]   The battery life is great.
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.560]   I get a lot of hate mail, a lot of hate mail,
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.800]   because I was an iPhone user for three years.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.480]   I did switch to the Nexus 1 at the beginning of this year.
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.040]   I was very excited about the iPhone 4.
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:23.520]   I loved it.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.000]   Beautiful.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.720]   But it was dropping calls, I mean, like crazy,
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.600]   because here in the Bay Area, AT&T not so good.
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.200]   And so I said, well, I'll try Verizon.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.480]   I got the Droid X.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.760]   Here's what I think.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.800]   I think once people get used to 4.3 inch screens,
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.400]   they don't go back.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.200]   It's hard to type on.
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.920]   It's easier to type on.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.560]   Now, Cali, you're smaller than me.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.440]   Is it too big for you, do you think?
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:49.280]   No, no, actually, I was concerned about the size,
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:53.800]   because girls' pockets are smaller than guys' pockets,
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:54.920]   for sure.
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.080]   And I like to be able to carry my phone around in my pocket
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:02.120]   without having to carry a purse or without fear of dropping it.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.800]   And it fits right in.
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:07.400]   I don't drop it unless it's in my hands, of course.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.760]   But it doesn't fall out of my pocket.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.720]   And it's a fantastic device.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:15.720]   I'm switching as soon as I decide to pay the termination fee
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.000]   over on AT&T.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.120]   Sure, you're still, I'm sure.
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.280]   I wait a second.
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.120]   I have both.
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.320]   I have a blackberry engine iPhone 4.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:25.400]   Really?
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.080]   Oh.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.080]   All right.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.520]   And I'm both-- I have AT&T and Verizon.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.400]   Can you believe that?
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.920]   Well, I believe it, because I have Sprint, AT&T, Verizon,
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.560]   and T-Mobile, so.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.360]   But that's our job.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:41.920]   You know, it's like Peter, Callie, you--
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:45.000]   I mean, our job is to try all the phones as many as we can,
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.120]   anyways, as much as we can stand.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:50.400]   To be honest, I haven't been able to use the phone on this.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.120]   The only way I call people-- because I use this typically,
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.640]   but if this runs out of battery, I'll go to my iPhone.
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.920]   Like, I use it to shoot video and just shoot pictures,
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.400]   and upload to YouTube and then the apps, of course.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.200]   But I've been using the Skype app to call people.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.200]   How sad is that?
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.400]   Is that because you're dropping calls on AT&T?
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.320]   Yes.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.440]   That's awesome.
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.240]   Oh my.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:17.720]   Well, is Apple in trouble?
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:18.720]   No.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:21.040]   As a hardware, it's a cool device,
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.440]   but this might as well just be a mini computer, not a phone.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.920]   That's the thing.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:25.960]   Very interesting.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.600]   Yes, I was talking to a study today,
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.400]   and they said exactly the same thing.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.080]   It should be called an iComputer, not an iPhone,
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.240]   because it doesn't do phone calls well.
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.960]   And as much as we complain about AT&T,
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:41.560]   I think there is something to the hardware aspect on the iPhone.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:42.640]   It's a combination of both.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.640]   It has to be.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.640]   It's a combination, absolutely.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.360]   But things are getting worse for me,
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.240]   and I'm still on the 3GS.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.920]   And you're in Dallas.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:51.960]   Yeah, Dallas.
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.880]   Well, and here's something nobody's talking about,
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:58.320]   but people who use the iPhone 3, the two model old iPhone,
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:02.480]   who have gone to iOS 4, are bitterly unhappy.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.760]   There is a revolt going on.
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.960]   It is so slow and unusable.
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.520]   So a word of warning, anybody who's still got an iPhone 3
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:13.440]   and has not yet upgraded, don't.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.920]   Although that puts you in an awkward position,
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.640]   because now you're suddenly out of the Apple universe.
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:20.400]   Ray, you're in Canada, so I don't know if you count.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:26.040]   iPhone 3GS running iOS 4 runs just fine.
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:26.880]   Good.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:29.600]   On the Telus network, and we'll tether.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:29.960]   All right.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.560]   Yeah, I think this 3GS is fine.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.000]   Oh, it will tether, which is nice.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.800]   That's another thing to droid.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.320]   X does nicely.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:40.920]   You pay $20 a month for it, but I traded in my MyFi,
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.720]   because basically this is a MyFi as well as a phone now.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.000]   It does the Wi-Fi tethering.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.920]   I really like that.
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.280]   Let's move along.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.160]   We did talk a little bit about quarterly results.
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.840]   Apple had a great quarter.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.800]   Microsoft had a great quarter.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.720]   We talked about this last week, Intel and AMD
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:57.320]   had a great quarter.
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.400]   In fact, AMD would have shown a profit for the first time
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.840]   in a long time.
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:05.480]   Is the PC industry coming back?
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.760]   Peter, do you have a thought on that?
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:11.760]   Well, I think that Intel and AMD have tried to diversify
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.480]   their product lines.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.520]   And I think that they were both smart to introduce
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.320]   the low power chips.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:18.200]   I mean, Intel got further along than anybody else.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.400]   And getting a netbooks--
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.400]   I mean, basically every netbook is using an atom processor.
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:27.760]   And Intel is trying really hard to get smartphones
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.440]   and the smaller devices using Intel chips at all.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.360]   And they're actually encountering a little bit of resistance.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.320]   But that's one reason why they introduced MIGO, which
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.240]   is that new mobile operating system that they did in partnership
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.000]   with Nokia.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.960]   Is that a terrible name?
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:41.760]   It's a terrible name.
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.760]   OK.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.760]   It is a terrible name.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.760]   MIGO, use phone.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.160]   But you know what the name they had before was?
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.080]   What?
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.280]   Moblin.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.120]   Oh, yeah, Moblin.
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.240]   I've used Moblin.
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.240]   Which is kind of a D&D vibe to it.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.360]   So-- and I guess in that sense, it wasn't so bad.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:01.440]   But I think that regular PC markets very mature.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.720]   And I think that we have to differentiate between a market
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.200]   that's going to die and disappear, which I don't think
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.240]   is going to happen anytime soon, with one that
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.480]   has just reached maturity and is sort of stabilized
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.840]   and isn't going to have a lot of its growth.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:13.480]   Race it earlier.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.400]   It's a commodity market.
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.720]   And I think that's exactly right.
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.880]   I think that most PC makers recognized that a long time ago.
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:22.040]   And I think it's one reason that HP bought Palm.
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:24.520]   I am writing a thing about this right now,
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:31.760]   which I'll post on gadget at some point, about why HP bought
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:32.280]   Palm.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:36.080]   And it was because they looked at the future of computing
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:39.800]   and realized that it's going to be about devices that
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:40.680]   are like the iPad.
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:41.320]   Yeah.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.680]   Factface, they're going to do the slate after all.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:48.320]   A Windows 7-based tablet towards the end of the year, right?
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.000]   I think it's going to be just an enterprise users.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.840]   And I think that it's basically going
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:57.400]   to be something that they release and then quietly shove aside.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:57.920]   Yeah.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:58.880]   And they do WebOS.
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:36:58.880]   They don't--
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.320]   WebOS is not in it at all.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.520]   WebOS is where their heart is.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.000]   It will be.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.720]   They will definitely do a WebOS tablet.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.400]   I don't think we'll see it this year, though.
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.600]   Oh, interesting.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.240]   Well, I don't think they have enough time.
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.520]   If they come out with something this year,
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:12.000]   if they actually release a product this year,
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.840]   I think it will be a shoddy product.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:15.680]   Why is that?
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:16.120]   It takes time.
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.240]   Well, it took-- I mean, I think Apple spent years
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.040]   working on the iPad and takes so much time
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.640]   to customize the operating system and so much time
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.800]   to optimize the hardware.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.600]   I mean, the thing that Apple did with the iPad
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:30.000]   that people don't think about is that they spent a lot of time
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.360]   making sure that the processor was completely optimized
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:37.440]   for the mobile platform.
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.000]   And so you have great battery life.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.160]   You have a super responsive user interface.
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.840]   And those things take a lot of engineering resources
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.560]   and a lot of time.
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:47.160]   That's a good point.
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:50.640]   That A4 chip-- correct me.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:51.600]   You probably know better than I.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.760]   But I was told that if you know your, for instance,
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.560]   you're not going to support Flash,
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.720]   you can actually customize the chip to be more efficient
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.080]   and leave that part out.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:37:59.580]   Yeah.
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:01.480]   Well, there are a lot of things that they did
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.240]   to optimize for battery life.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.800]   If you're not going to have a camera,
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.280]   you don't have to-- you can make the processor simpler.
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.440]   Things like that.
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.120]   That's interesting.
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.200]   So that's one of the reasons.
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:15.280]   Now, the A4 is in the iPhone 4 as well.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.760]   And the iPhone 4 does have better battery life.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:21.080]   Not as much as the iPad, but it does have better battery life.
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:21.920]   Yeah.
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.080]   It just has a much smaller battery than on the iPad.
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:24.640]   Right.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:25.760]   It feels snappy.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.600]   It certainly doesn't feel sluggish.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:28.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.120]   So is this custom silicon?
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:34.360]   Is that what HP is going to have to do, that kind of thing?
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.640]   Or can they use an atom?
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.640]   I think that.
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.280]   Well, I mean, that's one of the reasons
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:43.720]   why the slate that they introduced running Windows 7
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:47.000]   is so crappy is because it's on an atom processor.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.320]   And Windows 7 is just not fast enough,
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:51.240]   especially if you're going to start doing--
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:55.240]   you want responsive, touch-based input for a tablet device.
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.160]   This is not going to work.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.480]   And so I'm not sure that they're going
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:58.840]   to have to do custom silicon, but I
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.680]   think that they are going to have to find a partner.
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:04.200]   And maybe that'll be Intel.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.360]   Maybe it'll be Samsung.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.840]   And Samsung is really come a long way
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.000]   with these mobile processors.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.680]   They're going to have to come out with something
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:15.000]   that'll be highly optimized to make a great web OS tablet.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.600]   I think that they have a good shot at doing it.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.600]   But you have to keep in mind that HP
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.880]   doesn't have a lot of experience building
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:24.600]   and developing their own consumer software platforms.
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:25.840]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:26.400]   I guess not.
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.040]   They always use Windows, don't they?
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:30.120]   Yeah, and people forget.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:32.880]   But HP's actually been in the smartphone game
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:33.960]   for a really long time.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.600]   With the iPad.
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.040]   With the iPad line.
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:40.640]   I mean, the glisten was the last one I think they put out.
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.800]   Which I think says it all, right?
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.720]   It's slick and coated with fat.
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:46.560]   Yes.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:51.080]   Are you thinking that it'll be late next year or early next year?
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.640]   I think that they're going to try to really hard
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.280]   to announce something at CES.
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.200]   That would be my guess.
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.800]   We saw a lot of tablets announced at CES.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.200]   We still have yet to see any of them.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:00.760]   Yes.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:03.800]   All of that was going on at CES.
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:07.720]   That and ebook readers and none of them came out either.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:09.800]   Only 3D TVs.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.280]   But who's buying 3D TVs?
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.160]   Anybody here have a 3D TV?
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.160]   Oh.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:14.960]   No.
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:15.680]   Who is buying?
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:16.800]   Now they sold out.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.640]   I can't remember who it was.
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:18.480]   Had the first ones out.
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.840]   But they sold a sharp or something.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:21.440]   But they said they sold them out.
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:25.160]   The numbers seem to imply that it's being adopted
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:27.960]   at a faster rate than I would have ever expected.
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.040]   But I don't know anybody with one.
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:33.320]   Well, I feel like people buying the gigantic TVs
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:37.120]   are like sports fanatics who have game parties.
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.520]   And they're like, OK, guys, we're
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.320]   mules watching in 3D.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:40.840]   Right.
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:45.400]   And that's a huge part of America.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:47.000]   There's a lot of sports fans there.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.320]   Usually most of the programs that get the most views
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.440]   are sports shows.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:51.000]   Sure.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.440]   Sure.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:54.520]   I'm starting to feel like John C. Devorek.
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:57.400]   He may he has made a living saying everything sucks.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:59.480]   And I'm starting to feel like maybe that wasn't
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.160]   such a bad strategy.
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.440]   90% of everything that comes out in the tech industry
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.960]   does, in fact, suck.
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.560]   Now here's an interesting story from the Yankee group.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.640]   Let's talk customer satisfaction.
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.720]   They say that, according to the boy Genius Report,
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:18.000]   73% of iPhone users are happy with AT&T.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.480]   Of course, what they don't say is that means 20%, what
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.400]   is it, 27% or not?
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:23.920]   Right.
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.760]   That seems like a large number that are not.
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:29.560]   Frankly, Adam, I'm surprised they spun that as, hey, good news.
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:31.360]   Do we know what--
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:35.160]   just take the iPhone out of it on a normal satisfaction
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:35.680]   survey?
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:36.760]   Ah.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:37.280]   First.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:38.720]   That's a good question.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:39.480]   That's the thing.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.720]   How much is it really the iPhone versus the service?
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.720]   I think we're having--
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:44.640]   Nobody knows.
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:45.240]   Nobody knows.
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:48.440]   Although it's my feeling that since it was consumer reports
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.680]   that dinged them for the antenna,
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:53.880]   and they did their tests with-- not with AT&T,
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:58.760]   but with their own point, and in their own testing labs,
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.920]   seems to me that, well, maybe there is a problem with AT&T,
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.640]   but if there's a problem with the iPhone,
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.160]   it's independent of the carrier.
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.520]   Now, we have a lot of European listeners,
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.120]   a lot of Asian listeners.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.960]   And well, they're telling me right now,
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:13.240]   the saley is saying in the UK, the iPhone's just fine.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.120]   A lot of people are saying overseas
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:17.960]   that they're not seeing the same problems that we see in the states.
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.560]   In fact, a lot of people, even in the states,
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:21.520]   who have good AT&T coverage, are saying,
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.760]   we have never dropped a call.
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:24.600]   I just think--
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:30.160]   It's a combination of the antenna design and the coverage.
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.800]   And if you have excellent coverage and a high signal
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:37.800]   strength, then you're not going to see the problem.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:40.560]   Covers and multitudes of evils of sins.
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.080]   Right.
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:47.480]   And on the other hand, if you are in an area where you have weak
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:50.440]   signal strength, then it's going to be sensitive
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:52.280]   to how you hold the phone.
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:53.280]   Right.
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.920]   Well, as long as we're talking about customer satisfaction,
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:59.200]   Facebook, not so happy--
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.880]   500 million unhappy users.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:05.440]   It's a little bit of a disconnect.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.160]   Facebook now has half a billion users.
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.960]   They cross that point.
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.240]   Diane Sawyer was the 500-- no, she wasn't.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.360]   But they pretended she was--
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.000]   Five hundred--
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.680]   Five hundred one, whatever.
[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:18.520]   Half a billionth user.
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:20.720]   Now, somebody pointed out-- and this is actually
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.040]   kind of an interesting statistic-- there's only about a billion
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.320]   people who could use Facebook, who have internet access
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:27.560]   and a computer.
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:32.960]   That means half of the universe uses Facebook every month.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:33.480]   File.
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:34.760]   Is that an active number?
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:35.200]   I mean--
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:35.920]   Yeah, they say--
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:36.480]   They say months have--
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:37.080]   --signed up from a counter.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:37.960]   No, no, no.
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:40.280]   500 million active users, they say.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:41.360]   You know, this is what they say.
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:42.000]   We don't know.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:42.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:44.240]   Well, I was actually impressed.
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:45.680]   I have a Luddite sister.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:48.760]   She hates everything to do with technology.
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:51.920]   And I went to her house for planning some wedding stuff
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:52.960]   that she's getting married.
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.600]   And she was sitting there using Facebook.
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.120]   I was like, what are you doing?
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:58.640]   You hate technology.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:43:59.680]   You hate the internet.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.600]   I think that's who loves Facebook.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.560]   It seems to be.
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:06.160]   We forget that these things aren't just about technology.
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:08.160]   I mean, they started out as--
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.240]   obviously, techies create these platforms.
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:11.720]   But a lot of Twitter and Facebook,
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.400]   they're about humanity.
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.040]   Even Biz Stone, the founder, he said that about Twitter.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.160]   It's not just about technology.
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:17.920]   It's about humanity.
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:20.920]   And I think as kind of techies and geeks,
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:24.680]   we forget about that, that it's going beyond this community.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:29.280]   And when you see parents and just regular users that wouldn't
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:31.160]   just necessarily be into tech using it,
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:34.080]   you know it's kind of had its tipping point, obviously.
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:34.560]   Yeah.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.720]   But is it the techies that are getting upset with Facebook
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.080]   that hate Facebook?
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:39.600]   Yes.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:40.120]   It's just like--
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:41.480]   Well, what's the one that's really customer service?
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:43.520]   I mean, do regular people really
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.040]   know how to even click for customer service on the site
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:48.040]   if they can't even click their privacy option?
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:49.360]   Right.
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:52.280]   Well, yeah, because we're a little easier than privacy, though.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:54.600]   I do think people are aware of the privacy thing.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.160]   I see people talk to me all the time about it now.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.560]   And when I do radio interviews and things like that,
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:00.360]   people ask about that.
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.040]   They're kind of aware of it.
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.480]   There's that buzz in the background.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.840]   I don't think they know what to do with it
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:06.080]   or whether it's something to worry about.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:07.400]   That's what they want to know.
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.080]   They say to me, well, should I worry?
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.600]   That's what they would say.
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:13.600]   I'm interested in knowing what people are bothered about
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:14.360]   with Facebook.
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:17.000]   Like, what exactly are they going on the customer service
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.360]   for trying to reach out for?
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:20.280]   OK, well, I'll read you.
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:26.760]   This is the American customer satisfaction index
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:27.840]   from 4C results.
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:28.560]   Who are these people?
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.400]   I don't know.
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:35.120]   They're a number of statistics they came out with.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.000]   For instance, number one, when they ask the question,
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.400]   do you seek out recommendations for products or services
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.680]   on this site, Facebook number one?
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:44.360]   But it's only 16% say yes.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:49.440]   Then my space, Wikipedia and YouTube-- actually, YouTube
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.200]   did a little better than Facebook on that.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:53.600]   Have you ever purchased products or services
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:57.120]   that were recommended to you on this site?
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:58.280]   Facebook didn't do as well.
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:01.120]   YouTube was number one with 14%.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:04.480]   Facebook number two with 12%, Wikipedia 10%.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:06.880]   Does Wikipedia recommend anything?
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:09.880]   I think these people are drunk.
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:11.560]   My space, 8%.
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:14.000]   Sounds like there are preset options to choose from.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:14.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.800]   It does.
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:17.480]   Maybe these things are worthless.
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:21.080]   Maybe it was a marketing ploy to get all of us talking about it.
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:22.320]   Well, it worked.
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:23.440]   I'm talking.
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:31.720]   Social media, ACSI, Facebook 64%-- or 64 is the score.
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.000]   My space, 63.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.760]   The average 72.
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:37.960]   YouTube 73.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:40.600]   Wikipedia number one was 77.
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:41.280]   You know what?
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.800]   It did remind me-- well, I'd like to just take a moment.
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.480]   There has nothing to do with news to say.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:50.240]   I think if we look back 100 years from now at what the most--
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:53.560]   some of the most important developments were in technology,
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:57.000]   Wikipedia is going to rank right up there.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.680]   And I don't know if Jimmy Wales and the Wikipedia Foundation
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:00.840]   get enough credit.
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:03.800]   They have created an asset of such incredible usefulness
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.800]   that we just all take for granted.
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:08.600]   If you wanted to know something about a subject,
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.320]   in the old days you go to the library,
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:13.080]   you might get what you needed to take you a long time.
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:16.120]   Three seconds from now, I could find information on anything.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:17.680]   I could get an answer to almost any question,
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:20.920]   not just because of Google, but because of Wikipedia.
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:21.920]   So--
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:24.960]   And I love the fact that it's self-correcting.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:25.960]   Yeah.
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:26.720]   Yeah.
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:32.160]   And I find that it is the site that I use more than any other site
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:32.680]   on the web.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:34.480]   Me too.
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:40.400]   And me, I dig down into very deep technical topics.
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:44.240]   And I find it extremely accurate.
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:47.640]   And even in color science, they--
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:49.440]   They got it right.
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:50.320]   That's-- well, see that?
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:50.840]   And that's the thing.
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:52.440]   When you're an expert in a subject
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:54.840]   and you look at the Wikipedia article, nine times out of 10,
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:56.440]   it's very good.
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:56.960]   Yes.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:02.480]   I think when it comes to information on products
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:07.120]   or technical sides of things or whatever,
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:08.240]   it's really, really good.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:10.960]   When it comes to people, not so much,
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:14.520]   because people get emotionally involved in the editing of that.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:18.680]   But if you take that side of it out,
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:20.440]   then Wikipedia is fantastic.
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:22.560]   Yeah, if you want to go--
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:24.280]   I think I'll go ahead.
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.040]   Oh, sorry.
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:27.560]   I think all these sites, whether it be YouTube or Wikipedia
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:31.040]   that have crowdsourced content material by regular folks
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:32.120]   are becoming--
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:34.720]   we'll see in future years more legit.
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:37.800]   They'll be the places we'll be going to for content.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:39.160]   I think the interesting next step
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:43.440]   would be if official outlets like a news network
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:46.320]   or places like that would create partnerships
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:48.920]   with a site like Wikipedia as a place
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:51.800]   and legitimizing it as a place for real information,
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:55.000]   not just a place where random people are posting things.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.200]   Well, what do you mean, then they're in control?
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.240]   That wouldn't be good.
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:58.840]   No, I know.
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:01.840]   But partnerships meaning that they're getting feeds from Wikipedia,
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:05.160]   meaning want to find out more about this subject.
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:06.400]   It's like the encycl--
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:09.240]   it's obviously like an encyclopedia, modern encyclopedia.
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:11.680]   But I think Wikipedia has never been really taken seriously
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:13.360]   more and more so.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:17.840]   As they're having a history of subjects and people and events,
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:19.240]   they're becoming more legit.
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:21.160]   I love it that Jimmy Wales could make--
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:23.320]   we know, because of the number of page hits,
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.240]   could make hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:26.920]   So the foundation could make hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:29.400]   every year if they would just put a little bit of a Google ad
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:30.640]   on there.
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:33.280]   And even though they know that, they continuously--
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:34.800]   they continue to refuse that.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:35.520]   They raise money.
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:39.520]   I donated-- I don't know-- $250 the last time they asked for money.
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:43.320]   I just think that they've stayed clean.
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:45.280]   They have a higher purpose.
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:48.400]   And I just wanted to give them a little prop, that's all.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.000]   Maybe that's why we like them still,
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.520]   because they haven't taken advantage of having a problem yet.
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:55.520]   Everybody else is saying, how can I make money on this?
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:59.280]   And by the way, we're going to break for an ad in just a bit.
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.240]   But Wikipedia just goes out there,
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:03.720]   and they keep plugging away with good information.
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:05.160]   Of course, it's user-generated, right?
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:08.560]   So it's a little ethically, maybe a little challenging
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:10.760]   to try to make money off of that.
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:11.320]   Mahalo.
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:14.960]   Oh.
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:16.520]   That was mean.
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:19.440]   Hey, coming up, Walmart wants to put RFID in your pants.
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:21.520]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:22.560]   How's that for a tease?
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:25.800]   But right now, I want to talk about squarespace.com.
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:27.680]   If you're making a website--
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.560]   and who isn't these days--
[00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:32.200]   by the way, that's another point maybe to having to do with Facebook.
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.440]   It's fine to be on Facebook.
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:38.480]   But don't make Facebook your only presence on the web.
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:41.240]   I think you'd agree, sure, that as a social media expert,
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:43.960]   you've got to have multiple points of access on the web.
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:47.280]   And it's really important to have your own website.
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:50.520]   What a great place to do at squarespace.com.
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:53.520]   If you go to squarespace.com/twit, take a look at it.
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:58.320]   They call it the secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:00.480]   And it really is.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:02.080]   Starting at $8 a month--
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.880]   let's see if I can pull this up here.
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:08.680]   Run out of Switcher Port. Starting at $8 a month,
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:12.880]   you can create a site that is gorgeous.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:17.760]   It is both hosting and a content management system
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:20.240]   that is second to none.
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:22.680]   Dane and Anthony and the gang have just put together
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.800]   something truly incredible.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:27.440]   Templates that don't look templated that are easy to modify,
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:29.080]   even if you don't have any skills at all.
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:32.040]   You just drag and drop the columns and create things that
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.680]   just look unique and beautiful.
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:35.520]   And if you do know CSS and JavaScript,
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:36.800]   well, the sky's the limit.
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:38.600]   Great stats packages.
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:41.160]   So exactly who's watching, who's visiting,
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:43.600]   where they're coming from, how long they stay.
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:44.840]   Beautiful photo galleries.
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:46.680]   If you're a photographer or an artist of any kind,
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:50.120]   lots of people use Squarespace for portfolios.
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:52.720]   In fact, go to the examples page, squarespace.com/twit
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:53.840]   right at the top there.
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:55.160]   Click the Portfolios link.
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:52:02.200]   You'll see all the artists who use Squarespace to show their stuff.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:03.000]   This is so easy.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.880]   And look at these guys.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.240]   You know, they're aesthetic professionals,
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:09.640]   but they don't have time to be web designers.
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:15.000]   So they use Squarespace to do the job form and incredible stuff.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.400]   Squarespace uses a very sophisticated Java-based VPS
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:21.480]   technology to make sure there's always enough bandwidth
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.320]   for your site.
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:24.440]   No matter how popular it is.
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:26.680]   Take a look at squarespace.com/twit.
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:29.320]   You can try it free for 15 days.
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:34.960]   In fact, if you've got an existing blog on WordPress or TypePad
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.640]   or Blogger, you could just bring it right over.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:38.640]   They have import tools.
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:39.480]   It'll bring it right over.
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:40.600]   And you're never stuck.
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:43.880]   You can also get your data out of Squarespace.
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:44.800]   That's very important too.
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:47.760]   I think it's not a-- you never trapped there.

[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:31.760]   Thank you for their support of This Week in Tech.
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:34.940]   So privacy advocates going crazy this week,
[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:39.680]   because Walmart said we're going to require RFID tags in the pants.
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:45.800]   Actually in the tag attached to the pants.
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:47.480]   And my friend Jeff Jarvis, I think,
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:50.720]   wrote a great article saying, come on.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:53.480]   What is the privacy impact of this?
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:56.120]   People will know what my pants size is.
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:54:00.040]   What? They're going to search my garbage for the RFID tag.
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:01.120]   Is that--
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:03.880]   There's a key thing in the article.
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:06.640]   It says, removable tags.
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:09.920]   These tags, as I read the story, are
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:14.080]   used inside the store to keep track of inventory.
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:16.960]   When you buy the pants, they remove the tag.
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:20.440]   They're not going to track you after you leave the store
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:21.400]   with the product.
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:27.520]   So now another author there, commenting on this, said,
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:31.400]   well, some people have RFIDs in their driver's licenses.
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:32.240]   And the passports--
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:32.760]   We do.
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:33.920]   We do in our passports.
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.920]   And they're fearing that they'll read those.
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:38.360]   But they can-- all you have to have
[00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:41.760]   is a different digital code and make the equipment
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:43.740]   so it'll only read the code that's
[00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:46.680]   appropriate for inventory control at Walmart.
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:48.600]   If somebody has my driver's license,
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:50.800]   and you're required to hand it over all the time now,
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:52.160]   and you use a credit card and stuff,
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:55.600]   there's this mag strip on the back that has all the information
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:56.480]   you need.
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:59.280]   All they have to do is swipe it without me noticing,
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:00.560]   and they've got everything.
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:02.000]   Now, somebody did--
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.320]   I was talking to a friend of mine as a security expert,
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:04.840]   Shaquille.
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:06.520]   And he pointed out that on YouTube,
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:09.920]   there's a video you can watch about RFIDs in passports.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:13.000]   US has been putting RFIDs in passports for a while.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.520]   And there's a proof of concept video there
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:19.160]   where they use a long range RFID reader.
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:20.760]   And hackers know you can build--
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:23.000]   normally RFID, you scan it over something,
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.760]   and it's pretty close proximity.
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:26.760]   If you go to McDonald's and you have that instant pay thing,
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:29.280]   you have to wave it over the thing.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:31.760]   But apparently, you can make long range readers.
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:34.520]   Well, your fast track, I think, is something similar.
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:35.800]   They're passive devices, but you've
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:38.760]   got something that reads it from 10 or 15 feet away.
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:43.560]   And apparently, the US uses fairly distinctive numbers,
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:44.920]   and it's RFID.
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:47.760]   So they showed people walking through trash cans,
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:49.680]   walking around.
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:54.080]   And inside the trash can is an IED, a homemade bomb,
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:56.680]   and a little RFID detector that just waits for the American
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:59.760]   citizen to walk by and then explodes.
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:01.120]   That's a little scary.
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:05.080]   I don't think it's going to happen to my Walmart pants.
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:05.560]   But--
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:07.000]   But we just--
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.200]   Go ahead.
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:09.240]   You started going--
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:10.720]   No, you first.
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:11.640]   No, you go.
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.480]   No, you go.
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:16.440]   Yeah, the issue the privacy people have, obviously,
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:19.240]   is what are the implications for the future
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:21.840]   of anything to do with RFID?
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:25.720]   And they are constantly concerned that if we take one step,
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:27.640]   if we put one toe into the pool,
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:32.240]   then we're just going to get all wet.
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:33.800]   There is something to be said for that.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:36.520]   But with tags that are removable,
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:39.560]   with very weak signals that are going to be removed before we
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:41.080]   even take the pants out of the store,
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:42.320]   it's not that big of an issue.
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:45.600]   And we're already using RFID so much in our lives
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:47.080]   that we don't even think about.
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:48.840]   And it's not a security issue.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:51.880]   So I think they take it out of control.
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:53.520]   But at the same time, they're also
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:56.280]   trying to think towards the future.
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:57.920]   And that's a good thing as well.
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:59.680]   Yeah, I'm not so worried about Walmart.
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.800]   Walmart-- it's interesting because this is not the first time
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:02.760]   Walmart proposed this.
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:04.560]   In fact, I think it was two or three years ago,
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:06.560]   Walmart told its suppliers every one of them
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:09.240]   was going to have to have RFID in every item
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.160]   if they wanted to sell it at Walmart.
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.360]   I mean, it makes sense these guys
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:16.600]   must have an inventory challenge that is kind of unimaginable.
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:19.040]   And in that case, it wasn't the privacy advocates.
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:22.160]   It was the suppliers who said, hell no.
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:23.600]   What are you crazy?
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:25.360]   But I think Walmart's moving close to that.
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:29.160]   And I suppose that they may come that they--
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:29.600]   I don't know.
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:32.840]   While you're driving home, a bad guy could see what you bought.
[00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:34.040]   I don't know.
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:35.880]   Well, it would be easy to track anything.
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:36.240]   Go ahead.
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:36.680]   Go ahead.
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:37.720]   This, sure.
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:40.560]   No, I think it will be easy to track anything at this point.
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:42.800]   And there is definitely inventory issues
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:45.320]   at all these types of stores.
[00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:47.200]   I have family that are in the clothing business.
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.480]   And you really need to keep track of things
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:52.760]   as a store grows more and more in some place like Walmart.
[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:55.800]   But then I would say, interesting with the passport thing,
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:57.720]   because I would think with immigration,
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:57:59.760]   couldn't that become an interesting thing if they say,
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:02.360]   we all need to have our passports honest at all times
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:04.800]   to see who's legal or not legal?
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:05.600]   And now your RFID team--
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:06.480]   That's a good point.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:06.960]   --that said that--
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:09.040]   They could scan your car as you go by.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:10.400]   That's a good point.
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:12.520]   Yeah, and imagine that's a way to stop--
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:14.360]   that they could start stopping people in that way.
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:18.520]   If we do come to the point where every state actually
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:22.880]   goes through Arizona went through terms of stopping anyone,
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:24.720]   they could do it based on RFIDs.
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:26.680]   That could be the future.
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:29.600]   I think there is some concern about it.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:31.560]   By the way, they're pointing out in the chat room
[00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:33.960]   that the transponder in your fast track is not
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:34.840]   the same as RFID.
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:35.840]   I didn't mean to imply that.
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:38.040]   I'm just pointing out that you can make a reader that works
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:38.840]   somewhat similar.
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:41.960]   I am told by the bad guys.
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:43.720]   And then I love-- go ahead.
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:44.800]   Go ahead, Ray.
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:49.760]   Yeah, I think what we have to worry about is they have
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:53.600]   a transponder that you can put in your pet now, inject it.
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:54.560]   And I did it.
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:55.560]   That's good.
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:59.720]   Well, now when they start wanting to inject those in people
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:02.480]   when you're born, then I'm going to get work.
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:03.800]   All right, we'll wait till--
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:06.120]   There was a company that was doing that, Digital Angel.
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:07.640]   What ever happened to them?
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:08.640]   Really?
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:14.760]   Didn't like a Mexican legislator have that in plan
[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:16.560]   in the case he was kidnapped?
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:17.480]   Yeah, Digital Angel.
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:19.960]   I think that they are still doing this.
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:23.400]   They do it mainly for pets, but it is something
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:26.560]   that they did at one point an ounce of product for people.
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:30.280]   And I know that there was a nightclub in Spain
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:33.360]   where you could pay with everything via an RFID chip
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:34.360]   and plant it in your hand.
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:35.360]   I don't mind that.
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:37.280]   If I could just wave my body in front of it.
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:39.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:43.200]   That means that people cutting off your pieces of your body.
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:46.120]   If you have it right here, imagine they could cut it off.
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:48.920]   We're getting into a weird sci-fi territory here.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:52.320]   Yeah, everyone would need so much debt if we could do that.
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:54.840]   I'll take it to me.
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:58.120]   If people decide to put it in themselves, that's one thing.
[00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:02.320]   But putting it in it when we're born and just not giving us
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.440]   a choice, that's an entirely different thing.
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.400]   Yeah, I guess so.
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:05.920]   Right.
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.840]   My government requires it.
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:08.040]   Yeah.
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:09.640]   That gives me pause.
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:13.480]   A researcher trying to prove the fragility of social network
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:17.480]   security created an entirely fictional analyst listed
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:21.360]   her on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other services.
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:25.720]   Gathered-- this is from Wilson Rothman writing on msnbc.com--
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:29.280]   gathered over 300 friends from the US military,
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:34.360]   the intelligence community, and security companies.
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:38.400]   They interviewed her in computer world, Robin Sage,
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.520]   a figment of security researcher Thomas Ryan's imagination,
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.680]   an attractive 25-year-old woman with an MIT education
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:48.120]   a job at the Naval Network Warfare Command,
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:51.320]   and, quote, over 10 years, end, quote, of hacking experience.
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:59.160]   He got friends for Robin Sage who shared photos,
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.600]   personal information, conference invites,
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:03.680]   and requests to review documents.
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:08.240]   Employment nibbles from Google and Lockheed Martin.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:10.720]   The funny thing is people from the alleged school's
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:12.440]   Sage attended one nothing to do with her.
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:17.680]   People at MIT said they're very cliquey.
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:23.160]   Nobody from the CIA or FBI ever linked to her despite his attempts.
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:26.200]   But she had 226 friends on Facebook, 206 on LinkedIn,
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:27.920]   and 204 on Twitter.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.840]   Do you think we're kind of uncritical of people
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:32.640]   that we meet in these environments,
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:36.920]   especially for their attractive 25-year-old hackers?
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:39.040]   Certainly in innate trust, you know?
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:42.640]   But at the same time, I think, as a whole,
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:48.760]   we moderate ourselves as a community.
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:51.480]   And so I think that's where we have to put our trust in,
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:53.320]   people slip by all the time.
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:55.000]   But-- Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of people--
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.920]   I'm sure there are a lot of people who are guys posing as girls,
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.400]   or girls posing as guys, or all of that stuff.
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:05.280]   And maybe this actually, Callie, is to your point,
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:09.240]   your less sophisticated sister might not know that that happens.
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:12.280]   Do you think she's aware of that?
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:14.880]   She's probably aware that it might happen,
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.600]   but doesn't put any thought into it whatsoever.
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.840]   So hopefully, Callie's sister doesn't have access
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:23.200]   to classified information.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.640]   I'm just making an assumption.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.000]   She might.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:26.800]   Just possible.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.960]   It's an interesting thing, you guys,
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.920]   because Boston Globe actually released
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:33.720]   a story, I think, that was on Friday night about the Pentagon.
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:36.240]   They found they were checking out these kind of child porn
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:40.960]   sites, and while they were on their government emails--
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:43.600]   So there's obviously something going on with social networks
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:46.880]   in these sites, and people actually logging in when
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:49.200]   they're online, so people that work in the government.
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.440]   And it definitely brings up a security risk.
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:57.560]   Because then, if those sites have issues,
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:01.440]   or any sort of like worms or things that are messed up,
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.120]   they could go through the system, and people
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:07.720]   could then have access to government files and everything.
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:08.720]   What do you--
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:11.640]   We never covered the Jesse Slaughter story on here,
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.800]   which broke a couple of weeks ago.
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:16.640]   But I think we have two women on the panel,
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.000]   and social experts on the panel.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   I'm wondering what you think.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.800]   This is the 11-year-old girl who posted a bunch of videos
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.320]   on YouTube, a couple of them are with her dad just screaming
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:26.440]   at her and so forth.
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:30.560]   And she ended up being a 4-chand, and her mom says
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:31.360]   we had to--
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:34.400]   She's at a safe house now, in an undisclosed location.
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:37.160]   We're getting death threats from her.
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:38.800]   Sure, did you follow this story?
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:39.960]   What do you think of that?
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.080]   Yeah, no, I did.
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:43.760]   I think it's really difficult, because there's
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:47.560]   so many teens that they have their own kind of personalities
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:50.480]   online, and they become a bit viral in their community.
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:53.600]   But if you watch this video that she had on her Tumblr account,
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:57.680]   she basically, she was using really bad language,
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:02.840]   calling people out, saying that she was using some sort of relief.
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.560]   She's 11 years old.
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.760]   I mean, it was so sad.
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.080]   I don't think a lot of these teens
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:12.040]   realize the repercussions of what they're saying.
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:16.320]   They create these videos or blogs and posts
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.520]   with their little community, and they don't realize
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:21.920]   that it can venture beyond that.
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:24.640]   And so I think what really we need to start creating
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:27.240]   kind of an etiquette or kind of guidelines,
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:30.760]   and in terms of what people post,
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.560]   I think parents are going to become
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:36.320]   used to approaching their kids about this type of stuff.
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:38.200]   But I think that as kids grow up,
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.120]   they're just going to become used to what they're getting.
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:42.120]   It's like, it's like, you know what?
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:45.360]   What strangers are or get taken from a stranger,
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:48.520]   they'll learn what to do and what not to do online.
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:49.760]   I guess this is an outlier.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:50.840]   I mean, we can't say this is--
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:53.640]   I mean, but listen, this is-- I'll bleep out.
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:54.960]   For those of you listening at home live,
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:56.440]   you're going to hear some stuff you might not want to hear,
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:57.760]   but I'll bleep it out of the--
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:00.760]   - I'm going to say that you guys are ruined by life.
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:02.360]   - I'm going to tell you right now,
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.360]   this is from her father.
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:07.600]   You bought your lion no good and I know
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:11.000]   who it's coming from because I've backtraced it.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   And I know who's emailing a news doing it.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.840]   And you're clearly reporting to the cyber police
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:18.480]   and the state police.
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.760]   - You better write one more day.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:23.080]   - They're basically asking for it, aren't they?
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.600]   - Yeah.
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.520]   - That's a great way to handle it.
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:28.440]   Just go and make it--
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:30.720]   - Doesn't dad know where the on/off switch is?
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:32.080]   - Oh.
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:36.040]   And of course now there's remixes, auto-tune--
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.640]   - Oh, okay, you're getting--
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:38.560]   - Don't you put it here?
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:39.560]   - You don't like--
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:40.400]   - You don't like--
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:42.240]   - You guys are ruined by life.
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:43.880]   - I'm going to tell you right now.
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:45.480]   - I'm going to tell you right now.
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:46.680]   - Oh, please, I'm sorry.
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:47.520]   - It's hot.
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:50.320]   - It's sad, I mean, but it sucks because it's like
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.040]   a reality for them and it's actually
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:53.320]   like their lives are in danger.
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:56.520]   But then this is the internet and it's what happens.
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:59.800]   - We live in a world where, you know,
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.800]   this is the Jersey Shore world now.
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:03.600]   I mean, everything is spectacle.
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:06.960]   And if it's on a website or on TV, anything goes.
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.480]   I probably shouldn't have played it.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:12.280]   - To your point, it's certainly something
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:15.280]   that needs to be taken care of by the parents.
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.600]   It's the new sex talk, I guess, you know?
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:18.440]   - Yes.
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:19.800]   - There you go, you're right.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:20.960]   - So it's so high.
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:21.800]   - Yeah.
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:25.120]   - Yeah, so, but parents need to understand,
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:28.320]   maybe there needs to be like, you know,
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:31.640]   a campaign for educating parents on how to talk,
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:34.520]   you know, maybe we need these videos for parents,
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:37.520]   but the parents are the ones that have to be able
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:40.720]   to educate their own kids.
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:44.040]   And some of that will come by trial and error online.
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.640]   And we're still new to all of this.
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:48.040]   So it is at the beginning stages
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.960]   and it's gonna be trial and error.
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:50.880]   - It's kinda sad.
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:54.480]   - I think there's a similar issue with people learning,
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.720]   needing to learn how to trust and discern
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:59.520]   between different kinds of sources of information online.
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:01.120]   So I mean, you see people passing along
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:02.440]   bad information all the time.
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.520]   And I think that, you know, people,
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:08.240]   as we get, you know, sort of acclimated to the web
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.440]   and for a while, and it's still mean,
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:12.280]   even after 15 plus years, it's still, you know,
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:15.480]   new for a lot of people that, you know,
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:17.040]   how all this stuff works and the mechanics
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.720]   of how the web works and how information passes along
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:23.760]   and that not all sources, you know, are as good as other.
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.360]   Not every source is as good as every other
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:26.560]   or things that people have to learn
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:29.440]   and it takes a little while and you have to start to see,
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:31.440]   you know, bad information get passed along.
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:33.120]   I mean, I think this whole, you know,
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:35.440]   with the woman from the USDA,
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:38.360]   I think there's a perfect example of, you know,
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:41.200]   so a video, edited video being posted to the web
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:43.120]   and it, you know, gets a woman fired
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.560]   and then it comes out that the video, you know,
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:47.200]   had a wider context to it.
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:50.120]   And I think that that's a, that's very a good example
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:53.040]   of the kind of, you know, new media skills
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.240]   that everybody needs to learn,
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:55.320]   that you need to not every take,
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:56.920]   not take everything at face value.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:58.080]   - Yeah, I like what you said, Kelly.
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:07:59.720]   It's the new sex talk.
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.960]   Although I think parents, speaking as a parent,
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:04.080]   I think parents feel at sea because they don't know
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.200]   as much as their kids know.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:08.480]   So it, you know, clearly this dad was more clueless
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:10.400]   than his daughter was.
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:12.280]   - You know, so how is a parent going to talk about that
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:13.640]   if they don't get it?
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:15.400]   - Yeah, it's a good point.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:18.040]   It's like a new media literacy that people need to learn.
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.200]   I mean, should schools be teaching kind of getting
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:23.360]   to other parents and having social media people,
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.320]   like all of us kind of going into schools
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:27.920]   and telling parents like really what they should be aware of
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:30.160]   and what they shouldn't and how to react to situations
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:31.000]   like this properly.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.120]   So it doesn't become, you know, like the laughing stock
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.200]   of the internet.
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.200]   - Yeah.
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.200]   It could be like those fire safety assemblies
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.360]   we all had to go to in junior high.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:42.760]   - Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, drop,
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:44.040]   and stop tweeting.
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:44.880]   Yeah.
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:46.720]   - Believe it or not.
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:47.560]   - It's a smartphone.
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:49.440]   - I think what you, one thing that concerns me
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:51.560]   is maybe an overreaction of the part of authorities
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:53.760]   and parents in schools where they, you know, they say,
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:54.600]   "Okay, that's it.
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:56.600]   No more Facebook, no more Twitter."
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.600]   You know, you got to be 18 to use these things
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:08:59.440]   or something like that.
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:01.280]   And I hate to see that too.
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:03.000]   - Yeah, because we have so much brilliance
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.640]   also coming out of kids, you know?
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.120]   They're amazing.
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:08.600]   They have so much talent.
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:10.760]   But on the other hand, you have the kids
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:13.480]   that are posting too much or going too far.
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:16.160]   And so yeah, I would hate to see that you have to be 18.
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.000]   I mean, that would not be good.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.720]   - In some ways, you're the poster girl for that, Callie.
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:22.360]   You decided you wanted to do an internet show.
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:23.880]   And it's hugely successful.
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:26.640]   And it's just because of the internet, you could do that.
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:29.440]   And, you know, I mean, I guess we're all kind
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:30.760]   of the benefits here. - That's so great.
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:34.400]   But, you know, still that that's happening with kids
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:37.680]   under, you know, at 16 and 14,
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:40.520]   that they're finding success and finding talents
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:43.000]   that they wouldn't have otherwise explored.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.840]   - So, I mean, the chat room says, what about,
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:48.120]   maybe Twit, Casman says, maybe Twit should do five minute PSAs
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:50.560]   that we distribute saying, "What?"
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:54.080]   "Hey kids, here's what you're not to do."
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.400]   I don't know what I,
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:10:00.400]   a lot of the schools have a consumer education classes.
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.960]   You know, teaching kids about credit
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:05.480]   and the fact that credit costs you money.
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:08.600]   And it's, you know, if you save up and buy something well,
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:10.440]   they need the same kind of thing, I think,
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:13.680]   aimed at the internet and how to use the internet
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:15.320]   and whatnot, you know.
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.760]   - Actually, you're in Canada, right?
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:18.720]   Here in the States, we just tie our kids into chairs
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:20.640]   and hope they survive four years.
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:22.080]   (laughing)
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.280]   I don't, you know what, that's true, actually,
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:26.200]   in my kids' high school, the public school
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:29.240]   that he went to briefly, this is why he's not going anymore.
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:30.440]   It was a remedial class.
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:32.360]   The normal kids did not get credit education.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:35.040]   Only the remedial kids got credit education.
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.200]   Isn't that nice, huh?
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:37.600]   How to balance the checkbook?
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.280]   Well, it's remedial.
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:42.000]   The rest of you, you figure it out.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.240]   I want to take a break, we're going to come back.
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:45.160]   We have a great panel with us, Peter Rojas
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:47.200]   from gadgets, gdgt.com.
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:50.440]   Callie Lewis of Geekbeat TV, I want to hear about that.
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:53.360]   Sheira Lazar from CBS, and of course, the Great Ray Maxwell.
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:54.680]   I've formerly of Maxwell's house
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:56.600]   and a great friend of the Twit Network.
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.320]   It's good to have you all on board.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.720]   Two Canadians on the show today, I just want everybody
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:01.560]   to know.
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:05.800]   The two Canadians, one Texan and a New Yorker.
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:06.840]   What diverse?
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:08.160]   Originally from California, though.
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.480]   OK, we'll let you off the hook.
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:13.080]   I'll you a New Yorker.
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:14.760]   I've only been here nine years.
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:16.440]   I think that counts.
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:17.280]   It counts.
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:18.600]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:21.560]   I want to mention our friends at audiblebrieflyaudible.com.
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:25.360]   If you listen to audio programming, and obviously you are,
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:27.840]   you probably already know about audible.com.
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.560]   God knows we talk enough about it.
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:35.160]   It's a great site for people who love listening.
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:36.520]   And people who love books, too.
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:38.680]   I want to kind of point that out.
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:42.640]   Of course, there's 75,000 titles, not just books.
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:45.440]   Comedy performances, radio shows, all sorts of stuff.
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:50.720]   I love the books, mysteries, science fiction, history.
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.800]   I just finished The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo,
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:54.120]   and I have to recommend this.
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:57.320]   This is a wonderful book.
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.200]   Stieg Larson-- actually, it's a trilogy.
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:01.560]   Stieg Larson's passed away, but they call it the Millennium
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:02.280]   Trilogy.
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:05.200]   And there's two more, also both on Audible,
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:07.400]   The Girl Who Played with Fire, and The Girl
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:11.360]   with the Hornet's Nest, I think it is.
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:14.080]   It's interesting, because one of the main characters
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:16.680]   in this-- there's two characters-- one in elderly middle-aged
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:21.360]   journalists, roughly my age, and the other a young 20-something
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:26.920]   hacker who is kind of anti-social, but brilliant.
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:30.080]   And she helped solve the mysteries in this book.
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:32.080]   It's a very-- I think a very feminist book.
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.160]   Any of you read the book?
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:34.160]   I really enjoyed it.
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:37.840]   The woman is so strong in it, and it also
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:41.520]   shows you a Sweden that is not the clean, sanitized
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:43.720]   Sweden of our fantasies.
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:46.440]   The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larson.
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:49.680]   But this is just one of-- as I said, 75,000 titles.
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.040]   It's one you can get absolutely free.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:53.400]   In fact, you can get the first two books
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:55.200]   in the Millennium Trilogy for free,
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:02.880]   if you go right now, to audible.com/twit2.
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:05.160]   You'll be signing up for the Gold account.
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:06.840]   That's two-- I'm sorry, the Platinum account.
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:08.920]   I have the Gold account, one book a month,
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:10.480]   and then there's a Platinum account.
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:12.880]   Actually, I have the Platinum account, two books a month.
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:14.360]   And the first two books are free yours
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:16.360]   to keep you can cancel at any time.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:17.640]   The only problems?
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:18.520]   Pick in two books.
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:20.800]   There's so many great ones.
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:22.920]   My recommendation, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:25.800]   and the sequel, The Girl who kicked the hornet's nest.
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.320]   Actually, I think The Girl that played with fire
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:27.960]   is the second one.
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:29.960]   Then The Girl who kicked the hornet's nest.
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:33.040]   Some really great murder mystery novels.
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:36.360]   Well-written, fascinating, with some very interesting
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:37.040]   characters.
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.760]   But there's much more on here.
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:45.640]   audible.com/twit2 for your iPhone, your iPod, your Zoom,
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:47.200]   your Kindle.
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:50.080]   A lot of GPS devices, over 500 devices.
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:51.840]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:56.600]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:57.920]   Did any of you do--
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:00.880]   Callie, did you do a day in the life in a day video
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.440]   on Google yesterday?
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:03.600]   No, I didn't.
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:04.080]   I didn't.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:05.240]   I forgot.
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.080]   I know.
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:07.080]   I am bad.
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:07.920]   You're bad.
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:09.640]   Shira, you didn't do it either.
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:10.480]   I tried to.
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:13.160]   I'd shot a few things, and then I didn't get back home
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:14.360]   and died to upload them.
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:15.520]   They should have done it for Sunday.
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.520]   Oh, no, wait a minute.
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:17.600]   Oh, no, it's not too late.
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:18.800]   You just had to shoot it on that day.
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:21.080]   You have a week to unbloat it, Shira.
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:21.640]   Really?
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:22.640]   Yeah.
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:27.000]   How do you know if you really shot it that day, though?
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.480]   Oh, I guess they don't care that much.
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:32.760]   So we-- Leo, you and I could go ahead and do something.
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.680]   Yeah, we're going to get the yesterday's newspaper.
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:36.960]   Now, Jack, we're saying that you have it on Twitch,
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:39.120]   so look, though, that you just did it afterwards.
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:41.280]   I don't think they would mind if Leo--
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:43.800]   I think we get enough exposure, don't you, Callie?
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:44.400]   This is the site.
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.400]   It's a YouTube idea.
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.920]   Remember the day in the life videos is kind of like that.
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:53.800]   The idea is, by the way, it's two big time directors doing this.
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:58.320]   Kevin McDonald and Ridley Scott.
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:01.520]   And so what'll happen is they're going to-- they asked everybody
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:06.040]   to shoot what they're up to on July 24th,
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:07.200]   and then upload the video.
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:09.080]   And yes, you have a week, Shira.
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:12.200]   And they said to upload something that's funny or interesting
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:14.000]   or something you really care about, not just--
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.280]   it could be mundane, I guess.
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:18.120]   They're going to edit the best of these together
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:21.160]   and make a movie that I think they're going to show it at Sunday.
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:22.080]   Send it in.
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:25.200]   I actually interviewed the director, Kevin McDonald,
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:27.360]   for my blog on CBSNews.com.
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:28.520]   This is a neat idea.
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:31.560]   I can't wait to see this.
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:34.320]   Yeah, it's going to be premiering at Sundance in 2011,
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.160]   so that's next January.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:39.360]   And yeah, it's a little bit of an experimental documentary
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:43.120]   for them, because these are obviously two huge big time
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:44.840]   of Hollywood directors.
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:46.840]   But I think it's totally cool.
[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:49.680]   And it's a great way to get the online community also kind
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:54.800]   of interested and engaged in more like long form feature
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:55.720]   format.
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:57.200]   And hopefully, if it's in theaters too,
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:59.240]   you'll have the people that are on YouTube
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:01.320]   and the theater is watching the movie as well.
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:03.480]   So what did you shoot?
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:04.000]   Me?
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:04.680]   Yeah.
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:07.280]   Oh, well, I was at a concert with MIA yesterday.
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:10.440]   And so I kind of shot all day just going from work at CBS News
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:13.000]   at 5.30 in the morning to walking around New York.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.800]   You also had to answer these questions.
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:15.840]   What do you love?
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:16.440]   What do you fear?
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:19.520]   And what's in your purse or your pocket?
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:21.880]   And so besides actually documenting your day,
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:23.840]   you had to answer those questions, which will be interesting,
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:25.360]   because it'll kind of--
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:26.760]   actually, they'll splice those up.
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:28.960]   Those like emotions up into little pieces.
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:33.320]   And then I did a video of a guy dancing
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:37.480]   at this electronic DJ thing yesterday
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:39.560]   with his shoes on his hands.
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:41.560]   It's kind of like one of those wacky dancer guys,
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:44.240]   like big.
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:46.400]   I think that's what's going to make it into the movie.
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.960]   That's the bit you got us a bit.
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:48.720]   I don't think that's fun.
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:52.080]   I didn't really do anything that like a release.
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:54.000]   No, I swear I'm uploading that to YouTube.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.240]   It's a freaking hilarious video today.
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:01.160]   What's the biggest viral video any of you guys have--
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:03.080]   how many-- what's the biggest number of hits you guys
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:04.120]   have done?
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:06.000]   Anybody have a million hit video?
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.320]   Callie, what do you know what you're--
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.080]   I think the dig the code did.
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:10.000]   Dig the code.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.800]   The one you did with Jeff and that code that was the--
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:17.200]   HD DVD code, the gut road.
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:19.640]   That was the dig blocked and then forget it,
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:20.840]   because everybody put it on.
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:21.400]   That was good.
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:23.200]   I'm sure that got more than a million hits, absolutely.
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:24.320]   I think that did.
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:27.320]   Devorax got a-- the stupidest video I've ever seen.
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:31.240]   It's a Barney doll in his bathroom singing,
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:33.280]   "I Love You" or whatever.
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:35.520]   And it's got well over a million hits on it.
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:37.920]   It's like, what?
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:39.240]   So it kind of took the--
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:43.080]   I think that we watch as online users.
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:44.080]   Crazy.
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:45.760]   It's hard to believe.
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:49.000]   How long has those videos been up, like all those videos
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.720]   that you guys are talking about?
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:52.120]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:56.080]   We have a video that's almost got a million views now.
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:59.520]   And we was just something we did one off on live.
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:01.560]   Remember that I'm on a horse video,
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:05.000]   which-- so that was around January, this old Spice guy,
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.960]   before he was famous.
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:09.160]   When that video first came out, we interviewed the guys
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.480]   to the creative who had written a commercial
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:13.240]   that we did in Kennedy and shot it.
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:15.280]   Because we didn't know how they made it.
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:18.480]   So they walked us through shot by shot how they made that.
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:19.920]   And that's had almost a million hits.
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:21.040]   That's probably my biggest one.
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:23.680]   That or swearing out Mike Arrington, I'm not sure.
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:25.160]   I was going to say--
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:28.320]   I think, truly, that one's had a million, Leo.
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:30.120]   You know, I ran into Mike--
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:30.840]   it was pretty funny.
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:33.200]   I ran into Mike at food camp a couple of weeks ago.
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:35.400]   And he was like--
[01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:37.440]   he was like this.
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:39.440]   And the guy said, oh, don't hit him.
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:41.680]   And I said, what are you talking about, Mike?
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:42.320]   We get along fine.
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:44.240]   I apologize to Mike.
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:46.440]   And we talked and stuff.
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:48.320]   But I will never leave that down.
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:52.560]   They say that video now has 1,191,000 views.
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:54.640]   So I guess that's my biggest--
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:56.200]   That's your legacy, Leo.
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:58.760]   Isn't that sad?
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:00.960]   That's what you will be remembered for.
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:01.400]   Yeah.
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:04.800]   Leave that in your will to your children.
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:08.400]   To my kids, I give screw you, Mike Arrington.
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:11.120]   You give them Google AdSense to your kids.
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:12.880]   Now, somebody told me I haven't done this yet,
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.080]   but they did it on--
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:15.920]   Brian Brushford did it on NSFW.
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:19.640]   If you turn on the captioning on it,
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:21.880]   you know how they do the-- now YouTube has captioning.
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:23.160]   But it's really awful.
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:24.000]   It's like no good.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.680]   Yeah, it's terrible.
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:27.360]   Apparently, there's very funny on that one.
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:28.560]   And is that right, John?
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:29.160]   Am I right?
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:31.000]   Is that the video that they showed?
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.040]   And it ends up something about-- instead of saying screw you,
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:36.840]   it says butt Cuba.
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:38.040]   It must be automated.
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.440]   It's completely automated.
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:41.480]   It's like, huh?
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:42.640]   Butt Cuba.
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.640]   So that's become the tagline.
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:46.640]   It loses something in the translation.
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:47.840]   He does, doesn't he?
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:50.880]   I feel sorry for anybody who was reading the transcript
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:53.000]   instead of listening to the--
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.320]   you know, the full language of the episode.
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:59.320]   The full delivery body language.
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:00.840]   And it must be seen on video.
[01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:02.600]   I'm so sorry that that's recorded,
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:04.360]   because it's like one of my most embarrassing moments
[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:04.640]   of life.
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:07.680]   And of course, that's the one that gets remembered.
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:10.960]   I just wonder if the people who have to read the captions
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:15.200]   are thinking that the entire world has gone nuts.
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:18.120]   Yeah, when Google did this, it was like, well, thanks, Google.
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:21.280]   But I can't imagine anybody using this.
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:22.560]   Maybe it'll get better.
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:23.880]   We're going to end on a serious note.
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:27.840]   There's a very serious Windows vulnerability
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:31.000]   that affects every version of Windows for the last 10 years,
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.760]   including Windows NT, all the way up to Windows 7.
[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:36.320]   We talked about it on security now.
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:38.280]   And if you haven't listened to this week's security now,
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:39.280]   you probably want to.
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:42.040]   The sad thing is there is no fix for this.
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:45.760]   And there probably won't be a fix until Microsoft--
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:48.200]   at the earliest, till Microsoft's regular cycle updates
[01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:50.640]   in the second Tuesday of August.
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:54.960]   They call it the LNK 0-day or USB 0-day.
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:59.520]   If you read Microsoft's security bulletin 228 6198,
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:01.920]   it's a vulnerability in the Windows shell
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:04.920]   code that renders shortcut icons.
[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:07.320]   These are the .lnk files.
[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:09.560]   This vulnerability has been there for 10 years.
[01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:11.680]   It has survived multiple code reviews.
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:14.520]   Remember how Steve Ballmer said, we
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:16.840]   are going to review every bit of code in Windows XP.
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:18.880]   And Windows Vista is going to be the most secure code we've
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:19.280]   ever written.
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:20.840]   There will not be a single flaw.
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:22.720]   We'll get right through it.
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:24.240]   No problem at all.
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:29.000]   And bad guys have discovered this attack.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.720]   There are already websites that take advantage of it.
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:37.000]   The ISC warns, quote, prepare for extensive attacks
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.520]   of Windows 0-day.
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:42.680]   What happens is you go to a website--
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:47.400]   and by the way, PIF files as well can be subverted.
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:50.000]   The first samples were on USB keys.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.360]   So it was-- it would install itself on a USB key root kit
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:57.240]   itself so that nobody could see it.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:59.960]   And then it would copy itself to the next computer
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:00.600]   in the next computer.
[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:02.040]   And every time you use a USB key, it
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:03.440]   would copy it to all the computers.
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:04.680]   But now it's out there.
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:07.000]   It's all over the place.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.080]   Metasploit, which is a commonly used tool from hackers.
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:13.280]   It's in Metasploit.
[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:14.000]   It's everywhere.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.680]   Microsoft's fix for this is to turn off the shortcut rendering
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:18.200]   engine.
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:19.600]   So that's a quick workaround.
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:23.120]   But all your shortcuts will suddenly become lnk files,
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:25.280]   will suddenly become blank icons.
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:27.960]   Siemens already has been infected.
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:31.760]   The Siemens SCADA equipment, which I think is a router,
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:34.040]   has been infected.
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:36.680]   If you want to fix it, there is a Microsoft Fixit tool
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:40.800]   at 228-6198 that disables shortcut icon rendering.
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:43.880]   But it is not a long-term fix.
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:45.920]   And in fact, I wouldn't be surprised
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:50.600]   if it is only a temporary fix as hackers work around that.
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:54.560]   So this is a very serious vulnerability.
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:55.960]   I talked about it on the radio show,
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:58.200]   and I almost don't like to because there's nothing you can do.
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:01.360]   It's like, sorry.
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:03.760]   And if they do bring out a fix, how far back
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:04.480]   are they going to go?
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:04.840]   Right.
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:05.720]   Well, they don't--
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:09.040]   You know, I know they're going to go back and send us 95.
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:09.520]   Yeah.
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:11.160]   I mean, what are they going to fix?
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:12.160]   Yeah.
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:14.320]   [SIGHS]
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:15.000]   I don't know.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.480]   I don't really know what to say about this.
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:21.320]   You want to yell at somebody, but I don't know who you yell at.
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:23.800]   I was saying it's like the BP oil spill.
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:24.360]   It is.
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:26.760]   It's very much like that.
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:27.760]   That's really good.
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:28.960]   That's very much like that.
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:31.400]   It's like this is horrible.
[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:33.760]   Who do we get mad at?
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:35.440]   I don't know.
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:35.960]   I don't know.
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:36.920]   Yeah, obviously you guys are--
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:38.360]   That's your favorite set.
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.720]   You know, you all use Macs, don't you?
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:43.000]   I could tell.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.240]   You're like, this window stuff?
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:44.440]   OK.
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:47.040]   You're all sitting there smugly going, well, it doesn't bother me.
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:48.040]   Yeah.
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:48.920]   I have parallels.
[01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:50.320]   I have parallels.
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.240]   I have two or three programs that I
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:54.560]   have to run from time to time.
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:58.040]   And by the way, one of them is an RC helicopter simulator.
[01:23:58.040 --> 01:23:59.040]   That's very important.
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:00.040]   Oh, they're nice.
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:06.680]   Well, that could be infecting your computer right now.
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:08.760]   And finally, we'll end up with this.
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:10.120]   The most important story.
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:13.040]   I thought it might be that window story, but no, this is more important.
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:16.160]   The queen has joined Flickr.
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:22.600]   The British monarchy now has a photo stream on Flickr.
[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:30.440]   The address is Flickr.com/photos/BritishMonarchy.
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:33.200]   Why didn't they name it the queen?
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:35.160]   Well, it's not just the queen.
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.560]   It's the queen mother.
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:38.400]   It's the Duke of Edinburgh.
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:39.680]   Queen Anne, Queen Margaret.
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:41.040]   You know, it's the fam.
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:41.880]   Yeah, OK.
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:43.440]   The whole fam.
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:45.960]   They should have called it the royal family.
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:47.560]   Yeah, that would have been better.
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:50.160]   There's got to be something better than that.
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:51.720]   They're a social media person.
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:53.520]   Just obviously doesn't.
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:55.360]   But they're doing some things right.
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.440]   Look, it has a little map.
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:00.440]   This photo was taken July 18, 2010 in Upper Marham, England.
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:01.840]   They have a little map with a dot.
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:05.520]   Now we have an actual British person in the studio today.
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:08.080]   He brought me chocolates from Herod's.
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:09.320]   So Chris, what do you--
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:10.920]   pull up a microphone over there, Chris.
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:12.840]   We got to get Chris's point of view.
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:19.280]   What do you think of the queen having her own Flickr stream?
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.280]   Are you excited, Chris?
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:20.920]   Come on, admit it.
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:21.840]   You're excited.
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:22.520]   I can't say that.
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:23.000]   I'm excited.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.800]   I think that it's another one of those things
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:28.360]   where the monarch's still trying to become relevant.
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:30.560]   Be relevant.
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:33.960]   It's a medieval institution, but it has a Flickr page.
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:35.800]   Does she have a Twitter?
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:36.320]   I don't know.
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:37.760]   She has an iPod, I don't know.
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:38.360]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:40.800]   I should be asking you, Ray, and you, Shira,
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:43.320]   are you members of the British Commonwealth?
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:46.680]   Not only that, when she comes to Canada,
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:48.920]   she is in residence.
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:50.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:50.960]   Wow.
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:58.160]   So we still have a monarch in Canada, and she is it.
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:25:58.560]   Wait a minute.
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:25:59.400]   You're from Montreal.
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:03.120]   Do you bow down to the British monarch, Shira Lazar?
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:07.160]   I'd say it manages for any way to be connected to Europe,
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:10.760]   because I like being the Euro connection.
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:12.840]   I think that we should start a Twitter protest
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:14.800]   to get the queen on Twitter.
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:14.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:17.960]   Like the Dolly Lommo, like Betty White, with SNL.
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:18.320]   Yeah.
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:21.880]   I think we should hear Leo to get the queen on Twitter.
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:22.720]   Oh, dear.
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:24.720]   Had tea sandwiches today.
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:25.520]   The crusts were double.
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:28.800]   We could all do tea time with her virtually every day.
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:29.680]   It's a very good idea.
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:31.120]   It'd be awesome.
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:31.720]   Yes, Brian.
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:32.440]   What a really--
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:35.240]   Surely she could host Saturday Night Live, maybe.
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:36.760]   You know, we could--
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:39.200]   Somebody said the queen's Twitter handle should be,
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:41.640]   "Hoo!
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:43.360]   Come here from the queen!
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:44.560]   Hoo!"
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:45.760]   All right, enough of that, Celina.
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:48.040]   Tell me about Geekbeat TV.
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:50.120]   You're on your own revision three now, Callie Lewis.
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:51.600]   That's great news.
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:54.200]   I'm very excited to be partnered with Revision 3.
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:58.520]   And so Geekbeat TV is kind of what you've always, you know,
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:01.920]   expected from me three to five minutes of technology,
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:05.520]   news, and gadgets, and all the fun stuff
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:06.880]   that I'm passionate about.
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:08.480]   So you're not changing the format at all.
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:09.480]   It's still similar to--
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:11.800]   Well, it is a new look and feel.
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:14.080]   So it's a little-- it's slightly different.
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:15.880]   But yeah, I'm very excited.
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:21.840]   And I feel a new energy and a new passion with the new show.
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:26.240]   And some good things coming up very, very soon too.
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:30.200]   So actually launching a new show coming up here
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:31.720]   called Webbeat TV.
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:33.160]   And that's not out yet.
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:35.480]   But we are looking for a logo, so.
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:36.480]   Cool.
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:38.080]   Crowdsourcing that, huh?
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:38.600]   Yes.
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:39.960]   Did you crowdsource the Geekbeat?
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:41.360]   I liked the logo on this.
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:42.000]   I did.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.720]   I really like my new logo.
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:44.880]   I love it.
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:46.960]   I call that little guy Dexter.
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:49.320]   Yeah, he's definitely a poindexter.
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:50.280]   I love it.
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:54.280]   Geekbeat.tv, and it's three to five days a week.
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:55.240]   How many days a week is it?
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:56.040]   It's three days a week.
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:57.360]   Three days a week.
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:00.880]   Still the hardest working woman after me.
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:02.040]   You're not a woman, Leah.
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:03.440]   OK, so there you go.
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:05.360]   You got it all to yourself.
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:07.000]   Chirla Zar does so many things.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.160]   I don't even know where to start.
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:09.920]   CBS, of course, you've got your blog there.
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:12.600]   What is the address of that?
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:16.160]   CBSNews.com/OnTheScene.
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:19.680]   And I also host live stream during the early show on Saturdays.
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:21.840]   CBSNews.com/BackstageLive.
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:24.080]   But you can find it all on the scene.
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:24.440]   I always--
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:26.960]   It's digital trends and web culture.
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:28.840]   I always feel sorry for you when I see you.
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:31.120]   It's like three in the morning.
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:31.520]   You got to do it.
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:32.120]   I know.
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:33.440]   But we actually get--
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:35.760]   So you'd be surprised to see a lot of people watching that
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:38.280]   aren't just in the states and in Canada,
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:39.920]   but all over the world.
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:40.960]   It's daytime there.
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:43.400]   And they want to watch American TV.
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:45.320]   And so I do that.
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:47.760]   I host a lot of live streams for a lot of events,
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:48.760]   a lot of premieres.
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:53.520]   And yeah, I'm kind of having fun online.
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:54.360]   Very cool.
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:56.480]   On The Scene on CBSNews.com.
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:58.240]   And Chirla Zar.com is a great place to go.
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:28:59.480]   You get all the information.
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:00.880]   Yes, everything's in there.
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:02.840]   That's the hub for everything.
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:07.560]   Ray Maxwell, everybody was so sad when I brutally, viciously,
[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:09.000]   canceled Maxwell's house.
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.120]   But you've spent more time on the Twit Network ever since.
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:15.200]   So I hope they'll cut me some slack.
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:18.960]   @colorguy on Twitter still doesn't have a web page.
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.040]   That's why I fired you, Ray.
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:21.480]   You know that, right?
[01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:22.480]   That's right.
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:24.000]   No one-- you can't be on this network
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.280]   if you don't have a web page.
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:28.000]   I have one, but I'm not proud of it.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:28.560]   Oh, OK.
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:29.440]   That's different.
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:31.360]   None of us are proud of it.
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:32.960]   I'm not proud of mine either.
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:34.720]   But I got one.
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:36.440]   Go to Squarespace, Ray.
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:37.440]   It's nice to have you here.
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:40.280]   Thanks for joining us @colorguy on Twitter.
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:45.480]   And Peter Rojas is keeping very busy, I'm sure, at gdgt.com.
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:46.760]   What a great site.
[01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:49.360]   You added the news recently, the gadget news.
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:51.200]   What else is going on in GDGT?
[01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:53.960]   Yeah, we're doing a big event in Seattle on Tuesday night.
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:56.520]   So if you are anywhere in the Pacific Northwest
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:58.800]   and want to play with a bunch of gadgets,
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:00.880]   we're doing a show box, Soto.
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:02.800]   Which, if you live in Seattle, you probably know it
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:03.760]   as a music venue.
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:06.840]   And we're going to have a couple dozen different tech
[01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:09.400]   companies showing off new toys and gadgets and stuff like that.
[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:13.120]   And you'll be able to see the Windows Phone 7
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:14.760]   will be there and a bunch of other stuff.
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:15.640]   What do you think of that?
[01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:18.600]   Oh, so you've played with that Samsung developers model
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:19.120]   that they gave out?
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:21.240]   I've played with an earlier one.
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:22.840]   It's actually pretty nice.
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:23.200]   Yeah.
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:25.600]   Paul Therrot was talking about it on Windows Weekly this week.
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:28.040]   He's added for a while, but I guess they finally
[01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:29.800]   lifted the embargo on it.
[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:32.880]   Yeah, I think it's just the problem is very late to the game now.
[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:34.320]   Yeah, Microsoft even said this.
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:36.240]   You bomber said that we missed the cycle.
[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:38.320]   But maybe they're in time for the--
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:40.000]   I don't know.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.360]   The holiday buying season.
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:44.040]   This is going to be like World War 3.
[01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:47.160]   And it's going to be a trench warfare
[01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:48.440]   between all these different platforms.
[01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:50.880]   But I think that the sooner the Microsoft
[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.960]   can get this thing out, the better off they're going to be.
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:55.240]   I have to say, I think Microsoft
[01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:56.680]   has done some very innovative things
[01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:58.120]   with this new Windows Phone 7.
[01:30:58.120 --> 01:30:59.720]   What I've seen of it--
[01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:01.320]   and I think that's good.
[01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:04.960]   For one thing, they're trying to think in a more modern way.
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:09.680]   Even the iPhone still has its heritage.
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:11.600]   And it seems like the designers at Microsoft
[01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:13.440]   were told, look, cut the cord.
[01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:14.720]   Do something completely different.
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:17.120]   And so it's got that zoom kind of--
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:18.480]   They started completely over.
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:20.320]   The Metro interface and all that.
[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:21.280]   Yeah, I'm really nice.
[01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:22.680]   Yeah.
[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:23.480]   I'm very interested.
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:24.800]   So well, we'll see.
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:27.400]   Those will be coming out, I think, October or November.
[01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:28.480]   Yeah, be out this fall.
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:28.980]   Yeah.
[01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:30.540]   Favorite, what's your hot gadget these days?
[01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:31.540]   What do you like?
[01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:32.380]   You like the Droid X?
[01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:32.880]   I know.
[01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:33.900]   I do like the Droid X.
[01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:36.060]   I just got the 27-inch iMac.
[01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:37.040]   I got it on Friday.
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:38.360]   You-- isn't that amazing?
[01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:39.220]   That's just too big.
[01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:41.200]   I'm sorry, that's too big.
[01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:42.200]   No, it's not too big.
[01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:46.100]   In fact, I have a 24-inch LCD right next to it.
[01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:49.160]   I also have surrounded by screens right now.
[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:50.920]   This is actually lighting me.
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:51.300]   It is.
[01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:53.200]   You don't need light panels.
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:54.560]   You've got an iMac.
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:56.640]   You just need an iMac on Fulbright.
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:58.900]   You actually look like you're in an interrogation chamber
[01:31:58.900 --> 01:32:00.160]   to come to think of this.
[01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:01.560]   Well, I just built this home office,
[01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:03.080]   and it's like a tiny little--
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:06.520]   yeah, it has kind of a Guantanamo Bay kind of vibe to it.
[01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:09.320]   Live from Gitmo, Peter Rojas.
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:09.920]   Well, that's great.
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:11.000]   It's great to talk to you, Peter.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.160]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:15.640]   GDGT.com and Ryan and Veronica, I
[01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:17.160]   hope you beat Maria Sharpova.
[01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:19.000]   That's all I can say.
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.880]   Now she's tweeting, I didn't play her.
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:24.440]   She was just giving me tips.
[01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:25.600]   That's what losers say.
[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:26.600]   Yeah.
[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:29.580]   Ah, you got her.
[01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:31.380]   Don't forget, we're going to be live from Detroit.
[01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:33.020]   We're going to the Motor City.
[01:32:33.020 --> 01:32:34.380]   Friday will be broadcasting.
[01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:40.660]   I think it's going to be around 11 or noon Pacific time.
[01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:44.100]   But watch the TwitCalendar Live.Twit.tv for the exact broadcast
[01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:47.500]   time from the Rouge factory, the amazing virtual reality
[01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:49.860]   stuff they have at the Ford plant, how they design cars
[01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:50.980]   in the 21st century.
[01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:52.060]   I cannot wait to do that.
[01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:54.300]   The next day, we're at the Maker Fair at the Henry Ford
[01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:55.020]   Museum, come by.
[01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:55.900]   We'd love to see you.
[01:32:55.900 --> 01:32:58.300]   We darn doing an event, a little meetup, just a small meetup.
[01:32:58.300 --> 01:32:59.540]   It's just me.
[01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:02.500]   At the Hyatt Dearborn on Friday, I
[01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:07.240]   guess that's the 30th of July, 7 to 10 PM.
[01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:07.940]   Look for the sign.
[01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:11.220]   I think it's the Archimedes lounge, although we are getting RSVPs
[01:33:11.220 --> 01:33:14.940]   that indicate that we may in fact be too big for the facility.
[01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:17.480]   So just look for signs.
[01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:20.900]   If we had to go to Tiger Stadium, we'll leave a sign.
[01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:23.460]   They'll say we're at Tiger Stadium instead.
[01:33:23.460 --> 01:33:24.600]   Never mind.
[01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:25.100]   I think we--
[01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:26.620]   Expect a small number of people.
[01:33:26.620 --> 01:33:27.500]   Did you, Leo?
[01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:31.060]   Well, I don't know.
[01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:34.300]   I see Kevin Rose and they get 2,500 people showing up
[01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:34.900]   at their meetups.
[01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:36.860]   You probably get hundreds and thousands of people
[01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:37.740]   at your meetups.
[01:33:37.740 --> 01:33:39.300]   I'd be happy with 10.
[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:42.180]   10 fat guys, 10 sweaty fat guys who
[01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:43.460]   want me to sign their mouse pads.
[01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:45.820]   That's all I need.
[01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:47.540]   That's usually what I get, by the way.
[01:33:47.540 --> 01:33:48.460]   So I don't know.
[01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:49.060]   We're going to have fun.
[01:33:49.060 --> 01:33:49.580]   It's going to be great.
[01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:50.080]   I can't wait.
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:52.580]   I haven't been to the Detroit area in years.
[01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:54.580]   We did a designing there for Tech TV.
[01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:56.100]   Probably 10 years ago.
[01:33:56.100 --> 01:33:59.980]   So I'm looking forward to that.
[01:33:59.980 --> 01:34:01.380]   Find out more.
[01:34:01.380 --> 01:34:02.580]   I don't know.
[01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:04.420]   Follow my Twitter feed, Leo Laport.
[01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:07.020]   I think I'll-- I'm sure I'll tweet it or buzz it or something
[01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:08.220]   like that.
[01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:08.860]   I guess we're done.
[01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:10.020]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:10.700]   We appreciate it.
[01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:11.540]   Thank you for watching.
[01:34:11.540 --> 01:34:13.860]   We do this show live every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m.
[01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:17.060]   civic, 6 p.m. Eastern 2200 UTC.

[01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:21.900]   By the way, thanks to MediaFly for making that possible,
[01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:27.900]   not only on your iPhone and your BlackBerry and your Android.
[01:34:27.900 --> 01:34:29.700]   They've got MediaFly on all those platforms,
[01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:31.260]   but also on the Roku box.
[01:34:31.260 --> 01:34:32.660]   You can watch the video.
[01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:34.740]   I think we're getting the streaming going, too, as well.
[01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:37.420]   So you'll be able to watch live on Roku, as well as any
[01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:39.980]   of our shows, downloadable after the fact.
[01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:41.980]   Also on Yahoo TV.
[01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:43.820]   Pretty much we want to be everywhere you want to watch.
[01:34:43.820 --> 01:34:45.700]   And thanks to MediaFly, a great partner that makes it
[01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:47.180]   possible for that to happen.

[01:34:54.540 --> 01:34:55.100]   Another Twit.
[01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:56.100]   This is amazing.
[01:34:56.100 --> 01:34:56.620]   Isn't it?
[01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:57.620]   OK.
[01:34:57.620 --> 01:35:00.420]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
