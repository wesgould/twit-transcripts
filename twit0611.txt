[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.140]   Jason Heiner is here you went back home. You were out here this week
[00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:25.420]   Sorry about that. That's okay for the F8 developers conference from CBS interactive and I see Jason Heiner.com now on
[00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.300]   Thing there is that indeed Jason is Jason is my is my best phrase my boss
[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.900]   Well because not only did he make the president of the internet many years ago in tech republic
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.740]   through a
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.740]   dual process election
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.140]   It's true, but you wrote a great book
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.120]   And I'm apparently a chapter in that book. I haven't had the nerve to read the chapter yet
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.620]   Chapter 9 you haven't read it yet. Wow. I didn't know that I read a little bit
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.140]   But I just like I'm nervous about reading it. I do have I mean I may never come back on this show once you
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:10.480]   Read it so a website expired. What the hell I do I clicked follow the geeks and it said the websites expired
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.120]   Let's go. Yeah, so
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.380]   More people were going to the yet. We've pretty much not done follow the geeks book.com which we did when we launched it
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.760]   But we we pretty much sent everybody to Amazon now because what we found was that's where they go anyway
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.400]   Business thing. Yeah, exactly. That's where they go anyway
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.200]   And when they go to the website they end up not going right there and so and as I learned
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.360]   To my bitter dismay you make more money from Amazon associate fees
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.240]   Then you do from the royalties book
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.000]   Will tip for the future authors of the world
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.160]   Anyway, great thing authors brutal. It's brutal. The book is not a way to make money
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.960]   Don't ever go into it thinking you're gonna make money, you know five percent four percent of people actually make money on it
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.000]   Something like that. It's a terrible way, but it's a fun thing to do. Yeah, it's a lesson, you know
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.600]   It's a it's a labor of love well. We're we're putting out a little warning to the
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.520]   naive and in cinemas
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.200]   welcoming also
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.400]   No connection here serenity called well from i'm more calm, but don't do a book. Are you considering they're pushing?
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.080]   Never
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:29.200]   No, I won't say never but the book the book that I would do has nothing to do with technology and would probably just be for my own personal
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.200]   Satisfaction
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.920]   Yeah, you do a novel your fiction. I had a or technically it's a graphic
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.040]   It's some it's a it's a novel less graphic novel, but it is very much in progress
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.840]   Like I've been working on it for 10 years. So it's it's one of those like again passion projects
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:55.160]   Well, but I I mean you're you're a great artist because I remember you were the first one who showed really what you could do with an ipad pro and the apple pencil
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:01.080]   And uh, and you affected a whole article a graphic article on i'm more not dead
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.800]   Which I love yeah
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.160]   so
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.880]   You why how else are you gonna review a stylist by then by showing how it writes and draws?
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:18.120]   Yeah, so she did the apple pencil drawn review of the apple pencil and by the way, you could I would I would read your graphic novel
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:25.000]   It's awesome. Well, we'll see if I ever get the time to to actually draw it. So
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.120]   Yeah coming of age grow it like little kid's story. I love it. I love this character
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.600]   This little this serenity this little serenity. It's so great. I love it also here. Oh
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.880]   Doctor, what's the matter? Oh doctor. Oh and jj stone. What's the matter?
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.680]   I've been spending the last three months writing a novel. I'm halfway through it. Are you?
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.320]   No
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.640]   Sorry, man. I got to rethink my life
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.320]   And I don't even know how to read
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.120]   No, no, we're talking about computer books. We're not talking about novels
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.040]   Oh, oh good. Because this is this is fiction. This is amazing. I give you a secret tip
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.120]   It's from a dream that I had while I was jesus. This is true
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:16.920]   The book is about stuff on marberry. Isn't it? This is book is about stuff. It sure is or word elkure you
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:23.240]   War down exactly and how they go down look you see my shirt uncleo how do I lean?
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:29.000]   See read it can read it in cog Negro. That's right. That's how I roll it now
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.240]   You've used that phrase on our show before
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.920]   I use it often and I finally decided to put it on a shirt
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:40.040]   And then if somebody wants to buy one don't message me and I'm it's a million of them and I give up on this book idea
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.920]   Well, we're where can people go to buy in cock Negro
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:49.000]   T-shirt. It should I wear one or would that be inappropriate? I would love to see you. You know what?
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.960]   I let's do an experiment next time I come out. I'm gonna give you one and we're gonna go like a fancy restaurant
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.440]   I'm gonna wear a suit and you wear it as t-shirt
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.920]   And I just want to see what people say be the rachel dole's all of uh, petaluma
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.040]   Oh, it'd be a great actually we should send one to rachel
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.000]   Yeah, yeah, get it done get it done
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.680]   Ladies and gentlemen, we did not come get together to talk about all of this fall to raw
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.760]   We got here to talk about tech
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.560]   But frankly sometimes with the tech business it's fun to talk about novels and
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.520]   t-shirts and it is to talk about the tech
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.720]   Jason you were at uh facebook's developers conference f eight was this week
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:34.040]   Uh, we talked yesterday to a cheerleader for ar robert scoble
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:41.400]   Maybe the best known ar cheerleader in the world. He was very excited about what facebook's planning was
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.160]   Uh, it's augmented reality in fact what facebook said
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:52.680]   Was that uh, they were gonna they're introducing a new platform facebook loves platforms last year
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:58.200]   The platform was the bots this year. It's the camera in the facebook app
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.160]   He says it will be the first augmented reality
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.200]   platform
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.400]   What does that mean and what do you think?
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:13.480]   Yeah, yeah, and look mark zucker bird even said look we know we're a little slow on this
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.160]   But we're all in that was that's a paraphrated. That's essentially what he said
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.480]   What is what he should have said is we know we're stealing this all from snapchat, but we're all in
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:27.960]   Yeah, exactly exactly. I mean and well, you know to be to be honest
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.960]   I thought and I anticipated I said earlier this year
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:38.280]   I did an article in february where I said the two biggest moves facebook could make for its future
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:45.880]   are ar and cloud like amazon aws stuff right where they take all they've learned from building data centers and the
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.960]   Cloud and and offer it to the world because facebook is
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:55.720]   Incredible at at that stuff. They're the king of scale. They are the king's scale
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:04.760]   Yes in the same way amazon is they are they are they could really give amazon or run for its money in ways that other vendors aren't
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.400]   Long-term anyway, that's not they're not talking about that yet, but ar they did talk about obviously
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:14.360]   We didn't go five minutes into the keynote before mark zucker bird was talking about ar
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.360]   Um, but I do think there might i'm kind of a split
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:25.240]   Mind on this because one of the they're cto and the people there that talked about what they're doing in ar
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:30.920]   They really understand this stuff deeply right they they understand all the technical parts that you have to do
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:37.240]   Um to to make this right and to make it happen and they understand how hard it is and that they have to make it
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.520]   So it works on a phone whereas this stuff is actually just a few years ago
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:45.400]   You really almost needed a supercomputer to to kind of run it or at least a lot of cloud power
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:53.080]   Um, so so they get that but then their answer to ar right now is like putting stickers on photos
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.680]   And so that does not impress me at all
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.320]   um, I can um, there's a
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.600]   Picture I posted on twitter where i'm sitting there
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:09.480]   Um to go to went to there like ar designer and it basically has this thing that's put stickers all over your face
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:17.400]   And so I put that on and I put like the future is here with ar it's tweeted something, you know, um somewhat snarky, but um
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:22.760]   That stuff was I just was not super impressed with that most of the money that's being
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:32.200]   Invested in ar and where people where there are big bets are company. Yeah, there you go. You got it. Um, that our people are are making
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.200]   um, uh
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:40.040]   Are making investments and making bets on ar is the stuff that can really be useful right training
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:47.160]   Um surgeons sharing stuff through surgery. Um, even up to down to the sort of consumer level of
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:52.360]   Um, you know, you've seen pokemon go but pokemon go also, you know
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:57.800]   Was a service that was getting people to move around it was getting people to make friends it was getting
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:03.880]   Um, uh, it was a great opportunity for places to get more foot traffic
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:09.000]   Which if you're a retail organization of any kind is is the number one thing that you want and so
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.360]   Um, it's a huge opportunity for facebook to take advantage of that because they know more about people
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.480]   They know more about events. They know more about businesses
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:25.080]   Um, than anybody they have more of a, you know, a yellow page and white pages kind of listing than anybody
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.040]   But they didn't talk about any of that kind of stuff and either
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:32.440]   Either that part is still embryonic and they don't want to maybe play their hand yet
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:37.240]   Um, but but I was not impressed with them just showing like look we're gonna let you put stickers
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:43.080]   We're gonna let you take this um selfie and you can fill the room up with balls behind you in
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.320]   You know virtual
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.040]   Um balls to fill up the room or fill up the room with water
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.480]   And um, yeah, that's so if didn't impress me much at all
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:57.160]   Uh, so I kind of think that they're this shows that they're really really early in this
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:02.600]   They wanted to do something that was a little bit flashy and looked good in a in a keynote or a demo
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:11.320]   Um, but I wonder how ready or serious they are about the things that about with AR that are going to really make a difference
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:17.480]   And that are worth getting excited about serenity of course apple is supposedly and I know tim cook said this
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.320]   numerous times
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:23.640]   Also all in on ar I mean the only company really doing ar right now
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.480]   I guess is microsoft with the hollow lens and then there's smaller companies
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.720]   We actually had one on yesterday on the new screen savers demoing, uh similar stuff
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:38.600]   But but we don't really know what apples up to because apple's so secretive. Do you think this is the year of apple? Uh, an ar
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:46.200]   Uh, I'm still hesitant on whether or not apples ar project is going to come to fruition this year
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.760]   Or if it's more of a long, you know, a long game
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:56.600]   I I mean, I think it makes sense for pretty much any company who is interested in doing technology to to focus on
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.080]   augmented reality
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.280]   Uh, and just in general finding a way to make the
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:09.400]   layer between real real life and what we can do with the internet more seamless
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:15.560]   Right where it's like the the watch and wearable technology is one step of this
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:21.320]   And ar is the sort of the next step is like how do we allow people to interface with their tech
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.280]   And also still exist in the real world
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:29.080]   Um, and that you know, of course brings up all kinds of ethical questions in terms of you know, like
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:34.920]   Is it okay if i'm pretending to look at you, but my contacts are secretly showing me emails like
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:40.760]   There's societal questions to be asked, but we already we already do that. It's just a lot more obvious now
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:46.040]   It's you know, if i'm ignoring you to to read twitter, it just it looks like this
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:51.320]   Uh, yeah, you can kind of tell in fact you can tell even if you can't see somebody you know
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:55.640]   Everybody's had this experience. You're talking to somebody in the phone and it's really obvious
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:02.840]   That they're reading their twitter feed good right? Yeah, everything's fine. Yeah. Yeah, that sounds fascinating. Uh, huh?
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.920]   Oh my god. Yeah, so good
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.560]   We all have seen that we've all experienced that. Yeah
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:14.440]   Oh, do you snep go ahead? I'm sorry. I mean you're interrupt. Oh, no. No, I I was just gonna say I just don't see
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:20.600]   Anyone have coming up with the the right solution sort of you on musk talking about his, you know
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.440]   Plan to put chips and brains
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.880]   But there's really not a good wearable solution right now
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:31.400]   For ar and I think that apple has to conquer that and conquer the technology problem
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:37.880]   I mean the hall lens is a great idea in theory, but that's again the hall lens is still pretty much a prototype phase, right?
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:41.240]   It's not you know, it's it's not something where you're like, yes
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:48.200]   This is here the future is existing and in a compact way that I can take wherever I go
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:54.840]   Uh, and and until we get that down we have you know, we have uh failed attempts like google glass
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:15:00.760]   So I don't I don't see apple coming out with ar until they're absolutely ready for to have the right product
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:09.080]   I'm playing with an ad at f a sorry. Goodly. I'm just playing right now with what facebook claims is there wildly innovative
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.160]   ar future
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:17.400]   And it it's snapchat. It's okay. Yeah, can we just can we just stop for a second again with all this junk?
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:21.720]   I mean, Jason you sat there that I love you man, but that was a long soliloquy
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:27.160]   Of potential great escapes to get back to this is still junk and it doesn't matter
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:32.760]   I mean you said all the potential great things in the world, but until we can do that until you can show me that functionality
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.080]   This is basically i'm just trying to be snapchat
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:40.680]   I'm trying to have some cookie cutter filters and some mochi on a lot of chatez and a shark coming up on a table
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.480]   And who gives a who and or any it's cute fuzzy stuff
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:49.160]   Only thing I appreciate about this stuff is that it pushes technology forward so that maybe in 30 years
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.560]   We can actually have some futuristic wearables and wait a minute ar that matters
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:59.400]   I mean come on like you're you got a cat on your face and that's the coolest thing we don't look what
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.840]   Look look
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.880]   Look
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.880]   Zoom in on this. This is awesome watch
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:10.680]   I'm chewing a carrot universal carrot. Yeah, yeah, if
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.400]   An analyst virtual carrot
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:20.120]   I used to have my daughters rabbit ears that she took of my gas and I had antlers from
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.920]   I just put ears on my head bro like it's not that serious and I and I do do that
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:29.000]   I do that doofy stuff a little turn it to no, I like I see you use a snapchat
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.920]   I see you using it. I just told you I do it, but it's not anything important is frivolous stuff
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:40.280]   So when you show me a doctor doing some surgery or looking at the veins. Well, that's what Jason was saying
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.120]   That's what serenity was saying
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.120]   He said it
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:49.160]   Somebody doing that but then I could believe all right. I have two different takes on this on the one hand
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.360]   It does feel like all I mean facebook is
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:56.760]   Is like the old microsoft, you know predatory monopoly
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.480]   When when they were threatened by insta
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:05.160]   When they were threatened by instagram they bought them for a billion dollars when they were threatened by what's app a messaging app
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.640]   They bought them for 24 billion dollars. They tried to buy snapchat
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.960]   They couldn't buy snapchat and so what are they doing their response?
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:19.000]   Just like microsoft is well, then we'll put all of the features of snapchat in messenger
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.640]   and uh an instagram
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.720]   And kill them and eat them alive and so that's the cynical point of view
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:30.360]   And so this big announcement on ar is you know, not really that
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:35.240]   It's just you know a cover up icing on the cake of let's clobber snapchat
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:39.560]   I'd also would say if you're as long as i'm going to be on the negative side and i'll do the positive
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.760]   And but I would also say if you're a developer at this point
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:48.120]   To trust facebook as a platform. That's a shaky ass platform
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:52.440]   I mean how many people built games for facebook and then got clobbered
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.840]   How many people built bots for facebook well bots aren't the new thing now it's
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.920]   Uh filters. I would be very nervous about going all in
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.400]   I mean facebook's where all the people are so people are going to do it
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.440]   But look at all the publishers who have abandoned instant articles
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:12.440]   Uh now that we're going to guardian has joined the new york times and said we're not going to publish to facebook's instant articles anymore
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.880]   Because it's there's no way to monetize it facebook's not sharing their revenue
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:20.280]   Um, I feel like so that's the negative on the positive side. I do feel like
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:26.360]   Augmented reality is going to be a lot world-changing technology and a lot of times when technologies are new
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:31.000]   They are you know the the game room. They are silly. They are
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.360]   Trivial they look a little terrible. Yeah, and they look and they don't work very well because they're brand new
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:41.240]   Again laying the groundwork for the future, but i'm just saying whatever
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.400]   What evs
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.520]   Yeah
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:53.960]   Uh, and so apple i think is probably watching this very closely i would guess and saying all right well
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:58.280]   Let's not let's let's see what the reaction is to what mark announced
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:04.680]   I I think the challenge is like I just would have liked to see some vision from them of like here's our vision of what ar's
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:10.520]   Gonna do right if apple does it that's what we're gonna see they're gonna hold the big shiny thing up and say like
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:16.440]   This is the amazing world changing thing that our thing is gonna do right and some of it will be based on
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:22.920]   Fiction some of it will be based on smokin mirrors, but they'll they'll literally show us something right?
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.160]   I think facebook was like ar's gonna change the world and here's stickers
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:32.760]   You know, I just it was part of it is the limit the limitation of the hardware right now
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:37.720]   I mean I I suspect if apple doesn't add something this year uh serenity it will be
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:44.920]   Based on the new iPhone and the camera it'll be it'll end up being very much like what snapchat and facebook
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.080]   Are doing jason you're out there
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:52.040]   You get a lot of credit to a company who hasn't done any magic or innovation in the last four years
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.720]   You're getting a lot of credit to them saying we have a thinner lights a cat face, but
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.720]   But on
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:01.720]   We have faith we apple believers have faith we know
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:07.560]   Steve jobs is gonna get up out of that grave and he's gonna transform the world one more
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.040]   He's gonna get up and say one more thing
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:15.320]   In the seaport no headphone jack ifo seven is just an iPhone six plus
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:20.040]   Yeah, faith in i i Mac pro consumer box that isn't a pro unit anymore
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:25.320]   What kind of faith do you have these people all better come out with some of this iPhone 10 because apple's just
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.360]   Right now
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:32.200]   But I have faith in I have faith that they will tell a better story about it
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.480]   I'm saying that that
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:39.800]   Facebook did not tell a better better a very good story about what this thing is yet cat face does not is not a good story to me
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:44.200]   And all of the stickers the stuff was not a good story
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:48.360]   It was just like we're a rip off of snapchat and by the way, you know
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.320]   They kind of already rolled this out on instagram
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:55.000]   You know months ago and instagrams have been doing great fight in snapchat
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.040]   So it felt like okay, you know, we know that none of you
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:03.000]   You know over 30 people are into either of those apps so gress. What we're gonna deliver it to you too
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.360]   On facebook on our big app so but that did not feel like a real great ar vision now
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:13.480]   Their chief scientist too to to on day two where they do their sort of big vision thing
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:19.320]   Their their chief scientists came out and and poured a lot of cold water on this and said look
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:25.960]   For there to be affordable glasses that aren't putting a computer on your face where they just look like glasses
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:31.320]   Where they you know have storage their high res they you know have great imagery
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:38.360]   He's like it's at least five years. We're not going to see really good hardware ar glasses for at least five years
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.520]   Well, that's what microsoft says they say they say 20
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.480]   Not next year, but the year after 2019
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:49.800]   When we had yesterday on the new screensavers we had a meta vision on they have a developer edition
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.800]   That's a third the cost of hollow lens
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.800]   Uh, and they even though that's pretty mature and I like it. It's full
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.880]   It's 90 degree view instead of 45 degree view. You're not looking through a mail slot
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.240]   They say it's a couple of three maybe more years off
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:08.360]   So this this but but this is I have to I also let me be positive
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:14.520]   Because we're we're we've been in a let's face a little bit of a doldrum for the last few years
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.440]   Technology
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:23.640]   You know the the smartphone is is as good as it's really let's be honest gonna get it's fins from now on and chrome bumpers
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:28.360]   It's some you know it's something to get people buying it, but it's not gonna be a big because it's good
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.440]   It's peak. It's it's good. It's done
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.520]   PCs
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.720]   Ditto
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.560]   um
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:40.680]   Technology we're at a plateau and so I think as a technology buff
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:43.640]   And maybe even as a journalist maybe more as a buff
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:47.160]   I am excited about what machine what how machine learning and an
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:52.920]   Augmented reality are gonna. I think in the next five years change things. They are gonna get us out of this
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.360]   doldrums
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.360]   Absolutely and you can already see
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   Agree you can already see that happening
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.640]   Um with the VR sets that have been coming out over the last couple years
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:09.800]   You know the HTC five the PlayStation VR the Oculus Rift none of those are at the point where you're gonna get joe shmo
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:17.080]   Walking in and buying them off the street and being like oh wow. I love I love my VR headset. They're still wired. They're heavy
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:23.400]   Uh, but they have the promise and the potential right where it's I think everybody on this call has probably tried one
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:29.720]   Um or two and like there are just some there's a there's a game called super hot on the HTC vive
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.040]   That completely
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:36.600]   Mind bends the idea of like what a what a first-person shooter can look like
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.560]   Uh it plays with time and movement and it's like that
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:46.600]   Those are the kind of games and the kind of simulations that get me excited about like oh people are actually kind of peering into the window
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:51.400]   I'm ready to attend. I want to play that super hot. Okay, super hot. Oh, it's so much fun
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:55.000]   super hot. Yeah super as I sound negative
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.280]   I I did end as saying as I like the fact that this is going to push technology forward
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:03.560]   And we're going to get things out of this and the same thing with
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:08.680]   The PlayStation or VR. Yeah, it's cool to be in that realm, but at the same time
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:15.880]   When you're in it for a long period of time, it's just different than just playing a video game and just playing it the regular way you're playing it
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:20.120]   I mean you're already in an immersive world as it were it's just not around your face
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:23.240]   And you're not disconnected. I mean we're we're sitting in a chair
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.080]   You can't really move around and yes
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:29.640]   There's some places where you can run through a foam obstacle thing and that's cool
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:33.720]   But again just progressing the technology for but as far as like looking at it
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.000]   Like when Facebook's like had the little stations where people look like cartoons
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.920]   I'm like oh, so we're gonna do second life on my facebook now and I'm supposed to be excited
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:47.000]   Like really? Yeah, really a car next second like I mean that's that was 10-12 years ago
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:53.080]   Like what am I excited for looking at that like oh second life? I gave up on that
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:57.320]   This feels really nerdy. This is the facebook spaces. They've released it as a beta
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.600]   We're gonna bring in in order to do this
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:04.600]   Second life was like it was thought to in order to do this everybody
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:09.720]   I thought second life was the first thing I thought of as like so we're doing second life in
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:17.480]   You need a $1,500 computer a $700 Oculus Rift plus touch another hundred bucks
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:22.680]   A great internet connection. You need a 300 computer and an old boot up a second life
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.760]   That's all you need and you can sell
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:29.000]   It looks really nerdy and then they've got mark in there with you go barra and there
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.120]   Oh
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.720]   And I thought I
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.960]   Part of my problem with it is you're gonna feel really like you like
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:42.040]   Constrained you go let me paint and it's not gonna be I mean real life is so
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:47.480]   Fluid and you're gonna feel like you're in this weird partial life
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.720]   The thing that really annoys me about facebook's
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:57.480]   Announcements is that there are things that you could very clearly showcase as
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:01.160]   Here's where we think it's going to go and also here's a platform
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:06.680]   Like one of the things that I really think will change with AR and VR in the next five 10 years is learning
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.760]   and education especially
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:16.440]   In places where like I mean obviously no kid in Africa is going to be able to get a $1,700 computer and a Oculus VR
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:21.880]   But as those things go down in price, I could definitely see you know your community library
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:26.440]   Right having a headset and you can go on it for like a couple hours and like learn
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.800]   these
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:35.560]   Specific very hyper specific skills right the the concept of going to college or or even med school right
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.360]   learning classes about
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:43.720]   Neurology and actually being able to go virtually inside the brain and like pull it apart
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:49.880]   And converse with other people around that and being able to like physically move these models like these are all
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:54.920]   Amazing aspects and it's one of the reasons why microsoft's hollow lens pitch
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:59.640]   It felt a lot more solid as it's like yeah, okay, you can play minecraft in AR
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:05.400]   But also let's talk about how it's actually going to change people's lives and and like you said Jason
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.000]   Like that's what I think
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Where where apple is really strong is not only do they tell a better story
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.920]   But I do think that they're genuinely committed, you know, maybe not with the iphone
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.800]   Um because it's the you know, it's the consumer product
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:21.560]   But you look at the you look at the ipad pro and the stories they're starting to tell there
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:26.840]   But specifically like the apple watch all of the investment that they've put into the health and research team
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:31.720]   Like they're not just doing that that's not the kind of stuff that that makes like everyday money
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:36.520]   That's the kind of stuff that genuinely can can hugely affect somebody's life
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.760]   And maybe make a little bit money while you're at it
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:42.040]   But but studies like studies are studies how we move
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:47.800]   You know the the human race forward. They're not how you you know come out with bundles of cash
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:53.960]   Cackling and if you're talking about a product today in the earliest stages, it might just be you know facebook filters and weird
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:28:00.680]   Virtual reality by the way on the chatroom says clearly you haven't been in second life recently
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.280]   So I thought I'd show you this trailer. This is second life
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:11.480]   2017, okay, it's not your grandpa's second life. Let me let me tell you you know what happens
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.800]   I saw this commercial
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.800]   Song just played in my mind baby come back
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:27.000]   It's a little player
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.440]   I got a dog we can have dogs. Oh it's over be
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:35.640]   We saved I'm making a psychedelic dog part. Here's the music second life put behind this trailer
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:41.880]   It's a three-minute trailer. Yeah. Wow
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:45.240]   Yo, yo, yo, yo
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.200]   Second life
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:51.880]   Surrender now we got to get a boost of the computer. I think I need a one in a row
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:57.880]   There were countries are putting their embassies in second life run this on a raspberry pie. You probably could
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:04.840]   You probably could. Yeah, countries are putting stop and solve second life businesses putting their brands in second life
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:10.280]   I used to make money on an android phone. Let's be honest. Yeah
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:15.560]   I used to make money on second life be there was there was massed up going on a second life ice me straight cat
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.560]   Did you to were you one of those people?
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:24.520]   Did we do a second life like realtor? I was up in there making clothes then I started flipping in a real estate
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:29.720]   Uh, you were doing that my buddy got catfish throw second life. What?
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:36.200]   I guess it was crazy second life was crazy man. I was out there making that guap. Yeah, I mean gotta do it
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:40.120]   I didn't know that you were a big second lifer
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:45.800]   Incogniger. I was a big time second life. I just found out you can make money on there and I was like, oh, let me go find out
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:52.440]   Let's uh, let's play your song here while we watch the a second life trailer. Let me just find it here
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:57.960]   I think this is gonna work much better than the music uh that they that they offered
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:04.360]   Turn off the second life music
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:09.320]   There you go. Oh, yeah. This is so much better. This is so much better. It's more much better
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:15.400]   I feel like I feel like the mermaids are moving to the music. Yeah. Yeah, I mean
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:20.680]   It's almost as if they probably made this with that music and then they realized they couldn't release it that way
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.960]   There's so much better
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:36.760]   Imagine if you aren't watching the video of twit today, you better check out this
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.960]   I might do a remix
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:44.760]   We gotta do it. You got you got to arm me over there. How somebody makes this up. Well, so 80s, baby
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.080]   Here we go everybody
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:55.720]   We miss you
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:59.480]   Oh my god, it fits perfectly
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:03.160]   Wow
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.880]   Wow, they've been dancing to it
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.880]   This is like
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:13.240]   This just shows like how genius human beings can be, you know, oh, the genius would be oh, doctor
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:19.160]   The genius is oh, doctor. You picked the right song for that, man. We gotta get you anything videos
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.640]   That's all
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.160]   Bravo
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.160]   That was amazing
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.760]   It kind of works just right
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.920]   Wow, I might do the remix
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.640]   We're gonna take a break. We come back microstops having a hardware event
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:37.480]   Which is all it's actually interesting because this is I think the continuation of what they did
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:42.440]   With their uh windows anniversary event last year where they really started talking about 3d
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:43.640]   Windows holographic
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:49.720]   This is what this is all leading to they want kids in schools to start learning these skills because I think microsoft sees
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:58.280]   Augmented reality is the future of windows apple seizes a future of iOS facebook seizes the future of their camera
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.360]   It's all uh changing
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.240]   I want to be positive I want to be a little bullish and say this this
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:11.480]   In five years or 10 years we're gonna be looking back and saying maybe wow, this is this really did happen or maybe we'll
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:16.760]   Yeah, I I think we will the I mean, I think you're right like my colleague larry dignan. He always says
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:22.200]   When when you look at it the cynics always sound more logical and it's it's true
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:27.960]   Like we and and we do a lot of all of us here do it and it's part of our job to look at things with a critical eye
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.440]   and uh and that but
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:38.360]   That said I've seen some pretty good examples of of augmented reality that give me a taste of you know where it could be
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:45.720]   um companies like epsin and odg that have done some really interesting things already in sort of the
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:48.440]   commercial space and industrial space
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:54.840]   Uh, you know, I've seen a taste of what it could do. They're too big and clunky and heavy and slow
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.560]   Um and all of that right now
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.760]   Um, but you can see it you can see it's coming
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:05.560]   By the way, thanks to mashable. They actually and this is somebody that jeffman pointed me to this
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:09.480]   Have the hot new technology for gamers today. It's not augmented. It's not virtual
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:15.240]   It's the wipe designed for gamers who like to eat while they play they can wipe their cheeto fingers off
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.800]   on a little mop that sits next
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.040]   to their
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.720]   Compassion hash tag. This is this is the future

[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:47.560]   And I'm and I'm reading somebody said you got to read if you're going to the galapagos kirt vanagot's
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:51.160]   novel about kind of a sci-fi novel
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.680]   Uh written from a million years in the future
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:36:00.200]   Called galapagos. So this is this is one of the things you can do. That's just awesome
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:04.280]   Uh audible by the way is re recording all of kirt vanagot
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:09.800]   I love kirt vanagot and the audible studios they've brought in some of the best readers to take all of his books
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.600]   And rerecord them
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:17.400]   So if you're a fan of vanna if you if you haven't read any vanna get got to
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:20.440]   You got to some of the best stuff
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.160]   Ever
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:27.640]   What do you read and jason? What's your I know you had a lot of flying and travel lately. What were you reading?
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:30.040]   Yeah, my my audible recommendation
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:37.240]   Is this book called california a history? Oh, um, which I come to california all the time, right?
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:44.600]   And no actually realized, uh, I know very little about it and I was just looking for something
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:48.520]   um this last time when I was traveling last week and
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.760]   It was one of those where I listened to that sample and I was like, okay, this could be really boring
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:56.280]   You know, especially you look at the cover and the title is pretty big
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.000]   and I
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.760]   Okay, but it's not listen. It's not I listen I hit play and listen to the uh sample
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:09.640]   Which I always do very important. It got to the end of the sample and I was like, oh, I want more
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:13.160]   Yeah, so I was like, okay. Yeah, that's one to buy every book on audible
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:17.880]   You can listen ahead of time. You can also read reviews, which I find very useful
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:22.120]   To find out whether this is going to be a great book whether you like the reader
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:25.800]   They have such a great selection. It's kind of basically the bookstore
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:29.960]   Look at this. Lewis black has a new uh comedy series on audible
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:35.160]   That's interesting. I didn't know they did that kind of thing the rant is due. I like that
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:42.680]   Uh, you're good. It's an unlimited supply of great audio entertainment the new niel game and north
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.520]   mythology read by
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:47.640]   Niel himself and he really is good. He is a great

[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:43.480]   I read it too. So that may be a plus or a minus but just you know, it is there
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:45.000]   Yeah, lindsio
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.880]   Leo's chapter number nine leo is also the sample chapter. So if you listen to sample chapter
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:55.880]   Really? You can hear it is that's that's a fact. Let's hear the can you hear my eyes fingers dug deep into leo
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:59.640]   loport's arm as she yanked him to a halt in a parking lot in Las vegas
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:03.000]   Oh, I'll never forget that moment, but you're gonna have to listen to find out what happened
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.400]   Sounds like you just got kidnapped at a parking lot
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:14.200]   Could be I mean could be how about William Shatner talking about Leonard Nimoy
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:19.160]   Many wonderfully talented people have never got the right opportunity. I love often
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:23.560]   It's simply a matter of being in the right place at the right time having some
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.520]   Often
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.280]   Same way
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:34.920]   Wow, yeah, wouldn't it be a nut show. Yeah, don't you want to have Shatner in your car as you commute? I love it audible
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:38.120]   Dot com slash twit and the number
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.440]   two
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:44.360]   We've been an audible podcast for since the beginning I think
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:49.960]   Other things Facebook announced apple music and spotify coming to facebook messenger
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:52.920]   Rennady is Rennady you got to explain this one to me
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:40:01.000]   Okay, so from what I understand it's very it's just very similar to what um apple currently has put into messages
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:06.520]   Uh, which is if you put a link in it'll expand it so you can actually play it from
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:14.840]   Facebook so you're not gonna have a conversation saying hey facebook. What's a great song for a good mood time?
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:22.920]   No, I think I think uh apple might have the the monopoly on that with siri like they might get pretty pretty angry about that
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:26.680]   Uh, no, I I think that it's just going to be basically widgets
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:32.200]   So it's like the like the spotify widget or the apple music widget if you're planning a stateless
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:38.360]   I'm like leo, you know what you've got to hear this amazing song by the who here's this song
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:41.080]   You know, it's called the seeker. Have you heard of it?
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:46.600]   And then it allows you to or have you actually heard it you can just play it from right in there
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:52.840]   So I get it so so and I should have been I should have read this more carefully or watch the conversation more carefully
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:58.280]   This isn't a bot. I thought it was gonna be like an apple music bot or a spotify bot where you talk to it
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:05.080]   It's what they call chat extensions. And I think you I think you nailed it. It's just like in the apple in uh apple's messages
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.160]   Okay, he gives you the bot stuff
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:12.280]   They are doing some cool stuff with the bots though to give them credit and I talked to a couple developers
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.280]   I have a video on this on tech republic
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:18.360]   Uh with a couple developers who help people develop
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.080]   Shopping bots and they said these two developers talked about the fact that
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:26.760]   Um, they they worked for all the big platforms for bots
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:31.800]   And they said facebook is really ahead of the other ones that they work with in terms of the technology
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:38.360]   They've enabled the apis and all of that and they developed this bot for example that went
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:42.120]   Um that launched the day that uh, they announced this
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:45.560]   With with a reattailer a rue 21
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:50.200]   And this is a shopping bot where you like have a picture and you say look
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:54.440]   I want to get a dress like this for example the the demo that these guys showed me was a
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.440]   Probably excited
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:01.480]   Oh, sorry. I explained your video. Go ahead. That's okay. And so um so yeah, but I
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:05.400]   We can we can show that the demo if you want but it does
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:11.080]   It is one of those things where you can essentially text your friends and say look
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:14.200]   I'm thinking about this dress or this dress or this dress
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   Vote and so
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.720]   Then your friends can vote on which one send it back to you
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:24.520]   Right and then the bot can say it can go out and find you know
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:31.160]   The places that you can buy that and then can also suggest accessories that you know might go with it and that kind of thing
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:37.560]   So it's it's a fashion um advisor or uh, you know that kind of thing that makes sense
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.480]   You know
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:43.960]   Because then it's social and it's not the bot is a part of a larger conversation
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:48.600]   Yeah, the bot's like filling in the gaps for you the bots not you're not talking to the bot
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:55.720]   The bots like doing the the hard stuff to where you're not like having to jump into urls and paste them and all of that kind of stuff
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:57.960]   That makes a lot more sense because I have a looking
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:03.000]   It's a bot to help you buy something is so much less efficient
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.640]   Than just going to website and clicking a link
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.960]   That I don't understand the value of it
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:13.480]   I thought maybe they're trying to get millennials because millennials are more comfortable with using chat apps
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.560]   You know they live in snapchat or
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:21.160]   Facebook host messenger and so that was a better interface for them, but it's not that it's it's still social
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:25.480]   It's just chatting with other people but the bot is could at least at this bot
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:30.760]   And now I would guess any well-designed bot is contributing to the uh a conversation between humans
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:35.080]   Okay, so what are you lining the bits? Yeah, sorry. Go ahead
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:38.680]   So so what does apple do in here because I know spotify has a free
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:41.400]   Service so when somebody sends me a song
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:46.120]   I can listen to the song on spotify apple doesn't have that
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:49.240]   So what are they going to get like a snippet 30 seconds of the song?
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:55.240]   I wonder if they'll do the 90 seconds that they do with the item store, you know, you know most
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:57.800]   Songs 90 seconds is more than enough
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:02.920]   Yeah, you're gonna know in 90 seconds. Yeah, you know, it's not I mean
[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:06.040]   Sometimes it's just about you just want to hear the song right?
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.440]   I understand but again, I just
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:11.800]   They don't have a like when somebody sends me someone spotify. I know that if I click it
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.120]   90 percent of the time I can just listen to the song
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:17.640]   So I'm like, oh, listen song you might like it now. I got to listen to song
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:21.320]   To satisfy like it and then figure out how I'm paying for it. Yeah, or doing something good
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:25.960]   So that's the thing that apple still annoys me with a useful thing to do would be is say
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:31.160]   Oh, I see you're not a apple music subscriber, but you do have spotify. Here's the song on spotify now
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:35.400]   That would be cool or they say we see you probably a spotify
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.840]   Let us give you this whole song of those two for free and then you come pay us money
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:45.320]   I mean if I was smart, they'd say they'd say look you get five songs for free a month or something
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:50.680]   The way like, you know, some of these paywalls and stuff do and then after that, you know, you have to you have to pay
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:53.400]   But they'll let you yeah, you get a listening, you know, right?
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:57.080]   Yeah, you can get like five songs that'll just play and you don't have to worry about it
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:01.800]   Or if your friends are really smart, they'll just send you to youtube version of song
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.000]   Thanks so much to video about us until let me ask you
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.200]   Let me ask you to say my mic. It may be
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:07.000]   I'm going my mic
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   pssssss
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.760]   Let me ask you though because I bet
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:15.080]   Laya may not be holding up but my daughter when she was roughly, you know, junior high school
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:19.720]   She would listen the radio. She couldn't listen for more than a 30 seconds to any song
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:23.240]   She would change it every 30 seconds and I noticed her friends did the same thing
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:25.480]   They don't they didn't listen to the whole song
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:28.760]   That there's there's something in your water news because of 80d
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:32.360]   When I'm I play music in my car and I've got the whole song
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:35.720]   I've got five kids in my car and literally like
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.280]   What won my radius when he laughs at the kids love it?
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:42.440]   We play all the songs and the only thing that they do is they do request songs
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:45.960]   They love me talking to siri to bring the song they think i'm like the magic man
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:50.680]   They're like they get in my car and they're like, I bet your dad has this song play the song
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.560]   And i'm like siri played a song and they're like your dad's amazing
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:46:00.520]   I got the magic in me is there anything you can't do what are they listening to these days?
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:02.600]   What's the hot
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:08.200]   They're listening to a song called rolex and I love embarrassing my daughter because they have like those musically dances
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:13.720]   And uh, the song says I just want to rolly rolly rolly with a dab of ranch
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:16.440]   Already got some designer about my pace
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:23.880]   And then they all drink out in the season. Oh, see it's not roll water
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.880]   Went
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:44.840]   Do it
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:48.440]   Over again. Don't listen to them musically 90 000 times in a row and drive you up
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:50.760]   That's the 80d thing they do do
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:55.160]   Listen to musically clips of some of their 15 seconds a thousand times
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:59.720]   Yeah, I see that too. Yeah, so they listen to their songs
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:03.880]   That was ao and tao and roly roly roly
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:07.160]   Rolex Rolex the dabber ranch
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:13.720]   When they say dab are they talking the dance dab they're dabbing. Yes. That's why I just embarrassed my children
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:16.920]   Rent those out of dab
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:19.560]   Yes, I do it
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:27.640]   Okay, what else let's wrap up f8 oh, you know, and this is on a more serious note. Uh, of course
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:35.240]   About the worst thing that could happen to a brand had just happened to facebook it happened actually as we were doing twit last week the
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:39.000]   Facebook killer just how facebook would love you to brand this
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.480]   Uh, very sad story
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:47.400]   Wasn't live video on on facebook, but a guy posted a murder he committed
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:49.960]   uh, and then
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:56.520]   Posted a live video talking about it. Of course he was apprehended it occurred in what occurred in cleveland and he was apprehended
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:58.520]   uh
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:04.600]   Later, but the timeline facebook's released the timeline of this and they've gotten some heat about
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:07.640]   I don't see how facebook's prevents this right
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:14.200]   But they've gotten some heat about the timing so the video was uploaded at 11.09 a.m
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:17.640]   And not reported
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:22.920]   Maybe he didn't have a lot of followers a couple of minutes later. He did another video first video was saying i'm going to kill
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:25.480]   So my second video was him killing somebody horrible
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:31.400]   Then on 11 minutes after that he did a facebook live stream for five minutes saying I did it
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:37.240]   Still not reported the first report according to facebook was 11 27
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:40.280]   so uh 20 minutes later
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:43.080]   and uh, i'm sorry
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:49.800]   The live videos reported shortly after the video of the shooting wasn't reported till almost one in the afternoon
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:52.760]   So almost two hours later
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:58.360]   And then then 23 minutes later facebook disables the account and pulls down the videos
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:03.160]   I have to say given the scale of what facebook's up to
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:06.520]   That doesn't seem unreasonable. It does it to you
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:13.240]   I instantly was angry and then I was like stop it because no matter what your knee jerk reaction is
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:16.680]   You should do better than that. But then again, I think to myself
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:19.800]   Again, the same thing is how many people were following him
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:23.000]   And how many people even thought that this wasn't real
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.640]   Right, that's the other issue because I have people you know somebody sent me a video a tally-bond thing and i'm like
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:29.880]   That's not real. That's fake stop sending that around to people
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:32.200]   So you don't really know what's going on per se
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:38.760]   And so I fully am understanding and in the process in the time period that that went on and also
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:42.200]   Everybody's vulnerable to this google is yes twitter is
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:46.360]   It's the it's a big place the internet it doesn't because they
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:49.800]   Somebody can do this doesn't mean facebook is endorsing it
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:57.480]   And to be honest the small group of friends or family whoever he had might not are even a realized report because most people don't ever report a
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:01.720]   Video ever right sometimes when you ask somebody to report a video that how do you do that?
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:06.920]   Where do I got to go to report it? So it's a whole thing to do so i'm i'm understanding
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:12.360]   Of that to our process and and lord knows how many videos get uploaded to facebook at a time
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:15.880]   This has got copyright music in the back. They're not going to look at it for forever
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:22.040]   So the only critique you could make is that at 1109 he said i'm going to kill somebody in two minutes later
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:26.440]   He did if but did he write that in a caption or something something?
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:29.320]   Yeah
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:33.480]   I'm going to kill someone like what you know what i mean facebook
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:37.960]   Facebook did say that they got additional reports since this
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:42.920]   Press release but none of the reports came in before the events so
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:45.720]   Yeah, I mean and I don't know how they would prevent it
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.840]   I don't feel like facebook's done
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:52.200]   Worse than they could do although they say we've got it we've taken this seriously
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:55.720]   We're going to do it and mark himself got it got on stage. So we're going to do a lot more here
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:58.040]   It seemed appropriate
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:00.200]   Jason what what mark said and did
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:05.880]   Some people complained that he joked that he did some dad jokes about fast and furious first
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:12.120]   Yeah, I think he did that to kind of lighten things up and and you know
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:14.440]   It was a serious thing
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:18.280]   Jokes to start with yeah, and then he did acknowledge it
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:24.840]   I think I didn't expect him to acknowledge it to be honest. I think most people were surprised when he did acknowledge it
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:30.680]   Um, so so I you know for that since I I took my hat to them. I mean he said the right things
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:35.480]   Um, well, you know if you're a brand said they take it serious. Yeah, you got to do this
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:37.880]   I think you can't ignore it. I think he did the right thing
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:41.480]   Um, yeah, I agree and everybody's vulnerable to this
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:44.440]   I mean this is what happens when you do live video and
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:48.760]   You know facebook's learning as we all are that you know you can celebrate
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:56.440]   What the internet brings to democracy gives everybody a voice, but that they're bad people and uh, it also gives them a voice
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:59.400]   And it's kind of you can't have one without the other
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:01.800]   Um, I don't I don't want to I'm talking
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:07.000]   Yeah, there's no way to really fix that we've seen assassinations live on tv and things like that that happened
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   You know, it's kind of horrible, but
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.280]   There the things happen. So they're doing the best they can. I'll accept that from facebook on this one. Yeah
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:17.640]   There's no gross negligence here
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:18.760]   Right
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:21.000]   Yes, which is what we don't want right?
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:27.720]   We don't want to see any kind of gross negligence where they just don't care or they treat their customers badly repeatedly and and you know
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:32.760]   Are callous to it. Um, oh, I'm sorry. We we're not talking about uber. Sorry
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:35.960]   So
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:38.120]   Uh, yeah, we could talk about uber
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:44.440]   It seems like every week there's a new, you know revelation on uber man. Oh man
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:46.760]   It just uh, it never stops in fact
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:50.280]   This morning on uh or this afternoon on tech meme
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:53.240]   Mike isek for the new york times
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:56.360]   Uh talks about uh uber's
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:00.920]   CEO plays with fire. This is something that's been in the works for a while, but
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:04.920]   A description of his early years and how at one point tim cook
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:07.800]   Um
[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:11.320]   Said I heard you've been breaking some of our rules
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:17.240]   Stop the trickery he demanded or uber's app would be kicked out of apple's app store
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:23.000]   So apparently what had been happening was a calonek had been telling uh uber employees
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:26.840]   To hide the ride hailing app from apple's engineers
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:31.880]   So that apple would not find out that uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iphones
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:35.080]   Even after it's app had been deleted and the devices erased
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:41.640]   Yeah, this is in really 2015 what can we can we just say that uber is like the worst
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:46.520]   Like it really is the worst like every week. There's another story. I don't really is
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:52.840]   It's literally the service of the devil. It promises you goodness that you kind of need but at the same time
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:57.160]   You're selling your soul and you're gonna end up in hell for using the service in the first place
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:59.320]   I hate uber. I hate everything about uber
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:04.680]   I and I got so many friends that have invested uber and you watch them tweeting and they trying to say uber's life
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:08.600]   But uber delete is a thing and it's real and every step they take
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:13.080]   I feel like they don't have a colored person on their board. They don't have a woman on their board
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:16.760]   All they got is red dudes and suits with horns on their head
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:22.280]   Making all these stupid decisions and it's retarded. I mean for Pete's sake just look
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:27.000]   Just hire me for a week to follow you around the office uber. I make sure everything's okay
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:33.400]   Haven't haven't they done that? I mean they've no they haven't they hired other monkeys and they got you doing dumb stuff too
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:35.960]   And don't know nobody can check them. They're all yes men
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:41.160]   They get in there and they look at these dudes hired eric holder the former attendant attorney general
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:43.640]   To investigate right? I mean
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:50.360]   Investing is a holder is a good. Yeah, investigate is not the same as change right where they can make all the assurances
[00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:53.480]   They're like, oh, yeah, we're gonna get to the bottom of this and it's great
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:58.280]   They can get to the bottom of this they can figure out exactly where it went wrong and what HR people, you know
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:02.440]   We're reporting harassment and and various other things
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:08.600]   But at the end of the day what happens from there eric holder can come to uber and basically be like
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:12.680]   Have your company's toxic you need to fire these people and you need to restructure these things
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:18.920]   And then they go great eric holder. Thank you and they pay him lots of money and then they don't do anything with this information
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:23.400]   Exactly, I'm not saying that's actually what happens, but it sounds it sounds legit to me
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:27.880]   I'll cosign on that. I just put that on me. Ain't nobody called me. I say what you say is real
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:33.400]   I mean in and talk about the slave labor other people working for uber that are trapped in this toxic society
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:37.960]   I'm working for this monkey check week the week and their cars falling apart because they're doing all these jobs
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:41.400]   They keep freaking down to pay and telling them and then they won't let them take tips
[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:45.320]   And then you got to go and deal with lift and lord knows lift is not great at all
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:48.680]   But at least to have decent human beings so you say to yourself
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:54.280]   I'm gonna talk with the mustache even though you know it's not that great, but you try anyway. I hate uber
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:57.320]   I think I got that
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:07.560]   They're so yeah, they're so rotten to the core, you know, it's like
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:10.760]   They they are completely amoral and
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:15.080]   This is
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:20.680]   Everybody wants and uses and I know I know there was a big delete uber movement, but I don't
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:26.520]   Oh, sorry about that Travis Kalanek online one for you mr. Heiner. I don't think that
[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:33.880]   I don't know if they're gonna suffer long-term damage from this maybe
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:38.840]   Deal they they sound a whole bunch of I'm sorry come baby come back email
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:42.360]   So I mean they feel it they try every time it happens
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:48.360]   But the problem is it keeps happening at some point the lion will get slayed as soon as we get yeah a better substitute
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:53.320]   But at this point they can't make a right decision and that's not good for business in general
[00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:59.000]   You could be the evil underlord all you want to but the light is going to come through at some point for uber
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:04.360]   Right now there's too much money tied up into it. They've got too much backing from powerhouse people that sit there
[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:07.800]   Good people sit there and they're like well. I got stock about I've invested money
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:10.120]   So I got to say this uber sucks
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:14.040]   Have you I take it you delete a uber
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:22.840]   I I deleted uber you know so so this reminds me of what happened after the united kerfuffle of last week and maybe what happened after sam
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.840]   Sung's note seven to back. Oh
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:32.440]   That so there's three companies sam sung united and uber that have all had you know active?
[00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:37.960]   Protest and boycotts but somebody pointed out to me, you know the minute you need to take united airlines or the minute
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:43.560]   You're stranded downtown in New York City and you have to take an uber or the minute the samson galaxy
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:47.960]   S8 comes out all will be forgotten and forgiven the people are going to always
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:53.560]   You go for convenience. They're not going to hold this against you how's uber working on austin
[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:57.240]   Well, i'll tell you the people were down there. I don't know if you went down
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:02.040]   Jason but the people were down there were kind of mad that there was no uber and left in they were made
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:08.760]   But just what they still didn't have it. Yeah, and they had to use the local ride sharing services, which didn't work perfectly and
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:15.160]   Like I said, it's yeah, it's with the devil. You want to do it. You got to do it, but you don't feel good about it
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:21.720]   Somebody in the chat room says I drive leney says I drive for uber every day extra thousand bucks a month game changer
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:25.160]   I guess i mean i mean i talk to drivers
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:30.680]   Whenever i whenever i take an uber or lift and i honestly i haven't not deleted the app
[00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:36.120]   Because there are times when I do have to use it because it's either the only option or by far the best option
[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:38.440]   I tend to use lift more
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:42.280]   Um, but i always talk to the drivers and i ask them like how long have you been driving?
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:46.920]   You know how much money you make is it you know, do you do this full time you do it part time?
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:55.080]   Um, and just kind of ask them about it because i'm sort of i've all been fascinated by the whole thing because it's it is interesting the whole
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:59:00.360]   um the way it is changed the the economics of this both for
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:06.600]   For people who are getting rides and you know given this new opportunity for some other people
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:14.520]   Um who you know find that this is one of the options that they have now that they didn't have before and ultimately that can be a good thing
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:16.920]   A lot of them talk very positively
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:20.040]   About it
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:22.040]   uh with obviously
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:27.800]   Clear exceptions. They don't they don't want to bad mouth that they don't want to get back to the company
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:31.400]   So they're not they're kind of incented not to air their dirty laundry
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:35.240]   But some of them some of them are just more candid people than others and so i wonder
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:40.120]   We live in an era now everybody's wired everybody's got you know watching twitter
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:42.840]   Outrage is coming big waves
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:49.960]   And we're more much more aware of them than we were before because of social media, but i wonder as a result if we're also
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:51.720]   uh
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:55.960]   Less impacted by them in the long run if the sam sung in united and uber in a year
[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.160]   Decentatized yeah, we're desensitized right well there's there's also different levels to it
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:06.600]   Okay, so sam sung makes a bad phone has anybody ever made a mistake and has something bad happen to them
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:09.800]   Yes, you you accept that this is a large multi company
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.920]   They made a mistake now as far as united's concerned has anybody
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:19.160]   Ribashity body over the head and dragged them down the aisle after a seat they paid for no that's there's different levels to how you feel
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:24.120]   And associate with a product okay, so when you say they have mistakes at all if you were jit no
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:29.560]   There are certain levels of distinctions again uber is evil and the general consensus everybody knows that of course
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:32.200]   You ask my my he's not going to tell you what my mom
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:36.840]   I was she's 84 and she lives in a you know in Rhode Island and she
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:41.320]   Needs to get the doctor and sometimes she just want to call my sister lives nearby to do it
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.720]   So I said mom i'm gonna put uber on your phone
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:49.080]   This was a while ago put over in your phone and and then i've asked her like i said have you used uber?
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:51.080]   She says no they rob you
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:58.920]   And I don't know where she got that from i said mom no no it's it was on the news one day where uber driver either got robbed or robbed
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:03.240]   Someone it was one rob and uber in the same sentence uber rosh people so
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:07.960]   So she will do it and i'm he's hard for me and so there is this impact
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:11.160]   At some point we're all the negative breasts that people start to be
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.800]   You know skeptical of something
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:19.960]   Uh, I think samsung's gonna sell plenty of samsung galaxy s8's it's a great phone. It's a great looking phone. It's a nice feeling
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:24.680]   Are you using it? The only problem is i can't i'm i'm cracked out of apple until
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:28.760]   Your crap old guy only thing is the the finger fingerprint reader on the back
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:33.800]   They should just do a google dip with the camera up in the corner. Oh, it's terrible. It's much and that is the dumbest
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:37.240]   It's the worst possible place i get it wrong every time
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:42.120]   That's the worst thing about the phone, but everything else. Yeah, well and then they're the bixby assistant
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:44.920]   See this button you push this button and you get bixby
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:46.760]   Except you don't
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:48.760]   Could you stop talking about that?
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:53.720]   I'm pressing the bixby button and nothing's happening in a minute or two bixby will wake up and go
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:56.440]   You wanted me?
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:01.640]   What's not fully functional yet either right? No, it doesn't do voice recognition
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:06.440]   But it but it doesn't even do you push the button and i launch
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:13.640]   There finally it how long did that take how long did that? Oh boy a long time. That's not useful
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:19.720]   That's weird sometimes I hit the power button and I see the bixby button come up and i'm like why did that happen?
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:24.200]   Um, it does it is confusing although some of the vixby features do work like it
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:28.440]   It does some of the google nowish kind of stuff right where it's unless you have an amazon data
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:34.200]   If you have an amazon phone, I mean if rizin phone they turned off the shopping assistant on bixby
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:40.360]   I'm looking at the manual and the manual says we're moving on
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:47.880]   Not in touch with the first rule bixby's you don't talk actually i talked to somebody yesterday
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:54.360]   Remember sam song bought the guys who did syri left after apple bought them and didn't do much with syri and
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:58.360]   Uh, the guys started something called viv viv.ai
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:03.880]   And then uh not so long ago a few months ago maybe more than that six months ago sam song bought him
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:08.200]   So i talked to somebody who knows the the guy at viv and he says
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.680]   watch
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.680]   This is not bixby's not viv
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:16.600]   Uh bixby's not it's not viv and it's clearly not baked
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:19.800]   I'm wonder if sam song's working on getting viv
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:25.000]   In there then it would be for sure. Yeah, so i thought yeah
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:30.680]   I had a friend who worked at viv and the the demos that you know that i've seen in the of course
[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:32.280]   I mean they showed it off
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:37.800]   publicly at tech crunch last year i believe before they got bought up by by sam song and viv's
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:39.960]   viv's
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:43.240]   overall idea of basically we are making a
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:48.760]   Assistant that actually learns and can basically write rudimentary programs
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:57.480]   itself as it learns how these pathways connects together sounds a little bit, you know sky net but also um they have a really
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:01.800]   Really interesting overarching plan in terms of integrating with everything
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:04.680]   And I can imagine sam song being like well
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   We see the potential in this
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.560]   And we need the time to actually layer it up because as we can see with bixby
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:19.400]   You know launching a voice assistant from scratch is not the easiest thing. Yeah in the woods. Yeah, no kidding
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:22.840]   So true. I I feel like I reviewed it
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:26.280]   I had it early and I my review went live on tuesday and
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:29.400]   There's a lot I like about this. I was at the launch event too
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:32.280]   I I you know was really impressed for it with it when I saw it there
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:37.640]   I just think the thing my biggest complaint with it was what you guys already touched on the the iran the
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:42.760]   The fingerprint scanner doesn't work the iris scanner also is kind of lame
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:49.720]   Um, those were big disappointments the only other beef the biggest thing that I problem I had with it is um
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:55.320]   Sam song is still trying to duplicate all these services that good right already does well
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:59.400]   And it's just a no-win solution for them. I'd rather see them
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:06.840]   Take bixby and do something like there's bits of it that are interesting some augmented reality stuff that really google has not
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:12.840]   Worked on for a while where you take pictures of products and images and places and and it's going to you know give you
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.960]   Um some some augmented reality kind of information
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:22.520]   On it great go ahead and work on that find other things that sam song can do uniquely well make it work with televisions
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:25.320]   You know their televisions maybe even other televisions. I don't know
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:28.280]   Um, you know like they've done in the past where they've made a
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:31.640]   CIA about that. I think they figured that out. I think you can make that work
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:33.800]   Do
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:39.080]   The big problem what are doing that is to differentiate from the google phone now, which is a very sexy phone
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:42.440]   Yeah, let's just can we get back to talk about the good stuff about this essay?
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:49.240]   This phone is sexy this phone don't went out and this phone don't went out into the apple dress store and said look what i'm wearing
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:52.600]   This is sexy phone. I mean
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:57.560]   It's weird and tough, but it feels good. Yeah, beautiful screen girl. Look at this thing
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:02.360]   I don't know who would want to date this nobody. I tell you what i do in that essay
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:05.720]   I can't put it on to it. This is a family show, but that's a good look
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:09.320]   You could lick it in my review. I put a picture of it
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:12.200]   My american express card popped up
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.920]   That's hilarious. What do you look at?
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:17.720]   That's a big reality. It's a big reality feature right there
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:22.200]   Lick the phone and american express pixby. What are you trying to tell me?
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:25.640]   Lickin that essay you watch if you'd asked what to say you got to pay to play
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:29.000]   Oh, wait a minute. I have discovered a new gesture
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:36.040]   Look at that. There you are dear. It just came up again. It's a new gesture. You did that
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:38.760]   No, I didn't
[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:41.080]   I swear to god
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:44.120]   Is it gonna do it again?
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:46.120]   I
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:52.520]   Wrong on so many levels
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:58.520]   So many levels and you wipe the phone on and i start charging up still is pixby saying
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:06.040]   Would you that be cash or credit? What is pixby saying? Oh my goodness. Anyway, I do think it's a great phone
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:10.840]   It's interesting that samsung stumbled with such basic things as bixby and this fingerprint reader
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.160]   But it is a gorgeous screen what I really think is oh when you're not going to feel bad for too long
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:17.240]   This is a forebearer of things to come
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:20.440]   Apples iphone is going to have a you know giant
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:27.800]   Full dream screen and it's going to be OLED. I think that's pretty clear. They're buying a hundred million screens from samsung
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:31.400]   Um, it's going to be hard to get that that'll be the top of the line
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:37.560]   Uh new apple iphone according to all the rumors mark german had a great row uh roll up of all the rumors in the
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:40.200]   Bloomberg this week
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:46.040]   And so I what I might take on this is I feel bad for google because the pixel is the best android phone
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:49.160]   But it's but ugly next to this. I mean it really is
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:53.160]   And it's like it's two generations back compared to that thing
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:54.760]   It feels like the 50s two generations
[01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:58.520]   It's like the phone fonzi used on happy days compared to this
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:02.360]   I mean it's i put a picture of the three of them next to each other the iphone
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:07.160]   Seven which is gorgeous. I've unsaid is a gurgles. It is
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:10.200]   Excels
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:13.880]   And this one in the middle I put the and I put the galaxy
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:18.040]   You know the the s8 in the middle and it makes the two of them look
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:26.680]   I mean my point was that it makes the two of them look like really kind of outdated and uh, you know clunky next to
[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:30.360]   Well, I think that's what's going to happen 83 of the bezels in the future
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:35.960]   What you're going to see is all phones. This this is the this is what's this is the new generation
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:40.440]   Right. This is what's going to happen is that uh bezels are gone and if you buy a new phone
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:44.840]   You know these they'll all be bezel free in a year bezel come back. It used to be
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:52.280]   It used to be that apple would do this apple would put release a phone and then you knew like okay
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:59.080]   Every phone's going to look like this and so that's where this is significant right where samsung has a finally kind of
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:04.040]   Into the punch where now samsung's releasing the phone and probably every phone after this is going to look at that
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.200]   Even though apple's already been working on it
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:10.360]   Obviously, they're not copying samsung but they've been working on something similar
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:13.320]   But the fact that samson got to the market first with something like this
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:17.640]   I don't know that i'm not copying samson they could have somebody working the samson
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:20.840]   That samson put it out a whole year ahead of them. I don't know that they're not copying
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:25.080]   All I know is apple is far behind and every aspect of life again
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:30.200]   MacBook pro consumer laptop with a touchscreen on the top that nobody touches your seaport
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:33.960]   You know messed up and you don't read the nerd to tell how this saphone seven looks good
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:35.240]   You are delusional man
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:39.880]   You you know you're getting up in age and you need more vacations if you're gonna tell me this is a good looking phone
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:46.040]   I'll take that plus a google over this the picture no no no no you gotta come you gotta come over and see my iphone
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:52.360]   Plus in jet black no case is a very lovely phone beautiful. Yeah i'm a pitch
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:54.680]   Blackness, you know, I like black stuff
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:59.240]   By the way i have a picture of fonzi with his phone and it does look just like the pixel doesn't it
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:05.880]   Actually google gets google gets to answer before apple does google will probably do its pixel two
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:10.440]   before apple does its tenth iphone and
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:16.840]   I suspect google will also this is the new design language. I think google's pixel all the rumors were hearing about the pixel will be
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:22.600]   Also, uh, and the pixel fingerprint reader has already got it dead to rights on on good much better
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:28.920]   Much better this fingerprint reader if that's where you yeah, it works much better works much much better and bet it's not
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:37.880]   Probably not. I mean that that is a that is a bug of of bug. Yeah, we standard but uh, it's not a bug
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:39.880]   I can explain it but go ahead
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:48.840]   Uh, no, I what I was gonna say is that you know that like all of these companies have been working on edge-to-edge designs for at least three four years
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:56.360]   Because it's just yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. No exactly but the the big thing is and I mean that's this is the big compromise in the s8
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:01.640]   Right where the fingerprint sensor and their you know pseudo home button. It is an ideal
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:05.880]   It is an ideal in in the least in you know in any sense
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:10.280]   But unfortunately because fingerprint sensors have you know, they use camera based technology
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:14.920]   And there's only so much room that you can put uh camera sensors in the phone
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:18.920]   They're like, oh, we'll kill two birds one stone and we'll have like a whole little camera unit
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:20.680]   Then also has the fingerprint sensor
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:27.720]   I honestly think that the main reason why apple didn't do it with the with the seven is that they basically were like, well
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:35.080]   If we did this we would have to compromise and put the fingerprint sensor, you know in a in a less than ideal place
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:38.280]   And I mean we've seen the potential schematics like there
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:43.560]   And the google was amazing though the google cameras are really nice camera
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:45.880]   And it's a little camera in the middle
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:48.840]   I mean
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:52.760]   I think what you're saying like these are smart people and apparently i want to google people
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:55.240]   To make the desire
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:12:01.240]   Over go. Yeah, no, i'm looking i'm looking for my pixel because it's oh, it's sitting sitting right here
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:03.320]   Yeah, you know, I
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:06.680]   This is it's not an attractive phone, but it's a great phone
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:08.520]   And they put the camera before this
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:12.600]   Oh, yeah, the dude is what apple had to do they made their tactic physical button
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:18.280]   Then when the phone dies it drives me crazy because I click it like a tart cart over and over again and forgetting that's not a real button
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:22.680]   It's not a real ball. But then you know that it's off then you know, it's not just you know
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:27.800]   Then you know it's legitimately. Oh the battery died and not like why is the screen not turning on what's wrong?
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:33.560]   You call it a tart cart. I called myself a tart cart. I would never disrespect an apple product
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:36.520]   cart
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:39.320]   It's me when I i'm dumb enough to click it by the way
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:42.200]   I don't want to prove I don't want this perception to continue
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:46.520]   So it's a fingerprint reader gesture you can swipe up on the fingerprint reader
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:49.800]   But why is it reading reacting to your tongue your tongue has its own
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:52.760]   Dots and pixelations to it that shouldn't be
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:58.360]   It's secure. I don't think it's supposed to be secure. I think it's just a swipe up to if you swipe down
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:03.080]   You pull down the notifications. It's just that's all it is. Yeah, it's not it's not magic
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:05.800]   Okay
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:10.440]   I'm so relieved. I'm so relieved to hear that. I mean
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:15.400]   Well, people are gonna be sneaking into people's bedrooms. Like I said, let's have a good trick though
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:18.120]   I remember that
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:21.080]   Hey, the next time I'm in a store. I'll go. Oh, let me charge that
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:25.240]   Can lick the feed right?
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:30.920]   You're gonna freak some people out. You're gonna freak some people out
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.800]   I'll try it at mcdonald's when I see their dystopian uniforms. Did you see these new uniforms mcdonald's?
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:40.840]   This is so fun. There's been a whole twitter thread on this. This is they got
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:42.120]   uh
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:44.120]   warrer bazuel
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:46.120]   To design he's a designer
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:52.040]   Uh to design a new gray uniforms warrer used to work at mcdonald's when he was a kid and he said I was embarrassed
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:54.120]   I had to take off my my you know
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:59.960]   Party colored uniform my ronald mcdonald yellow uniform before I left the building because I didn't want anybody to see me in it
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:04.680]   But of course it looks so dystopian immediately gizmodo says oh
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:11.320]   Uh, it's gonna usher in the logans run dystopia. We've all been waiting for and then and then somebody else
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:17.480]   Uh calls it mcgadica and uh post a picture of the hunger games
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:22.760]   district 10 it's the district 10 uniform knows their logo is a bull with carving
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:24.840]   yikes
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:25.720]   So
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:27.720]   You know the crazy thing
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:31.800]   McDonald's. Yes, listen listen you listening. Yeah when you when you want to get a mcdonald's
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:37.240]   The best thing to do when you get a mcdonald's is to buy the property and then build your mcdonald's on it
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:43.880]   So that you own the property too. Maybe you should tell us something about property and buying and loans and mortgages
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:47.160]   Oh, you're so good. How did you know? How did you know that?

[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:57.640]   That's creepy as hell

[01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:16.280]   Um, but there were very very few that you have nobody could possibly believe
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:20.440]   That you were doing it even if they heard the rumor they went. Oh, that's insane
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:27.160]   The new screen savers we're gonna see meta in a brand new augmented reality platform
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:31.320]   You can do more with this than microsoft's doing with a whole lot of 90 degree field of view
[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:36.360]   So immersive that you don't really see the edges. So it's almost like virtual reality on top of the real world
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:39.240]   It's where your brain and tech meet
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:45.800]   But you know what's interesting is when you first held that up it felt like augmented reality of him. Oh, did it?

[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:36.760]   Okay, that sounds like a whole lot of not my problem
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:40.760]   You put the thing out
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:47.400]   Let's talk about it down is better. Yeah, let's talk about apple apple has a
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:52.440]   Apple has an employee who specializes in making fake human sweat
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:57.240]   Synthetic, I like that you chose that
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:20:58.680]   that
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:02.680]   Well now you understand how important it is that you test things
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:05.240]   um
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:09.400]   Like fingerprint readers and and so forth. It's it's extremely
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:15.320]   I I met a guy who his job was he made synthetic urine
[01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:18.920]   And what was uh
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:24.040]   He sold it to companies that would do drug tests and other things like that and they needed just
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:30.840]   urine to sample things with and he was wow making synthetic urine and I'm like, that's the craziest job I've ever heard
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:35.960]   So apple released apple released believe it or not an earth day video
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:39.240]   About
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:41.240]   Well, why apple makes its own sweat?
[01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:46.040]   I actually ended up creating a whole subsection of my team
[01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:51.640]   That's just focused on skin safety really what they're trying to do is to make sure that our products
[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:54.200]   Won't harm human health or the environment
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:57.000]   Do they test it if you like it?
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.800]   Immersive into something like artificial sweat. This is the funny part
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:04.200]   We use fake human sweat
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:09.480]   We want to mimic that we use conditions, but we're not gonna go around collecting sweat from our employees
[01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:10.600]   Our lab was like well
[01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:13.080]   We can do this a lot better if we just make our own sweat
[01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:18.200]   And so every day they make up and you got your sweat and there's one guy in our lab
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:20.280]   All right, this is way too much about apple
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:26.360]   I don't actually these are great. These are their day videos. I think this is actually it's very cute
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:31.080]   I can actually respect their earth day videos because they finally did something that
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:35.480]   I harp about all the time when apple says all the great things they do for the world
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:42.280]   They're going to start using recyclable wolves instead of destroying the planet to get a little bit more mining
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:45.080]   No more mining. I love it. I mean
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:48.040]   That is a long-term goal for them
[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:51.800]   But I mean they've been they have been working towards it for a very long time
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:53.800]   Like it's this is not just something we're out of the blue
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:23:01.000]   They're like, you know what guys now we're gonna start being responsible like apple has been on this track for about 20 years
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:07.000]   And I mean you can see it in all of the things that they've done pretty much since 1999 onward
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.280]   but um, this is a I think a much more
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:13.800]   Public stand. I mean lisa jackson was on
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:21.080]   john gubers during fireball this weekend lisa jackson who's of course the svp of the environmental technologies
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:22.600]   and
[01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:26.520]   I mean the fact that they're willing to talk so publicly about this not only
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:30.360]   What their plans are in the future, which is a very unappled thing
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:33.880]   But also let's tell you all of the ways that we're doing this
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:39.720]   To me shows that apples committed not only to making this for their own products, but kind of being a
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:44.120]   being a guiding post right for the rest of the technology world basically saying
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:48.440]   Hey guys, like we know that you don't like us because
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:54.440]   We you know, we we make our products so that they're you know, not necessarily user repairable
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:24:00.280]   But we have a reason for that and we're going to try and still use all of those parts and make sure
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:05.400]   That those parts don't end up in a landfill somewhere apple can obviously control
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:08.200]   It's you know fox con the people assembling the phone
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:12.680]   But it's been notoriously difficult for them to control the supply chain
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:16.360]   And so there are parts in all smartphones that use
[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:21.480]   Rare and exotic minerals that are mined by children in the congo for instance
[01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:23.160]   so
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:28.280]   And apples to their credit done everything they can I know to go to up that supply chain and make sure that
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:32.760]   Everything's done as responsibly as possible, but there's only so much they can control
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:36.600]   So I think this is and it's the right thing to do. I mean, I have to say I'm
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:43.000]   It is the trend among uh, not just apple, but all of these phones these you know apples phones aren't
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.920]   recyclable by any normal recycler nor is this s8 I mean
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:52.360]   They're glued together everything's very tightly. You can't just grind it up and burn it
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:55.880]   Uh, you really need as apple to do it build a robot
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:25:02.280]   Liam to disassemble its iPhone I doubt leams in widespread use but that illustrated how difficult it would be
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:07.560]   Uh to recycle its stuff. So I don't I don't want to do this. I don't want to sign like it's an apple
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:09.560]   Just an apple thing it is a multi
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:13.640]   company everything and I I just appreciate them coming out and saying it
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:17.160]   Out loud and more forward because at the same time
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:21.080]   There's still a company that does what they do when how they need to do it and get it done
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:26.680]   So for 20 years of them being you know recyclable and then their miss the things are less
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:29.000]   taken apart it's
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.960]   I like the fact that they've actually made this statement and they're moving forward in a more aggressive manner
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:37.560]   Then the ho hum hey, we're trying to save the earth approach today
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:43.320]   Slide on the radar. Well as long as it's not lip service. Yeah as long as they're genuinely gonna do this. I agree
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:49.400]   Yeah, if they do it'll put pressure on others right to do this exactly that that's what we've that's always seen
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:52.200]   We did an award-winning story
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:54.040]   in 2014
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:58.760]   on uh, we had people on the ground in democratic republica kongo that
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.640]   looked at you know what was really happening and
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:09.240]   Beyond that that was when the story was kind of hot with conflict minerals and um look at the real consequences
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:14.120]   human consequences to you know the ways that these things are
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:18.840]   Not only mined but also recycled because a lot of the stuff gets sent
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:27.960]   back there and and burned and shipped and and um, you know separated and all of that and the human consequences are
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:31.240]   Are real and that story becomes a lot
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:37.240]   Um closer to home when you understand that and you understand that these things that I buy you know end up
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:39.640]   Um, you know harming up people
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:45.160]   Uh, you know in consequences that have consequences that you never intended and so
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:47.800]   You know has off to them
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:54.040]   It's overdue not just for them but for the industry and it is good to see them taking a leadership position and I think it will affect others
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:56.360]   again like
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:27:01.480]   That's the best part of it is that they're going to put pressure on other companies again coming on be more public about it because
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:04.840]   I understand they have to have these materials and they have to come from somewhere
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:09.160]   But as they progress to making especially apple leading the way of making their devices
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:12.440]   Unswappable unchanged where you can't swap out batteries
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:18.840]   You can't swap out and put SD card in it like apple products are starting to have like a one and done shelf life
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:23.400]   And they do have a lot of place you could drop stuff off as a best buy vis-a-vis or something like that
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:29.160]   But again a lot of things don't end up in the places that they need to be to get recycled
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:35.240]   So them making a statement just puts more force on other people and that is something i'm really excited about because
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:41.480]   It's something we always look over. Oh, solar is the next best thing. Where are they getting all the materials for the solar panels again?
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:46.120]   Oh, yeah, yeah, they're they're they're blowing up holes in the ground and
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:52.440]   Disturbin water and lakes and streams, but it's cool. We need to solar because we're all about clean energy
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:58.440]   So I mean it's always a tip for tat as far as the planet's concerned. So any effort is a great effort to me
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:05.800]   They do. I mean this the new apple park spaceship campus is solar the whole roof is solar
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:09.160]   And I think that thing's gonna just fly off one day. I feel like
[01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:14.360]   Come invade and apple just gonna be like all right it's time to go and that thing's gonna be gone
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:19.560]   Like that's the spaceship. Yep. That's just gonna leave us all behind and they just tell you it's an office building
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:23.480]   They're moving in uh, they're moving in starting to move in this month
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:28.840]   Uh here's I really wanted to sneak in there when I was in san jose because i was literally wackett sneak in there
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:30.840]   It's like no no drone
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:36.200]   There's two people there's dunkin and i can't sandfeld and another guy who do these drone videos
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:41.960]   Uh, so we've been able to watch this process and apple must know that they've got these drones flying over shooting video
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:46.440]   There's not much they can do like they can't post in a k-47 at the
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:52.280]   I guess not. I don't know. I don't think they might know that much. I mean look it's creating lots of it
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:56.760]   It's like free, you know, it's hype for them and hype and publicity
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:29:03.400]   They kind of love that stuff to a degree right that partially they're so secretive so that people will spend more time
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:05.880]   Anticipating right that that actually
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:13.880]   Did you see the guy in china who made his office building look like um the enterprise from star trek
[01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:21.960]   Have you seen that building? No, somebody google that find it. It's amazing. It's pretty awesome
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:25.480]   I'm almost sure that that was real and i'm not making that up in my mind. I didn't dream that
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:27.720]   I'm like you might have dream that i'm just saying
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:32.840]   No, somebody chat if you did it's a good dream. It's a good dream if you did the power of the internet
[01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:35.320]   china asian business guy
[01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:38.520]   Star trek office building this uh footy i'll find it
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:41.400]   But this this footage is interesting because it shows they're working at night
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:47.240]   Which means they're working really fast and hard to try to get this ready for occupy occupancy
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:49.240]   Which starts as i said
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:52.920]   This month on the apple campus all right. I'm gonna google starship there it is
[01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.760]   Wow
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:57.960]   The hundred day dollar building that looks like the starship enterprise
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:03.240]   And you think i don't know what's going on in the world i wonder i wonder how paramount feels about this
[01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:06.120]   They're very they're very protective of the star trek
[01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:11.560]   IP how you feel they throw photon torpedoes in your face
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:16.760]   I'm sure that thing comes equipped with some like sandwich photon torpedo
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:19.960]   How dope is that like how i want to work for that dude?
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:22.440]   I saw that i'm like this is the coolest dude to plant it
[01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:26.520]   I probably can't breathe over there, but i want to work in that building. I just want to do it
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:33.960]   Can't even see the building most days of the year. It's a trip uncle. Let's go. Let's go to his office small. Let's go. Wow. Yeah
[01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:42.360]   So another another more kudos to apple apparently i didn't know this before he died steve jobs founded a super secret initiative
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:49.480]   To develop sensors that can non-invasively and continuously monitor blood sugar levels to treat diabetes
[01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:53.480]   This is a story as cmbc got the got the scoop here
[01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:59.800]   Apparently they've been conducting feasibility trials at clinical sites across the bay area
[01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:07.640]   But google's talked about making contact lenses that can measure the blood sugar through your tears
[01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:11.960]   This i don't think this is a contact lens. I'm not sure exactly
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:16.360]   Well, they say optical sensors. It apparently shines a light through the skin
[01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:19.320]   And measures the same way that
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:23.320]   Yeah, it's the same way that the apple heart rate sensor sensor works
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:29.720]   It's currently this the heart rate sensor uses oximeter technology, which is the same thing as uh fit bit most the others
[01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:33.160]   And the glucose monitoring system would be something somewhat similar
[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:41.400]   And i'm not surprised at all by this especially again going back to the the thing where like apple's main like core passions
[01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:45.320]   When it comes to human interest are the environment
[01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:47.320]   um and
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:51.080]   Learning like teaching and health and health especially
[01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:55.960]   I mean, no, I don't I don't want to say the catalyst was steve jobs getting sick or anything like that
[01:31:56.040 --> 01:32:00.360]   But I do think that it's it's something that's a big part of tim cook's apple
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:05.160]   And something that he cares very deeply about and that jobs certainly cared very much about
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:08.840]   um, and I would not be surprised if
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:13.400]   the holy grail for treating diabetes was one tier of
[01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:16.040]   What eventually became the apple watch?
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:18.040]   Well, it was like yeah
[01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:20.600]   If you could wear an apple watch and have continuous blood
[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:26.920]   Sugar measurements that there's 30 million diabetics they'd sell 30 million apple watches
[01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:33.400]   Remember when remember when phil was on phil phil liven was on and he had that um unit that stuck into his arm
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:37.720]   Right that gave him his current that was invasie. That wasn't non invasive
[01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:40.280]   That was pricking his skin
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:47.640]   But again, i'm just saying that technology is moving towards that in a very fast manner especially overseas
[01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:50.040]   And so apple is like look
[01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:54.120]   The rest of the world is working on this we need to find a way that we can get this in our devices
[01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:56.120]   So we can make it so again
[01:32:56.120 --> 01:33:00.840]   It is about money at the end of the day because what you just said is a fact if someone says oh, I can just have this
[01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:03.240]   Not be pricking my finger 32 times a day. It's the best
[01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:10.520]   It's the best of all possible worlds. It's a it's a product. It's a business, but it also would be huge for health
[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:13.800]   Um, this is this is and you know we talk about
[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:20.520]   Virtual reality augmented reality. This is something simple and real that could change a lot of people's lives
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:22.600]   That's the stuff i think
[01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:26.680]   Yeah, you would realize that's why that's why i'd be down on all this vr and space ships
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:32.200]   I saw a lawnmower man 30 years ago. I'm still waiting so until we get to something that's like super sexy and functional
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:36.520]   I will bash it in the head and let you guys be the positive ways of the world
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:39.720]   But that apple is doing because they have a clear path
[01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:44.040]   To making things work and making a crap ton of money
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:46.600]   Uh
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:50.280]   Apple by the way is apparently i've heard rumors struggling
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:55.240]   Uh to get a fingerprint reader in the next generation iphone because
[01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:59.960]   I guess they don't want to put one on the back they want to put one under the screen and that's been the rumor
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:05.800]   But apparently according to some supply sources. They're having difficulty making that work. It'll be very
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:13.880]   They will not they will never make they will never make a fingerprint dongle. That is ridiculous
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:15.960]   This is the story from the verge
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:19.960]   Ridiculous. Oh, yeah, that's what they say to someone
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:25.720]   Yeah, this is someone who's like all right. Let's run with this crazy rumor because it's insane
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:28.120]   Okay, but no joke like it's
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:33.080]   Let me talk about this for a sec because I think it's it's it's absolutely silly
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:39.800]   Like of course apple apple has probably been testing a fingerprint sensor on the rear casing for again two years
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:46.600]   Probably since they started developing an OLED option for their iphone right and an edge to edge because
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:52.120]   You cannot do edge to edge screen technology with the current generation finger sensor
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:54.440]   It's just it's it's going to be very very difficult
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:35:01.800]   And there's only so much room in which to put some, you know, put all of this technology while improving the camera while improving the screen
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:08.360]   You know adding wide color and the p3 color gamut and all of this nonsense like there's a there's
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:14.760]   You got to pick and choose your battles. So I believe that apple is currently weighing like, okay
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:21.400]   Do we you know do we try and uh, you know, we can't get a hundred percent qa on fingerprints
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:23.480]   That's her on the front and we may have some problems
[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:28.680]   Or do we go with do we have to compromise and put the fingerprint sensor on the back for
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:31.880]   A year when we go to this edge to edge display
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:35.240]   So i'm i'm not surprised that we're seeing these these different
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:39.240]   These different models come up. I'm sure they've been around in testing for a while
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:46.280]   Uh, it's the the real question is are they going to actually ship one or the other of these like we're not really going to know
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:48.360]   Until we get much much closer
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:51.080]   This is ronody ronody speculation
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:57.720]   There's there's t in this cup and you see real sensitive about them dongles apple brought that joke upon themselves siretti
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:35:59.720]   It's just a joke nobody
[01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:04.120]   I'm going to have a fingerprint on but that's apples fault bringing in dongles
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:06.680]   People who think would you see?
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:12.120]   They did do a few dongles. Yes, they did they did I do think whatever they've done
[01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:17.960]   They has already decided like these links are you know, like siretti says there's i'm sure there's lots of prototypes
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:20.440]   I'm sure they tried lots of different ways
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:22.600]   I obviously
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:29.000]   Based on the patents and stuff they filed they would love to keep it on the front not make there be let there be any
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.400]   Sort of obvious circle or anything
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:35.240]   Maybe you have a place similar to where the fingerprint sensor is now
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:36.600]   but
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:39.240]   You know that you put your finger there or maybe you know
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:44.360]   Something lights up and shows you to put your finger there when you when you put your finger over it or something
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:49.400]   Um, I think that that's the ideal for them based on the patents they filed
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:52.360]   But it may not be technologically possible yet
[01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:55.240]   And so I think I think siretti's theory is a good one
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:59.640]   They may have to have a bridge between where they'd like to be and you know
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:04.200]   The fact that they're probably going to go to this bezel list display similar to the s8
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:06.440]   Um, and it may have to go on the back
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:13.000]   If they do I hope they put it in the middle like google has done and not to the side of the camera like the s8
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.520]   Which is kind of
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:18.600]   It wouldn't ask her apple apple is used to putting their famers in the top corner also
[01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:22.120]   Samsung always puts their cameras in the middle so their design
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:26.840]   Generally is already set up for that obviously things might change but yeah, yeah
[01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:31.400]   According to com score apple has more iphone users in the us
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:34.760]   Than at any point in history get this
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:37.560]   85.8 million
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:41.240]   iPhone old owners 13 and up
[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:49.400]   85.8 million people using iphones. I mean if you're a kid now you look at you know
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:55.400]   Um, if you you look at kids like none of them want to be caught without an iphone
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:38:02.280]   Um, it's it's almost like and a lot of it's the iMessage thing right like if you're a green bubble and not a blue bubble
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:05.480]   It's like ooh, you know, um and so
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:13.800]   Um, and that's real and that's uh for whatever reason and it could change right tastes and it's it's almost like a taste and fashion thing
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:15.880]   And those things can change
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:18.200]   But about I do think that's powering a lot
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:25.000]   And it's going to continue to have implications for apple over uh over the next several years
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:27.640]   Um, that doesn't mean something couldn't change it
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:31.800]   But I don't see a whole lot of people jumping to s8s, you know, who are under you pull that chart up again
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:39.800]   Is that is that an i is that an ios thing versus android thing or is that an iphone thing versus a galaxy thing like so this
[01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:42.840]   chart is i phones, but if you look at this this is
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:48.760]   The chart of smartphone platforms the blue at the bottom is android
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:52.440]   Ios is the light blue the dark blue is android
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:59.240]   So when you when you when you use funny because it goes back to 2005 when there was no android or iphone at that point it was
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:01.640]   microsoft
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:03.160]   blackberry
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:07.160]   Symbian and palm palm the purple one shrank away to nothing
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:11.400]   Uh, what i was about to say was like very shrunk away with kids
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:17.720]   Kids just want a phone and I see more kids when I and I pick my kid over from school with androids and I do iphones
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:20.520]   Because most people can't afford it. That's exactly right. You can go get your kid
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:25.960]   A phone is a hundred bucks of android phone. You can get them a one plus or anything over an iphone
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:32.600]   I mean of course people I mean the iphone is seen as the phone of privilege by a lot of people it is but as a phone affordability
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:35.560]   For a child to give it to a 14 year old that you can't trust
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:38.360]   Is android is
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:42.680]   53% the problem is that's a bunch of manufacturers
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:46.200]   Uh iphone is one manufacturer. That's the difference
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:51.480]   I'm just saying is the still multiple devices over when you just say everybody got an iphone
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:56.440]   I'm just trying to put it in perspective. I bet you I bet you I'd like to this is for comms score and I don't see the number of
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:40:05.080]   Samsung phones, but I bet you Samsung is not far off that mark of 85 million because for most people when they say android they mean samsung
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:09.720]   Again, that's why I wanted to see a different kind of chart because when you just say those things
[01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:12.360]   Everything
[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:16.200]   In reality the red world works everybody can't afford a iphone
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:22.760]   Nothing to nothing and nobody wants to all ones with the bumpity bumps and they can go get a solid android device
[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:28.200]   That works for them, especially when you're giving it to children. Yeah, that's funny. I see kids using
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:31.080]   The funny thing is I see kids using like these
[01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:33.640]   Carrying around like old iphone
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:35.720]   Yeah
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:42.200]   And stuff where they're like hand me downs from you know a pair or an uncle or you know a cousin or whatever
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:47.800]   And it's like oh, yeah, just give them that throw a sim in there, you know throw them on the family plan for 20 bucks a month or whatever
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:54.360]   We've got a iphone six plus s oh she's a fancy girl. Yeah, wow. Yeah. Yeah
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:59.080]   So we're gonna take a break when we come back hell will freeze over
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:02.280]   But first that's a tease but first
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:05.800]   A word from carbonite
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:11.080]   You are you reading my mind get out of my head. Oh and jj stone. Oh, doctor
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:18.280]   Yeah, this money bank carbonite online backup. You got it you nailed it got to back it up to get it back you got
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:23.320]   Thank you. I you know I invented that slogan. They don't actually use it. I just say it
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:28.440]   But it's true
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:32.760]   And with ransomware rampant in the world, I you know
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:38.120]   Carbonite is a really important solution not just from home home users, but for businesses
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:41.800]   Because uh, you know one employee opens one bad email
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:49.400]   You know, it's always from the boss. You know smithers. Here's the spreadsheet open it and he opens it and it's ransomware and your entire system
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:57.640]   Is now corrupted and you can't do business. You don't have access to your customer list your supplier list your accounts are so you got nothing
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:04.040]   That's when you'll be glad you have carbonite carbonite online backup for home for office for mac for pc

[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:20.920]   They have backup for individual computers as little as $59 a year for everything on a pc or a mac
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:26.440]   They have server backups. They even have this evolte, which is local hard drive backup

[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:41.400]   Lost and that's really important and because they support versioning
[01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:46.200]   Even if you do get bit by ransomware carbonite can save your took us
[01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:52.440]   Go to the business section read the resources page ransomware mitigation lots of great information there

[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:28.200]   with carbonite
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:29.160]   Yes, sir
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:36.360]   Hell freezing over because according to the wall street journal google is planning to put an ad blocker in chrome
[01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:41.320]   Google whose business is selling online ads
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:45.480]   Is planning to put an ad blocker in chrome?
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:51.400]   Now i'm guessing it's not gonna strip out google ads, but that was about to say that's
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:01.640]   They're gonna use go ahead go ahead serenity
[01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:05.400]   Oh no, I'm amused by the deck on that that article where it's like
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:07.880]   Cool plans to strip out bad ads
[01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:13.720]   and as as someone whose site uses google ads from time to time and
[01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:16.200]   We have been absolutely
[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:22.600]   Smothered with these awful google ads that hijack the browser and try and like send you to app store stuff
[01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:31.320]   Like that that amuses me. I'm like google fix your own darn ad problem before you try and well destroy other ads
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:35.880]   In google's defense that this is exactly what google's doing
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:42.200]   They've tried a number of things because you know the worst case scenario for google is that everybody starts using ad blockers and no
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:46.360]   Be sees ads googles or anybody else's and then by the way, that's a bad
[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:49.560]   Thing for imore and for tech republic and a lot of sites
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:53.640]   That rely on banner ads that's how you monetize the site
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:58.760]   And if more and more people and i'm sure the trend is are using ad blockers google's got to do something
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:03.960]   They started amp the amp initiative for mobile the idea being that uh amp would
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:09.000]   Make pages load much more quickly on mobile. They got a lot of publishers to use it
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:14.440]   It still has ads but it has much more limited ads. Java script is very much constrained. You can't have
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:18.440]   Audio, I mean there's a lot of things and that's I think kind of what they're doing here
[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:22.280]   They say they will block offensive ads ads that
[01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:29.560]   Have pop-ups or auto playing video or what we call prestitial ads, which you have to watch before you can see
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:36.680]   The content so we don't know the details yet of what google will or will not block, but I think this makes sense if you're google
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:39.400]   better to do this
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:40.520]   then
[01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:47.480]   Then go in a world where every ad is blocked better to at least meet users halfway and what you know, I use a browser
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:54.360]   Called brave which is based on google's chrome browser that has a contribute button in it
[01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:59.720]   And what you do is you turn it on you set up an automatic payment into an account and then brave
[01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:06.520]   Blocks all ads but pays out publishers who sign up to so that they make up the difference right
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:10.440]   I'm in effect paying for an ad free internet. I think that's a really good solution
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:15.800]   How much did a nickel and diamond you on that you can start brave amount that you're gonna nickel and diamond?
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:18.920]   Up to you you can I think the lowest is a buck a month
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:21.240]   You can choose to do five bucks a month
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:25.400]   Which is kind of the default and you can do more and then they'll just divvy
[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:29.720]   I this is a really cool browser has last pass built in it has
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:33.480]   ad blocking built in and has a way
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:39.800]   To support publishers and you even decide which publishers get contributions you can okay
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:45.480]   I can back brave on that that that all sounds good that that's instantly mitigated by
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:50.840]   Best of both worlds right two things. Yes. I I can accept that that sounds like a brave new world
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:58.440]   That was some serious dad joking right there
[01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:02.440]   Is it is it dead and
[01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:05.560]   Incidentally, uh, what brave does is the other side as well?
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:11.960]   Which is if you're a publisher like tech republic or i'm more you go to their website and you get verified and you say
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:14.600]   I want to be in this and you can get involved
[01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:20.600]   And you will get you know, you're automatically included in this micro payment system. I think this is really interesting
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:27.960]   I really I really like this idea. This is the kind of thing google should do and incidentally brave is around because google open sources
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:31.720]   It's browser chromium open source. So this is just a fork of chromium
[01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:35.400]   So it's using the the bacromium blink engine and all of that
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:41.880]   So it works. Well the only thing I don't like about brave and it works on all platforms is uh, it's a little
[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:50.040]   A little ugly. It's not super elegant, but uh, hey, you know what built in last pass and built in ad blocking
[01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:52.120]   That sounds pretty good to me
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:55.000]   I think the google thing is
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:01.480]   The thing about google is google owns double click right which is one of the biggest ad brokers right ad platforms
[01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:03.400]   Um on
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:06.280]   Yeah in the world and so I bought it a number of years ago
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:08.200]   It kind of runs in the background
[01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:12.360]   So it's not that google is gonna block like this is not gonna touch adwords at all
[01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:14.200]   Um
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:17.480]   But it could they could hurt themselves right with ad ad block. I assume
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:20.840]   You have to assume anything that runs on
[01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:27.000]   Their sites is is not gonna get blocked that runs on their platform is not gonna get blocked
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.400]   Um, but it is an interesting
[01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:36.040]   Uh, it it is an interesting thought experiment because I I sort of have my doubts about this
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:39.080]   I saw the story too and I just kind of can't see them doing it
[01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:45.320]   But google also does some strange things that you wouldn't expect sometimes build hold fiber networks and spend billions of dollars and then realize
[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:52.920]   This is too expensive. Um, you know, so you just kind of never know with them. They they uh, they go out there and try
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:56.360]   Weird things, but I can't see I just can't
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:49:00.520]   I just have my doubts about this if they even if they do this
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:03.720]   um, how effective they'll be at it because
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:10.040]   They're gonna come across a super critical. Um, they're gonna have to try to let their own stuff through to keep making money because
[01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:14.840]   This is where so much of their revenue, you know comes from they have not found
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:21.320]   They have not found another trick yet, you know to making money other than um, then ads and so
[01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:28.040]   I just don't I don't know if they even if they do do this. I don't know how good it's gonna be or how much of a difference it'll make
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:32.360]   Well, it just depends on how much pressure they're under in a way. I mean, I think if they
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:36.120]   I mean they know better than anybody how how many ads are being blocked
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:42.200]   I mean the other other alternative do you do this do you guys do this? Uh, is to have a pop up that says hey
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:47.560]   I see you're using an ad blocker. Can you knock it off or would you like to give us money or
[01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:51.160]   Sometimes they even prevent you from visiting the site
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:57.240]   Right, we we don't do that, but we do replace it with our own sort of in house tech stats
[01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:01.880]   We don't make all of our money off of you know tech republic doesn't you know make
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:06.440]   Um, you have another business money on display ads. We have other lines of business
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:11.880]   So we have our own sort of matchmaking service between, you know enterprise vendors and enterprise users
[01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:18.840]   And so if they if they block the ad then we just surface our little in-house kind of texty ads or or more
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:23.640]   Kind of like google ad because they're their first party ads. So they can't be right right
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:28.040]   Although i'm seeing ad blockers now really getting aggressive about blocking
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:31.400]   The request not to use an ad blocker
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:37.640]   I mean, it's a course blocking get admiral and the in between well it makes sense
[01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:43.960]   Yes, it seems unethical to me. So what is i'm more look mobile nations entirely relies on uh
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:46.520]   Well, maybe not entirely you have
[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:53.320]   Several yeah, we have we have several uh revenue streams, but our you know our primary source for the website at least is definitely
[01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:57.800]   Adivertizing revenue. Um, we generally we have a um
[01:50:58.120 --> 01:50:59.000]   uh
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:06.360]   An occasional pop-up that'll that'll hit i think about 10 percent of users using ad blockers that that's not it's just an interstitial
[01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:08.120]   It's testing that
[01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:16.360]   Yeah, it's basically just a hey like, you know, just just an fyi like we make like you help support us
[01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:17.480]   Yeah, exactly
[01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:22.760]   But we're also i mean we're we're testing with the idea of you know people who are
[01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:25.400]   You know already members of our site
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:30.120]   You know removing some of the ads or giving them a better experience as an incentive to you know
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:35.960]   Become part of our community. Uh, so because the site really is the new and especially the new design
[01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:42.120]   It's so nice without ads. It really is well. You see i do use an ad blocker, but there's i use it
[01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:44.760]   on the shows because
[01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:48.040]   Uh, it you know, you never know what it pops up. I don't yeah
[01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:50.760]   I don't want to give those ads air on our on air
[01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:53.960]   But let me disable the ad blocker and refresh and you'll see
[01:51:53.960 --> 01:52:00.360]   Uh, not that I mean here comes some ads, but you see all this part of it is this load time these ads are still loading
[01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:03.320]   Uh, it really makes a difference the over now
[01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:08.120]   I want to support imore if I could give you five bucks and not see ads I would do it
[01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:15.240]   I'm working on something like that believe me. Well, I think that's why the brave micro payments thing and google had a thing like that called google
[01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:16.040]   contributor
[01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:21.640]   They're they're pausing and I don't they said we're going to come back with something better that may be tied into what google's going to do
[01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:26.840]   Maybe they're looking at brave and saying what if we put in an ad blocker that had google contributor as the back end so
[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:29.320]   People could support and
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:32.360]   All these big sites, you know, like us we've looked at this for years too, right?
[01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:39.000]   All big sites and small sites and publishers of all kinds have looked at this idea, you know, you you look and you see
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.400]   What is the average cost?
[01:52:41.880 --> 01:52:45.960]   Uh, the average that we get the average revenue we get per user, right?
[01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:51.080]   And if it's whatever you just take your thing and round it up, you know by
[01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:56.280]   Five ten percent and you know, you just until it comes to an even number and you say great
[01:52:56.280 --> 01:53:03.240]   We can just maybe we'll just offer a pro subscription that says just pay us that you know a year and
[01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:09.320]   The way you go and that number 10s not to be especially have sites that have millions of users
[01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:12.040]   that number is not that big and
[01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:17.160]   It'll be an interesting test over the next few years to see how many sites
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:24.920]   Actually do that right offer this sort of paid tier where you can say you do this you see no ads
[01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:29.240]   You know, you get an ad-free experience that's going to be much faster. Maybe we'll even throw in a few
[01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:32.600]   incentives extra things and
[01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:35.320]   You know will users
[01:53:35.320 --> 01:53:38.040]   Want to pay
[01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:40.920]   For stuff they could get for free somewhere else
[01:53:40.920 --> 01:53:45.400]   Um and see some ads that's the question. I told us no, I like this
[01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:47.400]   Right, I like this contributor thing
[01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:51.320]   I'm the kind of guy who feels guilty about running an ad blocker
[01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:56.360]   But wants to run an ad blocker give me a way to give the sites some money if everybody's happy
[01:53:56.360 --> 01:54:00.280]   I'm much happier, but you're right. I don't know if the majority would do that
[01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:03.240]   Yeah, you're right history tells us no
[01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:06.520]   I take
[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:08.520]   I think you could skip this ad
[01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:14.360]   Actually, you could you know, I mean one of the problems with podcast is we can't guarantee that the ad is
[01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:18.600]   I shouldn't say this out loud, but I think advertisers aren't dumb. I mean
[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:23.800]   Just like a newspaper if you're reading a newspaper, there's no promise that somebody's gonna see your ad
[01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:30.200]   It's there, but they're gonna they may go right by it. They may not even open that page same thing with a podcast or any tv show
[01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:36.280]   Uh people know how to fast forward. I think the podcast is kind of not as easy as that because
[01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:40.760]   If you skip past it, then you got to get back to the part where they're talking about and usually
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:44.840]   Trying to make it hard. Somebody says something I'm using and you want to get back to it
[01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:49.400]   So you just deal with it when I tell uncle leo is time to read an ad and we just go on about our day
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:53.160]   Yeah, so don't short-chain this way. We don't do we don't do one at every half hour
[01:54:53.160 --> 01:54:55.160]   We try to make them products
[01:54:55.160 --> 01:55:00.840]   Or the first hour and 17 minutes until I bring it up before speed it because we got to get this guapolei
[01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:03.160]   All right, let's do it at
[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:05.480]   Perfect example here perfect example
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:09.240]   This is an ad for a company that we use we like we've known for years
[01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:14.280]   And we think some of you would like and what we try to do with the ads is tell you about a product that you might think is useful like
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:20.840]   Drobo Drobo Drobo data started with the the founder started it. He had a hard drive crash
[01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:23.720]   He had a raid array right everybody was using raid
[01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:28.600]   And it but it failed and he said well wait, I thought I was I thought I was protected
[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:32.200]   So he said I want to make a better redundant story storage solution
[01:55:32.680 --> 01:55:36.600]   Drobo stands for date. What was it data robot? I think is what it stood for
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:42.920]   They invented a new kind of raid called beyond raid, which has a lot of benefits including the ability to mix
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:47.400]   Drive sizes in one Drobo giving so I do that all the time
[01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:51.640]   You know I put in whatever hard drives I have lying around in my Drobo
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:56.760]   I have a couple of Drobo was I the Drobo mini and home and I have a five in and so
[01:55:56.760 --> 01:56:01.800]   But when the starts to fill up I take I just it tells you it's got these great lights on the front
[01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:05.880]   Tells you exactly what's going on when one of them goes orange because it's running out of room
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:07.960]   No problem. I get I don't even have to turn it off
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:12.840]   I just get a bigger drive put it in and I've increased the capacity because you don't have to match the sizes
[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:14.200]   plus
[01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:18.360]   They've got a variety of different ways to back, you know have redundant data
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:23.480]   So you you really are backed up. They've got battery backed cash
[01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:28.760]   So if the power goes out, you don't have to worry it prevents right failure or data corruption
[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:36.920]   Couldn't be easier to use these panels on the front they're maggically attached no screwdriver needed you add a drive without a screwdriver you slide it in
[01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:43.400]   It's so easy to do the status lights tell you exactly what's going on rebuilding getting low
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:48.760]   Drive failed whatever they've just introduced a new Drobo you see this one the five and
[01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:57.480]   Two it's the next era of simplified network attached storage for your connected home or small office high performance upgraded processor
[01:56:58.280 --> 01:57:03.400]   They do port bonding which means if you have multiple internet service providers you can bond their data together
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:09.240]   To give you higher speed connection and on the back not one gigabit two gigabit
[01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:18.840]   Ethernet ports so you put one in each port two different providers you've got incredible throughput ssd compatibility
[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:23.400]   They have an m sata accelerator bay. I use the m sata accelerator bay
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:25.240]   to
[01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:30.280]   To speed up rights. It's really fantastic. Of course secure backup remote data access and sharing
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:36.600]   Disaster recovery. I mean true peace of mind and the Drobo apps are available for the five and two
[01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:41.480]   They're really taking advantage of the new processor Drobo picks gives you photo backup plex. Yes
[01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:44.760]   They've got cloud apps for backup and data syncing
[01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:50.920]   Developer tools for programs and websites you could put a full lamp stack on there node.js
[01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:53.400]   You could put word you can run your wordpress
[01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:59.480]   Site right there or your clients if you're a web developer. This is a great way to do client sites
[01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:04.680]   So that they can see what you're doing app developers can use see and go and pearl and python and ruby
[01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:10.040]   There's even a get client. So the new five n2 is a power tool
[01:58:10.040 --> 01:58:13.640]   Go to Drobo store dot com to learn more check out their complete line of products
[01:58:13.640 --> 01:58:19.880]   And the prices they're better than ever they've lowered prices on almost the entire line plus you're going to save
[01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:21.960]   10 at
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:26.040]   Drobo store dot com when you use the code twit 10 and that includes the brand new five n2
[01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:29.480]   Drobo store dot com
[01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:32.280]   The offer code twit 10 for 10 percent off
[01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:37.880]   At the drobo store learn more about uh, how they work. I think you'll be very impressed
[01:58:37.880 --> 01:58:45.160]   Drobo is one of those uh s s products. It's a sexy and simple sexy and simple like just like you
[01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:49.880]   In some a never like that. You never lied
[01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:52.440]   Yeah
[01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:56.760]   This is like the data show. I love it. It is well. We do geek stuff. I want to do geek products
[01:58:56.760 --> 01:59:00.760]   I don't you know, that's uh, occasionally, you know, we're gonna get I think for father's day. We're gonna get some uh
[01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:03.400]   kind of more uh
[01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:08.360]   You know cosmetics and things, but I like if we cool if we can do the deep deep products. I like to do that
[01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:13.080]   It's fun. It does remind me though of just a one more thing on the conversation
[01:59:13.080 --> 01:59:19.240]   We we're just finishing on um on advertising. Yes, the thing is, you know, the old joke in advertising is that
[01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:24.520]   Um, I know 50 percent of my advertising doesn't work. I just don't know which 50 it is right?
[01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:27.000]   It's a that's why they
[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:31.640]   It's why they have to do what they do and spend so much money those days are gonna end soon
[01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:37.320]   They are at this. That's right. We are becoming part of a world where um, you know
[01:59:37.320 --> 01:59:41.800]   We are be able to measure and manage everything like even your show even audio ads is gonna
[01:59:41.800 --> 01:59:43.080]   Yep, mike
[01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:49.080]   There's gonna come some service that's gonna use a percentage or something and they're gonna be able to tell everyone of your advertisers
[01:59:49.160 --> 01:59:52.680]   Here's the percentage of people who listen to your ad or act it upon it
[01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:56.040]   They'll do some omni channel thing where they'll connect buyers
[01:59:56.040 --> 02:00:03.240]   And their habits and then your advertisers will come to you and they'll say something like oh well now we we we have to be
[02:00:03.240 --> 02:00:07.960]   We're gonna advertise with you, but we have to be the first ad in the show because we've we see that that has 27
[02:00:07.960 --> 02:00:12.600]   percent more likelihood of a purchase transaction and so then you're gonna have to start saying oh
[02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:16.920]   We're gonna charge you more if you want to be the first one in the slot
[02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:20.840]   That's a higher premium or whatever, but it's gonna be all based on data
[02:00:20.840 --> 02:00:27.320]   And so this world is changing considerably and I do think that um some of what we're seeing
[02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:32.920]   With ad blockers and those things that sort of this very it's what's driving this is because there's all this
[02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:36.600]   That's high volume low value inventory
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:41.240]   On the web and it's driven by the fact that people just you know
[02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:47.880]   Shove out as money impressions of everything as they can because they can't measure well
[02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:50.920]   And they don't know and they don't have sophisticated tools
[02:00:50.920 --> 02:01:00.360]   But I that is destined to change as the web changes as big data changes as we become smarter about those things and
[02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:04.520]   Just pure scale will matter less and less and so
[02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:07.000]   Um, that's a little bit optimistic view
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:12.360]   But it there's gonna be less value around just blasting out this message to so many people and a lot
[02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:17.000]   More value in I'm interested in people who are you know
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.640]   Interested in these four things
[02:01:19.640 --> 02:01:26.200]   That's because we're competing with Facebook who can tell yes, you can sell it down to the last slice and we're competing with google
[02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:28.040]   And frankly, I don't i'm not sure
[02:01:28.040 --> 02:01:32.600]   I'm gonna do very well in that era because the one thing that our audience doesn't want us to do and I don't want to do
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:36.600]   Is collect data about them. I don't want to give our advertisers big data
[02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:40.680]   So the one thing the one pick the new pick us because you know, we're
[02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:47.800]   Targeted at geeks and the well the other thing that works in your favor are in the favor of listening to an ad from a church of sources
[02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:52.760]   So, you know, I as a technology person. I get people asking me stuff. Oh, well, you know
[02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:56.600]   I want to start doing my stocks my own. I want to use one of these ask which one should I use?
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:02:00.440]   What happens to me? I don't use it, but I've heard it because I've been on this show and I watch show enough
[02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:06.360]   I say oh wealth front. Oh use code twin exactly. Yeah, and I you might not have mentioned them in six
[02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:10.680]   Talk to influencers. That's right. You see what I'm saying? But again, it gets stuck in your mind. I'm saying
[02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:16.440]   I believe in what we're doing. I just worry that advertisers are going to get that message that Jason's talking about say
[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:19.960]   But I want all these numbers. I want to know I want to target that guy
[02:02:19.960 --> 02:02:23.560]   And I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that
[02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:31.080]   You've also your target because you get people to use that the the code that you provide for them too. So you have yeah, but let me tell you that
[02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:35.960]   I mean again, it's a little inside baseball, but that's a very imperfect system
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:40.200]   And we only do that because advertisers want to do that and a lot of times they want to break it up by show
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.800]   And the problem is that most people just do twit
[02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:46.440]   Because they know it's twit and they don't
[02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:51.400]   Make weekly. I don't know and and a lot of times advertisers some will usually talk them out of this
[02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:54.840]   But they might have a variety of strange offer codes
[02:02:54.840 --> 02:03:01.960]   Because they're remember draft draft Kings would advertise an NFL football that doesn't work every ad had different
[02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:03.400]   offer code
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:07.240]   Clearly they were trying to figure out. Well, you see the 12 10 out of the 12
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:14.440]   Exactly, but this is going to work for you Leo because then it's going to be a less imperfect system, right?
[02:03:14.440 --> 02:03:16.520]   then the people who
[02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:22.680]   There are people who listen to your ads because they trust you and they buy it, but they know never put in the code
[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:26.840]   I think I have bought I can honestly say probably more than anything. I've ever
[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:31.720]   Any other site I've probably or you know tech
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:39.400]   Public publisher. I've bought stuff from this show more than anybody else. Me too. It's very expensive
[02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:47.320]   Because it's targeted though your your advertisers know based on your content
[02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:49.960]   on the kinds of people who listen
[02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:53.480]   Um that they are and the way that you deliver it
[02:03:53.480 --> 02:04:00.440]   And so where data will help you is it's going to show up more often and the imperfect code system will become less and less
[02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:05.320]   Important because of omni-channel data based on people who listen to your show and you know
[02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:08.680]   They'll know facebook already knows facebook is really on top of this
[02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:13.240]   That's what scares me because that's how facebook sells right help other vendors
[02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:19.160]   So facebook may actually be able to help you in this way because they are connecting the dots
[02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:21.880]   Facebook and others
[02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:31.400]   Giving facebook any information about our about our users. I don't know anything about our users
[02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:33.320]   And I don't want to know anything about our users
[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:40.040]   The thing is is they know even if you don't want them to know son of a like they they know that they do
[02:04:40.040 --> 02:04:41.240]   They listened to twit
[02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:46.680]   Yeah, they kind of walked into facebook and they went to amazon and they bought that thing
[02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:50.520]   Um that was on your show within 20 minutes of that ad running
[02:04:50.680 --> 02:04:56.520]   They'll be telling they'll be telling advertisers about us not us. They will yeah, that's your probably right
[02:04:56.520 --> 02:05:01.400]   And isp's right who can sell data user data now your isp
[02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:04.440]   Pledge not to but yeah, well, we'll see about that
[02:05:04.440 --> 02:05:07.000]   Not publicly
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:08.440]   It's a gold
[02:05:08.440 --> 02:05:12.840]   It's like saying we have this gold that's sitting in the back room of our
[02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:18.200]   Headquarters, we're not gonna we're not gonna access that because it's just you know
[02:05:18.280 --> 02:05:22.200]   We don't really want to do that and we know people don't like it that we have all of this money
[02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:27.400]   Of course, they're gonna do it. Yeah, that's what I spent so much of my time lying to the internet
[02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:32.920]   I'm currently 65 years old. I'm called can you do my advice to everybody?
[02:05:32.920 --> 02:05:41.480]   Yeah, but it's because you you're super smart and informed about this like you are not the average citizen. I know I know
[02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:46.920]   Okay a couple of quickies and then we're gonna let you all uh go to your
[02:05:47.960 --> 02:05:51.640]   Husbands and children fbi can't hire hackers because of 420
[02:05:51.640 --> 02:06:00.680]   So the fbi was very worried because they have a rule that says if you have smoked marijuana in the last what three years
[02:06:00.680 --> 02:06:07.880]   Uh, you know, you can't be an fbi agent and so the problem was fbi's trying to find hackers
[02:06:07.880 --> 02:06:10.440]   Uh
[02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:15.000]   Well, the fbi's proud to say it can finally find hackers who don't smoke weed. They just drink
[02:06:15.480 --> 02:06:20.440]   I don't believe it for a moment. I think that they didn't smoke for a month and then just said they don't smoke
[02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:24.040]   They wait till it gets out of the system. Yeah, and then they hire people anyway. Yeah, because
[02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:31.560]   It's a stressful job. Everybody smokes weed leo smoke. Are we right? It's legal. It's legal in many states. It's legal here
[02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:33.560]   There it is
[02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:37.640]   You know, there's also the way of getting around it by going the contractor route, right?
[02:06:37.640 --> 02:06:40.760]   Where you're not an employee of the fbi
[02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:45.960]   Wink wink. Oh, there you go. That's a good one
[02:06:45.960 --> 02:06:48.680]   That's how they could go on
[02:06:48.680 --> 02:06:54.520]   The well anyway, I'm glad to know I could finally get an fbi job. So that's what I'm going for
[02:06:54.520 --> 02:06:59.800]   Uh HTC. I bought their phone the u-ultra now. They're gonna do a new one. Come on
[02:06:59.800 --> 02:07:05.400]   The ocean will be unveiled with a what touch sensitive frame
[02:07:05.400 --> 02:07:08.280]   on may 16
[02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:12.760]   What can I just say that the uh squeeze for the real that is
[02:07:12.760 --> 02:07:16.120]   Not the shape that it really should be for a
[02:07:16.120 --> 02:07:22.760]   Advertise it that reminds me of yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Wait. Wait. Wait. I'm let me watch this and you can tell me what wait
[02:07:22.760 --> 02:07:25.160]   Wait, man. What is what airbnb zad came?
[02:07:25.160 --> 02:07:29.880]   Airbnb's new low. What are they? What are they? What are they? Was like, oh, what are you saying?
[02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:31.880]   What's weird about that? Oh that?
[02:07:31.880 --> 02:07:34.760]   That
[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000]   This is the invitation
[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:42.760]   That's that's that's co-text right there. It does. It looks like the uh the poster that a lot of people were
[02:07:42.760 --> 02:07:45.560]   Using in the march
[02:07:45.560 --> 02:07:49.320]   Uh for women. Do you need to you need to take a phone through a term style or something?
[02:07:49.320 --> 02:07:53.160]   Why do I need to squeeze my phone? What what is it's fun?
[02:07:53.160 --> 02:07:58.840]   Oh my god, I don't get me wrong. I really enjoy you know
[02:07:58.840 --> 02:08:03.800]   The little brain like the plastic brain that I have on my desk that I squeeze for like tension
[02:08:03.800 --> 02:08:05.800]   You know, you stress phone
[02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:08.920]   Yeah
[02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:13.640]   What we're gonna attach my plastic brain what happens when I lick it. I wonder oh
[02:08:13.640 --> 02:08:16.520]   Yeah, see there you go. Yeah
[02:08:16.520 --> 02:08:19.080]   I'm gonna do that to my phone like what?
[02:08:19.080 --> 02:08:22.200]   So I just stick it stick it on the phone and
[02:08:22.200 --> 02:08:26.760]   Well, I already already took this. I already performed CPR right now
[02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:33.240]   I already performed brain surgery on my HTC U-Ultra and put it in the Samsung galaxy s8
[02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:39.000]   Anyway, it doesn't matter that it's dead, but that's uh intel weird intel had booked
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:47.000]   downtown san francisco for the 20th yeah until developers actually 17th intel developers form
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:50.200]   And canceled it this week just add a hand
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:56.040]   This was a bummer. That was actually a good event used to go to it. I know yeah, I'd go
[02:08:56.040 --> 02:08:59.320]   You know, I'd go every few years. I do that with a lot of these events
[02:08:59.320 --> 02:09:03.080]   I don't tend not to go every year. I go every because you tend to hear the same story a lot of times
[02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:07.160]   I took typical skip a year or two in between but that's that's a good event
[02:09:07.160 --> 02:09:10.920]   They still have my scotty west booked. Yeah, but they canceled it
[02:09:10.920 --> 02:09:14.360]   Yeah, mostly because that one was nice because
[02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:20.520]   They're because they're not pushing up, you know, they don't have a product that they're pushing to people
[02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:25.720]   Right. So it was it was a nice industry overview. You got a sense from them. What was happening?
[02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:29.800]   This is uh, this is from ryan smith and ean cutris of anon's tech
[02:09:30.360 --> 02:09:36.040]   They write I just got off the phone with intel about why idf is being canceled. Here's what intel says
[02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:43.080]   Intel has been changing rapidly over the last two to three years as they go from a pc centric company
[02:09:43.080 --> 02:09:45.640]   to a data centric company
[02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:49.000]   What
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.240]   They're not going to make chips. What does that mean?
[02:09:51.240 --> 02:09:57.800]   Now it's all that data centers. It's just that they're they're going to sell their they're they're going to make all their money on
[02:09:58.120 --> 02:10:04.040]   Data centers people aren't buying pc's, but they are certainly building data centers. Okay. What they lost mobile
[02:10:04.040 --> 02:10:09.240]   They they knew they were gonna they knew mobile was coming. That's funny. I remember idf like 2008
[02:10:09.240 --> 02:10:16.200]   2009 they were like mobiles about to steamroll everything and they're like we got to switch to mobile
[02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:21.720]   They still couldn't do it right? They knew it was coming and they still couldn't adjust and do it
[02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:29.000]   So emma that's a Kodak knew that did it was coming. They even bought companies and put out the first digital cameras still in seva
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:37.480]   It's kind of over for them on that but where they can win is in two places data center because obviously data centers aren't going away
[02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:39.640]   People are going to build more of them
[02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:46.120]   And bigger and they're going to need bigger and faster ones to handle all of this data and that so they that's what they put
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:48.280]   That's where they're making all their money right
[02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:52.840]   Processor in the Samsung galaxy s8 the snap dragon 835 an arm
[02:10:52.840 --> 02:11:02.840]   Chip is designed for not just phones, but data centers microsoft. Yeah, it's rumored will release its first arm based pc in the fourth quarter
[02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:05.640]   Qualcomm which makes arm chips says that
[02:11:05.640 --> 02:11:07.400]   um
[02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:12.760]   I the arm thing is a slow power want to be in the data center, but it's fast
[02:11:12.760 --> 02:11:17.720]   I don't know is it leo like what are you really going to do on that smart enough?
[02:11:18.360 --> 02:11:20.360]   Yeah, it's not smart enough to handle the
[02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:23.960]   Unless you want to show with that instead of that space that's it
[02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:29.000]   You don't think that's a desktop class processor or at least a server class processor inside this again
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:33.240]   Look down in front of your face at the $3,000 unit right now
[02:11:33.240 --> 02:11:40.200]   Down it's got intel i5 at least at least $1,000 of that is display
[02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:43.000]   Oh
[02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:49.000]   The real knock this is the surface studio the real knock on this is that it's a kind of crappy laptop grade
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:50.120]   Yeah
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:54.440]   CPU it's all about the the screen, but I don't mind. I love the screen. Don't you
[02:11:54.440 --> 02:12:01.480]   I do green is beautiful like we wish that wheel. Yeah, look at how much I can do this and something like that
[02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:03.560]   I can do I can do I don't wish you know
[02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:09.080]   I can smell here. I don't wish for an iMac that could do something like that. I wish for
[02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:17.320]   That could be a well a giant iPad that could be a second screen for a desktop maybe that sounds like a whole lot of not real power
[02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:24.280]   Are you kidding for an artist my point exactly on the arm though is that power is less important
[02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:29.240]   Uh as we I mean we're kind of I don't draw I do photography and videos. I need to be
[02:12:29.240 --> 02:12:31.800]   Power not
[02:12:31.800 --> 02:12:33.800]   We're not going much faster
[02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:41.800]   Well, the thing is it's not again, uh, I mean you make a great point in that it's not about like how speedy one single processes
[02:12:41.800 --> 02:12:43.000]   It's about
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:47.800]   You know averaging out multiple processes if you're working in video if you're working in animation
[02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:53.880]   You basically need a heavy duty graphics card like one of any video series there or their kuda tech or you know
[02:12:53.880 --> 02:13:00.040]   Multiple cores to help process and and pass out all of that information if you're doing high-end stuff
[02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:06.440]   Yeah, but that's it as apple is of clearly observed. That's a small part of the market almost an irrelevant part of the market
[02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:08.440]   They don't have a market
[02:13:08.440 --> 02:13:10.840]   then the pros
[02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:13.000]   Yeah, everyone
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:16.920]   Start serenity first
[02:13:16.920 --> 02:13:19.560]   Gonna say it's a small part of the market
[02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:24.200]   Um, but it is a vital part in a in a couple of significant ways
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:31.320]   One it's the the part that develops their applications. So they kind of they kind of need to support again
[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:34.920]   A good computer that supports multiple processing
[02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:39.800]   Two some of their again, maybe not the customers that are going to
[02:13:39.800 --> 02:13:45.480]   Flow off and cash for them, but the customers that are going to help innovate in the space
[02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:49.000]   Um from my graphic point is you from my health point of view
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:53.960]   They want to like I'm sure the people making fake sweat right the people who are
[02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:58.280]   Number-crunching the algorithm to to make this stuff in a lab
[02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:01.640]   They're not going to want to come to apple and be like, yeah
[02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:06.440]   We did uh, we used a high-end windows pc to do that because your your
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:08.840]   Bro isn't good enough
[02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:11.960]   They're using that resin right now or rising how people say it
[02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:15.720]   You're right. I feel it's what you're saying about art and you don't need that
[02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:17.720]   But I I need that so bad
[02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:23.240]   So ready if you if you came here and you started playing with Photoshop or
[02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:30.760]   You know a draw I mean this thing is mind-bogglingly good the pen is good the knob is
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:34.360]   I'm an apple lover. I want apple just to make one
[02:14:34.360 --> 02:14:39.400]   This is the only thing wrong with this is running windows and I you know what windows 10 is not that bad
[02:14:39.400 --> 02:14:41.480]   And I think people are going to go well
[02:14:41.480 --> 02:14:43.960]   You know, it's not I can live with windows 10
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:48.120]   So I gotta admit I really have to admit on the on the surface studio
[02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:52.040]   Like I went in and tried one because when I saw it announced I was like, oh my god
[02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:55.880]   This is like this is that computer that I've been watching what you said. I went in
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:15:00.600]   I well, so okay. I first thing I did was I picked up the pen and I started drawing stuff
[02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:05.240]   And I'm like, all right. This is like the the surface throw pro 3/4 pen. It's like it's not bad
[02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:10.600]   Um, I'm totally spoiled by the apple pencil because it's probably one of the best dialysis
[02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:14.440]   I've ever used and I think this is not quite as good. You're right two decades. No, it's not
[02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:19.000]   But it's still I mean it's still a very good stylus and I'm like, but it's beautiful screen and I'm okay
[02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:23.400]   And then I go I'm like the knob thing's day in school and I take the knob and I put it on the screen
[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:29.000]   and it immediately slides off in the microsoft store and slides across the floor and
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.960]   Like it's the battery case
[02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:39.800]   Somebody had been licking somebody had been licking your knob. It's not it's not oh god. I can't believe I said that
[02:15:39.800 --> 02:15:45.960]   It's because this sits very nicely. It's it stays on the thing. It doesn't slide. I use it
[02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:49.480]   And I'm much more angled positions. Oh, yeah, you don't want to have it like this
[02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:53.880]   Course it's gonna fall off, but that's not how you're supposed to use
[02:15:53.880 --> 02:15:57.960]   Right, it's not like that was a setup situation. You set that up
[02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:02.840]   To have this story. No, not intentionally at all
[02:16:02.840 --> 02:16:07.400]   I I want to like it just like I wanted to like the surface before the ipad pro came out
[02:16:07.400 --> 02:16:15.160]   It's like I I have wanted nothing more since I was about 13 than to have a portable computer that I could very easily like draw on
[02:16:15.320 --> 02:16:19.240]   And sketch on and then immediately take those concepts and put them into action
[02:16:19.240 --> 02:16:25.400]   You know, bring them either bring them back to my Mac or start something on you know on a portable computer and then bring it to a
[02:16:25.400 --> 02:16:31.720]   Desktop but like they're just really hadn't been like I don't know there. They're always like look what i'm doing
[02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:37.480]   Look what i'm doing here. I love this is awesome. I'm doing 3d models. I'm drawing a 3d model
[02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:43.480]   I'm making i'm making I can wrote look at what you're the wrong person to advertise anything right now
[02:16:43.640 --> 02:16:47.000]   Look at this. I love apple, but I just want more power. I I want
[02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:52.200]   Innovation I want new sexy stuff and I haven't had that since steve left and I just want I
[02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:57.880]   I want apple to be apple and they're not and when I see stuff like that from microsoft. I'm like, oh, she's so pretty
[02:16:57.880 --> 02:17:03.240]   This is sexy watch this watch this. I'm gonna draw a woman right now
[02:17:03.240 --> 02:17:09.000]   Look at that there she is. I just drew a woman. I am so good. This is I am an argument
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:12.120]   Please stickers on top of that. Yeah, in fact, they have a whole wet
[02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:15.320]   Other
[02:17:15.320 --> 02:17:21.800]   Face they have a whole website full of these miles. This is the paint 3d that came out with microsoft's
[02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:24.040]   creators
[02:17:24.040 --> 02:17:26.040]   edition and of course
[02:17:26.040 --> 02:17:32.760]   Pron nearby because I have you making you make will do that too. Well, yeah, but you this is this is a full pc
[02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:34.840]   This says I mean this is not an eye pad
[02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:37.240]   7 inches, you know, look i'm
[02:17:37.240 --> 02:17:42.440]   Well, yeah, but you know, you know, it's like I put an alien in my project. Look at that and now he's waving
[02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:44.920]   He's waving at the lady
[02:17:44.920 --> 02:17:48.760]   You're not helping this argument leo what talk isn't this good
[02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:59.400]   Well, man, welcome to my cube planet. Look at that. Anyway, um, so microsoft's having an event may second
[02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:02.360]   It's an education event at least according to the invitation
[02:18:02.680 --> 02:18:09.000]   But what they are probably going to announce it's been leaked out now is the new windows cloud version
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.480]   Which is their attempt to get back in schools?
[02:18:11.480 --> 02:18:16.200]   Uh, which they've been losing ground to the chrome books so they'll be inexpensive
[02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:21.800]   I hope they're not netbooks but inexpensive computers and I think that with the creators edition
[02:18:21.800 --> 02:18:25.720]   uh and with the just came out and uh
[02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:32.440]   You know the push towards holographic. They're really interested in getting kids doing 3d design
[02:18:32.920 --> 02:18:34.920]   I think that they have a very I think
[02:18:34.920 --> 02:18:40.920]   Forward-looking point of view about what they're going to do with their hardware. I I um, I wouldn't write rule them out
[02:18:40.920 --> 02:18:45.720]   Just yet and I think this is an excellent drawing and you guys suck so they're
[02:18:45.720 --> 02:18:49.400]   Mocking my drawing
[02:18:49.400 --> 02:18:54.840]   No speaking of the cloud. I think microsoft knows the microsoft cloud
[02:18:54.840 --> 02:18:59.960]   They're gonna somehow use cloud with this laptop to try to get to the chrome book kind of thing
[02:18:59.960 --> 02:19:02.520]   It's a chrome book. I think yeah windows chrome
[02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:08.520]   What kind of thing but but to get back to the cloud though that that is we were talking a little bit about gpu
[02:19:08.520 --> 02:19:11.800]   Sorry, we're talking about cpu and arm versus
[02:19:11.800 --> 02:19:22.520]   Intel, but the gpu is part of it as well, right? This is where intel and gpu's and those kinds of things are the reason that
[02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:27.560]   That arm just is not going to compete and isn't yet anyway
[02:19:27.880 --> 02:19:34.520]   Competing in in the server room the demand for all that stuff to run all this cloud stuff is huge
[02:19:34.520 --> 02:19:39.960]   And the compute the demand for compute power to run big data to run what's going to be you know
[02:19:39.960 --> 02:19:45.960]   Things like this, you know cloud computer that that windows is going to do the windows light version
[02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:49.880]   I still don't have a whole lot of confidence that they can make this thing
[02:19:49.880 --> 02:19:52.360]   um as as lean and
[02:19:53.240 --> 02:19:59.000]   Minimal as a as a chrome book, but we'll see it's just not a core competency of microsoft to be lean and minimal
[02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:00.200]   um
[02:20:00.200 --> 02:20:05.240]   And so we'll see but I think where microsoft is doing really well and they have a lot of
[02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:11.960]   uh mojo is in cloud, you know with azure when I was there last year in february
[02:20:11.960 --> 02:20:18.920]   Um, I spent a few days it with me in meetings at microsoft and not one person the whole time
[02:20:18.920 --> 02:20:24.760]   I was there said the word windows not one person and this this really weirded me out because that's
[02:20:24.760 --> 02:20:31.000]   They're all always all about windows everywhere and that was the cash cow and everything went back to that
[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:37.720]   But I heard azure more times that I could count on two hands right that was all that they wanted to talk about
[02:20:37.720 --> 02:20:42.760]   They've really and smartly hitched their wagon to the club to that
[02:20:42.760 --> 02:20:48.360]   I think that's where all the rnd's going. I think that's where all of their internal goals
[02:20:48.600 --> 02:20:53.640]   um are about and they really are are putting all of their um,
[02:20:53.640 --> 02:20:58.040]   You know their chips there and and that's really smart because the windows brand
[02:20:58.040 --> 02:21:05.320]   I I think is still a bit tarnished from all of the years of you know security issues and malware and
[02:21:05.320 --> 02:21:07.720]   um and also the the bugginess of
[02:21:07.720 --> 02:21:13.960]   Of different things as well as the failure of vista the failure of windows eight windows tends much better
[02:21:13.960 --> 02:21:16.280]   But you know the world
[02:21:16.920 --> 02:21:18.920]   The world runs on windows
[02:21:18.920 --> 02:21:21.240]   It does but it's one of those
[02:21:21.240 --> 02:21:25.800]   It's one of those things that it lessened it's it is less and less
[02:21:25.800 --> 02:21:34.040]   relevant or important or maybe not relevant but central to um, you know business computing every day computing
[02:21:34.040 --> 02:21:39.960]   You know every day's people's computing that used to be I think microsoft is increasingly okay with that
[02:21:39.960 --> 02:21:45.240]   Um, and they've smartly said we're about sort of the back end. We're about cloud
[02:21:45.320 --> 02:21:51.480]   We're about also apps which is still front end but and we'll run our apps everywhere on our platform as well as others
[02:21:51.480 --> 02:21:54.360]   And they are kind of winning with that strategy
[02:21:54.360 --> 02:22:01.160]   um, and that's a much smarter much different mark microsoft than the one we we've seen in the past
[02:22:01.160 --> 02:22:07.000]   Um, but that does make me wonder about the the whole this their their chrome book competitor
[02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.480]   Can they really deliver something?
[02:22:09.480 --> 02:22:12.440]   You know useful and interesting with that it'll be interesting to see well
[02:22:12.680 --> 02:22:15.320]   I just want you to know that in the time you've been talking I
[02:22:15.320 --> 02:22:19.560]   Put a cookie in the aliens hand and a clock on the wall
[02:22:19.560 --> 02:22:23.320]   And now I can enter the scene. It's a 3d scene
[02:22:23.320 --> 02:22:25.800]   Can we pull up serenity's a little graphic
[02:22:25.800 --> 02:22:29.720]   She made all right. I'm not an artist. I'm not an artist
[02:22:29.720 --> 02:22:34.520]   Can we pull that up and would you you look like I said you're killing my argument
[02:22:34.520 --> 02:22:40.040]   I had her on my team and then you start with these alien cookies. Look what look what leo can do
[02:22:40.760 --> 02:22:44.280]   Look what leo can do. I mean this is pretty impressive
[02:22:44.280 --> 02:22:50.680]   That's all it is purple scovel. Look. I just put a little a little uh silver chipmunk in it too
[02:22:50.680 --> 02:22:53.720]   Oh my gosh. Look at that. So make him start singing
[02:22:53.720 --> 02:22:59.400]   And you know god he's red and no look at this clock is so realistic it even has a battery on the back
[02:22:59.400 --> 02:23:04.280]   I mean this is this is this is look at shine of the green from the alien on the silver chip
[02:23:04.280 --> 02:23:06.280]   Uh-huh
[02:23:06.280 --> 02:23:10.360]   Uh, yeah move away is there green on it anymore. Yeah, there is but anyway, yeah
[02:23:10.760 --> 02:23:13.400]   Don't don't don't pay too much attention to that. That's okay
[02:23:13.400 --> 02:23:18.360]   Mess it up. Why did you move it? I had a good thing going again. You just can you do this?
[02:23:18.360 --> 02:23:20.040]   Whoo
[02:23:20.040 --> 02:23:22.680]   All right. Yeah, but I can do it with my hands
[02:23:22.680 --> 02:23:25.960]   I can do it with my hands. You think I can't do it with the hands
[02:23:25.960 --> 02:23:29.560]   I can do it with the hands and everything I could do with this is a touch screen. I can do it
[02:23:29.560 --> 02:23:31.560]   It's even easier with my hands
[02:23:31.560 --> 02:23:34.760]   There's there's like because this is a complex
[02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:40.040]   Oh no, what happened three D complex. Yeah complex
[02:23:40.040 --> 02:23:45.320]   Something else changed the subject. Can we look at this in a second life? Can we share this in second life?
[02:23:45.320 --> 02:23:49.800]   This is my second life chip monk. Anyway, I don't know what explains so much. I you know
[02:23:49.800 --> 02:23:51.880]   Thank you very much. You guys are great
[02:23:51.880 --> 02:23:56.200]   Uh, I was going to mention steve bombers new website, but nobody cares
[02:23:56.200 --> 02:23:58.360]   Uh, so
[02:23:58.360 --> 02:23:59.720]   USA facts
[02:23:59.720 --> 02:24:00.280]   Dot org
[02:24:00.280 --> 02:24:02.200]   Actually, no, I I clicked on this
[02:24:02.200 --> 02:24:05.080]   Uh, what on friday? I was really impressed by this
[02:24:05.080 --> 02:24:07.400]   It was there was some really interesting statistics
[02:24:07.400 --> 02:24:09.880]   And I'm not I'm a big numbers geek for roller derby
[02:24:09.880 --> 02:24:11.640]   But not really outside of that
[02:24:11.640 --> 02:24:15.960]   And this was a good excuse to kind of dive back into statistics and I don't know
[02:24:15.960 --> 02:24:19.880]   I'm glad somebody's doing this. I think it's a I think it's worthwhile to have
[02:24:19.880 --> 02:24:22.280]   numbers and facts
[02:24:22.280 --> 02:24:26.280]   Available to people that aren't you know powered by a lot of this term
[02:24:26.280 --> 02:24:31.080]   Well, god knows steves got the money. Uh, he's been putting uh, this has been a secret project
[02:24:31.080 --> 02:24:34.200]   He's been putting money into you thought he was just running the la clippers
[02:24:34.200 --> 02:24:39.000]   He's got other stuff going on actually you're right serenity. I shouldn't mock it because it is kind of cool
[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:43.400]   Um, it is uh, USA facts dot org. You can browse it
[02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:50.920]   It's it's basically everything you would like to know about federal state and local government from 70 different sources
[02:24:50.920 --> 02:24:57.800]   Um, and it's all visualized and uh, yeah, I mean it's this is kind of for people who want this kind of thing
[02:24:57.800 --> 02:24:59.800]   You know clearly you could see steve bomber
[02:25:00.200 --> 02:25:04.680]   And his heritage here. He's a numbers guy, right? He wants to see the spreadsheet. He wants to see the so
[02:25:04.680 --> 02:25:10.840]   You know, that's kind of what this is, but it is interactive. It allows you to explore it. I think it's kind of fun
[02:25:10.840 --> 02:25:16.360]   So, you know, it's uh, it was really fun. So yeah, if you pull up, I think it's um
[02:25:16.360 --> 02:25:17.960]   uh,
[02:25:17.960 --> 02:25:19.560]   births
[02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:21.240]   deaths and um
[02:25:21.240 --> 02:25:27.560]   And population there are some really there are some fun spikes where it's like deaths goes way up
[02:25:28.040 --> 02:25:32.760]   Every time there's a war birth also goes way up in the next year
[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:37.080]   Every time there's a wall. It's called homey is stasis. It's uh, we're all we're trying to be
[02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:44.200]   We're trying to be this is kind of cool. So you can add I can add more lines to this and that's neat. That's really cool
[02:25:44.200 --> 02:25:48.440]   You know, it's kind it's a little wolf from alpha e maybe but um
[02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:53.800]   You know is that good or bad? No, I like wolf from alpha, but it's one of those things
[02:25:55.160 --> 02:26:01.480]   Go ahead. Not as nerdy. It's not as nerdy as wolf from alpha. Like it's it's nerdy from a perspective of there are a lot of numbers
[02:26:01.480 --> 02:26:08.680]   But I think usafax is doing it in a way that's very clear for the average person to understand without trying to
[02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:13.320]   Uh like push too much meaning on what it is. It's basically just giving you
[02:26:13.320 --> 02:26:17.560]   This is the date. This is the you know, this is what's going on
[02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:24.440]   And here are the factors that you can control and then you can go as as nerdy or as like base level as you want
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000]   interesting. Yeah
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.640]   Yeah, USA

[02:27:51.800 --> 02:27:55.560]   We had a tournament this weekend in in good old road islands
[02:27:55.560 --> 02:28:02.040]   We won our game against carolina on saturday and we unfortunately lost to dc today
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:05.160]   But it was a hard thought. I actually hear I have a
[02:28:05.160 --> 02:28:09.880]   I actually have a clip reel of myself that I finally made this is not from this tournament
[02:28:09.880 --> 02:28:12.920]   This is from our tournament in dallas, but I just sent it via the pasted
[02:28:12.920 --> 02:28:17.800]   Yeah, the skype chat. Oh, don't do it by a skype chat pasted into the uh, giggle doc. I don't have access to the skype
