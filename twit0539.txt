[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.600]   it's not the best people in the business just my favorite people in the business. Let's just
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.160]   let's be honest about it. People like Jason Snell. Actually can we be both Leo?
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.600]   Be both. But I don't I want to make it clear I don't choose you because of your esteemed
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.920]   position as the editor in chief of six colors dot com former editorial director at IG I
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.160]   choose you because I like you. I appreciate it. Yeah same thing with Katie Benner sure
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.760]   she's at the nation's paper of record the New York Times but she's also just a great
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.200]   person. Oh thank Katie nice to see you. Nice to see you Jason I heard a rumor he was actually
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.840]   choosing you based on your looks so well he's right. I can categorically deny these rumors.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.000]   I am in love with Jason Snell. Will Harris is here I'm I pick him just because he has
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.720]   only one L in his will. And to provide some transatlantic perspective once again it's good
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.400]   to be back Leo. It's been ages from Will's now head of digital at Condon asked Britain.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.200]   This is the fourth job will has held since he started bearing up to it. This shows you
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.040]   how long we've been doing. That's more it's more really a reflection on the amount of time
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:30.360]   we've been doing it anyway great to have you all here. Especially nice because we can talk
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:38.360]   about tech. The Toy Store instead of talking about guns and depressing sad stories of
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.000]   which there are an ample supply. Sometimes I kind of appreciate that I'm not a general
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.440]   reporter covering day to day news but we only cover the fun stuff the Toy Store. Nevertheless
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:04:00.000]   our hearts and prayers go out to people in San Bernardino a terrible tragedy there just
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:09.360]   on the heels of Paris. Seems an ever ending saga. You're using an iPad pro see see how
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.440]   that shows you up immediately. There's a giant iPad. It's a freakishly large iPad.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.880]   It is it's like those giant checks that give to people who win the lottery. It feels like
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.680]   a tea tray. Yeah it is. It's a demo. It's like a clipboard actually when you carry it.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.240]   It's like you're carrying a clipboard. And you have opted not to go with the also massive
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.320]   Logitech creative keyboard but I see you're using the Apple kind of slender keyboard.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.560]   Today I am. I thought it would be nicer on camera. It's more portable. Although honestly
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.760]   I'm really liking I still have my old Apple Bluetooth keyboard and the in case origami
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.040]   which is a little thing that folds out. You need to stand. Yeah. And I like it better because
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:54.040]   it's a regular old mechanical keyboard as opposed to this kind of strange keyboard. No pencil
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.760]   today. No pencil today. I left it at home. Is it behind my ear? No. I left it at home.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.200]   It really bugs me that Apple provided no affordance for storing that pencil in any
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.200]   way. Not a clip you could put in your pocket not a magnet you could put on the side. Yeah.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.600]   You know I mean I think this is this is the surface book and it has a nice magnetic you
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.840]   could I mean it's just good strong magnet that penny is not going anywhere. And I kind
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.640]   of like that. It just seems like a sensible thing. By the way this is hot which means
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.680]   it is still prey to the problem Microsoft has identified but not fixed they say not till
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:35.240]   next year of just kind of randomly being on. Well you know. And people report yeah I put
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.680]   the surface book in my backpack and it got really really hot and the battery died because
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.720]   it never really kind of it the screens off but it never just that used to happen to my
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.800]   Mac Pro all the time a few years ago. Things are hard. Our management is tricky. Microsoft
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.200]   says it's really Intel's fault the new sky this is one of the first Skylake machines
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:03.160]   who snorted blame Intel. No no no no no no no no long tradition between Microsoft and Intel
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.120]   if I can never forget interviewing Andy Grove remember him when he was the CEO of Intel
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.760]   and he said it's all Microsoft's fault. We make great 64 bit chips and they keep giving
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:18.880]   us these crap operating systems. So it's never ending. So never ending sideways. Andy Grove.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:26.320]   I loved Andy Grove. Whatever happened to him. He was a great story. He he would he was
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.520]   a Hungarian refugee who tells the story of crawling on his through a minefield and barbed
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:38.560]   wire to get out of Hungary in the 50s when of course it was still a Soviet satellite crawling
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:44.440]   through a minefield to get out of Hungary came the United States. There's you know not
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.560]   to get political but there's so many great stories of people who emigrated here and and
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.120]   really made a difference in the United States. One of my friends at Illinois school his parents
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.560]   were Hungarian immigrants same same story one of them fled when the revolution failed.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:04.640]   Yeah if you haven't read any of Andy Grove's books they are all pretty phenomenal great
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:10.040]   books on management and great books on you know how he built you know one of the most
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.400]   important companies of the 20th century and easy to read as well definitely worth picking
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.400]   up. Only the paranoid survive was that one of them something like that. Only the paranoid
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.320]   survive was a good one. Yeah. And then the other one is about leadership and I can't
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:28.400]   think of what it's called now but it's it's a really good lead read. Katie did you get your
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:35.160]   phone back yet? Oh no. So eBay is still trying to figure it out. What had happened is my
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.280]   phone was stolen and somebody bought it on eBay and very kindly called me and said I
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.320]   have it. How do they know was yours? Was your stuff still on it? No I had a lock screen
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.800]   so I had a brick the phone and it said please call this number if you find the phone so
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:53.560]   I get this call yesterday such a nice person and we said okay well let's figure out if
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.920]   you get your money back first because that's the most important thing at this point and
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.240]   then we'll figure out a way to get back to my work phones property the New York Times
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:06.600]   and then eBay they called the seller to let the seller know the buyer. The seller you
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:12.720]   mean the guy who stole your phone? The seller immediately messaged the buyer of the phone
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.480]   and was like I'll give you your money back just send the phone back to me don't report
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.320]   it. I know. Totally insane. Totally insane. So I did reach out to eBay and I said hey
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:26.160]   how do we get this taken care of so this nice honest person gets his money back and I can
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.920]   return this phone which is now broken also he was also told a broken phone get this broken
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:37.360]   phone back to my office and I haven't figured it out yet. A little note to crooks who watched
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:43.040]   to it I know there's lots of you. Don't steal iPhones you can't do anything with them.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:48.240]   I know. You have something about eBay to unsuspecting people. They have a kill switch right? Yeah.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:54.160]   You couldn't get rid of Katie Benner's lock screen could you? No. He tried to break it.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.960]   I bet he was broken. It was like in Zoolander where they're like the files are in the computer
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:05.000]   and they start shaking the computer. I just break this screen. I don't like it Katie out
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.720]   of this phone. There's got to be away. Yeah I heard that one of the reasons they ask
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:15.080]   for you to when you take our phone to be fixed at the Apple store they ask you to unlock
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.120]   it and turn off find my iPhone one of the reasons they want to do that is they want
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.160]   to verify that it's your phone and you have the password to it. Because that would be
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.880]   a way around right like oh it doesn't work get me a new one and then you got it.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.360]   Because Apple has no way of unlocking that. I always thought that really weird but I guess
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.360]   that's I guess that's why. And you can't turn on find my iPhone unless you have a password.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:39.800]   Yeah right. Your Apple account. It may also be because Apple isn't that great at dealing
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:44.720]   with phones that haven't been properly logged out and keeps them around as kind of ghosts.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.640]   But that's my understanding is that it may be in part because they want to verify that
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:55.480]   you actually own that device. So what's the latest from eBay they they they say you what
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.600]   are they telling you. They're working it out. I think that originally they gave originally
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.640]   they gave the buyer who was really trying to do the right thing when he went to them
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:09.040]   because he's not a reporter when he went to them he got well if this hasn't been reported
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:14.680]   to the police and it doesn't show up on check mend.com which is a phone verification website
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:20.040]   that I can't imagine many people are using. They don't have to show up there's no way
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:24.320]   to prove it was stolen and it's just you got to send it back to the seller and get your
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:30.480]   money back from him and work it out with him. This guy is like a thief possibly. And of
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.520]   course the gentleman didn't want to send it back to the seller. He thought that was wrong.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.800]   So he he got back in touch with me and let me know what was going on. I said you know
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:44.320]   what we'll figure it out. He got an honest guy. Money back. Yeah he's really honest.
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:49.600]   He's a nice person. How much did he pay? He paid a hundred dollars. Yeah. Yeah. And
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.840]   he fixes iPhone screen. So when in the description it said that the screen was cracked he thought
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.760]   oh that's no big deal. I can fix that and then I'll have a working phone. He was buying
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:03.520]   it for a friend's mother for Christmas because she didn't have a smartphone. But he's a nice
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:08.960]   person. Everybody's nice in this except for the thief. I know. And who is he be favoring?
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:17.720]   The thief. Well they're still working it out. So we'll see. Interesting story. You think
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:22.200]   with you know your clout and I know you've brought this to Twitter so it's in public
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.480]   that they would respond more quickly. But they're being quick. I just don't really
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.320]   know. I don't know. I don't want to criticize him too harshly. So we figured it out. Okay.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:42.240]   So as we were talking I was we should talk a little Apple news Samsung says we're going
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:49.000]   to pay the the amount that the court has dinged us for in the patent dispute. And it's not
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.200]   the full amount. Is it Katie five hundred forty eight million? Wasn't it over a billion
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:57.720]   originally? Originally but a lot of the a lot of the pieces of the case were dismissed
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:02.040]   or things that relevant. So the number got whittled down and whittled down. I love this
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:07.320]   story so much. I really want like Tim Cook and Phil Schiller to be photographed outside
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:13.760]   Apple HQ holding like one of those big checks. They can put it on a iPad at pro. So the way
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:18.080]   I view this is that it's going to be Samsung's going to play it pay entirely in coins. Wasn't
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:22.480]   that the rumor they're going to bring it all in. I bought a dump truck and nickels and
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:27.880]   then Apple give him back some Apple store credit just to be as passive aggressive. So
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:36.560]   Samsung says we'll pay it but we also want to be able to get it back if the judgment is
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:42.440]   reverse modified vacated or set aside on appeal which I think doesn't seem unfair but
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.680]   I guess that's not how these things work. And it's also sort of setting the company up
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.880]   for bringing the case somewhere else. And when you think what else could they possibly
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:55.520]   bring it one of those places is the Supreme Court which they nod to in their statement
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:01.800]   as well. So I think that we can probably expect some sort of move on Samsung's part
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:08.520]   to bring this case before the Supreme Court. Wow. Samsung's called the amount Apple's grossly
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:14.280]   examiner exaggerated damages claim. And frankly it is because it'd be pretty hard to prove
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:19.520]   that Apple lost half a billion dollars in iPhone sales because of Samsung's crappy
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:25.560]   copies. And it was the first Samsung phones that looked admittedly were copied from the
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:30.360]   iPhone but I doubt that it cost Apple half a billion dollars in damages.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:35.320]   Well it got Apple. I mean it got Android in the game right. So even if that generation
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.160]   of phones didn't sell very well it was the generation of phones that proved Android could
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:44.240]   make something that was even vaguely comparable which then set the market up to go forward
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.800]   I think if you were Steve Jobs you'd probably be thinking that half a billion was an absolute
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:54.640]   steal right. Well yeah Apple wanted to win a half billion and the original lawsuit they
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:59.640]   said it'll be two and a half billion. Please. I don't know how much of that is damages and
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:04.000]   how much of that is statutory. Probably mostly damages right Katie?
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.240]   Yeah and there were some things that were also dropped as well like to other people's
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:12.920]   points things like pinch to zoom Apple just really you know that that pattern they said
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:18.320]   that's just not something that you can say really was just yours. So slide to unlock
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:23.160]   was another one right. Exactly. Exactly. So it'll be interesting to see what happens
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:29.000]   is these companies continue to drag out what is a drop in the bucket in terms of money
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.200]   for both of them. Yeah well certainly for Apple also Samsung's phone sales haven't been
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:39.640]   great of late. It might be that like I can't say they need the money they still make bulldozers
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:48.760]   and refrigerators and chips and chips. All money. But hey even even for a giant caratsu it's
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:54.320]   a half a billion is not insignificant. Isn't that a waste of it all of our time and all
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.880]   the time and money to do this whole thing. What is the cost the court costs? What are
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:04.720]   the costs that we the people are paying for this and I think it was became very clear
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:09.960]   and in fact I have to say Tim Cook has kind of toned this war down considerably but it
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:15.480]   was clear there was some cost to Apple and just in the discovery phase in the revelations
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.880]   about how Apple works that they really didn't want people to know. I think that that's a
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:23.000]   bigger cost in some ways to Apple. Yeah I agree. You know this was Steve Jobs being
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.280]   angry and I think maybe rightfully so about feeling like they got ripped off by Samsung
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.440]   and that Samsung was building their business on something that was a rip off of an Apple
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:36.600]   product. I think that's all true but to go nuclear as he said and do this there are
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:42.240]   no winners here. Absolutely and you shouldn't let a motion like that run a business that's
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:47.200]   a risky although gosh you can't knock anything Steve Jobs did he certainly whatever he did
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.560]   it worked. I don't think he's. I think letting a motion run the business was the Steve Jobs
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:56.240]   motto. Yeah you got to take the good with the bad there but this I would put this in the
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.120]   bad column where he's got to vendetta against them and it's not necessarily going to do
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.800]   anything good for Apple but he feels like you know he felt it was right to do this so
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:08.760]   they did it. Kudos for Apple to Apple they open source Swift they said they would when
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.880]   they announced Swift Swift is a new programming language Apple designed initially for writing
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:20.640]   software for Mac and Tasha's and iOS but they have now literally I mean quite literally
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:25.360]   open sourced it and that means it's a good week for open source right because Microsoft
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:30.280]   has just done the same thing with with the edge engine. Yes the browser engine it's
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:35.320]   called what is it Karma what is the name of the browser engine I cat man do it'll come
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:43.200]   to me. It's interesting how my brain works it's it's with a K so Swift already we've seen
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:48.160]   it's on GitHub we've already seen I think a Linux implementation in fact I found a really
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:54.360]   cool site. You see the playground at IBM yeah IBM is doing a swift sandbox they already
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:58.960]   have it up and running so you can go to IBM Swift sandbox and literally type in Swift
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:05.360]   code online and see the output. Yeah it all runs you know it's running on the server and
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:10.760]   you can put the Swift code in there and it's a pretty cool idea you know whether it spreads
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:15.800]   far and wide or not it is a it's a nice gesture by Apple to to make it open source.
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.920]   You know one of the things that's really great about Swift is not part yet of this and that's
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:24.720]   the playground. The playground is a great teaching tool as we get this is the week of code of
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:29.080]   course the hour of codes this week code org trying to get kids all over the world not
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:34.760]   just the US to spend at least an hour learning the code and Swift is really great for that
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.840]   because of this playground which gives you an opportunity to kind of like this see your
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:44.160]   code run and mess around with it in a graphical way. And the way Swift is structured my understanding
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.920]   I'm not a programmer my understanding is that it's actually pretty good for education because
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:54.400]   kids can get going fairly quickly and see the effects of small changes in their code.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.320]   Exactly. Without a lot of the code overhead that's required for some more complex languages
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:03.640]   they're more familiar. And of course it would be great for Apple if more people were coding
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:10.920]   in what will be I think it's it's official language. There's issues with Objective C we
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.840]   talked about this on security now and I've never really verified it maybe maybe you could
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:23.160]   ask your developer friends. Steve Gibson says one of the problems with security on iOS comes
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:30.200]   down to Objective C and the way it resolves a function names it's possible to hide access
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:35.040]   to internal functions to non published functions in an app because you don't have to call them
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:39.640]   by name you can hash the name and Objective C there's no way to turn that off it's just
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:44.880]   part of how it resolves function names he says it's a it's a we've already seen an exploit
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:48.200]   based on that he says that's not going to be the end of it there's going to be a lot
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.640]   more so maybe Apple knowing this is anxious to move off of Objective C.
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:57.400]   Objective C I mean this goes back to the next days this is the reason Objective C is the
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:02.080]   development tool of choice for iOS and OS 10 is because it was the development tool of
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:06.600]   choice the programming language of choice for next step back in the day and when OS 10
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:11.920]   came out they there was a long progression but pretty much now you need to use Xcode
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:18.120]   and you basically need to use Objective C and Swift is the you know eventual replacement
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:22.920]   and is simpler and is higher level and has a lot of features that just weren't you know
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.680]   weren't there or weren't available or weren't practical when next step was being worked
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:31.200]   on but it was a long time ago so you know in the background they worked for whatever
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.960]   five years something like that on Swift and and you know what I hear from developers is
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:40.440]   that for certain tasks it is fantastic but it's also new and it's still growing and
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.080]   they're still making changes they did a 2.0 version of the language spec that actually
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:48.400]   sort of changed some of the rules which on one level if you learn to write in Swift and
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.520]   then they changed the rules that's scary but on the level it shows that they're listening
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:56.640]   and they want to progress the language and not just sort of say oh well we made a mistake
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.840]   we can never go back which would be they were very clear about that one swift 1.0 came out
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:05.720]   this is an unfinished language it will change and it has Swift 2.0 is current every seems
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:09.320]   like though there's also boasting rights every company has to have its own language you know
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:14.840]   Microsoft's got C sharp apples got swift Google's got go Yahoo's got Brooklyn ease I
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:21.560]   don't know what Yahoo's got they got nothing forget about it I want to I want to talk about
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:26.800]   what's going on at Yahoo because that's an interesting story also the grand unified theory
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:35.160]   of Apple products and John Gruber in a surprising breach of his relationship with Apple calls
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:46.760]   says the Mac App Store is rotting rotting wow is that what that smell was wow I get a fun
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:52.280]   I get a fun panel here it's gonna be fun will Harris from London his new digs with fiber
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:59.480]   nice what time is it in London it's like midnight eleven thirty oh you muted yourself
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:05.600]   my friend yeah half past eleven half past eleven that hundred Mac feels pretty good for
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:11.520]   yeah very nice Katie Benner from New York City we knew she arrived because we heard the
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:17.360]   sirens oh no I'm in San Francisco you're in San Francisco I'm sorry New York Times I'm
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:23.520]   very literal well okay we have sirens here yes sirens everywhere yeah that's a this is
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:29.080]   a nice view I like the the wood window behind you and everything is very pretty yeah it's
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:35.120]   my non-working fireplace oh it's not a window it's a fireplace every San Francisco flat has
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:40.720]   to have a non-working fireplace exactly it's very quaint yes and on a rainy day in San Francisco
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:45.480]   we finally have winter yeah Jason Snell is also here the other season one of our two seasons
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:51.880]   that we have summer and winter our show today brought to you by those great folks at Citrix
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:57.920]   who may go to meeting the easiest most powerful way to meet with your coworkers and clients
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:04.720]   all around the world you don't want to have to travel you know more and more as we even
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:11.280]   for us as we work with people we work with people all over the world San Francisco London
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:17.040]   and meeting with people over the phone can be so dry and deadly but with go to meeting
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:23.400]   you can see the screen they can see your screen you could trade back and forth great for presentations
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:30.680]   you can see them with HD quality webcams and you can do that all on not just your computer
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:37.320]   but your tablet your smartphone you can even present from your iPad which is amazing that
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:42.480]   means you can sit out in the garden enjoy a beautiful day or the rain and boom it's also
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:47.120]   really easy to start a meeting you just you know send out an email they click a link even
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:52.040]   if they've never used go to meeting before they're up and running within seconds I love

[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:29.520]   know what to think of it but I thought with Jason Snell here we could we could talk about
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:37.800]   it this is from a Apple blog called above Avalon Neil cybert the grand unified theory
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:45.000]   of Apple products it's interesting he's parsing some things that Phil Schiller Apple's VP
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.600]   product marketing has talked about in an interview and sort of put it in line it's it's interesting
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:55.360]   to see you know with Apple sometimes you've got a you got to look at what their statements
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:00.040]   are and and try to divine from that what their what their Kremlin knowledge it is Kremlin
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:04.320]  ology we are reading the tea leaves here and in this case it's how they describe these
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:09.600]   individual products and it's an interesting way to look at it which is they sort of say
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:14.320]   the watches for things that you used to be able to do on the phone the phone is for things
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.080]   that you could do on the iPad the iPads for things you could do on a laptop the laptops
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:23.680]   for things you could do on the desktop desktop is for us to invent new things and that's
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:28.840]   literally what they seem to be saying I kind of make sense it all has this cascade this
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:35.200]   lateral flow and you know there's a nesting dolls yeah yeah like Bob what are the butroshka's
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:40.520]   but Truschka's it kind of makes sense because and you almost need this because you wonder
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:47.160]   well how does the watch fit into this overall scheme and I think there's some concern because
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:52.120]   apples don't remember when Steve Jobs came back to Apple the first thing he did was slash
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:57.240]   product lines he very famously went up to the whiteboard drew a big plus sign and said
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:03.560]   we're gonna have four quadrants business consumer portable desktop and that's it that's it anything
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:09.480]   that doesn't fit into that is gone and they killed many many product lines and always
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:14.800]   said the most important word in business is no remember what was this one of the one of
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.600]   the biographies were maybe Johnny I have I think he mentioned this in an interview he
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.520]   said every day Steve would come to me say how many times you say no today Johnny and
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:29.080]   he wanted to hear a big number well in in the four years since jobs passed away Apple
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:35.400]   has doubled the number of products from 12 to 24 and if you take in the various skews
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:42.600]   it's even more it's really gotten fairly complicated Neil points out that part of this is is just
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:48.600]   Apple's ability to manage a supply chain better ability to manufacture better but it's nice to
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:54.040]   hear that there's still a rationale maybe you don't have a quadrant but there's a rationale behind
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:59.800]   what is Apple's doing does this make sense to you I think so I mean again how much of this is
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:03.080]   is marketing and how much of this is what they think behind the scenes what what criminal
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:09.160]   knowledge is like to believe is that Apple statements to the public can be reverse engineered to be
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.920]   something about the understanding about how they run their business Seattle things and I think
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:17.800]   it's part of it but it's not it's not the whole picture what's that I'm gonna I think I'm quoting
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:22.280]   Doctor who here where I say that a footprint doesn't look like a boot right just because there's a
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:27.000]   footprint there it doesn't mean you know what boot the person was wearing and what the shape of the
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.560]   boot was and I think there's a little of that going on here but look this is the only information we
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:36.840]   have to their behavior and their statements to the to the press that we can use to understand sort
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:41.000]   of like what does Apple think their businesses and where are they going and and and why do they
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.480]   make the decisions they make and so that's why criminal analogy happens very important though I
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:52.840]   think to realize that Apple is incredibly savvy in how they present themselves there's I feel like
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:57.640]   there's no statement coming out of Apple that isn't with intent behind it that's one of the nice
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:04.280]   things about the this above Avalon piece is that when you parse what is said you can see that it is
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:08.840]   very disciplined you can see that every statement that Phil Schiller makes about every product is
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:14.200]   parallel with the others like they're so obviously there are there are lines and everybody knows
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:19.560]   what to say and what we know when they ask what who's the Apple Watch for they have an answer and
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:23.480]   it's going to be the same answer and they're very disciplined about that in fact again we talk
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:28.760]   about Steve Jobs and and how you you know when you have Steve Jobs you get what you get good and bad
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:33.480]   he was the most undisciplined person in some ways he would say all sorts of crazy stuff from time
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:38.680]   to time because he he was mad or because he wanted to and Tim Cook's Apple super disciplined
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.960]   well and you see how hard that is to do when you look at a company like Microsoft which will
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:47.720]   say contradictory things within five minutes of one another or Google same same thing it's a
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:53.080]   little easier to see a through line and everything Apple says and everything Apple makes one of the
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:58.040]   questions I still have and I think Neil addresses this in his post is the watch
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:06.120]   he says while we did have to reset expectations after the watch came out he says I continue to
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:13.400]   think the Apple Watch is being underestimated that people don't see it where it's headed now I'm
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:20.360]   wearing an Apple Watch but I've said myself it's a feels like a flop it feels like it didn't live
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:26.600]   up to its promise you know and it doesn't it's more complicated yeah there's another one
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:32.760]   Katie you have one oh look you we have the same one will look I'm not wearing mine right now
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:38.040]   but you want to be bothered by the alerts see see and of course Jason's wearing I got I am
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:43.160]   I so but we're not a good sample no we're not but at the same time we may also be not a good
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:47.400]   sample about whether it's a flop or not I mean it sounds like the sales figures are pretty good
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:51.560]   they are there maybe a million a month according to some analysts guess and so then it's about
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:56.520]   what your expectations are yeah I think it's so I think it's just so early right we have this
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:02.120]   vision that whenever my whenever Apple comes out with with anything it's going to be perfect from
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:08.360]   day one it's going to revolutionize our lives from day one and actually we have that idea here of it
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:14.120]   and it's never been the case like it doesn't never happen like when the iPhone came out it took years
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:18.920]   to revolutionize well they had the app store right when the iPad came out it was just like
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:24.600]   an iPhone you know you remember they had the thing where you could double the size of apps so
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:29.160]   you could use like apps that weren't out on iPad you could still use the iPhone versions I mean
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:34.200]   that was a horror show and yet we still sort of continue to think that Apple's going to release
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:39.640]   something that's going to be fully formed and perfect from day one I think this is you know
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:45.720]   much better than the iPad was on was on day one it's much better than the iPhone was on day one
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:50.680]   is it as good as the iPhone or the iPad on now absolutely not will it get there you know
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:57.080]   I'm absolutely convinced it well and I agree with with with the with the guys on the blog like I
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:02.840]   think it's completely underestimated you're very interesting too to see this in light of
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:07.720]   the comments that Angela Aron's made she was at the fast company festival in New York City
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.640]   and it's really one of the first times they put her out in public it was it's been very odd
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.480]   trying to figure out what it has I keep expecting her to show up on stage somewhere
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:22.840]   so she finally does and and in if you look and look at the context of well this is what all the
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:27.480]   different products are for and these are the kinds of people therefore her push was really more around
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:33.640]   productivity like how she wants to rearrange the stores by how we'll use the products or what
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:39.560]   use cases they can solve whether that's music or making music or videos or business tasks and
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:46.760]   how each product can somehow fit into our lives in in the way that we get up and work and live
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:51.080]   so something like the watch that feels very much to me like a product it just hasn't really found
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:55.880]   its use case yeah I mean how long is the iPad existed and only now are we seeing it being given
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:31:01.880]   a real business tool purpose with the accessories necessary and the size necessary for people who
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:07.480]   are architects or designers to really use the iPad and that's just happening now but I think that
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:12.120]   there's a chance that could be successful right so the watch is for us we had high expectations
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:18.200]   for it because we own a lot of Apple stuff and we wanted it to be as cool as our phones are
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:22.840]   but for somebody who doesn't own a lot of Apple products or is new to the company for them it will
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:27.480]   probably be a much more national process of oh I wonder what I can do with this in my daily life
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:31.800]   like maybe my watch is going to be the thing that I only use for business purposes because I like
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:36.600]   the way it reminds me for meetings every 20 minutes I'm never late again and that in and of itself is
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:43.480]   a wonderful tool that maybe somebody who is using their ad for music doesn't care about that for me
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:48.200]   has changed my life by the way I like I just always tell people the Apple watch makes me like
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:53.000]   a way more polite person because rather than checking my phone every 10 minutes when I'm in
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.640]   a meeting if I get a little tap on my wrist I know it's time to go and there's no need for me to be
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:02.280]   looking at anything else apart from the personal thing that I'm supposed to be doing it would be
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:06.680]   worth it it'd be worth it just for that in my view and I know that's like a really
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:11.000]   niche use case but actually that's a niche use case that a lot of people wouldn't appreciate
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   unless you ever actually tried it right and if you're if you're looking at life in the bigger
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.400]   context of okay what's productivity for me and what is business for me there's your use case for
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:24.920]   the watch say you're not that person say you're a physician maybe there's a use for the watch that's
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:29.000]   totally different from timekeeping or if you're an artist there might be a use for that's totally
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.360]   different and again it's just going to be a matter of those purposes coming together over time with
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:40.920]   experimentation and app developers creating tools that will like or we won't I'm open to that notion
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:47.320]   but I think like the iPad Pro the Apple Watch is a concept that's yes to be proven it's it's all
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:52.200]   potential and and actually I start mostly potentially mostly potentially I start wearing again well
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:58.040]   give you an example we flew to Vegas on Thursday and I thought coming home you know I really should
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:03.800]   put the boarding pass in my phone and then transfer it over to my watch and the only people are going
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:10.760]   to do this I think having done it now are people who are really kind of geeks who are dedicated to
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:15.880]   getting this thing working because it's not as convenient let's I'm be completely honest as going
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:20.120]   up to the kiosk printing out your boarding pass and carrying it you have to kind of fuss with it
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:23.800]   as you're walking up the line and make sure it's on the screen and then you and then you're
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:28.920]   on the watch and you have to and then you can't with this virgin america so you can't fit the watch
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:33.320]   on it right scanner so you're going against mobile boarding passes in general right it papers
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:37.960]   you just like you just said paper is easy it's just easy it works that's maybe it's not a phone
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:44.040]   diamond of the watch but I but I feel like many of the things that we go oh this is really great
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:50.520]   we say it's great because we're geek enough to devote the energy involved and to put up with the
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:56.920]   inconvenience involved and I don't think a normal person is gonna I feel like the potential is
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:02.120]   unrealized I really do I think I think you I think you're smoking crack Leo I think I'd like to be
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:10.200]   right now but I think I see people flying like at the like I'd fly a lot right for work and I do
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:15.960]   use electronic boarding passes yeah absolutely because you get you know if you have something
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:21.240]   like the the British Airways apple the virgin app that's integrated with past book you get a little
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:25.800]   reminder that says hey do you want to check in and you swipe and you and you and you check in online
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:29.880]   that says hey do you want to add this boarding pass to your to a past book and you go yeah sure
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.920]   and then as soon as you get to the airport it pops up on your screen and you're like okay it's
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:37.400]   right here on my screen as soon as I walk into the terminal and I see more and more and more and
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:41.240]   more people doing that you know what I'm queuing up for a domestic flight now or like a European
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:47.000]   flight I see you know at least maybe 20 percent of the people with mobile boarding passes
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.600]   on their phones I'll grant you that a lot of people use it and it's very annoying because
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:59.320]   I have a whole line but I think you know I don't think it's gonna be geeks the same thing with apple
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:04.120]   pay by the way they slow the whole line down they don't speed the line up my apple pay I am super
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:07.880]   speedy and I speed the line up and you know why because I pay use up a pay on my apple watch
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:14.040]   you go check out and I'm out of there all right yeah well I'm open to the idea but it's
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:20.760]   really right it's really katie about Angela's comments are exactly as you said Jason an
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:29.240]   alignment with this whole notion of the watch will grow into tasks that the phone does right now
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:35.720]   but you will find more useful on the watch my only come when I say flop I don't mean in sales
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:42.120]   flop I don't judge a new technology product by sales that's not I'm not in a business reporter
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:47.320]   I'm judging it by utility applicability to what purpose and it hasn't made itself
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:52.920]   indispensable to you far yeah and so I understand I'm also an individual case I'm not a universal
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:59.240]   case but I try to look at it with a kind of a universal mind it's fiddly there's there's there's
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:06.520]   there's touch there's a knob there's a button there's a the UI is complex maybe overly complex I
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:10.920]   feel that there and as Ken from Chicago said in our chatroom this is one of the first apple
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:15.320]   products we've seen he says they didn't have a cohesive story about how people would use it they
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:21.080]   just say here's some features you know they sprayed they sprayed use cases against the wall back last
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:26.600]   September yeah when they announced it and or two September's ago now and that that's absolutely
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:31.560]   true and and I think it's still finding its way I think you're right it's telling that for me the
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:36.840]   most compelling uses of it are the face itself and the notifications I get and Siri I just
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:41.560]   want the apps and the glances I just want to face for on all the time don't you it would be nice
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:46.920]   annoying I completely internalized that that little wrist flip but I'd rather I didn't have to do
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:52.200]   it sure no I think yeah that if the face was on all the time it would make life much easier and
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:58.520]   also if you could enable if you could enable the payment function without having to have the security
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:03.560]   code on it yeah because I hate that darn security code like that is just the stupidest thing in the
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:09.800]   world but if you have a you know a credit card synchronized to it you have to have it and it's
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:15.560]   like those are the two things that drive me absolutely nuts well one thing that drives me nuts with
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:21.720]   Apple is they they're their passion for security means they ask for passwords and codes far too often
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:29.320]   all the colors yeah and and you know I get your app store password typing and oh and this is with
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:34.360]   fingerprint I mean this is this is you know it's like what I gave you my fingerprint what more do you
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:43.800]   want not like I have Katie Benner's phone or something this is my phone I think that it's going to be
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:48.680]   interesting to see how this plays out I'm not like a big watch advocate because I don't use
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:54.360]   mine as much as a lot of people I know but it kind of reminds me of very early days of the PC
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:57.560]   where people would get these boxes to their houses and be like what the hell do I do it just
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:03.320]   things like I it wasn't until desktop publishing I think that people were like oh now I understand
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:09.320]   there's a real use case for this enormous ugly machine I keep lying around the house that all
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:14.680]   I've done is play games on so I think that the watch if it works out is going to be similar people
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:20.360]   it could be a while before we're like oh of course we're all going to pay for things for this watch
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:24.760]   like that's the best thing we can do with it I think you nailed it I think there's we're in the
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:31.720]   the the watch is in the checkbook balancing phase you know when you first got a PC all you really
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:37.800]   could oh you I'll balance my checkbook again and again because it didn't do anything and and so this
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:42.680]   is a product full of potential waiting so I'll be I mean I'm open-minded about that but I just feel
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:49.880]   as of as of today it's not particularly compelling product for those of us who have it you know we
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:56.360]   already paid for it so you know what gave one who is our 13 year old for his birthday a week he wears
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:03.480]   it every day loves it but this kind of a isn't it kind of a status a little bit like you know that's
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:07.720]   part of the game I think that's part of the I pod was back that's kind of true for every watch
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:12.200]   right I mean whether you know we often that's true the apple watch is being like this unique
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:16.920]   sort of thing and it's like never watches a status symbol whoever whoever wears it right you'd be
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:22.840]   the way I Rolex or a or a tag or an apple right or time it when I was 13 I had the Casio calculator
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:29.240]   watch and that sent a strong message no dates for the next several years I believe it was the
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:34.200]   message it sent oh my god I want that watch now do you still have it would you know it's long gone
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:40.120]   and I wish I wish that's the one that had a stylist right because the no no no this was just a
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:44.760]   little tiny buzz buttons that were very hard to press though that's true because there was a
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:49.160]   Casio or somebody that made a calculator watch that you had to have a stylist because the buttons
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:54.920]   were so small hey look 1599 on eBay that's a more recent and you know what no activation lock on
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:40:01.960]   this one I'm pretty sure they make one in gold really which one is yours is this one it's just
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:07.000]   this is all nostalgia purposes now that's 50 bucks but you know I'd wear that with pride
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.320]   can't look metallic it's got to be just black plastic black plastic which one did you have
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:15.880]   I don't know it was it was one of the old models I think it had the I think the buttons were
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:23.320]   were silver and it was a black face and it was a very sexy was super nerdy love that see that on
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:29.720]   the girls back at a dance you know you're a man yeah be sure to wear that status I'm just saying
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:38.360]   status all right Gruber Gruber's been strained off the reservation a lot lately he talks about
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:43.000]   the fact that sketch which is an app actually an inch an app that's been in the conversation a
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:49.400]   lot because Bohemian coding the folks who did it said that they were not going to do an iPad
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:54.600]   pro version of an app that would be great on the iPad Pro because they didn't feel like they could
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:41:00.360]   sell a $99 app on an iPad without a demo version or something you know Apple wasn't really helping
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:08.920]   them now they pull it from the Mac App Store because of a bunch of gripes about you know I mean
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:14.120]   there's issues about updating there was a certificate expiration problem that was a real
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:20.120]   issue with Apple they let their certificate expire and a lot of apps said hey you know I can't run
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:29.240]   anymore so so he says there's a lot of reasons why we're taking sketch from the Mac App Store
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:35.000]   App Review takes at least a week there are technical limitations imposed by the guidelines
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:41.400]   sandboxing and so on upgrade pricing unavailable that's a big issue for expensive apps if you spend
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:48.120]   if you buy Adobe Photoshop you don't want to pay a full price for an upgrade and Adobe does want
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:53.800]   to make some money on the upgrade then any event yeah it's this is a problem that's a problem with
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:59.800]   the iOS App Store too the the the differences are that Mac apps tend to be more professional and
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:06.520]   they tend to have bigger prices and what that leads to is issues about you know how do I charge
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:13.160]   for upgrades well you can't how do I give people a trial well you can't so you can restructure your
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:18.040]   app to be sort of freemium within an app purchase of some features people often say that when I say
[00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:23.320]   oh you you know sketch one of the ability to have a demo version why why can't we do freemium isn't
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:27.560]   that okay way to do it well I can you can build it that way but you've got to build it into your
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:31.640]   app and you've got to architect your app to have features that are behind and in that purchase
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:36.760]   and it gets complicated and on the Mac you can just bail out I mean that's the bottom line is the
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:41.160]   Mac App Store was seen as a place you wanted to be despite all of these limitations plus the
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:45.960]   technical like the sandboxing and security limitations and you like you would go through them because
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:49.160]   you needed to be there because it was going to be a rocket that you could strap yourself to and
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:53.160]   it would drive your app into the stratosphere and it would sell just like iOS apps sold and you'll
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:59.000]   be a millionaire and the fact is Mac App Store I mean all the anecdotes are people who rank in the
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.240]   top 10 with their app and then report that they didn't really make very much on it it looks like
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:08.440]   there's not a lot going on in most parts of the Mac App Store and so at that point why would you
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:14.840]   put in the money and time to build the Mac App Store version of your app when it's easier to just
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:20.360]   sell it yourself but the good news is you can do both it's not like we have right iOS you're stuck
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:24.840]   Gruber writes the Mac App Store should be designed to make developers happy it should make developing
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:31.080]   for the Mac better not worse than selling outside the App Store these are among the best apps on
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:35.240]   the platform from developers who've been loyal to Apple in the Mac for decades he's talking about
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:43.960]   bare bones BB edit panics coda quicken the Mac App Store is rotting at least for productivity
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:47.800]   software there's no other way to put it if this hasn't set off alarm bells within Apple
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:51.640]   something's very wrong we talked about this a lot on Mac break weekly there needs to be an
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:56.040]   App Store czar yeah he's absolutely right it feels like there's nobody paying attention to it it
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:02.440]   seems to have not been updated in ages the approval process is really delayed and yeah it just doesn't
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:06.040]   seem like it's a priority for Apple so why would you stay in it if you could avoid it is one thing
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:11.800]   that drives me crazy about Apple Google's prone to this too which is it feels like the the eye of
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:17.880]   Mordor they can only point one way at a time right and if and if they're looking here they're not
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:22.760]   looking there the remote app still hasn't been updated to work with a new Apple TV yep they didn't
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:27.080]   update it for three years and then they've again ignored it and it turns out there was one guy
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:32.840]   can't apples a big company it's the most valuable company in the world it's got huge amounts of
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:39.400]   cash under twenty billion dollars in the bank can't they have two eyes i'm curious is there is there
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:44.280]   the equivalent of a guy Kawasaki working there right now or somebody who's only job is to sort of
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:49.080]   cultivate this community of developers help them work with them make their life easier or did that
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:54.440]   just disappear altogether there's a whole developer relations team i think the problem is the
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:59.160]   impression i get is that the people who run the App Store are not the developer relations they're
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:05.320]   the iTunes team yeah and and this is one of those things where unless you get started on iTunes right
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:10.840]   i mean yeah come on talk about can you only point like you know can you only have an i in one
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:15.640]   direction can we can we please fix the one thing that everybody in the world uses to get all their
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:22.680]   media and make it not a complete horror show yeah there was a guy Michael Jurowitz who was
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:28.280]   their evangelist jury juries jury still there i thought he left to go to black pixel he did he
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:32.680]   came back oh he came back yeah i think jury still all right so he's kind of the guy right well he's
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:41.000]   one in in one area he's he's working on on oh it's tan i think but okay i forget where jury is now
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.560]   but yeah there are developers and develop and developer relations people and they talk all the
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:51.080]   time but the services in the back end and who's doing the promotions and doing the app approvals
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:56.040]   my understanding is that that's a different group and they seem to be or focused on i don't know what
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:01.400]   there are 30 music according to simply hired 32 openings for developer evangelists at apple right
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:06.040]   now apple is famously understaffed right they they're very slow to hire they're very slow to hire
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:12.840]   and they may you know they have valuable stock um i think we should all apply there's 32 jobs i
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:19.480]   could do it i think we should please Jason write your app for apple please please right go me right
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:25.560]   okay fine i give up fine i can do that all right enough apple we've done our apple segment
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:32.200]   let's talk about barbie in a moment hello barbie the nsa is listening half class is hard

[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:22.520]   a lot a lot of it has become sort of totally iconic now you sort of see it sort of british
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:26.680]   people sort of say that stuff in the office all the time because it's just such a oh good
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:34.040]   i mean possibly not ideal but you know i only saw in the loop he's in that right that's the movie
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:40.280]   version and then the the tv show that preceded the movie was the sick of it yeah yeah i don't know
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:45.400]   if i can see it here or not i might have to do it is unhooloo okay good oh my word go and start at
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:51.320]   the beginning and watch it all it is all brilliant it really is is it and he plays a cabinet minister
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:58.200]   no oppress secretary spin doctor spin doctor yeah so there's not a very big doctor to the doctor
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:04.200]   who yeah not very loosely based on a guy called alistair Campbell who was tony blares spin doctor
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:11.640]   for many years and was famously angry it's very very angry but i'm told the chatroom saying the
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:16.200]   last two episodes the closing two episodes i don't i okay i'm gonna confess something that's shameful
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:21.480]   i'm really not a doctor who fainter that's okay there's some of you out there but the
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:27.720]   the episode the episode before last was a it's essentially just peter capaldi oh nice he has
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:33.320]   99% of the spoken lines in the episode it's basically a one man show very good wow very good
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:39.160]   back me on this though will hearse isn't it wasn't it intended to be a children's show
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:46.520]   doctor who kind of originally was always that kind of slightly kind of like early evening it's
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:52.200]   a children's show but with kind of like themes for adults and i think it broadly kind of has the same
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:57:00.920]   kind of approach now um it's it's definitely kid kid appropriate if not kid friendly i would say
[00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:06.040]   unlike the thick of it leo i'm gonna i'm gonna say something now i have never seen an episode of
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:12.680]   doctor do in my life you have to hand in your passport now i'm sorry okay so will i've seen one
[00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:17.640]   and you'll be it was so god awful that i said i'm never watching this again
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:24.520]   it was something about dalex in a warehouse there were mannequins involved interesting
[00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:29.720]   terror of the mannequins it was the terror of the mannequins probably something like that i don't
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:35.240]   know it was somebody told me oh don't start at the beginning because it really is cheesy in the
[00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:40.280]   beginning so i started so many beginnings now well i know and it was he said this is the doctor
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:45.640]   who you want to see and i watched an episode and i thought okay not for me it might not be i have
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:51.160]   to hand in my geek card now we are excited about star wars does it open in the uk on the 18th
[00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:59.880]   oh it opens uh yeah the 18th so midnight on the 17th so just the 18th we're gonna be going
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:05.240]   we're gonna be going we're gonna we got 22 tickets i think we gave it a day before you guys oh you
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:11.160]   bastards yeah it's amazing and france gets to the day before us i was sort of contemplating going to
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:15.160]   going to france to go and watch it that's why god made the channel so you can get right over there
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:19.880]   and watch the movies you can get over there but it'd be in french with it i'm i'm worried i'll
[00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:23.560]   turn up and they'll have like french subtitles or something and i just hate it i'm like so i've
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:30.760]   got a i've got a five a.m. showing on thursday to go and see it wow on i'm x i can't wait
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:38.040]   ah that's the question how should one see it in 3d and i'm x well i'd rather not see it in 3d
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:42.200]   because i don't really like three i don't either but pretty much all the good theaters in london
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:47.480]   are sharing it in 3d so if you want to go to like a really crummy theater you can watch it in 2d but
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:54.440]   if you want a good theater you got to watch it in 3d oh that's a bummer yeah jason you're what are
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:59:00.360]   you doing uh on the thursday night so it opens on on a week from thursday right yeah and i've got
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:06.040]   tickets and down the road here and where i live in meringue county we have still have that one
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:12.520]   big single-screen movie theater that's showing it um i think it's alternating 2d 2d and 3d we may be
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:17.560]   seeing a 3d showing which is not my favorite but it's a nice huge single-screen movie theater so
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:21.960]   as as it was meant to be seen i think i don't think you should go to france to see it because i can't
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:25.720]   see darth vader i've translated darth vader into french
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:39.480]   doesn't doesn't have that how about no no no no it's just people not bad
[00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:52.040]   no not the same hello hackable barbie there's a new barbie that uh it's actually pretty cool
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:56.440]   comes from a company well it comes from a tell who makes barbie but they enlisted a company called
[00:59:56.440 --> 01:00:02.280]   toy talk we've interviewed the people at toy talk they're really really cool um they make a
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:07.320]   variety of toys ipad apps and so forth that uh children encouraged to talk to
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:13.560]   and it doesn't just stay with barbie it goes up to a server where it's analyzed and then
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:21.560]   barbie is told what to say in response apparently there's a little problem with hello bar now it
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:27.960]   has it's not out yet so there's time to fix this uh but uh the hello barbie
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:36.360]   blue box security analyzed it and there's apparently some issues with an internet connected doll
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:43.000]   vulnerabilities in the mobile app and cloud storage used by the doll i never thought i'd be
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.520]   saying that and to it vulnerabilities in the mobile app and cloud storage used by the doll
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:53.640]   could have allowed hackers to eavesdrop on children's intimate play sessions
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:01:01.320]   so they're going to fix it toy talk says all right they've they've showed us we've fixed many of the
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:07.160]   issues they've raised um the researchers say they told toy talk about this weeks ago the company
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:13.400]   has been very responsive good news but that's a concern you know you know you know a number of
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:18.760]   people have been kind of concerned in general about the privacy impact of hello barbie the way it works
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:26.040]   uh the child has the barbie presses a button on its stomach and talks to it and uh it's sent
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:31.080]   then to the internet where a server processes it and the doll responds with one of thousands of
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:37.240]   pre-recorded messages um so people are you know understanding that that's a little
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:41.880]   fact there was this a petition that said that that's creepy i don't know you find that creepy
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:46.200]   it's like serie basically it's a side of toy it's preparing a child for serie
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:54.280]   that's right my first intelligent assistant yes um and at toy talk uh the toy talk app actually is
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:02:02.120]   kind of cool let me see if they have it because they have on their website some samples uh of this
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:08.840]   technology they have a thomas the tank engine that talks to you this hello barbie and then we
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:13.960]   interviewed them when they were doing the apps uh like speak a legend the winston show speak a zoo
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:22.440]   and they said there was actually some some some psychological value to this so these are actual
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:27.240]   audio recordings of children the parents submitted them and signed off
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:35.240]   um and so if you listen to this this is one of the characters in the ipad app poses a question to
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:42.200]   the child she is saying that you cannot just fall in love but that you can also fall out of love
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:47.720]   like it is a nest or the mouth of a donor predator six seven eight years old i am having to think
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:54.200]   of ways to keep our love from falling out of her heart or her heart from falling out of it's all
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:03:01.400]   very confusing so keeper please tell me why i must do so that nobody falls out of love so now the
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:08.600]   child is in a private session in a you know in the room talking to this uh thing well you must be very
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:15.880]   kind to her and bring her gifts now and then and remember her important dates like if you were to
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:21.480]   get married and a vercries or birthdays so they're what they're what they're trying to do with this
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:26.360]   is they're trying to create a dial almost a psychotherapeutic dialogue with the child
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:31.960]   that or philosophic that gets them to start thinking about these uh bigger questions and they say
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:36.040]   it's really valuable it's very uh it's really interesting how do you find that creepy it's like
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:43.800]   a rape or a story yeah but that like the velt or something right go ahead kitty oh no i i mean
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:49.000]   kids this is how kids play and it is uh helpful and beneficial for development but we're usually
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.920]   not eavesdropping on them when they do it they know what i mean with so when child's playing
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:56.600]   when his or her favorite teddy bear it's often these sort of questions going back and forth like
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:03.480]   uh discussions and and dialogue but we don't we don't observe it yeah we've all seen kids do that
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:07.960]   and when they're playing with their toys that's what they do right they they they have these elaborate
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:12.440]   conversations yeah so i mean it did creep me out somewhat to hear the demo
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:18.280]   it was is it a little creepy yeah i don't think i should be listening to this but um it's uh it's
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:24.360]   it's inevitable though that um adults and children are going to just get used to this idea that
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:28.040]   our queries and the things that we say are being constantly recorded by something in our house
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:35.880]   that we've invited in and with and and want to have around like Alexa for example or the NSA
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:40.280]   or they gonna say well i guess depends on whether or not use apple or android not just getting
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:45.960]   just a little joke i think that is first say that we don't know who's the NSA's
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:51.000]   co-opted and whether it's android or apple it could be either or both uh here's the hello uh
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:56.440]   hello barbie i think this is for older kids so right oh that's a little weird no we have to
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:06.920]   plug her buddy i really do think this is preparing kids for a new digital future katie i think you're
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:12.600]   exactly right oh my god and email will be sent to you you can't play with your doll until you
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:20.280]   enter your email address install the app go to your settings this is complicated does barbie
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:26.680]   have touch i do i just see that parent will pursue it the barbie has her own wi-fi oh by the way that
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:32.120]   was one of the security flaws is it joins the barbie wi-fi they're all named barbie something
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:39.480]   it would be trivial for a bad guy to set up a wi-fi access point barbie.hacker and the kid could
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:44.440]   very easily accidentally choose the wrong end start sending i don't know if that's really a big
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:49.800]   problem or not i think the more times you've got microphones connected to the internet in your home
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:55.880]   the more you need to be aware of this right amazon echo in every room now i want everything to listen
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:03.400]   don't i may be i'm i am on the radio it's awfully convenient you're used to broadcasting your voice
[01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.480]   everybody hears everything i say all the time i don't
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:12.920]   games what do you want to be when you grow up i went to the event that's wonderful wanting to take
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:18.680]   care of sick animals is it amazing see that's pretty cool yeah because barbie knows oh vet i know
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:25.640]   what that is it's like a modern aliza remember the uh the bot that would
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:32.440]   make sure you turn off your barbie when you're done and put her back on her dock it's still a barbie
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:37.160]   and that's the thing like this is not a natural looking doll i mean this is not past the Turing
[01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:43.720]   test at all it's so creepy you all need children dashing this stuff but kids did you have barbies
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:48.040]   as a kid katie well i mean yeah and of course like when i was growing up we had the teddy bear that
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:52.760]   spoke teddy ruxpin teddy ruxpin it was the same it was the same exact thing except it wasn't
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:57.960]   recording us uh but it was the same idea where you have this in that object that makes you feel
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:03.800]   like your friends so i mean that part i'm i get and i think it's fine yeah it's it's just um
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:08.280]   security flaws should probably be thought of before it makes these things this is all is the
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:11.880]   problem right it's not whether or not they're creepy at the end of the day because this is sort
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:17.720]   of what life is becoming we don't love it but it is happening it's that um the people who are making
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:25.480]   the speakers or the dolls or the teddy bears might think of security as an afterthought in part
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:32.040]   because they're like well what the hell did somebody do it's like 24 hours of audio of some random
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:36.520]   kid talking to a doll you know it's not like with those conversations but it's still sort of like
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:41.160]   the idea that people and manufacturers are irresponsible and don't care that i think it's
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:46.280]   probably more disturbing somebody said this is the new data mining barbie i like it
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:53.400]   data farming mining barbie uh part of the reason their sensitivity of course is because of the
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:59.880]   vtech breach vtech makes children's uh toys they're a chinese company and they announced a couple
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:05.480]   of weeks ago that five million customer accounts had been hacked and harvested by the bad guys
[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:10.200]   including the user profiles of the kids connected to those accounts
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:16.600]   email addresses names encrypted password security questions and answers ip addresses mailing
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:22.840]   addresses the download history no credit card numbers no social security numbers
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:30.440]   you know so there's 190 gigabytes of kids photos and chats stored on vtech servers
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:36.440]   that's a little bit more issue an issue on the same at the same time what are you going to do
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:42.200]   with that right i mean i guess if you were uh you know a patter asked that would be
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:48.520]   well it's important i think it's important that we don't we don't live in a world where there's
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:52.440]   a product or a service that's connected on the internet that doesn't need security right
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:59.560]   and it seems like the vtech right policies were not really considering the fact that they needed
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:02.600]   to take it seriously they've been doing digital stuff for kids for a long time
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:09.080]   say again i was gonna say they seem pretty woefully inadequate like things being stored in plain
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:14.600]   text and sent in the clear and it's like it's just not even it's just not even close to get
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:21.880]   security practice from so from now you're you're muted again i think well so from now on i think
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:28.040]   it's very nice face though it's very expressive will doesn't need speech you can just make faces
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:33.400]   is it are you there now yeah it just seemed like is that working there yeah and somebody's pointing
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:37.640]   out it's not just the kids talking to dolls you also have any background audio going on mom and
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:44.360]   dad fighting shouting their social security numbers at the top of their lungs as you do as one does yeah
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:51.160]   no but i think this is i think that's exactly right this is early days now is a very good time
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:55.560]   to start paying attention to this these breaches are a good reminder that everything is now going
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:10:01.000]   to be connected to the internet maybe it's time to pay attention to this stuff we had
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.960]   yesterday on the new screensavers we had the new raspberry pie five dollar computer so cheap
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:13.080]   they're putting it in the magpie magazine for free you buy the magazine get a computer buy the
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:21.560]   magazine get a computer a five dollar computer with an hdmi port a usb port storage on an sd car
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:25.960]   i mean this is amazing and of course those can be put in all sorts of divide i mean the internet is
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:30.120]   you know and computers are going to be in everything because they're so cheap
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:33.400]   no reason not to computerize it why not
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:46.280]   uh but mark zuckerberg had a baby bersilla chan his wife posted on facebook lovely picture the two of
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:50.040]   them it's actually a very sweet picture do you have kids uh will you don't have kids
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:57.720]   oh hell no i would be a disaster i can barely look off to myself i know
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:03.880]   katie you don't have kids right no not just no so do you two when you uh jason you don't i do you
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:08.600]   do so we're we're fathers but that when you two are not parents when you look at this does this make
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:16.120]   you want to have children no this isn't like or to me i look at this and i go oh isn't that
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:21.000]   sweet those first moments you have with your newborn baby just so sweet makes me want to set up the
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:27.560]   limited liability corporation yes yes yeah immediately i think i'd have children with zuckerberg if i
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:33.640]   got some of the four hundred fifty billion forty five billion come on yes let's be real
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:41.080]   so uh there has been a surprising amount of snark about this by the way so uh mark wrote a long
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:48.040]   letter to our daughter published tuesday with the announcement of of max her name is max max's birth
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:52.920]   and kind of buried the lead because in the final paragraphs he mentions oh and by the way we're
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:57.240]   going to give away ninety nine percent of our facebook shares currently worth forty five billion
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:03.400]   dollars during our lives to advance personalized learning curing disease connecting people building
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:08.360]   strong communities wonderful they created the the chan zuckerberg initiative
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:15.880]   um and they formed now and this is where the snark began an llc not a charitable foundation as
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:24.040]   must most would but an llc and i i think there's a little bit of an unfair uh bit of snarking going
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:29.640]   on i mean i think it's genuine that they plan to give away forty five well currently forty five
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:33.960]   billion is probably going to be a lot more ninety nine percent of their fortune that's what bill
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:41.720]   gates is doing warren buffett is doing um how do you all feel feel about the the notion that because
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:49.720]   it's an llc they can for instance channel tax away they can make profit any any charitable donation
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:54.680]   is tax deductible i mean we right so so we and we do that because we want people to give to charity
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:13:00.280]   there's a reason why that exists so i don't think that should be criticized and the llc structure is
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:05.240]   it gives them a little bit more optionality in terms of what they give their money to you know so
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:09.800]   they can give the money to they can even invest in stations yeah they can also invest it in the
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:14.840]   same way that like i don't know harvard management company invest the endowment so that they can't
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:18.600]   always have a lot of money to give to harvard you know what i mean even increase that amount of
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:23.240]   money right and increase the amount depending on how well the investment goes so i i don't think
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:30.200]   this is bad i just um i was surprised by a lot of the criticism as well but i think that part of
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:35.000]   it is because silicon valley does seem really cut off from the rest of the country uh the amounts
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:42.280]   of money that are sort of made here seem really unreal to most of the us frankly you know just
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:46.440]   it this is a very very different place and the amount of wealth it's here is very different from
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:51.160]   your average town in the midwest or new england or pretty much any world in the country so
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:55.800]   there's a natural suspicion i think of things that happen here because they seem so divorced
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:01.000]   from the reality of what other people face day today and it absolutely and it's even worse when
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:06.040]   it comes to mark zuckerberg i think there's a lot of kind of distrust of what marks up to
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:11.000]   uh because there was a lot of mistrust from facebook and the early days of the company i mean
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.480]   some of that's gone away but if you think about it there was like not six months that could go by
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:21.000]   without facebook doing something that made everybody really upset about privacy and be like oh what
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:26.520]   are you doing so i mean that these are these there's blowback there but i don't think that
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:30.200]   essentially what they've done is bad i think it's kind of great i mean it's like a lot of money to
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:35.720]   to put to use other than just making other people rich you know like right on
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:43.160]   uh phyllis salmon who's a well-known uh financial reporter uh has a nice british accent so i trust
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:49.160]   him uh wrote a very i thought a very uh i think you know and jeff jarvis posted this and i noticed
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:57.160]   it and he wrote kind of the flattened this story on fusion um he says mark zuckerberg wants to
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:03.960]   change the world again you got a problem with that and and really explains why the llc why this is
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:12.760]   not a bad thing uh and and praises him as i think we probably should um for doing this there is
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:17.320]   often the question though hey these guys have so much money that 45 billion is so much money it
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:22.840]   could really do we want people like bill gates mark zuckerberg warren buffet
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:31.400]   kind of unilaterally determining the future of the world but better than as you say katie better
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:36.760]   than that than to you know building a mansion right and also like the politicians who are supposed
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:41.800]   to be doing that aren't really stepping up right now so they've left kind of a vacuum so if it you
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:47.720]   know what i mean it's if we had a really robust political system with there's politicians who were
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:53.720]   thoughtful and trying in earnest to solve problems not just preserve their jobs i don't think there'd
[01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:59.960]   be as much of a huge hole for right for wealthy people to fill and this isn't new i mean the rail
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:05.880]   barons created charitable foundations for a lot of their carnegie we have a carnegie library in town
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:12.600]   exactly andrew carnegie that steel baron uh late although he was a son of a bitch late in his life
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:17.240]   decided to that he decided he maybe i want to go to heaven after all yeah and uh gave libraries
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:22.040]   we have a beautiful carnegie free library in uh in petaluma yeah and there are lots of things like
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:27.160]   that that have happened so i think uh the judgment judgment's gonna take probably longer than we're
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:33.080]   alive about how well this money gets spent but you know this is it's it's not bad to have this i
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:37.640]   think in general it just depends on how they what they do with it the gates foundation has done some
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:43.240]   amazing work in some places and i think you arguably you know some of their other work it has been
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:50.040]   less successful but uh that happens in lots of endeavors uh jesse isinger among others criticizing
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:54.680]   it saying this should be the occasion of maul what kind of society we want to live in and who should
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:17:00.760]   fund our general society needs and how charities rarely fill quotidian yet vital needs what would
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:05.560]   forty billion mean for job creation or infrastructure spending and think you're right katie if the if
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:10.440]   our government we're doing a better job on those things these questions wouldn't be wouldn't be raised
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:17.560]   but you know one of the things uh uh uh zuckerberg says he's going to work on climate change i think
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:24.440]   in the light of the paris climate uh talks uh this is absolutely an appropriate thing for all of
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:31.160]   them to work on this i think this is great i i don't i think if you read up on it and i understand
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:37.800]   what he's doing um there's nothing but good here but i did want to raise the issue in case of
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:43.160]   in case of anybody wanted to explain why it wasn't such a good thing it's tough to do i mean
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:46.760]   bill gates always said i'm not going to become a philanthropist until i have the time to decide
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:51.560]   what's the right way to spend the money uh he advanced that timeline a little bit he i think
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:55.400]   it initially said i'm not going to do it till after i leave microsoft because i'm too busy running
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:18:03.480]   this company but when he got married uh malinda i think uh kind of advanced the foundation and
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:08.840]   started running some of the foundations uh giving efforts before gates left and now that of course
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:14.360]   that he's no longer microsoft i think it's a full-time job and isn't it great if you took you know the
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:20.280]   the combined wealth of the Forbes 100 or whatever i said to them right you know you guys all give
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:24.920]   away 99 percent of your wealth into something like look at the effect that bill gates is being
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:30.920]   able to have on malaria right he's almost single handedly like getting rid of that globally
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:35.640]   imagine what you could do if if everybody in that Forbes 100 did that right how can you possibly
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:41.320]   argue that's going to be a miserable thing uh seven quotes john arnold another billionaire
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:46.120]   philanthropist who says quote i believe much of the highest value add in philanthropies and things
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:53.320]   that are controversial that they are controversial is exactly why there is under investment and thus
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:58.840]   the most to gain in these areas actually makes a lot of sense he says i think many philanthropic
[01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:02.600]   philanthropically inclined people struggle with how to give away very large sums
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:09.720]   institutions most adept at handling large grants at universities hospitals cultural institutions
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:16.920]   but uh maybe better to find some niches that that need some funding besides those
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:21.400]   right like mike bloomberg is done i mean he's made a name for himself only giving
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:25.960]   white tons of money to really controversial things he's very pro-gun control he has really
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:30.440]   strong views on health care and on the way that people eat as any new york city resident can tell
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:36.120]   you when he went to get rid of our sotas he bans us what is super sized uh sotas yeah he tried
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:41.800]   try they're back i believe so yeah we can drink as much horrible stuff as we want
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:45.880]   i mean this is the thing he's he's not afraid to wait in a controversy he's kind of like well if
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:49.640]   i have the money and i have the influence the clout why not use it for something real rather than
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:54.040]   give more to like you know another museum he gives a lot to museums don't get me wrong like
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:59.960]   but he's also not afraid to put his name on stuff that a lot of people would rather back away from
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:05.560]   john arnold is the same he wanted to and he did fund a huge initiative around tax reform i mean
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:08.680]   that's pretty controversial people don't want to see that happen right
[01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:14.200]   isn't michael bloomberg uh being uh bandied about is the next mayor of london
[01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:21.240]   have you heard that i didn't make that up i maybe i had a bad a fever dream and i
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:27.000]   no are you sure yeah pretty pretty sure the last i heard he was going back to actually like doing
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.320]   some work running bloomberg right he was sort of stepping back into doing a bit more there
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:36.840]   no we have very interesting london mayor or something in it boris but when boris leaves my
[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:42.600]   understanding is that he is yeah he is back and engaged at at bloomberg uh his company that he's
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:47.160]   he's he's back and she's happy to be back in charge of it well in fact here's a here's a direct
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:52.040]   quote in the telegraph michael bloomberg zero chance i'll run for mayor of london
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:58.520]   so and there's a picture of him next to boris but that's great that that newspaper got uh you know
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:03.320]   at least two stories out of that the story is saying that he might be right wouldn't yeah he says he
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:09.320]   has zero interest actually told the times this zero interest so i'm not it wasn't a fever dream
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:15.400]   there was briefly briefly he said the at one point he said that my 12 years as mayor of new york
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:21.960]   city was a suitable apprenticeship for running london is it bloomers starry bloomberg employees
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:28.680]   yeah probably get him out of here building he was knighted he is sir michael no actually he's not
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:32.520]   allowed to be sir michael right if you're not a british citizen he said not so he can be knighted
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:35.000]   but he can't be sir michael he can't be sir michael
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:44.280]   so uh bor do we like boris johnson uh will oh my god i am not getting into that
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:50.760]   it's kind of he had absolutely is he a peter kapaldi type can you imagine him
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:56.680]   throwing up blue streak in uh he's he's done he's done he's done a few good things okay
[01:21:56.680 --> 01:22:01.640]   i was just talking about the london i and how much at first i thought what a bad idea to have
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:05.640]   one of the most beautiful skylines in the world dominated by a ferris wheel
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:10.360]   but then i wrote it and i thought well that's pretty cool it's a pretty cool ferris wheel to be
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:15.080]   fair there are worse buildings in london i can tell you that sure oh you're not a fan of the
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:22.600]   gherkin uh the gherkin the walkie talkie sure is the latest controversial one
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:27.160]   um the walkie talkie's been a problem because whoever designed it didn't quite realize that the
[01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:33.320]   angle at which they built the glass would uh reflect the sundown in the summer onto the pavement
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:38.120]   oh lord they had to they had to change the glass in some of the upper areas because it was like
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:45.000]   now burning things the classical thing of like taking an egg and you know baking on the pavement
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:51.640]   you do it in like 30 seconds you know it looks like it does look kind of like a giant walkie talkie
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:59.880]   yep yeah it's a pretty dire that is one ugly ass building actually
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:05.320]   uh better than the buildings in front of it the 60s era buildings in front of it but uh
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:10.920]   strike it rich in the chat room says that uh rob ford is the next person to run there you go the
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:18.280]   vaunted mayor of toronto is he is ford still the mayor no isn't he dead
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:24.120]   let's start a rumor you know who's not dead yet marissa mire
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:30.600]   we're still waiting oh my god that's amazing all right all right i apologize
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:40.040]   i'm not dead yet i'll take a break we'll talk about uh yahoo because the the board met right this

[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:26.280]   manufacturers and they bought it so they can make better razors at half the price of the drug

[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:53.160]   uh so is was this all bs it was started with the wall street journal article saying that the
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:59.720]   yahoo board was going to meet earlier this week to decide what to do with the business they might in
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:09.000]   fact even sell it one of the issues was they they did have a plan to spin off the alibaba
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.040]   investment which that's worth billions and maybe even yahoo japan also worth billain billions
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:20.360]   but then the irs would not guarantee that that would be a tax-free transfer so some of the investors
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:27.720]   went whoo hold down hold on there a little bit so um now they're thinking maybe we just sell the
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:34.040]   whole damn thing they're gonna halt the alibaba perhaps according to wall street journal halt
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:42.040]   the alibaba spin-off and sell the internet business this of course coming from the activist investors
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:49.880]   on the yahoo board now most of most the value of yahoo it's got 31 billion dollars in market cap
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:57.160]   but most of that value is alibaba and yahoo japan 32 billion dollar of worth for its 15 percent
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:03.720]   stake in alibaba which alibaba is uh kind of like the uh amazon of of china right
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:10.760]   is that the best way to describe it yeah i think that's fair yeah and uh in fact you can use it here
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:18.280]   i know a lot of people use it here and it has a it is literally the yahoo business right according
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:23.240]   to the numbers that you've got right is literally less than the sum of its parts yeah is that weird
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:29.240]   all the bits separately are worth more than its current total market cap like it's totally not so
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:34.440]   and that's what puts it kind of upside down right the the stock market values of 31 billion the alibaba
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:39.320]   sticks were 32 billion if they just sold it the yahoo japan steak eight and a half billion if they
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:47.080]   just sold it and they have cash and investments totally 5.9 billion but it's only worth 31
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:51.640]   billion so that's what puts us a company in play when it's something like that and it's pretty clear
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:57.240]   if you look at the the share prices it's gone this year it's like it's it's all in a good place
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:04.360]   down down down fifty dollars. The share price is a measurement of of mire you know it's investors
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:09.000]   saying that they don't believe that she can actually steer the company without the buffer
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:15.960]   that she has with all these really valuable assets so that's fine and it's great that the
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:18.840]   market thinks that it's great that a bunch of activist investors may or may not have
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:25.240]   fed a story to the Wall Street Journal but this is still a decision that's made by the board of
[01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:29.720]   yahoo a board which is squarely in Marissa Meyer's corner you know these are people many of whom
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:36.200]   were handpicked by her troll Schwab is a San Francisco luminary and close to Meyer Scott comes from
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:41.560]   Walmart she served on the board of Walmart they're very tight you know I doubt that you know if
[01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:49.800]   somebody like you know Scott Scott and and David Fylo David Fylo is not going to try to push her out
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:55.560]   I highly doubt that Max Lovechin is going to try to push her out so she has support of people who
[01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:58.840]   are making a decision of whether or not she's going to run the place and then to sell the core
[01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:04.360]   business what would that give her to run what would she be overseeing a management company
[01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:08.360]   an investment management company a stock management company she doesn't come from Black Rock she
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:13.080]   doesn't come from you know an investment firm that's not her expertise she's not going to do that
[01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:18.760]   either so I really highly doubt we're going to see that happen so yeah there's no story here in
[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:25.320]   your opinion I don't think that there's no story I mean I the board it has a fiduciary
[01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:30.520]   responsibility it's a jargony way of putting it but just means that they are responsible for
[01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:35.720]   weighing every single option sort of like CYA so that if something happens or
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:41.320]   that they can prove that they were doing all they could at all times to maximize value for
[01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:46.280]   shareholder so yeah do they have to have everything on the table and talk about it of course they do
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:51.240]   but I just don't think they're going to push Marissa Meyer out the door not anytime soon and
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:58.280]   as long as the Alibaba spinoff happens that's a lot of money for them so I don't know I just
[01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:07.400]   don't see her getting canned in 2015 or even early 2016 that's just my read loyalty only goes so far
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:14.600]   I mean yes of course these guys are in her corner but at some point if the company is
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:20.600]   is the stock market says the company's worth 31 billion and you've got assets 50% worth 50% more
[01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:25.240]   do you have a choice I mean at some point these activist investors are going to
[01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:34.600]   start waging a battle over this the good news if you're Marissa Meyer is according to USA today
[01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:40.840]   she's got a pretty hefty severance package yes if they fire her they have to give her like
[01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:45.560]   a hundred and fifty eight million dollars which also makes fire her see even harder
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:52.440]   very hard because one it's very pricey to do and two can any of you think of anyone saying
[01:31:52.440 --> 01:32:01.080]   who would go run Yahoo right now right three million in severance 66 million in accelerated stock
[01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:09.800]   88 million in accelerated stock options so it's 157.9 million dollars but only if she gets fired
[01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:17.080]   or there's a and I think there's a there's a triggering clause if there's a transfer of ownership
[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:24.280]   as well nice work if you can get it can Marissa Meyer turn around Yahoo
[01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:29.640]   that's the other question the board has to be asking what does the future hold
[01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:36.040]   anybody well I think I think under you know as much as we all
[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:43.400]   derided the management prior to Marissa Meyer there was a really clear goal for Yahoo which was
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:48.440]   kind of taking the ao of trading in its existing business for a media business right
[01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:54.760]   for building an ad funded business that owned lots of media assets traded off its enormous
[01:32:54.760 --> 01:33:00.920]   scale page use brand recognition etc she didn't really want to go in that direction and wanted
[01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:06.360]   you know it to be a tech business right rather necessarily a media business so most of the
[01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:12.360]   media assets are slightly kind of stumbled and dwindled and apart from acquiring you know something
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:20.520]   like tumblr which is enormous but kind of financially not exactly exciting she hasn't really sort of
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:25.400]   put anything in place where you go well I can definitely see where you're going with that
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:32.520]   they've done a lot of aqueous hires in terms of bringing in talent but you know there was a
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:38.760]   great article I saw a couple of weeks ago about you know aqueous hires can be terrible for everybody
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:42.600]   else that works there because you sort of realize that you've been working you know if you're an
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:46.280]   engineer you're you've been working for however many years and you're getting paid x and the guy
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:50.440]   next to you has been working there for three months and there's just cashed out you know 10
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:56.040]   million or something it's sort of totally demotivating so I'm not really sure that she's put in a
[01:33:56.040 --> 01:34:01.560]   you know really a vision that anybody maybe outside her inner circle kind of really understands
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:09.880]   I don't think it's too early to say that whatever strategy myer had has failed
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:15.880]   and it may in fact be that she didn't have a coherent strategy I mean I'm not sure I saw
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:21.480]   anything you know from Yahoo I've seen anything in law he in the last three years it looked like
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:27.640]   it had even the remotest chance of changing Yahoo's fate their flicker app redesign I don't think so
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:34.120]   well it's tough it's tough because she inherited a lot of stuff that would have been potentially
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:38.680]   successful if they had moved faster earlier but it was too late like flicker being a good example
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:42.600]   flicker probably could have been instagram but they didn't they didn't see that but how often
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:46.840]   does that happen and they buy these things and then they and then they have kind of abandoned them
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:53.320]   and and so I don't know what she was supposed to do the content strategy might have done something
[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:57.320]   but yeah when people talk about Yahoo now they're saying the same things they said when she got
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:02.040]   hired which is is Yahoo still around and what does it do it seems very it seems like nothing has
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:05.800]   happened in other words and things have happened but in the end it hasn't changed anybody's
[01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:09.800]   perception of it it's not like they did something radical and broke it apart and turned it into
[01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:15.400]   something like google with a bunch of products and services nor did they turn it into a media
[01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:19.160]   machine that would that could take advantage of their huge audience because yahou still has a
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:24.520]   pretty large audience it's just not a cool audience it's a very non-technical older kind of audience
[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:30.120]   yahoo in fact I hate to say this but it's more like a newspaper than any other site on the internet
[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:34.360]   it's got an older audience and it's got a really broad general audience which is nice
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:40.680]   but it's not exciting and I think not necessarily a growth area and also a web pages
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:47.080]   I hate to say it but they're going the way of the newspaper aren't they I mean I love the web
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:50.840]   but it's it's all about apps now right how much time do people spend in the web versus how much
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:56.040]   time this is a yahoo property tv.com there's dr who we've come all the way back but yeah but
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:36:00.760]   I don't even see any ads on here oh actually because I haven't had blocker
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:07.320]   as a part of the problem too they also write lots of stuffs inside apps and it's apps and
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:12.120]   services and we really I think expect that there'd be more of that and they do have tumblr and
[01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:17.560]   tumblr is a really interesting business but you'd expect them to have broken you know I see a lot
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:22.440]   of ads on tumblr now I have to say it's yeah yeah yeah I don't know I don't know what their
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:25.960]   business is I think that's the problem is they're so big and they have so many legacy
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:31.160]   businesses and they are not like killing products fast enough or spinning them out fast enough and
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:36.040]   if you want to know it's a tough job happening with celebrities would you go to yahoo.com/celebrity
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:41.240]   or TMZ I mean I feel like in every respect I mean this is right this is the newspaper though it's
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:46.200]   like a little bit of everything instead of being focused and I would like to think that there is
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:51.640]   a place on the internet for people who are not you know solely focused on celebrity news to get a
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:55.640]   little celebrity news but that may not be the case that's something of general interest like
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:59.400]   yahoo is just not the way the world works should turn off my ad blocker because there's a lot of
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:05.320]   white space on this page let me refresh this reminds me a lot of del because I just that was a
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:11.640]   company that clearly needed a big strategy shift away from pcs and it never really got it done right
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:18.840]   never really gotten to services it bought um pro systems it did a lot but it was never bold enough
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:23.000]   michael del was never a bold enough leader in that way it because you know there was something
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.880]   about the core he didn't want to let go of or change substantively yahoo seems similar you've
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:34.600]   got mire making a lot of decisions around the margins let's do a tv show let's do magazines
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:41.000]   online magazines you know let's bring in all this talent but never making a bold decision
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:46.360]   yeah with any of that stuff never saying you know what we need to really utilize tumblr
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:49.720]   in a real way all tumblr does give them enough engagement that they haven't been totally
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:54.600]   abandoned by advertisers except if you look at what del has done recently right the one thing that
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:59.640]   michael del suddenly did which was like oh my you know he's really got bold as that is that
[01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:06.040]   is that company private right yeah that was a bold move and now they're buying emc for the largest
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:10.680]   tech acquisition history he got bold i don't know where that bold came from but he found this bold
[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:16.040]   he went private so he wasn't being scrutinized by shareholders and the move to buy emc is actually
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:22.360]   a move that kevin rallins during his teensy brief tenure as del cio had also wanted to do for about
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:29.240]   a quarter of the price oh whoopsies but i mean but at the same time you're right he did finally
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:34.120]   he did finally start making those moves is that what will take it yahoo will yahoo have to go private
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:42.280]   and be outside of the public i in order for mire or remover actually an interesting if if
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:47.000]   since they do have assets greater than their stock market value
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:54.200]   i wonder if there would be a way for them to go private sure i mean it'd be interesting if they
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:39:00.280]   were to sell off all a bobber and yahoo japan physically the company in terms of its size is
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:05.720]   much smaller and then yes a buyout shop like a silver lake could raise enough
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:09.800]   borrow enough money uh to take the private in theory that would work
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:17.000]   interesting well i so i but thank you for that dose of reality that was probably uh
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:22.120]   that wall street journal story was probably planted by the activist investors who wanted
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:27.480]   this to happen not necessarily what was going to happen uh still a challenge i you know i i think
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:32.280]   we all have a soft spot at least those of us a certain age of a soft spot in our heart for yahoo
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:39.480]   it was the first search engine i ever used yeah acobono.stanford.edu and uh it was a pretty amazing
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:44.200]   thing for some time but when the web was small enough that you could have a directory of what was
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:49.240]   on the web i was on the show instead of a search engine all let me oh nice new site let me type that
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:55.560]   in uh hey if you missed anything we'll take a little break if you missed anything uh on twitter

[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:31.800]   bit they do some of these books are dramatized too which makes it a lot of fun you know my favorite
[01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:36.920]   dramatized one is a Neil Gaiman they have so many great Neil Gaiman books i love
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:43.880]   Neil Gaiman by the way if you get the ones that Neil reads uh he does never wear i think he reads
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:48.760]   yep really great but that's a good one isn't it good and he reads it and they made a BBC series
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:54.440]   out of it and so forth but he reads it but this is one of my favorites it's american gods they did a
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:58.920]   full cast production on its tenth anniversary isn't it a great novel yeah it really is he did it
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:09.080]   uh um it's well it's hard to describe it's a it's the old gods are having a hard time in the new
[01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:13.640]   world it's a it's about immigrants and so the immigrants to america bring their gods with them
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:18.280]   right they they don't have the the history and the tradition that they act back and they're mixing
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:24.520]   with other gods from other places yeah and it's dramatized it's wonderful if you like Terry Pratchett
[01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:29.400]   i don't know if people know this but he did a book with Neil Gaiman called good omens that is
[01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:34.600]   hysterical all the Neil Pratchett novels are there they're just there's so much stuff i don't know
[01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:40.680]   where to begin and you won't either but pick two i just got this new one uh is this it no no no no

[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:24.840]   voices reading classic books like the handmaid's tail clear dains reads that
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:30.280]   dusted Hoffman being there the jersey kazinsky book what a great book if you thought the movie

[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:49.960]   he wrote a great book and i think i listened to it on audible uh called uh this much is true he's
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:53.320]   written a number of books i didn't read his last one she's come undone because it was too depressing
[01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:59.400]   but actually that was his first one um i know this much is true was good it was we are watered
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:06.520]   in re so he is a very very well-known best-selling novelist but he's doing something weird his sixth
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:21.240]   novel will be not released as a book it will be an app what um it's uh so it's met a book is the app
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:27.800]   it was founded last year it specializes in multimedia interactive storytelling but when
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:33.080]   steven king released uh he said i'm going to release a novel chapter by chapter as an audio
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:37.480]   only download or maybe it was a kit it was an ebook only download and it was a miserable failure
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:45.800]   he said i'm never doing that again have times changed um i don't know you got a big name
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:50.360]   the novel's called i'll take you there it centers on a film professor who runs a monday
[01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:55.240]   night film club in an old theater that turns out to be haunted by the ghost of lois webber
[01:50:55.880 --> 01:51:06.680]   a silent film era actress wow uh it'll in by the way only uh ios not even android and you'll have
[01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:13.880]   to buy it from the iTunes app store okay is it all at once or in installments i think it's all at once
[01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:17.800]   wow i'll buy it you know it just to see i'll buy it i love his stuff
[01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:27.400]   news from the us court of appeals for the second circuit breaking your computer your employers
[01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:34.200]   computer policy is not a crime this is actually surprising news because the courts have traditionally
[01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:39.480]   upheld the rights of employers when it comes to digital stuff an employer has to hang up if he
[01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:43.800]   picks up the phone and here's you having a personal conversation but reading your email no problem
[01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:50.120]   uh digital stuff has always been treated as uh you know the under the ownership of the employer
[01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:57.800]   um this is kind of a creepy case it comes from the cannibal cop case a new york city police officer
[01:51:57.800 --> 01:52:06.680]   was charged with conspiracy to kidnap he never kidnapped anybody he wrote fantasy posts on a
[01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:15.880]   cannibalism fetish site and he did during company time and he was also charged with violating the
[01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:22.120]   policies of the uh actually was charged with a computer fraud and abuse act for violating
[01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:28.520]   the york police department policies about accessing a police database without a valid law enforcement
[01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:35.000]   purpose now that's an NYPD policy but they decided to make a an example out of them and they charged
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:39.080]   him with the computer fraud and abuse case he was convicted on all counts
[01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:46.760]   the trial court reversed the jury's conspiracy verdict saying that you can't really have a
[01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:51.400]   kidnapping conspiracy in which no one has ever kidnapped no attempted kidnapping ever took place
[01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:56.440]   no real world steps were ever taken to kidnap anybody it's not really it's thought crime
[01:52:56.440 --> 01:53:01.320]   it's not a crime to think about it so the court overturned that one and then
[01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:05.160]   but they did up held the conviction under the computer fraud act
[01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:13.320]   interestingly though the second circuit has overturned that saying we declined to adopt the
[01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:18.520]   prosecution's construction of the computer fraud act which would criminalize the conduct of millions
[01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:23.480]   of ordinary computer users while the government might promise it would not prosecute an individual
[01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:29.080]   for checking facebook at work we are not at liberty to take prosecutors at their word in such
[01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:34.120]   matters a court should not uphold a highly problematic interpretation of a statute
[01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:37.240]   merely because the government says oh no we're never going to use it on facebook it's only when
[01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:43.080]   the the guy's doing something really wrong so but this is probably good news it means that
[01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:48.520]   while you could get fired or you know reprimanded for breaking your employer's computer
[01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:52.440]   computer policy at least you can't get charged under the computer fraud and abuse act
[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:59.720]   i mean it this is good news but of course corporate policies aren't crimes they they aren't laws
[01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:06.120]   right can commit crimes by breaking corporate policy that's crazy and this really points to an
[01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:12.520]   overreaching uh by law enforcement and prosecutors in the u_s_ to crime it's scary on this exactly on
[01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:17.320]   this cfa because i mean that was erin shorts was charged under the computer fraud act
[01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:24.840]   um uh it's been misused yeah so good uh i'm glad the court said wait a minute hold on yeah just
[01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:30.760]   upland him because he violated your your corporate policy but he didn't break any laws by not doing
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:37.640]   what your handbook said it's crazy here's a weird one do how many of you have a do not have a landline
[01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:42.920]   will do you have a landline you know landline katie do you have a landline no landline
[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:49.240]   uh Jason snell do you have a landline yeah uh and we tried to get rid of it but we still have it
[01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:54.280]   because of the Comcast bundle it was cheaper to keep it okay you don't want to land don't want it
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:55:00.440]   turns out according to the centers for disease control people who have cell phones but no landlines
[01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:07.720]   are more likely to binge drink more likely to smoke more likely to be uninsured
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:14.760]   you guys are losers i think that just describes young people that there you go
[01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:20.440]   demographic excuse to our not having landline that was a test of your ability to think and you
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:26.360]   and you passed katie benet turns out the cdc i didn't know this but the cdc does a uh kind of a
[01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:32.840]   census every year 40 000 people are interviewed and because uh they want to talk to everybody they do
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:38.600]   they go house to house they don't do it by phone so they were able to compile these statistics look
[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:46.680]   at this more people are cell phone only then have landlines in the united states 47
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:55.320]   are cell phone only 42 have both like like you and me Jason have landline and so only reason i
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:59.880]   have a landline is for my burglar alarm huh i don't use it i wouldn't have it what do you need one you
[01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:04.760]   got a cell phone now there are eight percent in the united states who do not have a cell phone but
[01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:11.320]   have a landline probably the the older people and the very poor uh but yeah isn't that interesting
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:16.760]   i think actually that's the statistics more interesting now there more people don't have a
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:22.200]   landline than do actually that's not strictly true because if you add landline and cell phone to
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:27.720]   landline no cell phone you get 50 percent but it's close it's neck and neck yeah this is um as we're
[01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:32.040]   going into a presidential election year this is something to keep in mind the pollsters are better
[01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:36.520]   at it than they used to be but the entire polling industry was predicated on this idea that you
[01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:42.680]   could reach people at a certain time at a number it was a location yeah and that meant a landline
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:48.440]   and now and while they're all trying to grasp the right way to poll with cell phones it's been an
[01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:52.760]   issue and it may continue to be an issue where the kind of people they want to reach who do vote
[01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:58.920]   but if they can't reach them at a statistically accurate level you end up with distorted polls
[01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:03.960]   well you understand the last people exactly yeah so in the last um uk election which was which
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:11.720]   was earlier on this year um the polling that took place was was statistically the worst on record
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:17.560]   in terms of accuracy they thought Donald Trump would win that's the amazing thing but they said
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:22.760]   universally it's because it's it's getting harder and harder and harder to poll people um because of
[01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:27.160]   the because of the landline problem and we're seeing that now in the uk and there's no signs
[01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:33.000]   from any of the the polling companies over here like the the u-goves or or whoever that is going
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:40.680]   to get any better good because polls suck oh because they make the whole all the coverage of
[01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:45.560]   elections a horse race coverage right who's winning at the you know who's and he's coming around the
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:49.640]   turn it's Donald Trump Donald Trump it's that's not that's not what elections should be about we
[01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:57.080]   should be talking about issues not who's winning in the polls finally i love this article in new
[01:57:57.080 --> 01:58:07.800]   york magazine they followed up on 10 former viral sensations on how they're doing life after the
[01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:14.360]   internet katie upton remember the south carol miss south carolina teen who couldn't in 2007
[01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:21.640]   answer a simple question such yeah and i i felt bad when i watched this you
[01:58:23.880 --> 01:58:31.720]   i personally believe that us americans are unable to do so because i know i'm not even going to go on
[01:58:31.720 --> 01:58:37.240]   with this at the same time as you're laughing at her you realize this is not her finest moment
[01:58:37.240 --> 01:58:42.040]   and in fact she almost committed suicide she said i lost a lot of close friends over it
[01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:46.520]   people i knew since i was 10 people i grew up playing soccer with one group of girls took me

[01:58:56.520 --> 01:59:02.840]   somebody put a letter in her parents mailboxes that go die katie upton go die for your stupidity
[01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:07.320]   she said i went through a period of i was very very depressed i mean huge
[01:59:07.320 --> 01:59:14.600]   this is actually tragic fortunately she went brunette she was a blonde in this video and now her
