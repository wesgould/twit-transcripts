[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.800]   Yeah, let's do it
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.240]   And I thought if we did a gaming show we should really do a let's play ish kind of show where we play the games
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.480]   Because what we did a gaming show for a while and was talking about the games
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.400]   That's not as interesting. I think people on you know would love to see how bad I am in video games. I'm totally okay
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.200]   Good. I'm sorry. That's always fun to watch other people. Oh, yeah resident evil or something. Who's voice?
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.160]   This is a voice and so from it. Oh, it's Georgia down. Hi Georgia down visiting us from Mariah. Yeah

[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.640]   But I don't think we can get you to move from Canada
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.280]   I love it's beautiful anytime you come down. Yeah, that we're getting some good weather
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.200]   Well, no it's raining you like that though, and you did wine cut. Did you do anything?
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.400]   Well, I don't really I don't really do one
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.400]   Candela wrong place we do have beer do you do beer? No
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.640]   She's good at sleep though. She has a number of videos at anxiety - videos calm including I love this
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:57.240]   Sleep like a baby. That's nice. That's a good one. It's a good one. Hey, totally passed out like I know that's baby sleep
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:03.480]   Well, I could sleep like that I would get you could sleep in that position you could sleep in any position
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.640]   That's true, and that is Rob Reed great to have you Rob Reed. It is great to be here read Rob Reed calm
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.320]   I like that is that the new site read Rob Reed. It's a site. It is a site
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.540]   Yeah, I love that and I think I have every derivative of the word read in both positions all pointing there
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:25.760]   It's read our E ad Rob. Oh, I get it read Rob Reed. It's a commander request now that we've had you on before
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.880]   On this show and also on triangulation to talk about year zero. Yes, Rob did a great
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.200]   I hope you've seen it if you haven't go see it Ted talk on on
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.480]   Copyright math yes, I did and it was actually really probably one of the best
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:47.700]   Explanation is of why copy you know why this this whole complaint of the music industry that they're losing money to pirates is bogus
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:55.440]   And then he followed it up with this book which is aliens it turns out aliens have been using our music for a long time
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.640]   And they owe us a horrendous amount of terrible copyright violation
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:06.000]   So this is the tale based on a true story of a vast alien civilization that is so into American pop music that they accidentally
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.760]   Commit the biggest copyright infringement since the dawn of time
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.280]   There boy thereby bankrupting the entire universe. There's a episode of Rick and Morty, which is one of my favorite cartoons
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.760]   That was based on this you're kidding is anybody. Oh you do Rick and Morty now. There's like a karaoke show and they like have
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:26.760]   Rob you better investigate this well would they did they come before this but this is a few years old my book?
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.760]   So no, this is this is just like last year
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:35.760]   I'll find the ironic
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.520]   Source you guys fighting copyright violation ends up
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.240]   Now the news about this because I am here on Twitter this week
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.880]   Random House has agreed at my urgent request to put the digital version of this book on
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.400]   Crazy discount it is a buck ninety nine all week because of this
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.200]   Literally because of this because of this I'm gonna be on Twitter and it'd be real
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.760]   I mean the books been out for a few years. It's really funny in fact the first sentences aliens suck at music
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:13.240]   For a lack of trying so and Rob has a little bit of experience in this having found a listen.com and Rhapsody
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.800]   So you go back a little way I go back a little you're a reformed entrepreneur. I take it
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:23.440]   I am a recovering entrepreneur turned science fiction author. I like it. Yes. I like it. Of course
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.680]   Tech TV fans will know that Morgan web is your spouse she is which is pretty cool very cool
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:38.560]   It was incredibly cool is the coolest fact about tell Morgan and the coolest aspect of my life a year from May when you're from now
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.840]   Is the 20th anniversary of the launch of ZD TV slash tech TV a year?
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:50.640]   20 years so I think we need to have a big party what day what day a day 11th 2018
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.260]   That's kind of scary that it was ZD TV at the time
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:59.000]   Did she was she there to be now she would have not she would have still been in Berkeley at that point
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.040]   But she came in she probably started there 2000 2001 ish nice. I'm gonna guess yeah, and it was already tech TV
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.040]   I know when she came over. Yeah, yeah
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.280]   Well, it was a week for tech news there was a lot of it
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:19.000]   I think we should probably mention because we talked about it on Wednesday that the Senate did indeed vote to
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.720]   revoke an FCC rule a rule that had only been
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.080]   promulgated October of last year that
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:34.120]   Prevented internet service providers from selling your browser history to the highest bidder well without permission first
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.120]   Let's make it clear without permission
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:41.440]   This is something that every ISP is basically doing AT&T did create a
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:47.880]   Deal where if you agreed to it you would get a somewhat reduced price for your internet access
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.160]   But for the most part until October of last year they just did whatever they wanted with it
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.880]   Yep, including putting you know Verizon put those
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.960]   Undelitable cookies
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:04.200]   Whenever you surf with a Verizon phone you identified yourself to the website and then they would charge websites for that information
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:11.320]   Oh, we'll tell you Julio is we'll tell you we'll tell you that they I mean they inject ads into your
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:16.080]   Search results they inject ads into your surfing they've done all of these things
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:23.640]   They were really stymied and didn't like it one bit that the FCC stopped that but this is back under Obama
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:30.800]   Senate has now voted in a fairly close vote along party lines exactly 50 to 48. I think it was
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.640]   Yeah
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.480]   To say that's it you can do anything you want
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:42.640]   Yeah, and this is going to be the trend I think from the FCC and from Congress to just eliminate consumer protections and say oh
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.720]   Practition will take care of it. I don't I don't know if I agree with that the house has to approve it
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.600]   But it's because the house has an even greater majority of Republicans
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.880]   Yeah, the house has to prove it and then Trump would have to sign into law is it a bill?
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:59.960]   It's no, I think it's just a rule. I think it does not it's not it's not a law. It's the rollback of a regulation
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.760]   Yeah, I don't think it's it's an a review act right?
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:10.120]   Okay, but what is you something that was done within 60 congressional days and they can review it and then without presidential signature
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.560]   Yeah
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.360]   sad
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.360]   What's really sad to me is that
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:23.280]   Our members of Congress are frankly and very clearly in the pockets of big companies and not in the pockets of consumers
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.960]   And I'll add that it's rather cool that a Canadian knows our laws better than we
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.680]   Thank you for that. She's the three of us had no idea
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:36.120]   She just knows everything better than well, you know, I don't want to sound defeatist here
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:41.280]   I feel like this this should be one of those opportunities if this is something you strongly believe in whether you're a Republican or
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.240]   Democrat like call up your your Congress member call up your congressman and call up your Congresswoman
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.320]   Yeah, tell them. I mean that vote was close and it was long party lines, but
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.080]   As I think we just saw with the GOP giving up
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.960]   They can be persuaded they can be persuaded. Yeah, and ultimately the vote we're the boss
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.120]   Yeah, and we have to but we have to assert that exactly and the fact the matter is is that
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.040]   ISPs cable companies TV set makers
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:14.400]   Basically any sort of internet connected device you have is collecting this sort of data. This is a business for all of these companies. So
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.720]   Whether or not you like that business existing is another separate issue
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:25.680]   But I think whether or not there's transparency about it and whether or not they ask us permission first is what this is about, right?
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.480]   So keeping that rule in place
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:34.400]   I don't see how that negatively impacts this business, which is in existence and growing
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.200]   If anything it just keeps us in the loop about that and I don't know how anyone can be mad at that. So
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:44.480]   You know, hey, if you if you if you want them to roll this back repeal it
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.480]   Tell all your elected officials that too. Let them know that you think they're doing the right thing
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.480]   But here's an opportunity to be active and engaged. So I'll get off my soapbox now
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.600]   I should point out though that we should give up on it. You know this rule this regulation
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:01.760]   And by the way, I'm reading an article on buzzfeed, which does say the president does have to sign it. It is a bill. It is a law
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.440]   Yes
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.360]   Indicated well and I know it won't make any difference rules. Yeah
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:12.720]   But I should point out this is prior to october 2016. This is the was the state of this
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:19.040]   It's not like a change of suddenly much worse than it's been for years. This is back to the way it was six months ago. Yeah
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.760]   It's just it's unfortunate
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.600]   I would hope that we would get some protection of our privacy
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:32.960]   We are you know, we talk a lot of and I hear from people a lot our audience who are upset about google spying on them or facebook spying on them
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:38.640]   But your internet service provider is prior to google and facebook it knows much more about what you do online
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.880]   And by the way, this would allow them also sell location information
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.680]   Because it's isp's not just landline based but also cell phone companies
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:53.120]   So verizon and t-mobile and sprinting at and t who know where you are it's everything could sell your location information
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.520]   And I don't think that people really get that this would be
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.080]   You know what time you wake up at
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:03.440]   Where you were when you woke up what websites you've surfed what people you follow it's
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:08.960]   Communicating with like where that traffic is going back to how long it takes you to get somewhere
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:14.720]   It's it's information about everything in your life. I've got a living scale. How much I weigh
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.800]   Isp no I tweet that so they you know, that's available
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.360]   Sundry
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.040]   But it would be nice if you could make the choice to tweet that rather than just give them the
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.320]   Least know because if you know that you could choose to say if you have if you're in a place where there's a choice
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.400]   Some people don't even have a choice right they may only have one isp provider that is in their area
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.440]   At least then if you have a choice then they'll say like elaska said that they're not going to be using this information
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.080]   Signing it. Yeah, so people they're like, oh, okay, that sounds good
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.680]   And that would at least give a little bit of competition where if you know verizon says well
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:52.320]   We're gonna sell your data. It would just give us a little bit more power in that our isp's sonic that definitely does not sell that
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:57.680]   That's actually a very good point you choose. So now your opportunity is to choose the right isp
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.000]   Well, if you have the
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   If you have a choice
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.200]   And then as this will likely I would guess
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.520]   Will turn out to be is if you if you can afford that choice because it's a good point
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.480]   This is probably going to be a sort of situation where you're going to have those
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:18.480]   You know, boutique. Oh, you think they'll rebate you the the money they make from no
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.160]   To have that choice. I think you could pay extra
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.960]   Outside of the phone book
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.240]   They're probably can't have to pay money so that I wouldn't be in the I know it's not annoying
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.320]   I think they do that candidates
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:35.520]   If they offered it at all how did it work before october because like I don't think we really were aware of this
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:41.440]   Prior to us right like I don't know if this is a radical change the other thing that I worry about with with transparency
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.440]   Maybe I'm just a little too cynical about you know how companies go about things
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:52.480]   But if if transparency were imposed on them, I just imagine it being you know the 10,000th word in the yula
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:57.760]   When you when you're clicking, you know, robotically through things like even if they do have to ask
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.320]   That's the notification that we would have gotten
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.040]   Here's here's an article
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.040]   From the electronic frontier foundation
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:09.360]   Jeremy gallelujah wrote the five things and this is the
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.280]   Subset of the total things the correct five creepy things your ISP could do
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.000]   And the reason these are credible because they've done them all
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.360]   Sell your data marketers hijack your searches
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:23.760]   Snoop through your traffic. Do you remember the neb you add and the form?
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:28.480]   Controversy, this was software we talked a lot about this on security now that
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:32.320]   Isp's were using including here's an article about british tel
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:37.280]   Telecom using it to to insert ads into your surfing
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:42.320]   Yeah, so they get marketing information about you like facebook does and instead of it being on facebook
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.320]   It's everywhere you go
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:49.920]   Pre-installing software on your phone to record vurls you visit atnt and sprint and t-mobile did that
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.400]   And injecting undetectable
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.400]   Undelievable tracking cookies. That's what for rising
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.440]   I mean to a certain extent
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.840]   This is a sort of situation where technology is moving faster than the laws have been able to keep up
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.080]   And that's that I think that's what we see that all the time now
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.360]   Yeah, and that's what makes this kind of discouraging is finally just in october
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.560]   They got their act together and they said you got to ask permission first
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:14.960]   We were so close and then their points. Yeah, they often say they just do it because they can not ask if they should
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.360]   And then how should that be enacted to that?
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:23.760]   I think that one if if anyone that that's in the house had this happened to them with all of their information kind of given back to them
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:28.320]   I think that would be the first time that they're like oh my goodness. How nefarious this could be how this could be
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.160]   Both
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.840]   No, no, no, that would be wrong
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.640]   But it's that thing is that wrong but effective
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:46.400]   Anybody got the number for the Turkish crime family we could call them and ask them by the way to put a pin in an upcoming story
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.960]   Undelievable traffic cookie. I forecast that that will be android's dessert for the letter
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:59.760]   Good we were talking before the show and I guess we'll do it again about what android o could be named what what dessert
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.840]   And they're really a limited number but rob has this has a pic that I think is
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.520]   I gotta say I think that's so that's gonna be the wild card. I don't know if that's gonna be the first choice
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.680]   I'm hoping for should we talk about an hour?
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:17.760]   That's a tease we'll also talk about the Turkish crime family
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:24.080]   That's a tease and I am mad as heck and apparently somebody else is because my my rundown's been defaced
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:30.000]   With the words why what the hell is wrong with you google google's taken is that was that you karsten?
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.360]   Carsten amis at google's dropping sms support from hangouts
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.520]   Why
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:41.440]   We'll talk about that in two just a bit our show today brought to you by blue apron
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.840]   I got a box waiting for me. I think we're gonna go out to dinner after the show, but
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:51.040]   All right tomorrow. I'll have a box waiting for me with a blue apron meal ready to go
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:56.560]   I love blue apron we get the box and you get to choose by the way it's not a subscription you choose what weeks you get it in each
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.880]   refrigerated box
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:03.920]   Blue apron will send you three different meals that you can make yourself include the recipe card and every ingredient
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.640]   So you know even if and it's not more than you need like if it's got if it needs two teaspoons of soy sauce
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.200]   You get a little bottle with two teaspoons of soy sauce, which I love
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:18.080]   Everything you need ingredients you've never tried before and a meal that will blow your mind they have plans for couples
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.640]   And they have plans for families with more kid-friendly ingredients
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:26.880]   You pick the day you get the box you don't it's not automatic
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.360]   You pick the meals that you want in the box
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:36.800]   And you're gonna save money you'll say blue apron is less expensive than shopping at the grocery store and it's better food
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:42.160]   It's always fresh. It's from local farms. The meat is fresh. The fish is fresh from sustainable fisheries
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.960]   uh the the beef chicken and pork come from responsibly raised animals
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:53.120]   The farms they use use regenerative farming practices is they're really trying to build a more sustainable food system
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:58.560]   So you have the good feeling of knowing that you're getting amazing fresh food without the middleman
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.640]   Which saves you money a grocery store is gonna be 60 percent more expensive than blue apron
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:08.880]   They delivered it. I'm sorry to hawaii in Alaska blue apron delivers to 99 percent of the continental United States
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:14.000]   Sorry, there's no weekly commitment you customize it based on your dietary preferences
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.840]   And there's you know what they're pointing out that they save food too because there's no waste if you need two scallions two carrots
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:24.160]   Whatever they're gonna send you what you need the only thing I said it wrong once if you need a clove of garlic
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.640]   They do send you the whole head. That's okay. I can always find a use for garlic
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:34.400]   Uh, yes, they don't want to peel the one clove off of a garlic to send that along
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:40.800]   What's on the menu this week? How about salmon pakata with orzo and broccoli pork chops and miso butter with bok choy and marinade of apple
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.960]   I have learned 12 ways to cook bok choy
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:47.920]   I didn't ever like bok choy until I got my blue apron box and now I am a bok choy master
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.200]   And it's good for you. It's a really good vegetable
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:56.800]   Vegetable chili and sweet baked sweet potatoes with crispy tortilla strips spicy
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:02.560]   shrimp coconut curry with cabbage and rice just look what's on the menu and order your first box
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:08.240]   You're gonna get your first three meals free with your first purchase and free shipping if you go to blue apron.com slash twit
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.920]   the meals on us
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.760]   blue apron
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.080]   Ooh short rib burgers on pretzel bonds
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.080]   When's that gonna be in my I think that's a they don't repeat more than once a year
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.200]   So that's the unfortunate thing
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.040]   But once you've cooked once you've cooked it, you know how so you can go and and make it again
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:28.160]   And your kids will say mommy I want that short rib burgers and pretzel buttons thing again and you'll have to say
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.880]   honey not till next year
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:35.280]   dot com slash twit actually I uh
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:40.080]   Having cooked that with blue apron. I do make I do make the recipes again because you have the recipe card now
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.080]   You know how the ingredients oh, that's so cool
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.120]   So it's really it's really expanded my repertoire
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:50.160]   So they call themselves the turkish crime family almost certainly not turkish
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.800]   Definitely not a family, but they are criminals
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.320]   They claim they have a quarter million
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:05.040]   I cloud accounts passwords and log in 250 million quarter billion quarter billion. I got it wrong quarter billion
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.600]   damn
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.520]   I I I cloud accounts
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:14.800]   And they're apparently blackmailing apple. They say if you don't pay the ransom by april seventh
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:20.560]   We will reset the passwords on those accounts and remotely wipe iphones what?
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:24.000]   But what do they want georgia
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.320]   Well, it's that's the best part is it's like 75 thousand dollars in in bitcoin or
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:34.320]   a hundred thousand dollars in itunes cards gift cards so
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:38.880]   You see an apple is a good deal right you're if you go on the streets and you're like
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.600]   iTunes card
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:48.560]   I got 75 thousand items car how much you want? It's kind of like dr. Evil, isn't it?
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.080]   Like I've got a quarter of a billion accounts. What do we want?
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.920]   $75,000
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:00.080]   Do more and then they're like okay, okay
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:03.920]   It's
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:08.800]   They would just sell them all the little cards or would you have one card that was like a hundred thousand dollars?
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:15.120]   I think they just have a lot of friends and they want to just gift people with songs and right
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:18.080]   This is a friendly group of people
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.800]   You're they're gonna wipe all of your accounts
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:27.040]   And then you get to replenish them with all of these cards that they give you later the turkish crime family apparently is very available to the media
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.880]   They there's a quote from motherboard. I just want I'm gonna add the accent
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.720]   I don't know really where they're from. I just want to lend money and they thought this would be interesting
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:41.960]   Report that lots of apple customers would be interested in reading and hearing is that what turkish people's own? No, they're not from turkey. That's just a lot of
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:47.840]   That's a Slavic. That's a generic Slavic. So they wrote to yeah generic slobbikics
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:52.960]   Are you willing to share a sample the data set an unnamed member of apple security team wrote to the hackers a week ago?
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:58.480]   Uh the hackers did in fact give a subset of the data 54
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:05.520]   Passwords to zd net zd net took the trouble of verifying that they were in fact passwords to iCloud accounts
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:11.760]   They weren't just random data and then they attempted to contact the account holders. They were able to get a hold of 10 of them
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:16.640]   So at least 10 were real in this set of 54
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:23.120]   Uh, they talked to the various people's most of these were old passwords
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.600]   Uh
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.480]   And like a three or four years old
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:35.840]   10 people, uh said they were accurate and have changed them the 10 people we spoke to says eating that were based in the uk and had uk
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.440]   cell phone numbers, but
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.440]   the turkish heck is collector
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:47.600]   Says well, we just have um did the in groups. It's bundled so we gave you a uk bundle, but that it's all over world
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.560]   uh, they also
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:56.320]   All 10 confirmed they had used the same passwords since opening their iCloud account. So we don't know how old they are
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:02.880]   Most of them four or five years old doesn't it? However, this is the weird one one of the people
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:09.360]   You what your what what the presumption is at this point is that apple wasn't breached somebody else was breached
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.840]   And people got passwords that were had been reused on iCloud and then the turkish hacker group
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:21.840]   family, um like reverse engineered it probably were probably did some sort of automated system of saying is this an iCloud password
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.720]   one of the people though that they confirmed
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.360]   That they talked to
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:32.800]   Actually three people said their iCloud email address and password were unique to iCloud had not been used on any other site
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:39.200]   Which would kind of indicate that maybe iCloud was breached
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:43.520]   Though they they said that they they didn't say that they breached apple
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:50.080]   They explicitly said they did not right? They said that they didn't and our memories are so faulty like if you asked me how many things
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:57.080]   I've signed up with I have no clue. I have absolutely no clue. I can barely remember use one password put on two factor authentication
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:02.800]   Well, I don't want to I don't want to oversimplify this but exactly like it seems as though
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.640]   The way to protect yourself if you're worried about this is to change your password
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:13.760]   To something unique. Yeah, you're hopefully not using on another service or use one password to remember that or yeah password manager like one password
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.920]   Last pass and then turn on two factor authentication because even if they have the password
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:22.400]   And if they use it if they have two factor, they're not going to get that you need to do that
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.880]   So do that and if you don't have two factor on turn it on
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.000]   Things like we're all going to be okay here
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.600]   And these this is the sort of advice that I think all of us give out to our friends and family all the time
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.200]   um
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:42.640]   And so it should be a fairly easy fix and I don't think apple's gonna set on email telling everybody to change their passwords or anything
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.200]   But if you're watching this show and if you're worried about it
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:50.800]   Like that's what you should do and you can protect yourself fairly easily. Is that an oversimplification of things or no?
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:55.120]   I think you're you should still change the password but between two factor everywhere you can
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:25:00.160]   Does the article indicate um how much zd net was able to raise in their own ransom from these 10
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.720]   I got five i2c guys. I'm glad to give you
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:09.360]   They actually mocked this group. They said based on our experience and our interactions with the group and its members
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.160]   It's evident the group is naive and inexperienced. Oh, man
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.680]   You don't say that to hackers. It really feels like a troll though
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.560]   It's almost a troll based on its grandiose claims
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.480]   And it's cherry picking of media outlets because they called media outlets
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:27.760]   Uh, they also said when we began asking the group questions the conversation quickly turned to whether
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:35.360]   CBS news which owns zd net would cover this too. Yeah, uh, can you get those on cbs news? I
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.960]   Really like that scut the pelly. He's a great guy
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:45.360]   I don't I mean the group also appears according to zd net disorganized and unable to maintain order with its own ranks
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.360]   Seen by the apparent firing of one of its members who ran the twitter account
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:53.520]   And weaving a red cape at a ball right now the dude the author of this
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.160]   I don't want to out them or anything. Yes, they did
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:00.960]   Yes, that's and i'm not gonna say it can't seem to say a message is evidenced by the need to correct the record after reporters
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.440]   Quote misunderstood the situation abritch
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:09.200]   Means this is a paste bin quote from the group the hacker. What is it the turkish turkish crime?
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.960]   Crime family
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.800]   It's like don't ease the pronto tcf
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:20.400]   Hey, abritch means nothing in 2017 when you can just pull the exact same user information and smaller scales through companies that aren't as secure
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.480]   Ah, that's what they're kind of saying
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.680]   Maybe they you know what they might have gotten as a password vaults, right?
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:29.280]   It would identify it as I cloud information possible
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:35.040]   zd net says we can't be sure this is something big but based on reporting are reporting. We can't say that it's nothing
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:39.200]   So that's why we're either massive or nothing
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.400]   I'm gonna vote for me. What about for man?
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:46.480]   But it's always a good idea turn on two factor change your password. Nothing wrong with that. Yep
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.600]   And that's a but that's a good template for future
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:55.440]   Yeah, because that is a real threat because if you have somebody's eye cloud account, you can wipe their mac you can wipe their iphone
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:00.400]   Yeah, you could be a bad bad person. Yeah matt honed and notoriously went through that when he was at wire if you're mad
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.560]   and he lost like
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:07.200]   A lot of pictures of his children and just like a ton of they can wipe your mac
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:13.120]   Well, they did go back wipe this is specifically because he did not have two factor turned on he was using his
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:17.680]   Uh the same password for iCloud and gmail if I remember correctly it was a sophisticated
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.640]   Amazon apple
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.760]   Uh
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:27.360]   So they so they got the last four digits of the credit card number by a social engineering hack
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:31.520]   I think with apple and then they went to amazon. They said we're changing the credit car
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:36.160]   It was a complicated multistate like a back door thing through amazon. I remember this. Yeah, it was
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.280]   reverse social engineering or matt
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.560]   And if the irony is this group that was doing it to matt
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:46.880]   Had only one goal. They wanted his twitter account because he had a three letter twitter handle
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:52.800]   Yeah, and matt is a valuable twitter handle. It turns out. I don't know if this is still true
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.680]   But in those days three years ago people would pay for that stuff kids wanted clever
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:05.120]   Handles, right there was a whole thing to get clever three letter handles. Yeah, so I worry for Alex will helms future
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:11.200]   What's what's his just Alex Alex? Right? Yeah, that's a nice. That's a nice one. I'm glad I didn't do at leo
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:16.640]   I could have you know, I joined early enough there were no other leos, but I went for my full name and i'm grateful at this point
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:23.600]   Uh, I cloud may have docked speaking of i cloud a journalist twitter attacker. This is an interesting slant
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.920]   on
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:31.440]   The story we already reported on kurt eichenwald who remember is the reporter for vanity fair
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.080]   who apparently upset
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.280]   a troll
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:39.520]   The trolls he's a kurt's epileptic the troll set him an epigenetic
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:46.640]   uh, he's got an enemy gift that that looked like a strobe. Yeah, yes. Yep hoping to send him into uh seizure
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.880]   and uh
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:54.960]   And so the we found out how this happened and that's kind of why the verge is saying i cloud may have docked
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:01.360]   twitter attacker because this was the this was the steps that the police used first. They sent a quarter to twitter
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.320]   Saying, you know, well, we know this account
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:11.680]   Uh, so twitter it was at jew_goldstein, which give you some idea of the the kind of person this is
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:14.960]   Uh twitter said, all right. Yeah, yeah, we'll give you all the data
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:20.400]   Uh, but the data showed only a dummy email address along with an ip address and phone numbers
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.160]   for a
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.720]   prepaid track phone, which is normally anonymous, but
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:31.200]   The the guy foolishly i should say this i put it in his iphone six. Yeah
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.920]   And so then they said well
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:38.640]   Let's go to apple to find out what i cloud accounts are associated with this phone number and apples at all yeah, we know who this is
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.680]   And that's how they got the guy
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.520]   Yeah, uh
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.800]   And so i or a ledge i should say allegedly
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:51.600]   But it is important to understand that you know, this is an example of
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.800]   There's information about yet they're all over the place
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:30:01.280]   Yeah, and then they use that information from icloud to be able to read his messaging where and his search is where he searched for
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:07.040]   How to induce an epileptic seizure and someone and you know messages of actually saying i'd like to
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:11.360]   You know have him have a seizure. Oh, he was sending dms to people saying i sent him
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.400]   Ha ha sent him a yeah bragging about it. Yeah, i hope he dies
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:19.200]   He really uh hurt the guy. I mean it said i was doing a little bit of research
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.240]   um
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:24.160]   While coming up here and apparently the guy had trouble speaking for weeks after word
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.280]   I mean he really really genuinely damaged the guy pretty badly
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:32.960]   He's as bad as an assault really. Yeah, it's almost it's like going through like an electro shop kind of your brain. He assaulted
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:36.000]   He assaulted this guy. That's that is an assault. Yeah, absolutely
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.240]   And that that's i think what is the most fascinating aspect about this to me is
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:45.920]   It's it's one of the first situations that i can think of where we're seeing trolling on the internet
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.320]   That has a real implication
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:55.280]   Uh in the real world and then there's the evidence to tie it because so often we hear that these trolls online have real world
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.800]   Impacts, right?
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.640]   And now here's the evidence to see it
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:03.680]   And and this wasn't something this man could avoid he was just scrolling through his at mentions
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.480]   He didn't have to go into it wasn't even the first time it had happened
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.240]   He had been attacked a couple other times i think they dropped his ipad
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:16.080]   He dropped his ipad before he saw he kind of knew what was up there and he dropped his ipad
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:21.040]   Yeah, so there's some crazy thing that happened with the japanese tv show several years ago
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.680]   Was it yeah
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:29.200]   It was a pokemon show. Yeah, we're a whole bunch of japanese kids were put into some kind of a
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:35.360]   Trans or a seizure in terrible. Yeah, yeah, like a tv drug get them to go to their father's wallet pull money out and really
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:40.240]   Because i would be interested in that. Yeah, there are certain video games if you play them before you play them
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.400]   There's a warning about a lot of people
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.680]   Because of that right exactly exactly because that was without intent
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:49.120]   Right. Yo, that was entirely without intent. Yeah, it was entirely
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.960]   That wasn't going after anybody. Yeah, right right. We could choose innocent
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:56.000]   Ish ish
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.640]   Oh, they're going to be coming after you on twitter now. Oh man. Just letting
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.960]   Know by the way the the fellow was arrested
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:08.960]   And has been charged with cyber stalking and we'll see what happens. We'll follow that story because
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:14.400]   That is that is terrible and uh, yeah, it's it. This is why we can't have nice things
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.960]   That's the this is why we can't have nice things segment of the show
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:21.200]   Um
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:26.400]   I think we got it all we got all the we got the apple section unless you want to talk about augmented reality
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:32.240]   We talk about this every week. I'm tired of it. Although there's now more and more evidence that scoble may get a dinner in paris on me
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.800]   I know i'm i remember that's stirred
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:41.040]   Uh scoble says there's going to be a clear iphone at the end of the year that is not going to happen june june
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:45.680]   You stated june. Oh really i'm off the hook. I think you're okay. And I said if that happens
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.840]   I don't think it's going to happen in june or this year
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:52.800]   I will buy your dinner at the restaurant of your choice. So he chose a restaurant in paris joel
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.240]   Abish on he's good taste. That's good taste. He's gonna do it. She's the wheeze
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:01.760]   I'm praying that apple doesn't it's funny now. I'm now i'm praying apple doesn't do anything interesting
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:05.040]   That's why you don't want to talk about it brings up some some a little bit of post-traumatic
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:11.360]   There there's I mean in my mind there's no no no at all dispute that apple's working on this
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.960]   Tim Cook said at many times they've probably spent billions on it. They've hired a lot of people
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:22.880]   The real question in my mind is does apple still have the mojo that the company had when it changed the world
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:28.800]   with the iMac and the ipod the iphone arguably the ipad
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:32.640]   Maybe the apple no not the apple watch no
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:36.960]   It's been a slow decline right the ipad apple watch have not changed the world
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:43.760]   But but apple used to maybe one steve when was only when steve was there apple had that magic where they could take a product that
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:48.160]   Everybody knew about mp3 players are not new and do something magic that made it
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:54.080]   Amazing and that's I mean there are countless tragedies associated with steves on timely death
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.320]   But one of you know, this is this is one of them
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.080]   I mean and it's like when he passed away
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:04.400]   I think there was widespread, you know, hope that there was probably three or four years of awesome in the pipeline
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.920]   And maybe that's really haven't seen the thing and I remember walter isakson's book
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:12.000]   Um, which came out right around the time that he passed away. It's been over five years now
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:19.760]   Um, he said that he had fixed television. He didn't say exactly what it is. Yeah, so we've got that one looks right there
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.560]   I could go get it and um, you know if over five years after steve passed away
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:29.520]   There hasn't I agree with it has been nothing other than size and case colored changes
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:34.960]   You know bigger and smaller iPads and bigger and smaller iPhones and red ones and green ones
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:39.920]   I mean, I know the tim cook and I know that johnny. I've and I know everybody at apple knows this
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:46.960]   And I think that there's a lot of pressure and they want really badly to do the next big thing
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:51.440]   But but the question is can you throw money at something like that?
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:56.080]   Can you just hire people and make it happen and and what would be the timing to that?
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.120]   Right like should like and they tim cook kind of said
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:02.880]   I'm gonna go through and it's probably gonna be something more software related than hardware related
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:08.720]   So it seems like they're gonna first try to do something with the phones that we already have upgraded to a certain capacity
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.360]   Yeah, I know it sparkles. I know
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.080]   Here we go. Go ahead. Show it
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.480]   Sparkle sparkle it flows
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.280]   It's
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.760]   Yeah
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.760]   That's uh, that's a nice iphone case
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.640]   Wow, it's a little girly. It's got a little pink car
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:31.760]   It's just a little girly. Yeah like a 12 year old girl. I know that's about that's about where I
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:36.560]   I stay is about a 12 year old girl. Did you did you buy this at 21 forever?
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.160]   I I actually
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:42.880]   I actually looked it up. I was searching for a water case with sparkles. I'm really loving this
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:48.640]   I just kept on i'm buying one. Are you buying one? That's it. I'm getting one. You can get one with like black sparkles, right?
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.720]   Family sparkle. Family sparkles and skulls.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:56.480]   Little penis is floating around. Yeah, no? Okay. Um, what were you saying?
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:02.400]   Man, I'm sorry. I do this at Georgia every time. I'm so sorry
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:08.160]   Um, just jealous because uh because of your manly sparkles, right? Um
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.800]   A.R. Amla sparkles
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.800]   A.R. Oh, they yeah
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.640]   They spend the money and make it happen. Can they they could definitely spend the money?
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:21.280]   Is they're gonna make it like a Pokemon go basically, right? Some sort of thing where you look through the phone
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:28.320]   We've we've had A.R. Browsers for at least three years. That's not that's not really like Pokemon goes not really A.R.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.840]   That's like an image
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:35.840]   supplanted on top of a background. A.R. Your camera is taking a picture of the street and the little Pokemon's on it. Yeah
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:42.000]   I assume like you see the the the lamps and you go to another length and you see all of it in different language
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.800]   You see your friend and your like contact name
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:49.280]   The exploit diagram would be would be actually more of something that would be software related and
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:53.920]   You're excited a little well, you got sparkles
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:59.200]   So they're saying that the A.R. Advance is a software related rather than hardware. That's what he said. Yeah
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.200]   That right now
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:06.080]   Yeah, yeah, you didn't say that not in the future but you know scobles assist that there's a they're doing a deal with Zeiss
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:09.600]   And that Zeiss is uh making glasses
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:15.360]   For them and that's if for A.R. That's kind of the form it kind of has contact lenses or glasses
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:19.920]   Right. Yeah, it's gonna be good because nobody wants wants to walk around with a hollens on there
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.080]   Yeah, we're just holding your phone
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:26.480]   This is not good. No, that's not a great. Well, it is with the sparkles. Oh, thank you
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:30.080]   It really kind of is a good look with the sparkles. Yeah, it's really cool
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:35.280]   You say Morgan like rocking the sparkles. Totally. Yeah, love Morgan. Morgan. Well, I think to a certain extent
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:39.280]   I think we all kind of like need to need to calm down a little bit here
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:42.000]   because really
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Most companies have like one
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.680]   Like zero groundbreaking products like you know history making products
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:51.440]   Apple has been pretty fortunate in that they had you know their original
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:59.360]   Uh, you know max then he had the iMac then he had the ipod which by the way doesn't really exist anymore
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:02.320]   Outside of an ipod touch was essentially an iphone then he had the iphone
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.080]   So I guess in some ways we've been kind of spoiled by recent
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:10.960]   Crazy they've they have a run that no other company. Yeah, possibly max
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.200]   So just being realistic that's not sustainable
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:18.400]   And if you look at all of those things whether it's the you know the original mac
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.960]   Whether it's the iMac whether it's the ipod or the ipod or the ipod
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.720]   They all happen under one person's watch well
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:28.000]   They all happen under one person's watch but they also were things that existed that apple took and modified right and let's be real
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.280]   AR right now sucks. Yeah virtual reality right now. It's not in the place far, but not great, right?
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:38.480]   These are early adopter things so if if you want to go by apple's history
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.280]   Then microsoft has to make like a competent
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:45.440]   Holo lens and then apple will find the consumer
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:48.880]   Uh angle that fits like our culture and lifestyle, right?
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:52.720]   They were agenda shattering i'd say with the ipad i don't think there was much
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.120]   I mean, I guess there were some tabularies
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.120]   I've had some pretty big there were some tabular things
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:57.600]   It might not have like
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.800]   You know what happened the ipad is a big iphone for for all that's what happened
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.600]   And they built the ipad before the iphone, right?
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:08.880]   So that's what happened which is that these got big enough that people didn't need the ipad
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:12.000]   And so I think that's why ipad sales it's tapasails and generators
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.120]   Part of it is people hold on the ipads for a really long time. Yeah
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:18.720]   I think what happened it was an intermediate product
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.200]   It was between your phone and your laptop or phone and desktop
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:21.840]   That's part of it
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.800]   And that as the phones got bigger and more capable people didn't
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:29.360]   I mean no one wants to buy an extra 500 dollar intermediate product. I've got a phone
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.120]   I got a laptop. What do I need an ipad for?
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:34.400]   So I don't I would be very surprised if they come back
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.520]   In if your theory is correct that people just you know, they've got it
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.680]   At some point they're gonna get a new one, right?
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:42.000]   And so sales will come back, but I don't think that's gonna happen
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.120]   What would happen though if schools started to really take in for ipads as they become more affordable
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:50.400]   And things with split playgrounds and then they did briefly
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:53.680]   And I think chromebooks completely stole all that initiative
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:54.960]   Because they were much more affordable
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.160]   Because they're a lot cheaper
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:00.640]   You're maintain cheaper. Yeah, we're a laptop board, but we're laptops going
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:04.080]   They're going touch-free two and one going to go into commercials, right?
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:04.720]   I agree
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:10.800]   So all stuff is converging so I think there's still hope for an ipad like product for apple to to dominate on
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.280]   And ipad stills are still
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.680]   Way way way bigger than max sales
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:18.160]   Uh, you know, even with their decline, right?
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:22.480]   And apple by the way, we will talk about what apple announced this week. Unfortunately, it wasn't new max
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.400]   No
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.400]   Or even really that exciting new ipads
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.440]   No, it was just a red iphone and new bands and yeah
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.960]   A tablet that really was the it's the cheap ipad
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:38.640]   Yeah, the one you get if you can't uh, you know, you want school. This is one for schools, right?
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:40.800]   It's replaced with the ipad air 2
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:44.480]   Uh, and it's the 399 what I wanted was a pro version of the mini
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.960]   Yeah, if anybody else with a stylus
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.600]   So the rumor is we're gonna so yeah
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.000]   The rumor we do need I think there will be a new mini
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:57.040]   I want that and I think there will be a new ipad pro and the rumor is it will there will be among other
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.120]   new ipad pros one that is
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:03.760]   The same size as the 9.7 inch ipad but with a 10 and a half inch screen. They're gonna reduce the bezel
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:07.520]   That's the one you want because I think do you have you ever tried the 12.9?
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:11.920]   That's that's what I have. I love it's so big. Yeah, but see I like to draw so I love all the
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:17.120]   Actually, you should get this this is big. It can also it can also double essentially you get the you get the um
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:21.920]   Keyboard with the with the with the pro and it essentially starts replacing your laptop for like
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:26.080]   Big problem like doesn't have windowing it has like little pains
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:28.560]   But if you don't have windowing are you really a computer?
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:29.760]   Can you really use it?
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:34.800]   I don't I have like a lots of ipads and they just kind of lie in an ipad graveyard cool
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:42.320]   And I I use I use my air for I use my Mac and then I use my phone and really I almost never will use my ipad because of that
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:44.320]   Like there was pencil support
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:50.240]   Maybe yeah, your case I figured out is made by a company called ocassus okay as us
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:53.600]   And here's the one I'm gonna get it has a built-in diamond ring
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:59.360]   That I they have all kinds here
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:05.360]   Uh and and all of them have the liquid backs that uh, how about a little fairy? I like that one
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:10.080]   See this has the little heart. I like that's the cherry blossom festival. That would actually really
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:13.680]   Yeah
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:16.640]   See I thought that some of them didn't have the liquid for the back for some of them
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:22.080]   I don't think the one with the ring does this kind of reminds me that I'm probably gonna be real nerdy here for a second
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:28.160]   But the nexus for had that kind of holographic like sparkly back. Yeah, and I like that
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:33.360]   You know actually there's press we're gonna have uh and I'm not gonna be here because I'm going on a little mini vacation
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.480]   But wednesday we're gonna be streaming them samsung event lot. Yes
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:40.000]   I think the same I don't know but I think from the rumors
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.400]   I've seen the samsung galaxy s8 will be a really interesting phone
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:48.560]   And and you know you could argue there's nothing new that you could do on a phone
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:51.440]   But I think that there's some some things this is going to be a beautiful phone
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:56.320]   Uh with some new features including I think some of the features apples expected to announce later in the year
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:02.160]   That getting rid of the home button in that case getting rid of the home button having a maybe a fingerprint reader underneath the screen
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.400]   I don't know or maybe on the on-off switch
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:08.560]   I'm I'm gonna be watching with interest to see what samsung does on wednesday. We'll have a live stream of that
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.640]   What time is that karsten is it nine or ten?
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.280]   eight a.m
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:22.240]   Eleven a.m. I don't think samsung will do it, but I really hope they spend some time talking about their revamped battery safety procedures
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:27.040]   They will they already did a press no no they already did a presser remember
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:31.600]   Yeah, and they have a six step program in fact they've been telling other phone companies should do this
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:36.000]   They're gonna x-ray the batteries. I don't know if they're the ones that should be telling other companies how to do this
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:42.320]   Well, you know what that might be a differentiator for them, you know, we've already been through
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:47.280]   We're gonna really do it right. We learned
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.440]   20 different ways how not to make batteries
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:53.840]   I'd still like to see them talk more about that because that they're sure they will
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:57.520]   They have to really like well there were some manufacturing errors and it really wasn't our fault
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:00.560]   Well, no, they have to pay attention more now
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:06.480]   I think if they don't reassure consumers this is because I you know I I gave my daughter my old s7
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:09.200]   Yeah, and her friend said oh you got the blow up phone
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.040]   Yeah, and I had to explain her no no
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:14.640]   But the problem is every samsung now is perceived as the phone that blows up
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:18.240]   They've got a really they're gonna have to bend over backwards to reassure people that the s8
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:22.640]   Wonderful thing is that people don't steal them now. Yeah, no market
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:28.720]   I'm gonna leave that phone. Sam's also will have a new voice assistant called bixby. What do you guys think of bixby?
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:30.880]   Makes me think of the whole thing about bixby
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:32.800]   No
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:40.080]   The we have two people the answer used to work at nuance remember sam's son's s voice used nuance and s voice was trash awful
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:45.760]   Can we talk about how bad that was why did they put a voice assistant on a phone that already has googles?
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:50.320]   Yeah, are they gonna get in an argument with each other like bixby and google voice is
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.960]   That bill bixby was on
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:56.000]   My money's on him. Oh god
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.960]   I mean well, you know to
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:04.880]   There's a lot of people who buy samsung phones and don't really i'm android right i mean
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:09.360]   There's a spong with folks who are like oh you have an android phone. No, I have a galaxy
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:11.280]   You're like it runs android
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:15.760]   No, no, no, but that's exactly right and that's why people skin it because they don't want you to think it's it's
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:19.520]   I mean as far as I'm gonna say the pixel is the google phone to get the android phone again
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:25.760]   But I will be very interested in samsung is number two after apple. They are of still an absolute presence
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.920]   um, so
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.520]   Despite their ford pinna moment
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:36.480]   They had a four pinna moment, but you'll still buy fords. Yeah people still take time and all but they did retire the people's silver and classic coke
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:40.560]   Eventually, yeah, they know we buy us pintoza right that's right. Right
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:46.400]   Um april so so this wednesday, which is march 29th will be the announcement
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.840]   They predict it'll be in eight late april. Maybe april 21st
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:54.400]   And some interesting looking colors to black gray and silver
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:58.560]   And is this the one that's gonna have three cameras on it one specifically for like retinol and face
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:00.800]   face recognition
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.680]   Probably I would guess that's that they will do that in this one
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:08.480]   They put as you may remember they put uh, I I recognition in the note seven the
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:14.160]   And the galaxy s3 but then they scrapped it after that they kind of add features and take them away
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:17.680]   Uh, a little googly. Yeah, there will be a
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:19.680]   5.7 inch
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:26.000]   S8 we think according to the rumors, but I think it's very interesting and there'll be a 6.2 inch version an s8 plus
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:30.640]   That seems to me too big there's a point where it's too large. I think six inches
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:34.560]   Too large. I have a purse that's and I can even think sometimes when i'm holding it my phone
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.400]   This is a little bit large
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:42.320]   And speaking that I think it would be great prank leo for just one s3 to go into public with this thing and then take a call on it
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:44.720]   because that would just
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:48.800]   It would be such a spoof you mean with this. Oh, yeah, just sort of like picking it up
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:51.440]   Taking the studio the surface studio. Yeah, yeah
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:57.920]   It was just sort of smooth. Let's do a bit for the new screen savers and I will be carrying my surface studio
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:00.880]   You can say it's the new phone. Hello
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:05.520]   How big is too big you have on your shoulder like a boomba
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:08.800]   Hang it there. It's like yeah
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:12.480]   You know what it'll probably happen. We'll watch the event go. Oh
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:18.720]   It's just another phone. It's hard to come up with something new. I think the same problem apple's gonna face the same problem this fall
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:22.560]   It's hard to do anything new. It's a slab of glass with rounded corners
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:25.280]   What what are you gonna do this different?
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.440]   Bixby no

[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:12.720]   Um, and thank you for giving me an excuse to go to random house and say let's do this cool thing
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:15.680]   Because we did it once before when I was on quit a couple of years ago
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:19.840]   And it was just really fun, you know and you're is it okay to say this working on a new book?
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:22.240]   Yeah, I got it. I've got a new book coming out this summer
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:26.720]   Um, which I'd like to talk about maybe we get a little bit faster to it. Yeah, I'd love to
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:33.200]   Um, there's quite a bit to say about it and you know, um, we may have more to say about it when i'm next here
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.840]   Uh, sci-fi? Yes
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:40.000]   Near very very near future set nine seconds
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:46.480]   Whenever you read the book it takes place nine seconds from them
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:48.960]   I like this idea. I was just have to read it real quick
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:51.600]   I was talking this morning at the radio show about how science fiction
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:55.600]   It signals to viewers that it's the future
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:58.800]   And it's of course if it's the distant future spaceships and you know
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:04.160]   But if it's the near future is harder and for a long time and they just if it was a black president and you knew it was the future
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.800]   Yeah, that doesn't work anymore. What they were wearing tunics
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:15.200]   Yeah, gentlemen's in fact they did that on she remember that with the scarlet joe hanson as the artificial intelligence
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:19.840]   Yeah, it was the near future and the only way you could tell was they wore
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:24.720]   Did I say him she said she sure some pronouns. Yeah, they're pants are high, right?
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:33.040]   It's a future where they're now they're wearing the pants high. Yeah, are they now they are they're wearing really high fashion very predictive that
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:39.280]   Shair styles fashion cell phones, right? Mm-hmm often they have clear cell phones in the future
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:41.840]   Like
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:44.560]   You know
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:46.560]   Something yeah
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:51.760]   Far in the parallel universe that's a problem because if you're making a science fiction movie today and you use anything that looks like a
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:55.600]   Cell phone you date yourself. It means like having a wide tie. Yeah, but I look at wall street
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:54:00.400]   Michael Douglas and wall street. He's holding one of those giant phones. Yeah, it looks like ancient history. Oh, yeah
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:04.400]   I don't know if anybody saw get out, but everyone that loved get out. I have a
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:08.960]   Windows phone. That's how little I know I noticed that too. Yeah, I love the movie
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:14.960]   It's a great movie, but oh you must see I have to see it. The best movie ever. It's a new genre comedy horror
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:21.040]   Actually, I guess that's not a new genre, but it's a really great movie, but you're right. They've got surfaces. Yeah surface tablets
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:26.160]   At one point you're sending a text on a Microsoft Windows phone. It's like yeah
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:29.680]   And then he calls his buddy and his buddy picks up on a Windows phone and it's like dude
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:36.880]   You just know yeah the logo's like always conveniently like I just heard it on my zoom. Yeah
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:40.240]   That's how you know it's not the future
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:48.960]   And also here Nathan all of us Giles we love having Nathan and studio with us and we are having more of him now
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:54.240]   Yeah, all the time you could find a higher me. I hired him. No going back now. I stole you away from the journal
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:58.480]   I feel like pretty good about that. Yeah, Nate. Oh gee although you'll still be doing some work for them
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:01.280]   I know for I'm gonna be pitching some freelance stuff for me
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:05.040]   Yeah, and you're still doing your podcast your little kitchen table version of this show
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:12.080]   Well, not quite this show, but uh, yeah, I'm I'm doing a podcast called buzzkill with my friends mark million from bloomberg and brine
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:17.120]   Chen from the new york times and we spent about a half hour talking about tech politics and pop culture
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:23.280]   And if any one of the three of us gets bored with this subject to hand we hit a little buzzer and it kills a conversation
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:26.880]   We move on. Oh, I love that. Yeah, so we eat that here
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:32.240]   Like the gong part of like a show. Yeah, everyone talks really fast and tries to be really punchy
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:35.840]   Guys every time sports comes up right. It's the buzzer really?
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:38.880]   That's the rock there about sports
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:42.640]   Someone go around and take out the batteries of someone else's buzzer. No, they're pressing it
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:48.880]   And they can't actually it's a laptop right in between all of us. And so yeah, yeah, that's a great idea for it's on sound cloud
[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:51.040]   I do this google play tune in
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:56.640]   A lot a lot of scary scary to be a guest on that show though. Well, so far
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:00.160]   I wonder why
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:06.000]   Right now it's just three of us, but at some point someone will have to you know getting the book on there. Yeah, step up
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:09.040]   So if you want to get in on that sure if I can get
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:12.880]   Couple of seconds man. It's like the gong show
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:20.400]   There is just really yeah Chuck Chuck. I saw that you know, ci spy and game guy
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:23.680]   I know ci assassin. Was he really a ci assassin?
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:27.600]   Hand imagine I like the sound of it. Or was he nutty? Probably not true
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:32.960]   He claims he was he was even a movie called. Yeah, my dangerous mind or something like that
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:38.080]   Well, he took the secret to his grade. I don't think so, but
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:41.120]   There's why things that have happened, you know
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:41.520]   I like that
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:47.920]   I like the idea that we live in an interesting world and a world in which Chuck Barris of the gong show was actually a ci assassin that
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:51.040]   Tol time is much more interesting in the world. I think I inhabit salsa
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:53.840]   Yeah, I'd like that to be if you're gonna be a ci assassin
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:58.240]   You don't want to be you know, you don't you want to have good cover. That's a great cover
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:01.600]   Yeah, it's like hiding in plain sight. It's like it's never gonna be this guy
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:06.080]   You know, I would I would not fear him. Yes. He might gong me
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:10.480]   Instead he pulls out a you know a gun with a silencer and wax me
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:14.400]   Maybe that was like his signature thing before you off somebody's like here's the gong
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:22.800]   Last words for it by the dangerous mind evil dictators everywhere. Yeah, you just got so I don't
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:26.320]   It's so funny. I did not know about this till gizmodo wrote about it
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:30.320]   But maybe you've heard about the supreme court case impression products
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:32.960]   versus lexmark
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:38.320]   Impression products is a small 35 person shop that was refilling
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:40.800]   printer cartridges
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:46.160]   Actually 25 people they specialized in buying used printer cartridges and men remanufacturing them
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:54.880]   Lexmark the printer company had been suing other re manufacturers that decided to add impression of the case in 2012 five years ago
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:57.600]   everyone else settled
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:04.800]   Except for the little impressions product and they fought it and now they're in the supreme
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:10.240]   Court the arg oral argon C a thing like that because I remember less
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:16.000]   Lessing learn less than used to talk about the fact that the dm ca could be perverted to things as bizarre as people suing
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.720]   Because you made ink from my printer. So this is a dm ca
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:23.920]   Wow, and it's going to the supreme court. It already is they had oral arguments this week. Wow
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:25.920]   um
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:29.360]   Now here's ronald man writing in scotus blog
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:34.640]   He says unfortunately, I don't think many people left the courtroom knowing much more about the case than they did with the editor
[00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:42.240]   Perhaps the justices wore themselves out with so much incisive questioning in the microsoft versus baker case from the morning
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:44.640]   but apparently the
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:48.560]   The justices were kind of baffled by the by the whole thing
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:52.800]   Um, the case involves the doctrine of exhaustion
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:59:00.640]   That's worse than a buzzer and a podcast. Yeah under which patent holders rights to enforce his patent or ordinarily run out
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:08.240]   The moment the patent holder sells the object in other words if I say i've got a patent on ink cartridges and sell you the ink cartridge
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:13.920]   Well, that's it. Mm-hmm. Now you own the ink cartridge you can do what you want with it. Yeah. Yeah. So the question is
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:19.040]   Is our lek smark's rights to the cartridges exhausted when it sells them?
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:23.680]   But lek smark has shrink wrap on there that says you're not buying this cartridge
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:31.760]   You're borrowing it. You will only let you use it if you agree by opening the cartridge that you will not refill it
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:34.400]   The you love it. Yeah
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:39.520]   By watching this thing open you have agreed. Yeah, we're gonna read this
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:40.000]   You see it
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:44.720]   with like, you know the syringe and my little ink and I try to refill the ink and get it everywhere
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:47.120]   Yeah, the real problem is
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:50.720]   That and I think this you know, this is probably a good thing
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:57.200]   I don't think this I wish the supreme court would address shrink wrap licenses or or actual patent rights
[00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:02.880]   Yeah, but they're they're probably gonna make it a very narrow decision because and that's the right thing to do
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:04.160]   You don't want to make
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:10.000]   Chief jesus roberts and steven briar probe repeatedly as to why patent holders can't just use con
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.120]   Cannot rely solely on contract law, but instead need patent law to enforce these restrictions
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.920]   um and
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.360]   After listening to the lexmark attorney's response
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:30.960]   Briar seemed confused. That's we all are it really I don't sure how much of this I want to read but they they did talk about it
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.400]   um
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:36.640]   According to scotas blog my take on this justices are well aware of the major implications here
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:41.520]   And don't see any obvious way to avoid doing something that will have real economic
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.640]   consequences
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.640]   So maybe they will have to make
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:50.320]   A significant decision. This this might be pretty important
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.060]   I find as a consumer
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:55.920]   Reprehensible that that they sell the you know and other companies do this they put chips
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:00.640]   In the uh in the cartridge so you can't uh buy third party cartridges
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:07.680]   Well, just the very notion that you've you've paid an exact extravagant amount of money for like a little tiny bit of ink
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:12.560]   Right and then they sort of you know sneak up on you by saying on the wrapper by opening this you agree
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:16.320]   You don't I mean that's just sleazy. Yeah, you know, it's some point it becomes such
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:20.160]   You know common sense rebels trickery. Yeah, it becomes such a
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:26.640]   You know parody of itself that hopefully the the supreme court saw that because I mean that's just there's no way
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:31.840]   There's been informed consent has been given by somebody who had a market choice
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:38.240]   To make in that environment when they ripped open this it's just ridiculous. Yeah, so I I I hope that um
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:40.480]   It's gonna be four to four right
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.480]   We know how it's gonna turn out
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:45.360]   Unless someone does a lot of printing and they're like, you know what?
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:50.640]   I'm so done with that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, because there's no way that you've read the small fine print when you've ripped something
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.920]   You can't really say that that's a signature on something
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:58.560]   I think that like a little bit of an overhaul to patent law would be just a good thing
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:03.360]   I think so, but it's a judge except for patrick's court of four could it go into supreme court over time
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:07.200]   You know what?
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:11.920]   Which dog are the justices gonna adhere to I mean, yeah
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:18.000]   For instance, there's other big businesses who are in favor of the little business against lexmark costco
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.320]   Costco yes filed in amicus brief on whose side on the side of impressions against lexmark
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:28.720]   Saying goods of all kind computer smartphones automobiles even medicines incorporate innumerable
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:31.520]   Numerable components made throughout the world
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:36.240]   Each product developer and manufacturer would be required to trace the origin
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:41.200]   And the patent rights of every single component approaches which that's too much to ask
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:47.040]   A a retailer to do and a consumer to do it's like the litigator full employment act
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.680]   Yeah, well, we don't want that no
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:53.760]   Uh, aren't you trained as a lawyer? No. Oh, okay. Good. No. Well, it sounded like for a second there
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:03:00.880]   It it kind of feels like to me this hits on the whole right to repair idea, right?
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:07.280]   So so whether it's your sealed iphone or you know the the laptop that nobody opens up anymore
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:12.240]   It's like do we have the right to replace our ink cartridges or not?
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:15.040]   Do we have the right to open these things and fix these things?
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.040]   It's kind of that right to repair issue, right?
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.800]   What's what i'm saying is there says no
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:23.680]   Yeah, and I think you know that to me is the question that I hope the supreme court really gets at and
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:27.360]   You know getting into patent law. Will there be consequences or not?
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:30.240]   But I feel like that's what this is about is yeah, you buy the printer
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:33.280]   Do you have the right to put your own ink in it?
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:37.760]   Right and what of course lexmark wants you to keep buying their ink we get that
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:41.600]   But but the idea that you can't go anywhere else for ink
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:48.560]   Uh, and that you can't repair this printer that won't work without the ink any other way is just it's it's ludicrous
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:54.800]   So the fear is they really dig into a supreme court decision in favor of lexmark could open the floodgates for copy
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:04:00.880]   Copy protection in everything you buy you don't own anything. We're already moving in that direction with digital rights
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:03.760]   You don't own anything. Well, I mean, that's kind of like what it is with a cable box
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:08.400]   They you know, you don't they send it to you and it's not really yours. Yeah, exactly
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:12.640]   Yeah, you can only fill your car with gas bought at exon
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:20.000]   Right because your manufacturer is gonna deal with exon and yeah, it's um, so there's a very dangerous
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.600]   Slope here that that you know, I don't even want to call it slippery
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:27.280]   Like it's like we can see the future and it's not a pretty one and I wonder it's interesting
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:33.840]   I wonder if the natural reaction of the conservatives on the court or the liberals on the court will be to go one side or the other
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:40.720]   If this is something because on one side you could see people who are like militant about property rights doing one thing or the other
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:44.640]   Like I wonder if there's going to be a left-right ideological break
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:51.680]   Or who is considered to be a he's a democratic appointee and considered to be on the left. Yeah actually
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:59.040]   Said conflicting things. So on the one hand he said any monopolist including a pat monopolist would love to be able to go to each buyer
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:04.720]   Separately and extract from each buyer and user the maximum amount he'd pay for that particular item
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:09.600]   But by and large that's forbidden under many laws even though it does mean slightly restricted output
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:13.120]   It also means a lower profit for the monopolist, but then he said
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.760]   That's pro-impression, but then he said
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:22.080]   Uh when discussing the application of us patent law overseas they've received money for that first sale under say let's say a german patent
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:24.960]   Have not received any money on this american patent so they say well
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:32.160]   How could you be subjecting us to a rule that first sale exhausted our right to money under the american patent when we never even got any money under the american patent?
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:39.040]   So he's he that's a kind of a pro-lex mark argument. So he was also described in the article as confused correct. Yeah
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:43.440]   That was my take that was now. You know why it seems accurate
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:46.960]   This often happens though in supreme court
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:52.880]   Oral arguments the justices will take op will sometimes do that they'll will yeah hypotheticals
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:58.160]   They'll take opposites it's often difficult to figure out where they stand on a case. We'll find out june
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:02.880]   Uh the next time that this this might crop up very important. Yes
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:05.520]   Yeah, I don't think it's well covered because it's kind of confusing
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:08.320]   Yeah, but as geeks we should pay attention and of course
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:16.400]   Somebody in the chat room said don't forget that great mother board article about american farmers hacking their tractors with ukranian firmware
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.360]   Oh
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:22.160]   Because of course john deere won't let you modify
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:28.960]   Your effect you if you get your john deere tract repaired by a third party you then have to
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:35.200]   A this is from a license agreement that john deere required farmers to sign last year you then have to
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.200]   uh
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:40.080]   Go to john deere and get it authorized
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:43.840]   So that you can continue to do it continue to use it
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:50.720]   Uh, and you continue to use it. Yeah, you don't because you license the software. Yes, you may no longer use the
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:56.480]   So the third party technicians because they control the software john deere charges $230 an hour
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.240]   Uh
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:04.640]   $230 plus $130 an hour for the technician to drive out and plug a connector into the usb port to authorize the new part
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:09.200]   Yeah, so you have you get the new part you get somebody to put it in doesn't have to be a john deere
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.920]   But then you then you have to have a john deere guy come out
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:18.880]   And charge you a minimum of 360 bucks to say yeah, okay, you can use it these guys are basically jail breaking their tractors
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:25.360]   Yeah, actually right so he says when you've got his technicians running around with cracked ukranian john deere software
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:29.200]   They bought off the black market live it here. It is car tech systems
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:31.920]   And you just uh you check the box
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:35.280]   And you generate the key
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:37.520]   99 bucks so the guy doesn't have to come out
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:41.680]   And then you can sell your tractor for more because you're like mine's a hack tractor
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.400]   Wow, that's better a hacker Wow
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:46.000]   Hacker
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:46.640]   That
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:48.640]   Hactor vests are big and
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:54.640]   Activists hacker vests are very big in Nebraska right now. It's a big it's a similar thing that elan musk said though
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:58.160]   That if you're driving my cars you can't be using that to be able to like you know
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:02.880]   A free uber car that's going to be driving itself because they want to go into business to be able to have their own
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:05.840]   Self-driving cars to be like a taxi service to that
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:09.360]   So they're also trying to control how you use something
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:15.120]   And not really yours like you're signed on to buy it then you have to not drive it and you know
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:20.880]   Never drive left or something else now. I heard that also was going to be forbidden to listen to untasteful music
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:25.520]   Only an alien society. Yes
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:31.200]   But we don't know what those aliens like the list. Oh, we do that one person does we do one man does
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:33.520]   And uh, it's like I said
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:35.520]   on a truce
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:38.640]   It's kind of a shame all this stuff because you know
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:44.880]   You you you want technology to be like a beautiful thing that pushes us all forward like opens up new possibilities
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:47.360]   You know expands the capabilities of what we have
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:51.440]   Allows us to have a better life, but at the same time there's this old school idea
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:56.560]   Which I really love which is like hot rotting and tuning and like, you know messing with what you got
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:02.400]   Customizing things and you know, we're getting this point where uh tech is so ubiquitous
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:06.320]   There's so much software in the cars nowadays that you I mean, you know
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:10.720]   You buy a new car you pop the hood and it's covered in plastic you can't even work on it yourself, you know
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:16.880]   Uh, and and I come from a background of doing that sort of thing really? Yeah with with my dad
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:20.880]   I thought you would have grown up in the era of no serviceable parts in these things
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:28.400]   No, I mean the first car I had was a five-liter Mustang that my dad and I bought together and it had no door panels no center console
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:32.960]   It had a roll cage and four-point racing harnesses, but you know, it was that sort of thing
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.440]   It's like, you know, you can get in and turn ranch and do some stuff now
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:41.040]   I used to I used to change the oil tune the car up. You'd have a little volt meter and you can check the timing and no
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:44.880]   No, that stuff was a vocal old school Volkswagen. Yeah, so that stuff was fun
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:48.880]   But there were also technological advancements that came from that right?
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:51.680]   I mean one of the things that like racing has done
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:58.640]   Uh is resulted in safer vehicles, right and and better efficiency. I wouldn't want to try to change the oil on my Tesla
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:01.360]   Yeah, I don't think there is oil there is these sorts of things
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:08.880]   These sorts of things like they where's the oil? They block that yeah, they block that like outside of your company ingenuity
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:14.480]   They block that kind of creativity well, then they killed shay three mechanics. I mean unless you work on an old car
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:18.480]   There are no shade three mechanics. Yeah, there's there's nothing like that anymore, right? So and and
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:22.880]   I find it offensive and kind of sad in just our daily lives
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:28.000]   But damn man, you know, there's there's not even that many farmers left and you're scrolling with those guys
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:33.600]   You know and you you know, it's just the the whole the whole idea and like I I get why john
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:37.440]   Dear would want to control some things but make it as simple as hey you've avoided the warranty
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:40.160]   But if you come back and you pay us, we'll still fix it for you
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:43.920]   Like why do you got to screw us over in you know in every possible?
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:47.840]   These things are more than just you know, you think you say tractor you think of a guy sitting on a thing
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:50.320]   about them down the road, but these are these are
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:53.840]   We have a real machine. They're machinery. Yeah, we have a listening
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:11:00.400]   Factory who has owns a farm in western, Australia. He was here a couple of months ago
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.960]   And he says I listened to you
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:04.640]   While i'm
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:06.400]   Working on the farm
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:11.920]   And he literally spends his whole day sitting in what is like an office on a giant combine
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:17.360]   Yeah, and he's not he doesn't have much to do. Yeah, the thing is a huge, you know
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:23.920]   Giant machine and he's not steering it. He says, yeah, no, he said well, don't you have to do it
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:26.640]   He said when we get to the end of the row, I have to tell it go to the next row
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.200]   But uh, so he can listen to podcast
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:34.400]   He's there kind of keeping an eye on it, but so you understand this is not but there's a lot of software in these things
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:38.880]   Yeah, and I and I get why john dear would want to say listen or any company
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:42.240]   Uh, would want to say we've built a complicated product
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:46.000]   It's built to work a specific way if you mess with it. It might be dangerous
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:53.120]   It might not be it be not good or whatever, right? Yeah, I get that but but but some things feel kind of petty
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:58.000]   When it's when a guy is driving out to plug in a usb port and you got to pay him a few
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.360]   There's a difference between trying to make sure that it's safe
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:04.240]   And we're not going to take warranty of like if something bad happens
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:05.760]   We're not going to be the ones that are
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:07.680]   Yeah, this feels like the people drive the worst
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:12.240]   This is trying to squeeze out of people as much as you can so that you're kind of stuck
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:16.080]   Exactly. There's nothing else that you can do unless you have a certain amount of technical knowledge
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:20.960]   To be able to go around that so a lot of people have been talking about their first cars in the chat room
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.840]   Just to bring this first circle mine was a pinto
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:34.640]   It never did blow up. No, no, it never did detonate. Yeah. Gosh. Wow. Well two fords here. All right. Yeah
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:37.120]   Mine mine was a fort as well. Oh, for what?
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:40.240]   I don't I think it was a
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:45.040]   I don't remember. Was it a tempo? Oh, Anthony knows
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:50.240]   I would tell you what mine is, but it's the answer to one of my secret questions. So
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:57.520]   Oh, it's the answer to one of my secret questions too, but I lied on the answer
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:02.320]   I didn't want to get it was a penta. I even want when they go searching for your day
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:04.480]   Like you don't want them to know this like Ferrari
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:07.680]   If I do get hacked to be so humiliating
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:10.560]   For the world to know that I had a penta, but now of course I've now
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.400]   We'll talk about it on a podcast admitted it on
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:18.000]   No, it's nothing wrong with humble beginnings. I'm proud of the penta. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.560]   Um
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:24.000]   Did you by the way speaking of I'm just looking at some of the big harvesters
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.240]   This is probably something like the the thing our listener that was what my kid looked like
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:29.760]   That's just like that
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:32.480]   Did you see the picture of the president driving the mac truck?
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:34.640]   Oh god
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:38.160]   I am amazed that we didn't see more meme action around him going like this
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:44.160]   It was a decent amount. There was one where he was looking a little play school pedal car
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:48.160]   Which was pretty good. I don't know if you guess it was this like decockus on the tank again. Yeah
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:50.960]   Except it works for you
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:52.960]   It's a meme, right? Yeah
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:56.080]   Yeah, yeah, there's actually a whole series of pictures
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:59.440]   Um, I suppose I he was meeting with truck manufacturers
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:05.600]   Um, he looked really happy though. He was he was having a he got to play he got to pull the horn
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:09.120]   And all the videos not available too bad, but there he is
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:12.080]   There he is like little tarantosauric
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:18.320]   Having a good time
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:21.520]   These are not photoshopped kids. These are real
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:26.000]   Uh, let's uh, you know, we had a fun week didn't we have a fun week?

[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:41.360]   If you can't afford a red phone you can't at least get the new product red case
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:44.000]   I don't use cases
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.200]   I don't use cases at all. I stick it in in here and
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:55.760]   All about android like christmas coming early, uh google released the android o developer preview
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:03.440]   Uh the developer preview version hit and it is now available for download and install on and everyone has been scrambling to check it out
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:07.920]   Tech news today. Nate was talking about a game called everything
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:11.280]   Where you can play as anything a blade of grass
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:16.800]   Everything is a strange experience in which you don't really have an ending
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:20.720]   And then you just start to really ask yourself what am I who am I?
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:28.160]   Where are you? What is twit? You know, it's just a lot of important questions. This is your brain. This is your brain on twit
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:30.400]   Any questions?
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:35.840]   I mean, I'm beautiful the way I am. There's no need to put me no need to put Jim in the case. That's for sure
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:43.040]   Jim dowerimbo he keeps his phone in his piece. I think he's capable of that mega moroni. What's coming up this week?

[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:34.800]   Unexplicable reason have a note seven by the way
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:38.960]   This is the month sam's song is going to kill it literally remotely
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:41.600]   Turn it into a brick
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:43.680]   good
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:46.640]   If you're if you're still using one just
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:49.920]   If it hasn't
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:55.200]   It's probably okay, right? No, it's not okay. It's never okay
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:57.680]   No
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:05.200]   Things he's talking to his elderly father. Yeah, grandfather. Maybe great grandfather dad get rid of the notes. Yeah, well if it hasn't blown up
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:07.200]   Yeah
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:17.520]   Books it's time to buy a new car. You can afford a new car. I'll cosign for you
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:23.760]   What are you before the show? You know Jason mentioned on the all about and I guess I was wrong mentioning android o is
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:29.040]   Yeah, this is the beta version. It'll be this fall before we see the next version of android
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:33.280]   I hope you see some new features because all you're talking about was like snoozing notifications and battery life
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:36.960]   They're trying to now, but that's a big issue. I mean, this is so well
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:41.520]   Nice and you know cutting off all of the things that are running in the background
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:44.800]   That's great, but it's not something that's really gonna drive a lot of press exactly
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:48.160]   Those are the things they should be doing. Give me some like cool flashy
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:55.280]   Automatically every phone reset from time immemorial promise better batteries. Oh, yeah, it's like yeah
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:20:02.000]   Like it's fair. It was gonna deliver that it's probably not gonna be the headline better battery life. Yeah, right?
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.240]   These ones don't aren't gonna melt in your pocket better battery life
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:11.680]   No, it's gonna be it's really gonna be about what dessert are we naming that's what i'm wondering?
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:16.720]   Now we know what do we do with this? We spent some time on this and in fact, I think because of us
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:23.040]   If you do a google search for you start. Oh, it'll it'll auto complete to o dessert names
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:29.920]   Apparently many people searching for desserts that begin with oh, well. Do we know that's the whole internet or just or just like your searches?
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:32.800]   I think it's the whole internet
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:35.280]   Oh, sorry. Yeah
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:37.840]   The whole internet
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:40.880]   I love you
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:44.800]   Oh
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:47.120]   Isp was tracking the data so they knew yeah, right?
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:52.880]   It turns out if you go to wikipedia and look at desserts, there are very few o desserts
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:57.360]   Android centrals put together a few uh ox tongue pastry
[01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:01.680]   That doesn't roll off the tongue in a nice way. It's a chinese tree and this is one of the problems of course
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:10.000]   They need a they need a name that is not specifically american. They need an international right nougat was really it's very international
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000]   Ozark is a foreign country, right?
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.760]   Ah, well that was my favorite. It's my favorite
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:21.840]   You don't like yep point bake cook which is a dutch cookie love spiced and sweet and served with butter at breakfast time
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:26.400]   That's my second favorite the Ozarks are in arkansas, mazurian, oklahoma
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:31.600]   Yeah, oh oh la boy. Oh la boy, which is actually literally
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:38.240]   oil balls a touch type of dutch donut made by dunking dough into a deep fat fryer
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:40.560]   I don't think android oh
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:43.840]   Oli ball is going anywhere and here's your favorite
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:50.240]   Or you Ozark pudding. I never I never heard of this. Yeah, I had it done in florida once
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:55.840]   Which is not far from the Ozarks as it turns out. Yeah. Yeah, it's a dried fruit nut custard
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:22:02.880]   Atlanta so disgusting and dry that they usually put a scoop of ice cream on it to sweeten it up that android Ozark pudding
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:09.280]   It's like is it's like eating the the composite wood inside of an ikea dresser. Oh, that sounds horrible
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:15.200]   So you really need that ice cream. It was yeah, it was the favorite dessert of president harry truman. Mm-hmm
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:17.280]   There was only so much choice then
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:19.760]   Well oatmeal cookie. I like it
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:25.040]   That's a two-order. I don't think you're gonna have a two-order. Oh, yeah. What? Yeah
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:28.880]   Stream it on twin peaks. I believe was fond of Ozark pudding not just making that up
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:30.480]   But his name was harry a stream in the show
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:33.440]   They were they did go to that diner and they would form a president
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:35.920]   Fine stuff. Yeah, this is where pies go to die
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:41.280]   Oriets which is a catalog pastry that looks like
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:48.160]   Years because looks like yours or like a pyrus. Yeah fried crispy kind of thing
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:52.000]   But everybody seems to agree oreo is the one it should be
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:56.160]   Oreo is what I'd like to see but I would be thrilled if it was Ozark
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:58.880]   Always like really would make me so happy and I really hope you write Rob
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:03.760]   Yeah, I really do the problem also is I think google got burned with kit cat where they were used a brand name
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:07.760]   And I think people journalist particularly I resent and having to say kit cat all the time
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:12.720]   Like that was sounding like an ad for nestling doesn't make me a bad journalist that I thought it was cool
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:15.920]   Okay
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:17.920]   If you say it's okay
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:20.800]   You do so many shows though leo you had to say it a lot more often
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:25.520]   Well, the only good news is whenever we do finally get the new
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:31.600]   You know phone and the new android people pile onto our table here whatever dessert
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:38.880]   So we've had nougat we've had lollipops. We've had jelly beans and yes, we've had kit cat bars
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:41.840]   So now you're hoping it's not Ozark because you'd have to eat it on
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:44.000]   Ozark
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:50.320]   Pudding on the table. No, no, it's gotta be oreo. They gotta make a deal. There's rarely a g included in that. Yeah. Oh, sorry
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.320]   Pudding
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:54.080]   Uh
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:56.080]   so why
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:58.560]   So karstin at the same reaction I did
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:23:59.920]   Uh google
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:02.080]   Their messaging strategy is so confusing
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:09.200]   I as a hangout as a google voice user and google file user have been using hangouts because it's the only messaging platform you can use
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:16.000]   On google that works on iphone that works on the desktop. It works everywhere. Yep, and that's why i use messages
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.680]   Yeah, it's ugly. It's not a great message, but you use it too. I guess yeah
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:22.480]   And and I hate the iOS app because it's so slow
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:25.680]   But but because it's so useful
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:28.720]   And because so many of my friends use it I stick with it
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:33.920]   I have it on every phone and I have it on every desktop. I haven't you could see on my uh my chrome
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:42.080]   I have a chrome extension for it. It's the closest thing google has androids has to apple messages. Yeah where it's cross platform
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:43.840]   Um
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:45.920]   And it's got the desktop. I think having it desktop
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:52.640]   Well was because they're gonna take sms support out. I made the mistake of porting my phone number that everybody in the world has over to
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:57.680]   Uh google voice, right which it just was has just been a catastrophe. Oh really?
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:01.360]   Yeah, and they came out with a new app and literally the new app on the iphone
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:08.880]   What it does is when you hit the button that summons the the uh, you know, like basically the dial pad that is a crash the app button
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:12.560]   Uninstalled and uninstalled
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:16.160]   Probably 20 times. So I'm literally getting a new phone
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:24.480]   Which I'm due for and switching providers in order to finally claw my my phone number back from google voice
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:28.000]   And you know, they got hangouts. Is they still have google talk?
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:36.000]   They have this will this is part of the phase out of google talk got it. Okay. Um, they did say that if you use google voice or google
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:42.640]   file which I do uh that you will still have sms support, but you gotta think that the days are numbered
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:46.400]   Why do they move everybody the android messenger? I don't know products
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:50.080]   That's what the problem is right? They're trying to do a little bit of a calling
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:52.560]   It's just might not have been the one that they should have given the act
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:56.720]   Aloe has google assistant built in make aloe your sms choice
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:00.160]   Well, that's that's where this is going. They're trying to turn aloe into the consumer
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:03.360]   But it doesn't do sms yet well, not yet, but it will someday
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:10.960]   And hangouts which is what consumers were using and people were fairly happy with which was a decent product and one of their most popular
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:14.720]   investing I think options outside of gmail because you could use it everywhere
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:19.840]   They're trying to pivot that into an enterprise product. Right. It's part of g suite exactly
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:26.720]   So then they're they're sun setting google talk and now what you're going to have in gmail is going to be rebranded as hangouts
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:30.560]   Which is kind of silly because it's always worked with the hangouts app anyways
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:34.960]   So no one will even be able to pick that up. So they're literally like sun setting talk
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:37.760]   Sun setting parts of hangouts to pivot you into enterprise
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:41.920]   Trying to build up aloe and then there's messaging inside of google voice too
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:49.040]   So it's a total cluster and this is one of the smartest companies in the world that allowed this to happen by launching
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:52.880]   Products and then I love the fact that we're talking again. This is google
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:56.960]   They are the smartest company in the world and they said well, they haven't gone to around sms yet
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:03.200]   It's like that's 1993 technology. Yeah, that's right. They're like, oh, we can't quite do that
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:05.840]   Yeah, it's some nine of our telephony products
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:06.960]   Just not the tenth one
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:10.320]   This is one of the things that I both love and hate about google is like
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:14.960]   They're so willing to just do this out in the open and just say let's see if it works
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:20.000]   Like let's just build this crazy thing like I don't know like people are you know, next is cute google class
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.840]   Like let's just mess around messaging
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:26.560]   And they just don't think things all the way through and it's fun because you get to see these decisions and these mistakes
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:29.440]   And we all get to learn together, but at the same time if you use
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:32.000]   It's not fun when you can't totally see you over
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.760]   And google google glass they're giving you something that you've already used
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:39.520]   They're not taking away your eyes and giving you google glass and you're forced to have to use them
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.520]   Yeah, that would be a bad thing
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.520]   That would be
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:45.520]   That would be a bad thing
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:47.520]   Can we take people's eyes?
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:49.520]   Yeah, just take this and particularly if they survive
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:52.640]   Well, they are working on the wrong way. They are working on the contact lens
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:54.480]   Which you know, we'll probably fryer
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:57.200]   But with this, I think part of what the issue is
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:02.800]   Just from speaking with people who work on messaging products, you know over the years and reporting on these sorts of things
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:04.640]   Is that
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:11.840]   I think they really see that there is this important thing happening in messaging that they weren't able to key into and that's that's really
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:15.920]   Um, you know, a lot of apps like line like building an operating system
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:20.080]   But that's what our the rich communication services rcs is all about
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:26.640]   Google's trying google bought a company called jibe which had this technology and they're trying to convince the carriers
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:33.200]   Yeah, and all the users to and by the way, android messenger supports rcs to move to this rcs standard
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:37.520]   Which would replace sms standard do much of the same things that
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:42.480]   Apples messages does and this move is almost an apple esque move where they're like, you know
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:45.760]   Let's just go to you to speed type c like even though you're still using that other. Yeah
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:55.280]   Exactly part of the problem is is the carriers have to agree. Yep carriers have their own agendas sprints using it sort of
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:58.400]   Yeah, it's it's kind of a mess
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:00.240]   Yeah, to a certain extent
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:07.520]   What there's another part here that I think is important is that they want people to take take on the google assistant and messaging within having that
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:14.400]   And aloe to a certain extent is a little bit of an experiment and they don't want to alienate the people who love and use
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:17.040]   Hangouts with that well then kill aloe
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:19.120]   kill hangouts
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:24.560]   Make android messenger messages do everything it's supposed to do and I think that's their goal
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:30.640]   But there's there's a way that they do it and I think that a lot of companies and all I'll just talk right to the camera companies
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:37.040]   Listen to me tech companies once people are comfortable using your technology and like it small
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:41.920]   incremental changes to the better don't suddenly just take away people's like, you know
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:46.000]   3.5 millimeter headphone jack just don't take it away
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:52.480]   Give us a better option once we get comfortable slowly shift the call because people get really angry you use something
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:58.800]   You're comfortable with it. It works then you change it and then we end up with that anxiety that tech anxiety of
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:05.760]   Is it gonna work? What's gonna happen? Am I gonna be have to change everyone over to it and we're unsure of that and that causes a lot of distress
[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:11.040]   It's unnecessary. I'm nothing a sparkly phone case can't fix that. That is true. That is true
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:17.200]   I'm still getting over the losses using that to hypnotize. Oh, you're still getting over the loss of google readers still getting over the loss
[01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:21.600]   Yeah, man. I'm still missing wave wave. Yeah

[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:43.360]   uh this week in tech
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:50.720]   Yeah, sometime. I'm going to do more on rcs because I feel like that this is something google is all behind this rich communication service
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:56.480]   They've got some global partners, but it seems like american carriers say and we want to do it ourselves
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:35:02.560]   Um, and this is I clearly the endgame on android messaging, but we're so far away from it
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:07.760]   It would be nice to dive into it and really see us to something about what what what is the benefit?
[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:10.000]   Yeah, why is why is google so hot on this right?
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.480]   Um, let's see what else the other google stories
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:17.360]   um
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:20.400]   So one thing google does do very well is they enforce
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:29.200]   Their view of how the internet should be run and they've been pissed off at semantic for some time because semantic apparently
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:31.840]   Uh has been kind of fast and loose
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:36.160]   With their certs you can buy certs from semantic in fact they're one of the biggest
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:42.560]   uh cert companies in the world 30 of all of the internet certificates in 2015 come from
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:45.360]   semantic
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:47.360]   um
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:53.440]   In fact according to firefox semantic issued certificates are responsible for 42 percent of all certificate
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:56.320]   validations, however
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:58.800]   google ain't happy
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:00.800]   google says semantic has has
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:04.880]   Misused more than 30 miss issued more than 30,000 certificates
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:10.320]   So chrome is going to stop recognizing the extended validation status of certificates
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:13.680]   Issued by semantic now that's a big deal
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:20.480]   Because wouldn't that affect the 48 percent of them that are valid all the all the people who use it yeah
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:26.560]   Uh, so the way they're going to do this is kind of gradually they'll decrease the maximum age of
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:29.040]   Semantic certificates
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:34.000]   Over a series of releases a chrome 59 which is three versions from now will limit the expiration
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:39.440]   To no more than 33 months by chrome 64 nine months, so they're phasing them out now
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:43.760]   You could still uh, if you don't get the extended cert the extended cert i'm on
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:49.760]   Um, let's see if I go to amazon for instance the extended cert it will turn green and you will see the company name
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:52.320]   Amazon dot com or microsoft dot com
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:58.400]   That means that the cert authority has gone to the company they've called them they've verified they may take an extra steps to verify
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.480]   This really is semantic the less
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:06.320]   Uh, you know the search like for twit that we use are not extended they're cheaper extensors are very expensive
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:12.480]   They just send you an email verifying that you own the domain somehow, you know, and uh, and then and then they send you a cert
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:14.000]   And that's what we use
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:18.720]   So it's not like you're going to be able to go to go to these sites and they won't be secure anymore
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:21.360]   Although I do worry
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:23.760]   That over time that may become
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:29.680]   Google strategy. Well like basically you'll see a pop-up and then you'll be given a warning and then if you want to proceed you have to
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:34.720]   Right you have to say so yeah, this is the site is not uh, you know, you've seen it before yeah
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:38.720]   Um, so it's just a pain to have to do it seems kind of petty
[01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:42.560]   Well, it's to preserve the integrity of the cert
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:48.640]   System and uh and semantic has just been kind of we talked a lot about it on security now
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:50.960]   They've just been fast and loose with this stuff
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:58.080]   So you think this is more of them trying to ensure that everything's going to be secure than them trying to be punitive in nature
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:03.840]   It seems to me like it's google basically like kind of tugging on leash a little bit insane like get it together
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000]   You've been slacking off and
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000]   It's since since some of them are in question
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:13.040]   All of them aren't good here anymore. It's kind of it may be a negotiating tactic
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:17.280]   Yeah, like this may be something don't be surprised if this never actually gets implemented
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:20.560]   Like I think that if I were a semantic, I'd be wide awake at this point
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:25.600]   Well, they're pissed they uh, they said google statements about our issuance practices and the scope of our past
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:30.160]   Miscellences are exaggerated and misleading they say 30,000
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:38.400]   Semantic says in google's referring to 127 certificates that were identified as misissued by a third party security
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:40.000]   uh researcher
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.840]   They resulted in no consumer harm. We've taken extensive remediation measures
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:50.320]   To correct the situation. We immediately terminated the involved partner's appointment as a registration authority
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:54.560]   And then a move to strengthen the trust of semantic issued ssl TLS certificates
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:57.920]   Discontinued our RA program. They were selling
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:02.160]   These search were being issued by a third party through semantic
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:06.000]   Uh google says this remains an ongoing discussion
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.120]   I love the gap from 127 to 30,000
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:13.120]   We're just gonna round it up to the nearest 13th
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:15.520]   You know
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:19.280]   Google's prickly and you know, I've had little problems with google before you know they
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:24.640]   But on the other hand, they feel like they're they're kind of responding if somebody doesn't enforce this stuff
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:28.800]   And and it's of course the browser makers that have the most power in this microsoft
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:31.120]   And no browsers bigger than chrome firefox
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:32.880]   Chrome's chrome's a big one
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:36.000]   Well, you know going back to the negotiating tactic idea, right?
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.800]   Google mentioning that this is ongoing discussion, right?
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:44.480]   Also, uh the version of chrome that this would roll run it is like 18 weeks away, right?
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:49.360]   Right, so it's three versions and they so maybe this is all just like guys take this serious
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:51.760]   Or we're gonna do this. Yes. There's time
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:58.320]   You know, they're basically saying in 18 weeks. This is going to the public, you know, it's there like two cars heading toward each other
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:03.040]   Playing a game of chicken only one is at this moment one is in vermont and the other is in california
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:06.640]   And there's a lot of time to swerve that wheel
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:09.440]   I like it self-driving cars. They could hit some things along the way
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:11.440]   So let's let's only if it's a well, no
[01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:14.800]   I want so over self-driving cars wasn't their fault. Yeah, wasn't their fault
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:17.200]   It never is not yield to them
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:20.160]   Failure to yield to uber
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:27.360]   Well, maybe steve minutian is right our treasury secretary says oh, don't worry about losing your job to auto art of artificial
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:33.120]   Intelligence and automation. It's 50 to 100 years off. We don't have to think about that. That's not he said
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:36.800]   It's now he's not he's middle east treasury not, you know
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:42.560]   Labor department, but he says it's not he's treasury, but he used to be the chief information officer
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:49.280]   Uh at goldman sacks. He also used to run hedge funds even golden sacks says automation is coming soon
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:55.600]   Exactly so it is in his in his past job. It was his job to know like what technology is coming
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:02.160]   What could be disruptive and transformative and now that steve in minutian? I mispronounced his munching last week
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:04.480]   Or munching
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:09.040]   Minutian that's right now that he's the secretary of treasury now
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:11.040]   He's saying 50 to 100 years off
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:15.280]   Which you want to talk about asleep at the wheel like that is just lucris
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:17.920]   I don't know if it's so much asleep at the wheel or this is a choice
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.920]   Right there the kind of the tactic of like no one create panic don't worry
[01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:28.560]   Everything's gonna be okay. So that you know he doesn't have to do anything about it and then when his terms up
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:30.640]   It's like
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:37.280]   We look back 100 years from now
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:44.080]   Yeah, the way that technology went and the way that technology is speeding up that's I should point out absolutely lucris
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:49.280]   Good in the same interview with axios. He said that's the donald term has perfect genes
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:53.120]   So maybe everything he said was one in 100 credible
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:56.400]   Uh, but it's our opinion. I think
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:02.800]   Uh, and I by the way, I've talked a lot of people and there are people who say like john mark off automation is coming
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:04.800]   But it's not going to necessarily cost every
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:11.120]   J we're gonna have jobs to replace the jobs that are lost so for instance if you're a truck driver or a cabbie
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:14.720]   This probably is a good time to start thinking about training up for something different
[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:17.920]   And I think that's what the conversation should be but that's what the government should be doing
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:22.400]   Say listen automation is coming in some cases already here if you've been a grocery store
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:25.680]   You've seen the automated checkout if you you know if you've gone to a bank
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:29.680]   You've seen a lot of atms like these things are slowly happening. So let's retrain folks
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:35.520]   Let's find out what those new jobs are going to be that will be created and hopefully be a better quality of life for everyone
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:40.160]   Let's let's figure that out and to to say that it's 50 to 100 years off is is
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:42.880]   Sticking your head in the sands you're responsible
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:47.440]   I don't know though about the thought of that they'll be I think that they'll be new jobs replace it
[01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:50.240]   But I do not think that they will be in the same number because a machine
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:55.760]   You can do things much faster to many more people and I think that the quality of jobs and the amount of education
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:43:02.640]   That you know in some places is not free to be able to have to get different jobs to be able to deal with that because a lot of the manual
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:04.160]   Label jobs are going to be going away
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:08.320]   So train so the solution is training people for jobs that will persist if over the next few
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:12.800]   I actually will say something even more radical, but I'm Canadian so I can say this is I think that in the end
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:18.000]   We're going to have to really look at something like universal income and taxing the machines that are going to be taking
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.080]   Jobs away so that the companies are going to be able to support that and in Ontario
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:25.200]   We are actually taking a look at that's right. You're doing a pilot aren't you?
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:31.040]   Yeah, yeah, you know income for everyone just to have a quality of life where you're going to be all right
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:36.480]   Well, it's an important conversation to have and you can't really have that conversation in full if you don't consider those ideas
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:43.840]   Whether you choose them or not right and and to back up your point if you just look at the change in manufacturing
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:45.840]   You know
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:47.840]   And this this is part of what trump
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:51.280]   Rannon was bringing back manufacturing jobs that went overseas right?
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:55.200]   Well a lot of those jobs that went overseas that I think are never coming back
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:59.920]   Those jobs are done in a combination of people and robots today, right?
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:04.000]   So even if those jobs came back they wouldn't have that one for one match on what was lost
[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:06.080]   Yeah, but they'd be American robots
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:12.080]   But they'd be American robots but but but but when but when you're when you're running on that idea of replacing this thing that is
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:14.320]   arguably irreplaceable
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:19.040]   Uh, then you're already not fully understanding the picture or maybe not
[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:26.000]   Disingenuously like selling it short and so this does kind of fall in line with the rhetoric that we've seen which is unfortunate because
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:29.040]   It deserves a real genuine dialogue especially from
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:36.320]   Our leaders at the top and but to have that conversation you need the context to understand the impact technologies already had
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:41.520]   And that's what I mean when I say automation is is in some respects already here. Yeah
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:46.960]   In many respects it is. I think that it's a scary conversation to have though. I think that that is a lot of
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:51.200]   Um worry and anxiety people have thought of what are what are we gonna do going forward?
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:55.520]   Where the jobs that are going to be more easily automated versus jobs that will not be easily automated
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:01.440]   And there's um, there's a lot of different changes that are happening with you know, AI and robotics
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:04.480]   And machine learning so it's a really big deal
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:11.200]   Emily drifus writing and wired interviews andrew mackephie who is the co-founder of mit's initiative on the digital economy
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:16.560]   He did a a poll of 140 experts in ai on automation
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:23.600]   And employment at an event that they held he said he asked the question when will the robots take all the jobs
[01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:27.600]   and how and how worried are you and um
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:31.920]   The the conclusion was this is happening soon
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:36.160]   Um, you see you see the graphs here 50 percent of highway miles
[01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:41.280]   When will 50 percent of highway miles be driven by self-driving vehicles the consensus was 2030
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:45.120]   Um the mean 2032
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:48.480]   Uh it the soon is to be seven years
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:53.120]   Median was 2030 and only five of the 140 said later
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:55.840]   Uh than 2050 or never
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:46:00.240]   So there's a fairly strong consensus. It's going to happen the next few
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:03.600]   Uh decades i'd like to meet the people who said never
[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:06.640]   Well, I think that there is
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:08.640]   The half-esteem kebec drivers
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:15.600]   No, but there is I think a large incredible group of people uh who say it's not going to be as bad as you think
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:21.040]   It's uh, like john mark-off who I think is a very astute former new york times technology writer
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:24.160]   Um, he he says there's a lot of experts who say
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:29.360]   A it's not going to come as fast as you think because there are a lot of to hurdles and b
[01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:33.040]   Many jobs will be created. They're just going to be a different kind of job
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:37.200]   But I think the real thing to worry about and this is why people are looking at basic income
[01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:40.800]   Uh, is that it's the lowest paying jobs the cashiers
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:44.800]   The grocery store clerks the drivers
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:50.000]   Machinists those are the people are going to lose their jobs soonest and dot people working industrial
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:53.920]   Uh, and and so those are the people who I think it would be
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:47:00.160]   Kind of responsible for the government to acknowledge that we we ought to be spending money on retraining and education
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:06.080]   I would think you would think but I mean it's too expensive politicians don't care about poor people that much or something
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:07.600]   So, you know, they
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:12.320]   Unfortunately, they seem to be more shortsighted than ever before they care about the next election the next vote
[01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:16.960]   Yep, and they're really not looking that long-term. It's just saying this is a big opportunity
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:22.720]   I mean we can create the future like we have that we have to we have to you know, it's going to happen
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:24.400]   Why not?
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:26.080]   Silicon Valley's shoulders to be responsible
[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:31.040]   I mean one of the one of the complaints people have is that silicon valley is inventing this stuff without taking responsibility for the
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:33.200]   consequences of it
[01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:37.840]   Should should should technologists be more responsible and be planning for this?
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:43.600]   I think that it's a really hard question because you like everyone wants to make a certain amount of profit
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:47.520]   And I think that the entire entire society is based upon this
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:54.880]   Amount that having more is better and so, you know, you ask Google. Well, should Google make less of a profit by not, you know
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:57.600]   Going into robotics communism
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:03.840]   And would that be wrong? I think that it really is up to a government to take care of its people and the problem is with
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:07.760]   Lobbyists and the way that you have to be funded in order to you know
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:09.920]   Have a campaign and being so expensive
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:14.720]   Then you become in the pockets of the people that can put that money there and so I think that the entire system kind of
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:18.240]   Forces everyone's hand that the only way to get up there to make the change
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:24.320]   You already have to be beholden to the people that are not the ones that must need this to be protected from which also the
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:30.640]   impossibility of foretelling, you know, it's like who could have foreseen the consequences of the
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:32.640]   A lot of science fiction writers
[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:41.440]   Where's my flying car?
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:47.280]   Risky for somebody to say well that's speculation. We don't think that's going to happen
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:49.280]   I mean, I don't think it's too risky although
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:55.200]   It's interesting that push back to steve minutian because so many people at silicon valley and technologists said you're crazy
[01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:57.520]   This is happening fast faster than you think well
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:00.480]   I mean just because you can't necessarily predict the future doesn't mean you can't
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:08.160]   Try to shape it right and protect people before it comes to the place where then you have to that sounds like just a good idea
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:14.240]   Yeah, and this is not really a philosophy that is very ochre in washington these days
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:16.080]   But I of the opinion that
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:17.440]   companies
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:20.880]   Are designed to maximize profits. That's how it's supposed to work
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:28.400]   Uh, and that it's appropriate for us as a society to say but but maybe our goals don't coincide
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:32.560]   It's really what you said georgia with googles goals google's going to maximize profits
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:34.560]   But maybe we as a society
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:37.840]   Think that there is better ways to do that and I think we should have the right to do that
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:41.360]   But right now in washington the philosophy is let the free market rule
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:43.840]   It will handle everything
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:51.120]   And uh and competition is the is the key and we shouldn't mess with the gears and I frankly I also understand that point of view
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:52.640]   I'm not sure that that's the
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:55.760]   Wrong point of view, but that's kind of where we stand right now
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:49:58.800]   And so I think that's the that's what you're going to see at least for the next four years
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:03.360]   Uh youtube is facing some problems with advertising. We'll talk about
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000]   uh that problem and
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.400]   the laptop ban
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:10.720]   And uh and why
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:13.200]   these airlines
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:18.800]   All from the middle east are not allowed or are saying passengers cannot carry laptops
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:24.640]   Kindles or iPads there is a theory the guardian says it comes it goes down to a plot
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:29.600]   Mm-hmm to put explosives and iPads we'll talk about that in just a little bit
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:31.680]   But right now your book's unaudible
[01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:35.680]   You're zero it is and it's read by the inimitable john hodgman
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:40.000]   Is a million comedian he reads it magnificently
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:43.440]   Historically funny. It's a wonderful way to consume that book
[01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:46.800]   Well arable is as you know our sponsor and we're going to get you
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:49.440]   Two audible books right now
[01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:52.400]   It's their new gold plus one plan
[01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:57.360]   So you could try out two free audio books and then get one book credit per month
[01:50:57.360 --> 01:51:01.520]   As an audible subscription of course you can cancel anytime in the first 30 days
[01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:06.160]   And pay nothing, but I think we've got your first book. It's going to be year zero, right?
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:10.400]   I would love for that to be the case. John hodgman john hodgman is brilliant
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:15.440]   You don't get better than that. You don't yeah, and he's got that nice dry with it's perfect for your produce. I think yeah
[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:18.960]   So there's one what else do what else do we like on audiobooks?
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:26.560]   These days i'm listening to patrick rothverses first love the the pet named the wind i think name of the wind
[01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:29.600]   Yeah, i'm just started to i'm finally catching up prey rat
[01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:33.920]   Trey racliffe said if you don't like this book, I don't want to be your friend anymore
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:37.440]   I think that's the second that's the second it's the king killer chronicles
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:42.080]   You're really reading the first one with the name of the wind which is awesome so good apparently patrick is given up though
[01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:44.800]   I don't know if we're ever to see another one he's supposed to be working on it
[01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:47.440]   But the work is going very slowly
[01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:53.840]   Of very nerdy book that I really like it's an audible is um the brief wondrous life of oscar wao by juneo diaz
[01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:58.880]   And uh, yeah linn men well mr randa you're kidding is uh the reader. Yeah
[01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:04.800]   What did he but he must have read it years ago because that came out like 2017 2008 or did he just rerecorded
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:09.840]   They just rerecorded it yeah because we're my favorite. Yeah, we're my favorite novels. Yeah. Yes. Thank you. It's so good
[01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:10.960]   Uh, what what is it called?
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:18.080]   It's called, um, the brief wondrous life of oscar wao if you just search for the author's name juneo diaz jun ot
[01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:23.200]   Diaz and it won the peel it surprise and deservedly so yeah, that's a it's like real
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:26.240]   I thought you said oscar wao. That's oscar wao. Yeah, wow. Yeah
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:30.720]   Uh read by oh well, wait a minute. I gotta listen to a little linn mr and well mr randa
[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:34.560]   uh narrating this that is fantastic
[01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:38.960]   Yeah, I gotta do it again. I read it if you like this book adore this. Yeah
[01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:43.840]   You've read it. Oh, yeah, I read it. I read it when the year came out in in print
[01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:46.960]   I never listened to it that I mean this is a great reason to go back to it
[01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:51.920]   It's probably almost 10 years ago. Maybe seven eight years old. Yes, and it won the Pulitzer the year it came out
[01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:55.760]   I think it might be to yeah, but seven eight. I'm gonna get a second ballpark. Yeah. Yeah
[01:52:56.320 --> 01:52:59.360]   So well, we've got three books you only get two but I'm gonna give you one
[01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:04.880]   I can do this you get 13 with the gold plus or 14
[01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:12.160]   If you continue. Yeah, uh, so this is the gold plus one plan two free audiobooks to try out the service after 30 days
[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:15.520]   15 dollars a month 1495 and you get a credit every month
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:19.120]   That's the most affordable way to get it. I this is a weird book
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:22.480]   But it is one of the most exciting audiobooks ever really going to read this
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:25.040]   166 narrators including
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:30.480]   Nick Offerman Ron Swanson from parks and rec davis cederis there the kind of lead readers
[01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:33.680]   But so many people are in this lina dunham is in it
[01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:41.360]   Uh, in fact you listen and you'll be and you'll go. I know what who's that? I know that it's amazing how many people are in this
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:46.400]   uh, bradley wittford bill hater jeff drein wilson jeff tweedy
[01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:51.360]   Of wilko. Yes. He does a cap muylion prince. It's awesome
[01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:54.400]   Don cheetl is in this season's or anything
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:58.720]   It's this is ran and you know rec as soon as you she starts reading you recognize her voice immediately
[01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:01.520]   So it's really fun. The plot is bizarre
[01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:07.280]   It's I would guess it's kind of more like sci-fi fantasy than anything else and I don't want to give away too much
[01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:13.760]   It all happens on one night in a cemetery in washington dc the night that lincoln's son willy
[01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:20.960]   Is buried and that's all i'm going to tell you because it's really fun just to start listening to this and figure out what's going on
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:28.560]   Once you do it's like jaw dropping it is a beautiful book and very deep and but at the same time
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:35.200]   Funny and interesting it's unusual. Yeah, I've been I've really been want to read that I love george saunters and so he's
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:38.960]   Is his first novel? He's written a bunch of short stories. You like your stories. Yeah
[01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:44.800]   Yeah, he's I mean if you like fiction and you like things that are a little surreal and kind of funny
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:48.640]   But a little bit of social commentary but not hitting you over the head with stuff a little absurd
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:51.120]   He's fantastic and this is
[01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:55.200]   This is where audiobooks sing because you can read the book
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:55:01.520]   And you can imagine the voices but when these all of these great actors and readers and and rock stars
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:07.920]   Perform it it comes a lot point together that cast is incredible. That's amazing. I don't know how they did it
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:14.800]   Well, I'm I maybe maybe we should say now that you are going to be reading a small segment of my next i have agreed to read the
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:20.160]   Little section tiny portion. Yeah, wow absolutely. We're not gonna have as many voices as
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:24.160]   One of the aliens. No, this is a new book that takes all the new
[01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:30.400]   Nine seconds in the future. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so I'll be tomorrow San Francisco chronicle eight nine seconds from now
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:32.320]   That's a

[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:10.640]   Yeah, right. I don't have the time to be able to deal with that but when we go take long car rides
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:15.440]   We usually listen to an audiobook and I love it. You know, it's fun with the kids, isn't it?
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:21.280]   It's wonderful. Do you have a kid a book that you're your your your kids like we just did dune and
[01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:25.600]   Pissedicated. Well, they don't they don't watch tv or watch video games
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:27.920]   So like this was like really a big deal for them
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:32.560]   And they they were able to go through it and it was just in little tiny pieces to that and it was a lot of fun
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:34.560]   That's cool. They have a very good version of dune
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:40.320]   In fact, they have all the dune novels on here. I listened to dune on yeah an audio is really really good audible.com
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:48.320]   to what we're all audible listeners I listened to five or six books a month easily. Wow, that's easily. Yeah, every once in a while
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:49.600]   I will uh
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:54.080]   Say I've got to have this book and I'll buy a book just outright because I just because I just want it
[01:56:54.080 --> 01:57:00.960]   And I think Lincoln and the barter was one of those what boy read it listen to it. It is uh me zing
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:03.600]   Let me know what you think name. Oh, yeah, definitely will
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:06.160]   so uh
[01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:08.480]   This I thought this was an any competitive measure
[01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:15.840]   We talked about it a little bit because united delta and american the american airlines have been long upset with
[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:17.680]   Emirates
[01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:22.160]   Eddy hod and cotter airlines because they get massive government subsidies, but you know
[01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:25.440]   So does british airways so does air france. I mean there are
[01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:28.160]   There's a long standing tradition of
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:33.040]   Airlines being subsidized by the governor of the country there they belong to
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:37.200]   We don't do it here in the us there's no um american subsidized airline
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:40.480]   So they feel like it's an unfair competitive advantage and
[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:44.080]   last week the us and the uk band
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:47.680]   big electronic devices basically anything but a cell phone
[01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:51.440]   from flights from uh 10 countries
[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:58.160]   Originating in the middle east on these airlines only and some thought I thought well
[01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:06.720]   It's an any competitive measure because you can fly united american and delta and still keep your laptop and your kindle and your ipad
[01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:11.520]   But maybe not because here is the story from the observer
[01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:15.920]   laptop ban on planes came after plot to put explosives
[01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:18.880]   in an ipad
[01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:23.120]   So uh, maybe the department of homeland security and the uk
[01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:29.920]   uh security forces were responding to that it bans tablets laptops game consoles kindles
[01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:35.280]   to inbound flights from egypt jordan lebanon saudi arabia tinesia and turkey
[01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:37.840]   Uh
[01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:43.360]   They in the case of england they did this does apply to british airways easy jet jet to monarch
[01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:46.960]   katomas cook and tomsen as well as the eight foreign carriers
[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:51.760]   The us is banning a flights from jordan egypt turkey saudi arabia morocco katar
[01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:54.320]   kawaii and the uae so
[01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:55.840]   uh
[01:58:55.840 --> 01:59:00.080]   Security sources say the bans were not the result of single incident specific incidents
[01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:06.080]   But a combination of factors including the discovery of this plot remember you used to have to turn on electronics
[01:59:06.080 --> 01:59:11.360]   Then they stopped doing that right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that would be one way to handle this
[01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:14.400]   I don't think you have a bomb in an ipad and have it be a working ipad
[01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:17.440]   Maybe in a laptop. I mean I always I remember when they would do that
[01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:20.960]   I was like couldn't they just kind of come up with something where the screen lights up and
[01:59:21.360 --> 01:59:23.360]   Yeah, um
[01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:27.680]   You know, I you want to give the government the benefit of the doubt
[01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:30.880]   Uh in in in saying that this is about safety
[01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:38.720]   But when when you see at least on the us as part that it only applies to airlines that aren't owned by us companies
[01:59:38.720 --> 01:59:45.280]   That seems discriminatory to be quite honest and the fact that it is only muslim majority nations
[01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:47.040]   And
[01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:50.160]   The us and the uk seem to have coordinated, but they didn't choose the same country
[01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:55.040]   Yeah, it's also very interesting. So there's a lot of just like what here and um
[01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:58.720]   I if that's your genuine concern
[01:59:58.720 --> 02:00:00.880]   You can still take all these devices on a flight
[02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:03.920]   You just have to pack them in your luggage and then you have to check the luggage
[02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:09.200]   So what's in question here is you can't actually use these devices in the cabin during a flight
[02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:13.520]   But you can use them if they come from the airline
[02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:17.280]   So this doesn't apply to the flight crew this doesn't apply to the cabin
[02:00:17.280 --> 02:00:21.360]   That's reasonable because presumably the stuff provided by the airline is is secure
[02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:23.600]   Yeah, there's also lots of different
[02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:30.000]   Electronics you could put explosives in so it's like there's lots of things exactly. Yeah, what is exactly happening here?
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.120]   How much safer are we really that this is happening?
[02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:37.280]   Then people would just fly dealt like, you know, then you're like, okay, I'm not gonna fly delta now now
[02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:42.560]   I don't know what where am I really gonna be that safe? It seems like there's probably a lot more to this than well
[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:44.800]   Yeah, bombs are bombs whether they're in check
[02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:48.800]   Well, but it's much worse if it's in it's much worse if it's in the cabin
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:51.040]   It could blow a hole in the cabin passenger can get sucked out
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:56.960]   But you can't say where the bomb is gonna be in check luggage. It could be near the
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:01:01.360]   Skin of the plane, but it could also be in the middle so it may not be as effective
[02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:05.440]   Man if I had there are a lot of questions about this, but I had since I had
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:09.120]   Suggested this was actually a kind of a crypto
[02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:14.800]   You know any competitive move I have to point out there is a security issue
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:22.640]   And that may be what stems seems there's one it would just be nice to feel like it was more well thought out as to what the security issue was
[02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:24.640]   What the solution is well?
[02:01:24.640 --> 02:01:26.480]   Well, there's a lot of security theater, right?
[02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:30.000]   Bruce Schneider has always called the TSA and this is not the TSA this DHS
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:30.800]   but
[02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:33.440]   It's often called TSA security theater because
[02:01:33.440 --> 02:01:36.640]   You take off your shoes because the guy tried to let his shoes on fire
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:39.200]   But I don't know and the thing that gets me is
[02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:46.640]   If I ever fly business a class almost always when I fly business class, I'm sent to the TSA pre
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:50.320]   You know they have autumn you know you don't have to be a member of TSA pre to get selected for it
[02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:52.320]   And that's the one where you don't have to take off your shoes
[02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:55.760]   And you don't have to take out your laptop and you just walk through them a metal detector
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:01:58.720]   There's much lighter security and it always strikes me
[02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:06.960]   But but the hijackers in 9/11 all were flying first class because they want to be the front of the cabin flying first class doesn't make you a better person
[02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:09.120]   No, it just means you paid for that
[02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:16.000]   So it makes me wonder what's the whole thing about TSA pre if they're gonna let you through because you bought a expensive ticket
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:21.680]   I don't it's theater. It's security. I had a fly from Dubai to San Francisco. Look without all that
[02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:23.680]   Looking at my fingernails without a
[02:02:23.680 --> 02:02:29.120]   Talk about air rage. That's a dangerous proposition
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:31.520]   I don't like that. I'm an entire
[02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:36.320]   Plain full of people climbing the walls and I think a lot of folks would be perfectly happy watching the movies and so forth
[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:40.800]   I need to read and do work on a plane like I would be so bomb. Well, and that's why I thought it was
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:48.000]   Flight sir, that's why I thought it was really about some sort of trade because the the most valuable customers are the ones
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:53.200]   The business travelers the first business class who are working on the plane if you take away their laptops
[02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:58.480]   They're gonna they're gonna go from Etihad to Delta or America and united where they can carry their laptop. Yeah
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:03.360]   It's felt to me like a trade a little bit of a mini trade war crypto trade war
[02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:11.360]   Amazon is now it's official going to collect sales taxes on all 50 states starting April 1st
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:14.880]   The last holdouts Hawaii Idaho, Maine and New Mexico
[02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:21.360]   This remember what a big deal this was that Amazon had this advantage over brick and mortar stores because they didn't have to charge sales
[02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:26.480]   Tax and the brick and mortar stores are upset the states were upset because they were losing revenue
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:31.200]   Amazon said we're not doing business in California. We are our fulfillment centers in Nevada
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:36.160]   It's over the border and and then remember they for a while they they said all right
[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:39.760]   Well fine. We're not gonna give associate fees to anybody in California
[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:45.680]   Right and that pissed off everybody and finally they negotiate with the state of California and they've negotiated with all the states
[02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:52.080]   And so all of these states now will be charging the flip side conspiracy theory has been and I've heard it
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:57.440]   Articulated a lot and there might be some truth is when they realize that they really couldn't win fighting the state
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:00.640]   I think kind of led the charge into saying fine
[02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:06.880]   We're gonna pay sales tax everywhere because they are a large and sophisticated enough company that they can actually
[02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:11.680]   They can figure out how to pay different right differential taxes in
[02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:17.360]   4800 and I think that's something crazy like that jurisdiction with the counties and the towns and everything else
[02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:21.200]   So at the end of the day when they realized they could not win against the state of California
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:24.400]   Some argue that they led the charge and saying okay fine
[02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:28.400]   Let's just do this because that would just really cripple folks that don't have
[02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:31.280]   Yeah
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:36.880]   No longer needs that competitive advantage and and they can do this in 4800 jurisdictions of just like
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:40.880]   Engineers that well, that's where they always said it would be impossible to figure that out
[02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:46.400]   Come on Amazon you got to realize that maybe jet I could write a program to do that basic
[02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:51.440]   They can make drones deliver to your house. Yeah, you could probably figure out everywhere
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:55.760]   So actually the national conference of state legislatures estimated that in 2012
[02:04:55.760 --> 02:05:03.280]   23 billion dollars in tax revenue was lost because of these online purchases. So it's a big deal for states
[02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:05.440]   It's a big deal, but you know their
[02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:12.720]   Amazon used to argue that it would negatively hurt their business too and it hasn't done that at all right. They've been fine so and incidentally in theory
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:18.320]   You still own sales tax you just said this the Amazon didn't have to collect it, but you still had to pay it
[02:05:18.560 --> 02:05:22.640]   So every year for the last 10 years state of california's asked on my tax
[02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:30.080]   Would you buy online and here give us your tax you owe us and I always said I never bought anything online sir
[02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:36.240]   Right online what's that crazy I go down to the store
[02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:46.960]   Model three almost almost here to tell your Tesla driver no no all right nobody cares
[02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:48.960]   I
[02:05:48.960 --> 02:05:55.360]   Do I care because this this test level will be about 35 grand and you did you put did you put a reservation in name?
[02:05:55.360 --> 02:06:01.200]   No, oh you should I kind of feel like a date doesn't even own a car, but needs gonna be buying a car soon hopefully
[02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:06.320]   It's got some driving to do so I like to get some driving to do just today
[02:06:06.320 --> 02:06:11.040]   I was saying or maybe it was yesterday. I was saying how much once you drive an electric car
[02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:13.280]   You never want to go back to an eternal combustion engine
[02:06:13.840 --> 02:06:18.720]   There's something about it knew who had a Tesla who let me drive it. I'll let you drive my Tesla
[02:06:18.720 --> 02:06:22.720]   Here's the key take it around the block take it around the block kid. Yeah, but no
[02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:24.960]   I mean, it's your favorite thing about driving an electric car
[02:06:24.960 --> 02:06:27.440]   uh, well besides the kind of the feeling that
[02:06:27.440 --> 02:06:34.560]   Species or not that you're being good to the environment. We have panels so we're generating our power so I think it's pretty good
[02:06:34.560 --> 02:06:41.280]   Uh, I'm not I'm not getting my power from a coal-fired plant. Yeah, but uh besides that it's funer
[02:06:41.520 --> 02:06:43.520]   Funner to drive is that a well
[02:06:43.520 --> 02:06:47.920]   When you it's just like all torqued right it's instant excel you just do this and also all
[02:06:47.920 --> 02:06:50.240]   Most of them have regenerative braking
[02:06:50.240 --> 02:06:54.000]   So when you don't put the brake on when you want to stop it stops on you just let off the accelerator
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.240]   It slows down you break it at the very end
[02:06:56.240 --> 02:07:02.960]   Once you get used to that you never want to drive a normal that when I drive my wife's a ice car internal combustion engine
[02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:10.320]   It's noticeable the hesitation. That's what they call it's it's kind of interesting that you mentioned on this because I am looking for a car right now
[02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:15.840]   Trying to figure out, you know what what to buy but you have a long commute that might be a problem. It's like it's about an hour
[02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:18.320]   You know
[02:07:18.320 --> 02:07:21.840]   Well, the thing is a hundred mile. You know, I'm gonna charge it in
[02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:24.720]   So I'll be doing street parking
[02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:30.640]   Rules it right that does that kind of and you'd have to wait for a really long time
[02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:34.720]   Yeah, like waiting. You know we could facilitate that let's get
[02:07:34.720 --> 02:07:37.440]   Lisa. Let's get a charger out front
[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:39.760]   Right because then you drive here and charge here
[02:07:39.760 --> 02:07:41.760]   And then you're definitely
[02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:48.400]   No, because we make money on it's a fucking hour we make money we make money on well whenever the Tesla model 3 does come
[02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:52.480]   Hopefully it'll be affordable and attainable and there will be plentiful charging stations
[02:07:52.480 --> 02:07:56.480]   Whether or not I can afford the right those wall units on the ground. Yeah, yeah
[02:07:56.480 --> 02:08:02.800]   Or you could put some of these new fancy Tesla roof tiles on the car by the way. Those are coming they are
[02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:06.960]   But you know like they're gonna start taking orders next month a few of the things I've been looking at one
[02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:12.800]   Is this this little toyota called the GT86? It's a fairly inexpensive like naturally aspirated
[02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:17.280]   You know stick kind of noisy stiff suspension wait a minute. What's naturally aspirated?
[02:08:17.280 --> 02:08:24.720]   It breathes your turbo. No supercharger. Yeah, so sorry. That's nerdy. Uh, it's in an a vehicle. I understand
[02:08:24.720 --> 02:08:27.120]   Oh, it's it's a nice vehicle. So
[02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:30.320]   So but it's like, you know, it's like a kind of old school
[02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:33.920]   It's like a little rough you driving stick and I really enjoy driving stick
[02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:36.960]   I kind of like some of those older ideas that are gonna get thrown away
[02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:41.440]   Go with a mini. I do not have many with a stick shift. I had that in San Francisco
[02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:45.200]   It'd be great for street parking, right? It was so much fun
[02:08:45.200 --> 02:08:49.360]   That thing had so much power going up the hills and but I am excited to see the model 3
[02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:54.480]   Actually driving even if it's just a silly little gift that Elon Musk shared on twitter
[02:08:54.480 --> 02:09:00.720]   He says he won't drive one which how does that make sense? Well, he's got a model. Yes. Yeah, this is but this is a
[02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:05.200]   a near consumer ready version of your your
[02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:08.560]   Arguably most important car you've ever released the one that will be affordable to
[02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:13.920]   Many many people and you don't want to drive it. What does that tell tell me is this?
[02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:17.120]   It's a better there's a better Tesla car out there. It's really what you're saying
[02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:22.720]   You know, it's like come on. You know, I'm just I drive the car doesn't miss 80s, you know, they're uh
[02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:25.760]   The model 3
[02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:30.960]   He doesn't like the name. He says he didn't realize it would cause confusion. They wanted a name at the model e but for
[02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:33.280]   Right. So they have an s
[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:36.160]   They have an x
[02:09:36.160 --> 02:09:43.920]   They have an e or a 3 and the 3 has looks like an e with like text message emojis and there and what's the next one going to be the y
[02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:51.520]   They're gonna the model y is coming. So this is sexy s e x and y. I need to speak
[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:56.640]   I wonder if he was 13 years old and was like someday i'm gonna have a car company
[02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:18.800]   He's chuckling to self-
[02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:21.440]   Thanks to your husband, Anthony who's had to put up now with two twit shows
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:27.040]   Poor guy even got a little bit of of airtime. You don't let your kids play video games
[02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:29.280]   They they have to earn their time. They play because
[02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:34.080]   Maybe you don't know this but georgia nth they have a virtual reality room
[02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:38.080]   What and they they play in fact they have two
[02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:42.960]   She'll be downstairs and he'll be upstairs playing against each other in virtual reality
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:45.360]   But the kids don't get to use
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:47.840]   That is torture. That's mean
[02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:52.400]   They are they earn points. They earn points with a system where if they get great
[02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:57.760]   Not for you kid. That's that's true. That's true. Get your own VR. No
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:05.600]   Someday you'll have a job and you can afford it yourself. They earn their points and then they get to play. They play. They do
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:10.800]   Right, so i work hard and then i got to ln 8 and 11. Okay, so they're not yet
