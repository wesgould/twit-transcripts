[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.680]   You're going to do a special version of NSFW right after TWIT today, right?
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.800]   It's at night because as we're talking right now, Justin Robert Young is driving from the

[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.560]   And we have in studio with us Patrick De La Hante.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.560]   You might know.

[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.120]   Look what he showed up at my house with.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:14.000]   He made Schwood Opoli, which is a completely hacked version of Monopoly down to like all
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.400]   these cards.

[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.720]   a lighter and 15 minutes and you'll be breathing through your throat. Well the towel helps with the trache imperialist, oh,
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:26.480]   yeah, a little messy. You always gotta have it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, wow. I don't even know if we should waste our time with tech news with a
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:33.720]   panel like this, we should just talk about whatever the hell we want to hang out. It is Easter Sunday, thank you all for joining us on the one
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:41.600]   of the holiest day's of your big Facebook meme, which apparently is a phony which is that it was named after Ishtar the goddess of
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:51.360]   fertility, the Babylonian Assyrian goddess of fertility. What was named after Easter? Ishtar. Oh, and then Molly McCready wrote a piece on
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:59.600]   the beast saying no, that's oh, yes. So you're saying your misinformation spread rapidly through social media? Shocking. Interesting. Yeah,
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:07.200]   doesn't seem like a bad sign, right? That doesn't feel like Google decided not to sell. Easter, Easter has been around for
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:15.760]   thousands and thousands of years. And just today there's a new rumor. But where the name came from? Actually, good. I don't know how long
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:24.800]   Easter's been around, really. Well, in theory, not since the year's Euro or 33 or whatever. Anyway, I don't want to get into that
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:33.120]   somewhat close to this week. And really just apparently Google didn't want to either because the Google Doodle today is says our Chavez not
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:59.600]   Easter. And of course, not a bunny. CNET says it ignites a furor. Furor. Now, do you do you think this is a little bit of making hay out of nothing? Because when you look at the actual tweets, right? There's certainly surprise. And there's certain people like, wow, that's surprising Google. Like, and especially, you know, like Glenn Beck, the moment you mentioned his name, it's a, you know, it's a lightning rod for whatever. Right. But, but like they're all like, you know, tweets, he tweets about it. Yeah.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:17.360]   And what he says is it's clearly surprise, not anger or annoyance or for a guy. I don't know. Everybody who was apparently everybody who was upset, according to CNET was from Fox. Yeah. So they went to the place of upsetness and then found upset. They're upset.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:29.160]   When are they not upset? But Google doesn't celebrate religious holidays in any of any denomination, as I remember. Well, but they, they got to do some kind of Christmas thing, right?
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.680]   They have like a holiday. Thanksgiving.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.080]   Do like, I skating around a Christmas tree one year.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.040]   I mean, let's put it this way. All right.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:45.280]   Is anybody, I was surprised that there was an Easter eggs in the o's of Google. And I don't know if they've done that before or not.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:51.600]   I was surprised that they went with Caesar Chavez's birthday instead. So it's like, yes. I mean, people have a legitimate point to be surprised.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.840]   But I don't think it's on saying.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:08:02.880]   No, it's just they keep, they keep you guessing. You don't know where Google is going to come out on these issues that are very, very important, like what the doodle on their homepage is going to be.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.760]   And so we all must remain vigilant. I think it is.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:12.680]   And really, you know, the conversation, the national conversation, the international conversation is driven by the doodle.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:19.040]   That's thank you. Thank you, Joshua. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I mean, you have to really acknowledge that it's important.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:24.320]   And regardless of what they were really trying to say, the fact that we're talking about it right now, that's the good part. That's the good part.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:33.320]   That's the good part. It's trending. Yeah. It's trending. Well, so was the fake name of Easter. So, because it's a trend.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:39.200]   Right. And I'm hanging out with Joshua. Yeah. Get out in New York. We should be hanging. We should. We're going to do that.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:48.960]   I'm going to do the office. I'm going to do the public vow. We have new offices. Before the show, I don't know what happened this week because I got Bioshock infinite and I haven't left my room, my bedroom.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:55.520]   Before the show, Brian and I were talking about it. And I don't know if this is a spoiler from Kotaku. The secret covers.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:08.760]   There are apparently musical covers. Bioshock infinite takes place in 1912. OK. Right. But I think as far as like disclaimers, we should say like if you want to go in pristine and virginal, don't
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:16.640]   listen, maybe skip the next couple of minutes. This is definitely, oh, this is a spoiler for sure. Well, then I won't say anything. Just listen to the music carefully. How about that?
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:27.200]   There's a moment of magic for those of you who aren't going to play Bioshock infinite. There was a delightful moment of magic as I was scrounging around looking for coins or for, you know, health or ammo.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:35.160]   All of a sudden I'm about to leave room and I notice something that's playing on the gramophone and I walk back in and that's what this is about on Kotaku.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:41.080]   Keep listening. We won't play the video. We won't spoil it. It is a great game. Have you finished it, Brian?
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:54.720]   Already, man. It was like it took took me. I played it on hard mode. So it took me about 22, 24 hours of gameplay. And in fact, it's one of the few games that I immediately went back and played again from the beginning.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:03.960]   And it went back and replayed the ending just to make sure I understood everything correctly. Yeah, I'm not going to I'm not going to open myself up to being torn apart by saying it's the greatest narrative game ever.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:15.160]   But I will say that it is my favorite narrative experience in all of gaming in my entire lifetime. It it is echoes of Stephen King's dark tower. It is big beyond time and space.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:29.560]   It is mind blowing, literally, draw dropping at the ending. Love it. I will say I will say something while playing it. I had this I've been having this repeated thought about this, you know, the conversation. Can video games be art?
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:45.320]   You know, are they considered arc and the can they be as compelling as a film? And this is one game where I feel like the kind of the suspension of disbelief and this thrill of experiencing a narrative is is happening throughout the game.
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:58.360]   And it's kind of like I feel like I'm playing just to get to more of the story where it's in a lot of games you feel like you're playing to beat it. This is like you're playing to experience this story, this big epic, amazing story.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:11.560]   It's really it's very cool. Agree 100%. I asked the chat room, is it better than the original? Yes. The original I love Bioshock because it was so different. But this they take it to a new level. It is beautiful. It is.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:26.160]   I you know, it's funny. I had exactly the same reaction Joshua, which is okay. This answers the question. Our video games are. Yes. Yeah. There's a I tweeted out a quote from a post this week. Kill Screen Daily's become one of my favorite sites.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:35.840]   And actually, I know the guy who created it, but they have a story up. Bioshock infinite creator, Ken Levine talks occupy Wall Street and how his game almost wasn't. It just came out last week.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.360]   What does it have to do with occupy Wall Street? We got to be able to find out, Leo.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:55.960]   But don't you see there's a huge I mean in that game, there's there's and again, I don't want to spoil anything, but this the strains of of of politics and the issue of political issues that are happening are totally reflective of the America that we live in right now.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:08.560]   Well, do you think go ahead? Sorry, go ahead. No, I just think it's amazing how how strangely how the commentary is so perfectly about like what we're going through as a nation right now.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:25.160]   And yet it's so very much about something completely insane and not real. What are should do? Yeah, anyways, this is this is a stated aspect from a rational games early in the development. They said that just as Bioshock original took on took the idea of of
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:37.160]   Ayn Rand's philosophy from Atlas shrugged and you know, of course, because it's a video game, you have to have some go terribly wrong and kill people. But they wanted to take the ethics of the tea party and play with them in Bioshock infinite.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:54.960]   And by putting it in the context of 1912, you know, again, these are minor spoilers. The city that you go to that floats in the sky seceded from the union at some point because they essentially have elevated patriotism to the to the level of a religion where you have the scroll and the gun.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:08.960]   And and you had you know, Thomas Jefferson, Frankly, George Washington as these icons that you pray to. And it's it's amazing. Like that start. And this is again, this is the first 15 minutes. I hope I'm not spoiling anything for anyone.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:23.960]   But but you walk in and you experience Columbia and it's so sweet. You almost want to cry. It's an American never existed. It's Disney's Main Street, America. Yes. Yes. Correct. And then there's one moment when all of a sudden it becomes instantly
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:41.960]   horrific. Exactly. Wow. And again, I don't want to spoil my life. By the way, a very long time. It's about racism. Well, so in here's, I'll do another plug. I'm not getting paid by Kilscreen daily here, but Jim and Warren is a guy who runs the site and he wrote a piece very recently about race, Obama and gaming.
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:57.960]   And he had this quote that I tweeted out. Excuse me. When the time comes for a child to ask, who am I games like all great art form should have an answer. I'm talking about representation, interesting gaming and who the heroes are when you take the mask off. I'm going to be very curious.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:09.960]   What your reaction is because while racism is a is a thread that runs through it. There are no black people in the game. It's all a bunch of white guys. No, maybe later. All right. Don't spoil it.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:16.960]   No, I don't know. I haven't gotten any good. There are major characters that are that are not okay. Good. I'll be looking forward to it. Thanks.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:34.960]   And, you know, it's it doesn't it's, you know, this is early days in gaming as art and it doesn't it's not. I mean, we're not talking David Lynch here. We're not talking high art yet. It's still popular art, but it's starting to reach into more thorny, interesting, difficult topics.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:45.960]   More here's go ahead. I was going to say it's you're right that it's it's still somewhat in the popular realm. But I mean, it's not national treasure in I mean, it's smarter than.
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:57.960]   Okay. It tackles it's tackling real issue. It's asking big questions and and also doing a brilliant job of making an exciting action. Wonderful. I mean, yeah, as a game it certainly succeeds.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:06.960]   But I dares it. It's a little smarter. Yes. Well, and here's the progression that you see, right? In the early days of gaming, one of the first. So your goal is to create emotions, right?
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:16.960]   So the first thing you do is you tell stories. You use video games as a printed medium and that's why you get your old, you know, your Transylvania's or your multi user dungeons back from the 1970s and 80s.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:25.960]   But then but then when you want to evoke emotions, the first thing you go for is fear because that's easy to do. And that's when you have your doom experience where you turn around a corner and all of a sudden there's a monster there.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:37.960]   And for the first time you experience fear and then you evolve through that and you get to the point where you start to deal with difficult choices and we've seen a lot of games in the last few years that have dealt with difficult choices.
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:48.960]   Then like the Walking Dead last year, I think was for me, Game of the Year, because it was the first video game that ever made me cry like I felt such an attachment to the characters and situations.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:16:00.960]   Like that to me was the Holy Grail, but I think it's great in some ways Bioshock Infinite goes beyond that. Like, okay, now we can make you cry. We can make you afraid. We can make you elated. Now let's start having a discussion.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:06.960]   Yeah, let's make you think that's a great way to what was the game that came out that previewed it last year at South by Southwest.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:17.960]   I remember seeing someone give a TEDx talk. I can't remember her name, but she talked about the spectrum of emotions and feelings that games can evoke and how narrow most of the industry has been focused on aggression and fear.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:29.960]   And through violence and warfare. And their game was this big canvas where you have this little creature and you start off in the middle of a desert and you're wandering through the journey.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:35.960]   Is that it? Journey is such an amazing, you're probably thinking of Jane McGonagall. I don't know. No, it wasn't Jane.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:43.960]   Because she talks a lot about gaming. Journey is, there's no shooting. So it answers the question, can you have a game without actually killing anybody?
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:54.960]   Journey is about the mechanics. Like the people who make Journey did a fantastic job of understanding that what the reason most people play video games is for the experience of doing the thing, whatever it is.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:17:10.960]   You know, in this case, they make jumping and running a joy and it's fun and there's moments when you jump farther and jump and there's this one moment of journey that I will remember forever until I die where it's like you're sliding down this sand hill and the camera pan sideways
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:20.960]   and the sun is setting and it's golden and beautiful and it's something iconic and beautiful. It's like a it's like a impressionistic painting of a moment from a character who never existed.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:29.960]   And in that way, I think, you know, games like Journey will do well. And then there's other ways to tell stories like we're seeing with Bioshock Infinite and of course with the walking dead.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:40.960]   There's more, I think, for the first time, and this is an exciting time because gaming has gotten mature enough that we're starting to see the splintering. We're going to have to start describing what you can't just say. It's a game.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:50.960]   You got to say, well, is it a narrative game or is it a story? It's a world. It's a contest. Not only is it narrative, but what kind of narrative? You know, is it a drama? Is it a romance? Is it funny?
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:58.960]   I mean, because I think that with art, at least with film, you know, you have these job sub genres, right? Like it's a film, but there's lots of different genres of film.
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:08.960]   And in games, it really is very much about, okay, you got to shoot something or figure something out. You know, there's like, I feel like there's been this strata, right? There's the violent games where you have to shoot everybody.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:18.960]   And then there's the games kind of like Journey where it's more playful and it's almost cartoonish. And you know, it's not quite as it's not quite as real, right?
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:24.960]   And now we're starting to see those two things come together where you have all these different mechanics and all these different emotions and all this narrative stuff happening.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:35.960]   But it also happens to be a game that feels real or that feels more like a story that you can relate to. I do think it's odd, though, that you're still killing everybody in Bioshock.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:41.960]   It's almost too bad. It really is almost too bad. You're still shooting everybody you come to contact with for the most part.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.960]   And you're looking for the headshot, right? Yeah. Yeah.
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.960]   Yeah. Yeah. And that kind of takes the motivation is totally, yeah. Yeah. So we're going to be fighting for the right.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:19:02.960]   You're fighting for the right. To party. Let me, let me real quick, give you guys a heads up for when you do finish the game. There is, after the credits, there is a delightful, delightful moment that's reminiscent of the end scene in Inception.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.960]   You remember the very last scene of Inception when the top is spinning and you're waiting to see whether it is.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:07.960]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:16.960]   There's stick around for after the credits. That's all I'm going to say about that. It is say about good movies too. So that's amazing. It's a good pitchman for Bioshock Infinite.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:28.960]   They there's some debate about how much it costs. The New York Times estimated that the game might have cost as much as a hundred million dollars to make plus a hundred million dollars to promote Ken Levine said that's crazy in Twitter.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:38.960]   But I bet you it's not far off. I bet you were talking certainly a game that was in the in the realm of the cost of a major motion picture hundred hundred million dollars or more.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:48.960]   Well, sir, that'll live longer in a world where like what do you mean in a world in a world in a world where a Call of Duty game can make a bajillion D dollars overnight.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:58.960]   I mean, it's like you can do some crazy numbers when you're charging $60 a head for a video game. So it's a surprise me that they would be at that long.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:07.960]   Aren't video games more profitable than film? I mean, I think they're going to make more than they would make. They're bigger than $20 billion last year, which is of course more than film.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:14.960]   But remember, it's, you know, 10 times the price or nowadays, six times the price of a movie ticket in the last much longer.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:26.960]   Six times the experience. Yeah, maybe. Yeah. What do you, Brian is saying 20 hours, 30 hours. I would say I'm playing on hard level too. I must be a better player than you because it could take me about 10 I think.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:31.960]   Well, you're only a third of the way in right now. Right. So it took me three hours to get that far.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:37.960]   I play everything easy. I'm a sucker for the story and it's like I'm going around and just checking out everything.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:45.960]   I'm checking out every little thing. And it's amazing how much I missed the time. I look around. I look around. I'm not just running through the game. I'm looking around.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:21:00.960]   See, it's funny that you guys play on hard. I learned a lesson from a friend who I'm not going to name because I don't want to sell them out in the video game industry who was like, you just want to, you know, if you really want to enjoy the game and you don't want to deal with having to learn how to play it really well.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:08.960]   I'll just play it on easy because if you just want to get through it and have the experience and playing it. So I made the mistake with Dead Space of playing it on medium or something.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:16.960]   And for literally for four years, I stopped playing it because I could not get through one of the levels. And I was just like, I'm never going to finish this. I picked it back up recently and did finish it.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:23.960]   It was extremely rewarding. But for me, like I have such a limited time. I've got maybe like an hour or two at night where I can play a game.
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:33.960]   And so I'll just put it on easy because I want, and by the way, for BioShock, the new one, it's particularly good because the story is so compelling. You just wanted to keep going. You don't want to get stuck somewhere.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.960]   So maybe I'm just bad at it.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.960]   It's like big TV.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:44.960]   Like I got convinced that what you should always do is whatever the normal mode. That is the intended gaming experience.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:55.960]   But in this case, Evan Lottie over at PC Gamer Magazine, a little video that he put on there saying saying, here's a case for why you should go for hard. And he swayed me. So I went ahead and I did that.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.960]   What is the case? What is the reason?
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:05.960]   Well, it's funny that you should say that, Brian, because I started on the middle of the road because I agree with you. And I read that article and I restarted the game on hard.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:13.960]   He says you're going to see more of the game. This is, by the way, riding those rails. Don't show this because this is a little bit of a spoiler. So let's not show the whole thing.
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:20.960]   But riding those rails is his point is, and I guess I don't know. I haven't played it on easy, that you will see more of the game.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:21.960]   See it now.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:30.960]   Well, it also mistakes. Like when you play through on normal and you only die like four times in the first four hours, like death feels rubbery.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:37.960]   And you don't care. But it's like if you want to care about the experience playing on hard, if you're an experienced gamer, I think it's worth doing.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:42.960]   It's not that hard either. I have not gotten stuck and I usually do get stuck. I'm not that good.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.960]   It was not that hard.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:55.960]   The thing about death, we just did an article on a panel that was a GDC and the gist of it was basically we've diminished the danger of death to a point where it doesn't matter every game.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:56.960]   Like you can die a million times.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.960]   It was a consequence.
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:03.960]   So what's the point of dying at all? You know, like there's no risk involved anymore.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:08.960]   Well, actually Bioshock is a game where I've only died a couple of times playing on easy. Maybe that's why.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:14.960]   But I've been really surprised and like it took me out of the moment and it kind of places you somewhere you don't expect to be.
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.960]   And I hope I'm not spoiling this right.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.960]   There's story in that, by the way. Keep playing because there's a reason why you get placed there.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:21.960]   Really? Yeah.
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.960]   And I'll tell you something else.
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.960]   When you jump off a building, you don't die. You immediately just can put right back.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.960]   Yeah, that was an interesting choice.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:35.960]   Yeah, no, where it's like they acknowledge the difference between like an oops versus like, oh, no, you died, which I thought was interesting.
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.960]   When you follow the building, it's like it just jumps you.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.960]   No, you didn't mean to jump off that.
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.960]   Is there any? Is there any?
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.960]   Because they make their, at some point, again, I don't want to try not to spoil this.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.960]   There is some explanation about the floating city, how it functions.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:49.960]   Right.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:54.960]   Is there any, is there anything in the game that would lead you to believe that that's actually a function of the floating city?
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.960]   You know, the technology using it?
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:57.960]   Not that I know.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:58.960]   Not, no, no, no.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:23:59.960]   It's, yeah, I agree.
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:00.960]   It's to save your life.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:01.960]   Okay.
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.960]   It would have been cool though to incorporate that.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.960]   But, but, but they, but in a way, that's an answer to that question.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.960]   Why bother dying?
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.960]   And in fact, if you just follow up a building or even jump off, because I tried it.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:18.960]   Did I just point out how great it is that that we're three guys playing this game who normally wouldn't think twice about just talking about it?
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:23.960]   But the story is so precious to all of us that we don't want to ruin it for anybody who might, even if you're not a gamer, just dicks it.
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:24.960]   Like me.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:25.960]   I just appreciate that guys.
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.960]   For the people who haven't played it, I represent them right now.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:29.960]   I fight for the users.
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:34.960]   You couldn't really do much of a spoiler and, well, I guess you could in half life or left for dead.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.960]   I mean, what's the spoiler and left for dead?
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:37.960]   No, left for dead.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:38.960]   Left for dead has no real plot.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:39.960]   Yeah.
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:40.960]   That's just like kill till you get to the left.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:41.960]   Right.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:45.960]   So, so the fact that there is is a intriguing, but enough said.
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:46.960]   I play the game if you get a chance.
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:47.960]   It's very interesting in that.
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:54.960]   And I should say really, I know you want to probably move on, but, but if you haven't played the original BioShock, which has, is another game with an incredible narrative in all of the games.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.960]   And I think it's a incredible narrative.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:56.960]   It also is an exciting game.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:04.960]   I think it's a lot more action heavy than this game and less heavy on the narrative, but the story in that game, that took me a while to beat his welcome.
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.960]   It's a long game.
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:12.960]   But when you, that's one of those really rewarding, like, wow, you know, it kind of a revelation as far as game storytelling goes, I think.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:13.960]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:14.960]   I recommend it.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.960]   If you, if you, if you're bored after playing this and you don't know what to do, you should go play the first one if you haven't.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.960]   But if you haven't played the first one, why do you even, you know, you should, I think, get off the planet.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:30.960]   I think the, I think the PS3 version of Infinite comes with BioShock 1, which I think is great, is an interesting place.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:31.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.960]   The PS3 version, not the PC version.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:38.960]   Oh, but the PS3 version, because I just ordered the PS3 version so I could play in my living room.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:50.960]   You know, interesting, in a related story, we're talking about the Uya, Uya 3D virtual reality headset, which, no, I had Oculus Rift.
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.960]   I mean, not Uya, Oculus Rift. Thank you very much.
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.960]   Thank God somebody's here from The Verge.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:56.960]   Yeah, right.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:02.960]   And we'll talk about the Uya, Uya and Oculus, both Kickstarter projects, both funded.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.960]   But are they anything exciting?
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.960]   Used to be called the Blue Yash.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.960]   All right, all right, stop it, no spoilers.
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.960]   20, 20, wait, what?
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:12.960]   What's happening?
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.960]   And you touch the Oculus? Have you experienced it?
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:15.960]   Stop!
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:16.960]   I touched it.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:17.960]   Commercial.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:18.960]   Okay, let's talk.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:19.960]   Let's talk.
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:20.960]   That's called a tease.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.960]   Right.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.960]   Right after this word from Citrix.
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.960]   Sorry, I drank some whiskey.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.960]   And now I got the heck out drunk and sponsor of this.
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:30.960]   I just love Citrix.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:31.960]   I love that.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:32.960]   I love that.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:33.960]   Extremely, shimmy.
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:34.960]   God bless him.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.960]   Or would we be without Citrix?
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.960]   At work, you know where we'd be?
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:39.960]   We'd be sitting at work.
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:40.960]   That's right.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:41.960]   But with Citrix, you could be anywhere.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.960]   You could be in the backyard enjoying the weather.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:45.960]   Summer's coming.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:50.960]   You could be traveling, finding a time to get caught up at the office.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.960]   You know, the worst thing is to go away on a vacation and come back with a thousand messages
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:55.960]   and a thousand.
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.960]   That's a day's worth for many of you in your inbox.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.960]   Wouldn't it be nice to clear that out before you get back?
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:06.960]   With GoToMyPC from Citrix, you can securely access your office computer, Mac or PC, anywhere
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.960]   you are.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:14.600]   I'm secure, even if you're like at the hacker cafe in Catman Do, you could be, yeah, wide
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.360]   open access spot.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.640]   All the monks up the river are looking at what your stuff doesn't matter because you've
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.280]   got GoToMyPC.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.280]   You're secure.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.280]   You can even use--
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.280]   This is an amazing movie you're pitching right now.
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.280]   I love this.
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.280]   I want to watch this film.
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.280]   Indiana Jones Catman Do's, of all.
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:32.120]   Would you go to my PC if he had the chance to.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:36.320]   By the way, work's not just on your Mac or PC, but your office computer is, of course,
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.320]   a Mac or PC.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.560]   But when you're on the road, you could use a laptop, but you could also use a tablet.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.400]   You could use your iPad or your smartphone.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:48.440]   The weirdest thing in the world to be doing business work on your PC from your iPhone,
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.440]   but it totally works.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.600]   It's totally cool.
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.320]   Be at work from anywhere with GoToMyPC, but don't take my word for it.
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.320]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.160]   Visit GoToMyPC.com.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.160]   Click the try it.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.160]   There it is.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.160]   Try it free button.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:04.960]   The only thing I ask is if you'd use Twit in the promo code there so that we get a little
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:05.960]   credit for that.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:06.960]   That's it.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.960]   30 days free.
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:08.960]   Go to myPC.com.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.960]   Leo.
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.360]   Did I ever tell you about the first time I used GoToMyPC?
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.360]   GoToMyPC.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.360]   You did?
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.600]   I needed to.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:22.840]   There was a reboot of The Gong Show, and they said, "We want a three-minute video of
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:26.680]   your best magic BS to submit."
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.320]   You mean you had a chance to be on The Gong Show?
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.160]   The reboot with David Tell.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.520]   I was like, "Well, I'm in San Francisco.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.400]   There's no way I could do this."
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:40.800]   I remembered, I didn't want to pay for GoToMyPC, but I remember you saying 30 days free.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:45.040]   I went and I used promo code Twit, signed up for the smart 30-day trial, and then I
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.040]   edited.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:49.560]   I remotely controlled, because I knew I had a five-minute reel, but they were very adamant
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.560]   there.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:51.560]   They had to be three minutes.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:55.800]   So I remotely controlled my home PC to edit it down to three, saved it, uploaded it to
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.160]   the FTP, and sent them a link to it.
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.240]   So it's like, there's a bunch of people out there who don't think they're ever going to
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.080]   need it, but when did you go?
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.640]   Did you rehearse this?
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:04.640]   No.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.240]   It was just that good, Joshua.
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.240]   We actually happened to...
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.400]   We had a GoToMeeting last night.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.040]   And that we planned the whole thing out.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.040]   Very clever.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.040]   But what happened?
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.040]   You didn't get on the Gong Show?
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.040]   Oh, no.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.040]   Who cares?
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.040]   Whatever.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:19.040]   There's a billion-
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.040]   There's no Gong Show.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.280]   So which is going to be better?
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.280]   Uya or Oculus?
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.280]   Oculus.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.280]   Oculus.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.280]   Oculus.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:26.280]   Oculus.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:34.640]   Now, I got to tell you, I have worn every goddamn virtual reality helmet since 1999 SIGGRAPH.
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.480]   They're stupid.
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:40.880]   You got to tell me why this somehow magical thing that you put on your head and you're
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.800]   in the world and you turn your head and the...
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:44.960]   Why is this better?
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.760]   Who are you asking?
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.520]   First of all, has anyone actually used it on the phone?
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.520]   Josh was using...
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.000]   Josh was using Google Glass.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Josh was what gets everything.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   I'm Josh.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.160]   I use the Oculus at CES for the first time, and it blew my mind.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:02.000]   My brain went flying out of the back of my head.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   That sounds violent.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Through a wall.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.760]   But I've heard, Josh, is that the amazing part is the field of vision.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.760]   It's the fact that it goes all the way...
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:14.760]   There's two things.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.840]   It's the degrees all the way around you that are amazing.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.840]   There's two...
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:18.840]   Here's the two things that make it.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.480]   The first thing is that the field of vision is massive.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.680]   It's basically your entire field of vision.
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:26.240]   There's a little bit on the sides you can see, but once you're in, you don't see that
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.240]   stuff at all.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:34.120]   The second thing is that the tracking is very low latency.
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.880]   When you move your head, it feels like you're moving your head.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.360]   It doesn't feel like you're waiting for this thing to catch up with you.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:43.400]   I'm watching my Skype window right now, and I'm waiting for my head to do what I think.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.920]   It should feel like it's instant.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:45.920]   It's direct drive time.
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:49.400]   It feels real time, and it's only getting better.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.520]   They went with a lower resolution display for the first version because they wanted to
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:56.880]   focus on low latency and getting that field of vision big.
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:02.560]   I got to say, I use this as in a completely blue, my jaw was on the floor.
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:06.400]   We had people in a room in our trailer, and there was a line out the door because the
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.200]   Oculus guys came by and people were just lining up.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.360]   Every time somebody would try it, their jaw was on the floor.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.320]   I took it on late night.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:18.480]   I was like, "After I got the day before, I'd been using it a little bit," and then we
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.480]   went on the show.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.560]   I was like, "Maybe I've blown this out of proportion.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.880]   Maybe I'm crazy."
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.120]   They brought it in the morning to set it up for late night.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:31.240]   I went in in the afternoon to go on, and Gavin Procell, the producer there, was sitting in
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.640]   the studio, playing it.
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:37.520]   Literally, his mouth was a gape, and he was just in awe of the experience.
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:40.720]   I have to say, I don't want to over-hype it, which I've already done.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.720]   No, no.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:45.880]   My brain just left the back of my head and knew somebody in the face.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:46.880]   It's crap.
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.880]   I'm not worried.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:48.880]   It's a neutral opinion.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:53.760]   When I was a kid, when I was 12, I was such a nerd, and I just thought virtual reality
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:54.760]   was going to happen.
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:56.920]   I'm so sure we were going to be living in our...
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.560]   It was going to be like neuro-man, so yeah, we were all lied to.
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.040]   You know, but yeah, we were all lied to.
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:05.280]   And this, when I put this thing on a user, I was like, "Oh God, I'm going to check into
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.400]   this, and I'm never checking out."
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.400]   Like, it's good.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.400]   It sounds like Ready Player One.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.080]   It'll make you feel the view.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.320]   Ready Player One is...
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:19.360]   So the field of view is so good that I have a friend of my best friend from college, and
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:25.720]   Regus Rumey, is now like some VP at some business, healing as one eye.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:30.600]   So we used to joke when we'd played Doom or whatever, it's like, "Oh, you can wear these
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.120]   glasses and it's kind of 3D's.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.680]   It's all 3D to me, whatever."
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.320]   And he used to make fun of us for the goggles.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:40.560]   He was so impressed with what he saw from the tracking and the field of vision that even
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:45.800]   though he'll get no benefit from the stereoscopic vision, he ordered one for the full of what
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.600]   was it, like $1,500 for a dev kit or whatever?
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:49.600]   $300 for a dev kit.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:50.600]   Yeah, I've ordered one.
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:55.520]   I mean, I did the Kickstarter, and I'm just curious, because I've seen so much hype about
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:59.960]   VR helmets for going back to Jaren Lanier for years, and every time I've tried one, it's
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:00.960]   like, "This is...
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:01.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:02.960]   Well, I got to say...
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.440]   Sorry, I'm just going to say...
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:07.840]   And then I'll stop cutting you off, but you'll never stop.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.760]   John, John, that's right.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:13.120]   John Carmack and Gabe at Valve.
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.120]   I mean, these are the guys who are on the...
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.120]   It's pretty good people.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.120]   Thank you.
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:23.600]   I think that this has a real chance when people start creating software for it, and when they
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.600]   get this...
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.360]   Like I said, it's only going to get better.
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:27.600]   I really think this is it.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.720]   I think this is the start of something pretty amazing.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.600]   But here's the other thing that's exciting.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.480]   Not only did they figure out that the field of vision matters, that latency matters, and
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:40.440]   that resolution is obviously, as you said, low now to get things started, but they're
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.360]   figuring out the right products to associate it with.
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:48.000]   For example, it's problematic the fact that you can't physically run around in circles
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.040]   wearing VR goggles without tying yourself in knots.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:57.280]   So it's being tightly tied to titles where it makes sense to where you're locked in but
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:59.400]   have freedom to look all around.
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.400]   For example, Hawking.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:04.240]   I don't know if you played it with a Hawking, but Hawking is a mech game, so it makes sense
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:09.280]   that your hands would be tied to the mouse and keyboard, but you would be able to look
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.920]   all around from inside the cockpit of this vehicle.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.000]   So it wouldn't be for bio-shock infinite.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   No, I think it would.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.160]   Actually, I was just saying to my wife Laura, I was playing it and I was like, "This would
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.800]   be insane in the Oculus.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.800]   Well, I'd love to go into that world, right?
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.800]   I'd love to live there."
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:27.080]   If it makes you feel like you're there, then I'm, "You know what?
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.080]   This is why Joshua.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.600]   Like you, I dreamed of virtual reality.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.600]   I couldn't wait.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:35.280]   I thought by the time I'm in the nursing home, I'll be able to lie in the bed."
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.280]   That's soon, by the way.
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:40.880]   I'll be able to lie in the bed with the thing on and I can be walking around Paris and then
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.600]   I'll be happy.
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:47.080]   But then I just felt like the promise was, it failed us.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.080]   So I'm thrilled if this is real.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.080]   I have one.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:51.080]   Because it's one of the years extra.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.080]   That's the thing.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.080]   Well, as always, with everything, right?
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.560]   At least 20 years, right?
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:35:01.080]   Back in the long ago era of roughly 1997, there used to be a gaming shop on Church Street
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.040]   in downtown Cambridge, Mass.
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:07.360]   And they had the platforms and you put these massive goggles on, a few.
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.360]   It was this big, right, man.
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.360]   And a big cable.
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.360]   You look like something out of Alien.
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.680]   And that was terrible.
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:17.120]   And then a few years ago, I had a chance to do this TV show for the science channel for
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:18.120]   Discovery Science.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:23.720]   That was called The Future of, and we went to Japan where all things robot are a little
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.640]   too close for comfort.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:30.240]   But I got to go into this dome of a virtual reality environment.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.880]   You could walk at 360 degrees and vertical as well, really look all around.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.960]   The resolution was really, really poor.
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.480]   But you got to see a little bit of where this is going.
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.600]   But this was a huge, it was a room.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:44.720]   You physically walked in, like Professor X, you walked out into this plank and you had
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.040]   a rail and you stood at it.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:51.080]   Everything I'm hearing from you guys says, we're actually finally here.
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:52.080]   Maybe being alive.
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.840]   That was probably a million dollar hardware platform.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:36:01.040]   I think we're on the verge, if you will, of something.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.640]   Did you just do that?
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.640]   You did it.
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.840]   Do you have an auto-index for self-referential puns?
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:09.280]   This is my next virtual reality helmet.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:10.280]   This is my first.
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:11.280]   It's not a helmet.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.280]   It's not a helmet.
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.280]   It's an eyepiece.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:15.280]   That wasn't no scam stuff.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.280]   You quit.
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:17.280]   Oh.
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:20.280]   This is not how to be black guys.
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.280]   This is not how to be black.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:25.280]   Just so you guys just stay in there with that.
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.280]   That's all.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.440]   All right, so here we go.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:31.360]   Here's a video of Jimmy Fallon putting whatever this thing is on.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.360]   I don't have to imagine.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.360]   It just feels like it was on the house.
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:36.120]   All right, so this is the Oculus Rift.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.120]   This is--
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.120]   Oculus Rift.
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:40.160]   The Oculus Rift, this started as a small project.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.160]   What is that?
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.160]   Get that adjusted.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.160]   Holy mackerel.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.160]   Okay, so look.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.280]   Look to your left.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.280]   Look to your right.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.280]   Look to your right.
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.280]   Look to your right.
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.280]   All right, now look behind you.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.280]   Don't move your body, but move your head.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.280]   Turn that on.
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.040]   This is ironic because there's no way you can demonstrate this on TV.
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.520]   You have to wear it.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.680]   All right, all right.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.120]   You want to-- okay, look forward.
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.120]   Look forward.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.120]   So here's the thing.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.720]   This started as a small project that a few guys were working on.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.600]   They wanted to make $250,000.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.600]   This is those great moments where the wonderful--
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.600]   I want you to hear faces.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.600]   That's the ability to--
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:09.600]   He's a little excited about that.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:10.600]   He's not really acting.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:11.600]   Fallon really is excited.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.600]   He's never used it.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.600]   He's actually freaking out.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.600]   Go ahead, walk up to this knight.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.600]   Walk right up to that knight.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:18.600]   That guy in the middle.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.600]   Walk right up to him.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.240]   All right, get right in his face.
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.960]   Now look down.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.200]   Look at that cod piece.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.200]   [laughter]
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.200]   I didn't even know that.
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.200]   [laughter]
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.200]   Nice.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:30.200]   Nice job.
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.200]   Nice job.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.200]   Well done.
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.200]   That was great.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.200]   Okay.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.200]   Fine.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.560]   I'll get a gaming thing and learn.
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:38.560]   Look at that cod piece.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:39.560]   Face thing on my face.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:40.560]   Now it's cool though.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:46.960]   But the fact that I told him to look down, you know, to think about playing in that way
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:51.120]   or editing documents in that way, that'd be really amazing.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.160]   Looking down at your paragraphs.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:56.680]   I believe that tweeting in 3D was difficult before.
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.160]   It's the fact that you could tilt your head to the side.
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:03.320]   You get genuine parallax of motion.
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:09.160]   I mean, it's like, I mean, I know we all have bad memories of the first round of VR.
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:10.160]   We've been scarred.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.160]   I know.
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.160]   It sounds pretty dope.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.160]   All right.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:16.040]   I was one of the, sorry, one of the things I was doing, just sorry, I'm just getting
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.040]   her up to you.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:20.600]   I was focused, I was just sitting in the room when I was using it in the, whatever space
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:25.640]   I was in, just focusing my eyes on near and distant objects because of the stereoscopic
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:26.960]   view, you can do that.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.440]   He kind of can do that.
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:29.440]   It's weird.
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.440]   Sorry, go ahead.
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.960]   Well, I'm just afraid it's going to be like 3D TV where it's just like, okay, or my 3D
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:34.960]   movies.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.960]   That sounds like it's not.
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:36.960]   It's better.
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:37.960]   It sounds so much better.
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:38.960]   I'm excited.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:39.960]   You guys got me excited.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:40.960]   It's not a novel.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:41.960]   It's not a gimmick.
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.640]   I think this is really, if it gets better, it's another thing to ruin dinner with friends.
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:45.960]   A sazzy is creed.
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.200]   There would be a great game, right?
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:50.040]   You're climbing, you're running, you're jumping, you're looking around.
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.600]   It does make you sick a little bit though.
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:52.600]   Oh good.
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:53.600]   Oh, it makes noise.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:54.600]   Does it really?
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:57.840]   Yeah, because you're sitting there and you're experiencing motion, but you're stationary.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:58.840]   Oh, that's Zulu.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.240]   It does create a little bit of a disconnect.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.800]   That's the Carmack effect.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.640]   John won't do anything that doesn't make you a little queasy.
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:06.640]   Dramamine.
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.640]   You get to get to dramamine before you go in.
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.840]   You have to take a drug before you play a game.
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:10.840]   Like, like, maybe.
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.080]   Well, no, but think about it on slightly hallucinogenic drugs.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.080]   Like, just think about like--
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.080]   Look, everything's amazing.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:16.080]   Wait a minute.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.080]   Are there slightly hallucinogenic drugs?
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:18.720]   Dude, I'll tell you what, man.
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.720]   Face that water.
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:22.720]   It's a trip because you're going to be just constantly like, what was that?
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:23.720]   Was that?
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.280]   Like, is that an animated gift?
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.640]   Stay off drugs and stay in school.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:32.040]   But if you were high and using the Oculus Rift, hypothetically speaking, totally hypothetically
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.040]   speaking.
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.880]   If you're high on marijuana and using it, I bet it would be amazing.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:35.880]   I can't tell you.
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:37.520]   I bet it would be amazing.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.920]   I have to imagine.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:39.920]   I would be happy to read about that.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:43.280]   Or if you run ecstasy, if you run a ton of ecstasy using it, that would be.
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.200]   And you read a virtual rave.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.200]   Think about that.
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.120]   Was this the plot of Minority Report?
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:52.840]   Was like, you get high and then go Facebooking to remember your dead son or whatever?
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.480]   Can I get one for my penis?
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.120]   And do we have another story?
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:01.520]   It's time for a word just overstay in our welcome in that segment.
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:04.600]   When Lee over for his penis, you stay too long.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.680]   It's the Godland principles for Leo.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:08.800]   It's like, don't we have a sponsor?
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.280]   I do.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:13.320]   Just quickly before we get to the ad, because I got to make a buffer, otherwise they'll
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.920]   be never back.
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:18.920]   Who, yeah, which is not Oculus, is the Android gaming thing.
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:19.920]   The console.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:23.040]   They finally got that one, another Kickstarter price.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.040]   Is it like $100?
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:25.040]   $100 Android.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.440]   Is that going to be real or is that?
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:28.440]   It is real.
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.360]   Well, I know it's real, but I mean, is it something I would want instead of a PlayStation
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.360]   or Xbox?
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:37.600]   So I interviewed Julie Erman, the founder, and she said something really interesting at
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.600]   South by Southwest, actually.
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:39.600]   She said something really interesting.
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:43.320]   And I said, I'm not going to, you're not going to do this hardcore gaming experience
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.440]   because it's not that powerful.
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.600]   She was like, I think they actually see it as a companion.
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:53.720]   If you have a PS3 or you have, this is something you get, it's 99 bucks, it's not expensive.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:56.400]   And it's, people can make games for it.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.640]   Anybody who wants to make a game can make it.
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.560]   It's not locked down the way the PlayStation works.
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:04.760]   And everybody knows how to develop for Android, so it's not difficult.
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:07.960]   And actually, I think it's an interesting, instead of a second screen, it's second controller
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:08.960]   kind of.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.960]   It's like, this could be an enhancement of the gaming experience in addition to...
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:15.920]   Well, I think what's interesting for me about it, as someone who doesn't play a ton of games
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:21.160]   anymore, but is excited about new entrants having a platform and a marketplace and a
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.400]   store, you can publish to this.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:30.080]   And I still remember publishing to the App Store on Apple versus the Play Store on Android.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:34.400]   You just do it in the latter and people can download it and you're done.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.840]   It creates more noise, you need to get ready to help you figure out what's good and what's
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:37.840]   not.
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.200]   You might get flooded with a lot of nonsense.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:43.360]   But the cost of distribution and discovery may be a bit lower.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.920]   Openness is awesome.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:49.600]   Letting anybody make a game that could be a 12-year-old kid, it could be a person who's
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:52.840]   just doing it as a hobby, or it could be like somebody who's a serious contender but can't
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:56.240]   pay $10,000 to get this thing put through all of the channels you need to go through
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:57.960]   to get it onto Xbox Live.
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.520]   I think that's a really powerful...
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:03.760]   You know, before I actually Chris Grant, the editor-in-chief of Polygon, who you should
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:08.840]   have on the show if you haven't had him on, he brought that up to me and we were talking
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.560]   about it and he's like, "That's what's really cool about this."
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:14.200]   Not that it's going to be super powerful, it's just that anybody can publish to it and
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.640]   it's going to open the door for the living room.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:16.640]   For the living room.
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.320]   Yeah, which we haven't had.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.320]   It's really an American.
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:23.720]   It's the first true American console when you think about it.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:25.720]   I think of it more like the Google Doodle.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.720]   I would point out though, the journey...
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.400]   The Google Doodle of consoles.
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:34.360]   Journey, which we were kind of raving about, is also an independent development.
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:39.640]   It's on the PlayStation 3, not on Uyah or something like it, but it's an independent
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.720]   and very innovative game.
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:43.160]   I agree, I think we need both.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:48.160]   I think we need platforms that you can do a $100 million game like Bioshock Infinite,
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:50.160]   which just blows one's mind.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:54.720]   We should have a place like YouTube, which is a place for people to start getting their
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:58.760]   chops in video, a place for gaming developers to get their chops in games.
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.120]   It's 99 bucks, and Android's free.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:03.640]   The development tools are simple and widely available.
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:06.320]   I like that analogy with the YouTube thing.
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.320]   It's like YouTube.
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:10.760]   What YouTube has done has given people a choice.
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:14.640]   Do you want to taste sugar or do you want to be sugar?
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:18.720]   It's allowed people to discover, "Oh, I get more joy out of making someone laugh than
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.400]   laughing at something myself."
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:24.680]   If we could do that in the gaming world, and if Uyah was the portal by which we're able
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:26.120]   to do that, that would be amazing.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.480]   I do have a question for Joshua.
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:29.800]   I don't know if you happen to know.
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:33.560]   At $99, is the Uyah profitable?
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:38.280]   Of course, we're accustomed to seeing all these game consoles come out at first as last
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:42.320]   leaders so they can make money on the software later on.
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:45.520]   Their goal on Kickstarter was $950,000.
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:48.800]   They made $8.6 million.
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.560]   They've continued to sell them since then.
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:55.680]   Beyond that, they haven't talked about outside investment, but what I will say is the guts
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:01.440]   of it are essentially a smartphone with hardly any storage and no radios.
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:02.440]   Those are readily available.
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:03.840]   They're basically off-the-shelf components.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:07.040]   In fact, Julie Erman said, "Look, this is off-the-shelf stuff.
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.040]   This is not.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.360]   We're not using some fancy custom GPUs here."
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:13.000]   I think that the actual ... A lot went into R&D.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.720]   A lot is obviously going into production of these things, but when you've got 8.6 million
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:21.960]   handy, plus maybe some outside investment once you get rolling and you're using off-the-shelf
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:24.480]   components, I think it brings the cost way down.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:30.400]   I don't know if they're profitable, but I don't think they're losing a ton of money
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:31.880]   doing what they're doing right now.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:36.080]   There are Android sticks that you plug in that are what, $30.
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.080]   That's what it is.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.080]   That's what it is.
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:39.080]   In essence, what it is.
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:40.080]   It's what it is.
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:43.440]   I bet you they're actually ... They might even be quite profitable.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:45.120]   They might have $8.5 million.
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.320]   They do another kickstart.
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:49.400]   They don't have to make another penny.
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:50.920]   They probably made the profit already.
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:51.920]   Possible.
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:52.920]   All right.
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:53.920]   We're going to take a break.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:57.600]   Which was the only person on this panel, the only person I know who's worn Google Glass.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.600]   Oh boy.
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.360]   Dude, I watched that video of a car.
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:02.360]   All right.
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:03.360]   All right.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:04.360]   Hang on.
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:05.360]   I want to ... Oh boy.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.360]   Dude, I watched the video.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:07.520]   By the way, how's the dude counter going?
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.120]   We were developing a dude counter.
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:10.120]   Oh my God.
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:14.920]   Please tell me this isn't real.
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:15.920]   We couldn't decide.
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:19.200]   We were thinking of just a simple counter, but then we were thinking like a meter.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.200]   The dude meter.
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:21.200]   I'll tell you what.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.200]   She'd be like an over-uncondometer.
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.440]   It should be double blinded.
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:25.440]   I cannot see it.
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:27.680]   It's got to be something like at the end.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:28.680]   Really?
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.680]   And of course, this episode, the dude counter.
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:32.680]   Brought to you by Dude, the dude.
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:33.680]   All right.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:35.760]   We're going to ... A lot of people are now on the list to get glass.
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:39.800]   There's also some question about how did Google pick those people in the Twitter thing
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.000]   if I had glass?
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.320]   Because some of them said some ... Some of the things they were going to do were a little
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:46.320]   weird.
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:47.320]   Actually, they've retracted one investigation.
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.320]   Better monkey some whiskey.
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:49.320]   Gave them some darts.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:50.320]   It was awesome.
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.320]   All right.
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:55.960]   Actually, I think he shouldn't ... They shouldn't ... Sorry.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:56.960]   That was my best.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:59.000]   Our show today brought to you by a brand new sponsor.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:05.200]   We want to welcome Shutterstock to this week in tech 20 million.
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.400]   Count them.
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:10.640]   High quality stock photos, illustrations, vectors, and video clips.
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:13.280]   If you're looking, if you've got a creative project, you're looking for the right image
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:18.240]   or video for your website, your publication, and advertise me, you must use these.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.640]   You stock video, stock photos, Berta.
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.200]   You must use this kind of stuff.
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.520]   Well, you gots to get going here.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:24.680]   This is good stuff.
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:29.040]   Shutterstock, professional photographers, professional artists, they review each image
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:34.000]   individually for quality before adding it to their library, but they add 10,000 images
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.200]   every single day.
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.320]   There's a couple of ways you can do this on a budget.
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:40.720]   For instance, they have subscriptions.
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:47.720]   You can say, "I want to subscribe to Shutterstock," and that'll give you access to 25 images a
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:48.720]   day.
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:51.680]   I actually have the 50 a day subscription.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.880]   Any image, any size, pay only one price.
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.200]   This is royalty free, which means you pay for it once.
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:58.680]   You use it in everything.
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:03.240]   Sophisticated search tools mean you can search and drill down by subject, asset, type, gender,
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:04.240]   emotion.
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:05.240]   That's cool.
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:07.720]   You can search for a sad little boy.
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:08.720]   Yeah.
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:09.720]   That's sad.
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:10.720]   You definitely can.
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:11.720]   Great.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:12.720]   Oh, you've done this.
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:13.720]   He does it every day.
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:17.600]   Did you see how sad you look at the bloggers that would use this a lot, right?
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:22.120]   We actually, I haven't used it much directly myself, but when I was at the onion, it's
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:25.440]   not the topic of essential to the way of life for that organization.
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:26.440]   So this...
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:28.880]   Here, look, you wanted sad little boys.
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:31.720]   We got sad little boys in all shapes and sizes.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:32.720]   We got...
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:36.720]   These are the saddest little boys you've ever seen.
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.200]   Did you have something in...
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:39.920]   Actually, he looks more angry than sad.
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:40.920]   They're more surly.
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:42.920]   This boy.
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:43.920]   This is a sad...
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:44.920]   I was specific to these emotions.
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:45.920]   Mommy and Daddy are fighting.
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:46.920]   They get really specific.
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:47.920]   What about...
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:48.920]   Oh, wait.
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:49.920]   Okay.
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:50.920]   Do you have someone with a sense of on-wee?
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:51.920]   That's like...
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:55.720]   It's like sad cyborg or sad half robot.
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:56.720]   With 20 million images.
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:57.720]   Look, here's On-Wee.
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:58.720]   Oops.
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:47:59.720]   Oh, now they want me to sign up.
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:00.720]   I got a log in.
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:01.720]   Okay.
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:02.720]   You get one...
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:03.720]   This one's free.
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:04.720]   I don't have my code.
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.520]   I don't want to sign up in front of you.
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:08.560]   Actually women, no, these are On-Wee.
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:09.560]   That's On-Wee.
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:10.560]   Wow.
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:11.560]   He's unweable.
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:12.560]   This guy...
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:13.560]   It's different kinds of On-Wee.
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:14.560]   Inconsolable.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:15.560]   Inconsolable On-Wee.
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:16.560]   Yeah.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.560]   My life is so boring.
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.920]   If I only had an Oculus Rift.
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:24.360]   For our first holiday gift guide, I think we did all Shutter Stock photos of people getting
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:29.080]   gifts and they've got some really weird people getting like surprise gifts.
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:30.480]   Do you like a surprise gift?
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.000]   Oh, I'm having fun.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   No!
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   Okay, surprise.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.480]   This is easy enough to get Shutter Stock, by the way.
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:37.680]   It's just to look for...
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:38.680]   Why not?
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:39.680]   Just go there and search.
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:44.080]   Although, if you want, we have a special deal for you.
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:47.120]   I got the iPad app, which won a Webby Award for.
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:49.000]   So this is surprise gifts.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.600]   You've got to get me with people.
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:52.760]   Yeah, you've got to get some people.
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:54.080]   It's a surprise gift.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.080]   People sneaking up behind you.
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:56.080]   Surprise honey.
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.280]   You know what's in that box?
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.840]   Those are mostly like romance-focused surprises.
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:00.840]   Well, right there.
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:01.840]   Right there.
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:05.200]   I think he's going to be surprised tonight.
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:08.280]   Here's a child surprised with Wonder.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:09.280]   That's good.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:10.280]   Wonder.
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:11.280]   That's a wonderful surprise.
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.080]   Actually, they shall open the suitcase and pull fiction.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:14.080]   That's a horrifying vision.
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:15.080]   That's like a fire hazard.
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.080]   Perfect inside the box.
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:26.800]   They have now also a spectrum tool that lets you sort images by color spectrum.
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:30.560]   So if you know you've got a color palette, they have shareable light boxes.
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:34.600]   You share images to a light box gallery, then you can have your team access them.
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:35.600]   So you can say, "What about this?
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:36.600]   What about this?
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:37.600]   What about this?"
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:38.600]   The iPad app is awesome.
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:40.240]   I don't have my iPad here, but I will show you next time.
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:41.800]   I'll show you the iPad app.
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:45.080]   And because they're global, they can give you global images.
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:49.400]   They are in Germany, China, Italy, Brazil, Belgium.
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:51.160]   That multilingual customer service.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:52.160]   We know we have a lot.
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:53.160]   This is so great.
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:58.240]   One of the problems early days of podcasting is advertisers were local.
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:49:59.240]   They were national.
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:02.840]   We finally got an advertiser all over the world.
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:07.720]   And no matter where you're watching our show, you will have a dedicated rep at Shutterstock
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:08.720]   who speaks your language.
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:12.320]   We'll give you images that fit your cultural needs.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:13.320]   Just fantastic.
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:17.240]   Sign up, but today for a free account, you don't need a credit card.
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:19.480]   Just begin to use Shutterstock.
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:22.800]   Use our offer code TWIT4, Twit in the number 4.
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:29.000]   And when you decide to purchase, you'll get 30% off any package, 30% off any of the packages.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   All right?
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.520]   Shutterstock.com, offer code TWIT in the number 4 for the month of April.
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:36.520]   That's kind of fun.
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:37.480]   I'm glad you were here, Joshua.
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:40.600]   I would never have thought of searching for...
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:42.120]   Give us one more term.
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.120]   That's part time to...
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.120]   I did sad boys.
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.800]   That led to a dark, dark place.
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:47.880]   Sad boys, plural.
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:51.200]   And then the surprise gift led to a soul and a box.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:52.200]   So let's see...
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:54.000]   Yeah, maybe you would just want to stop now while you're ahead.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   Let's do one more.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   Okay, one more.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   What are we thinking?
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   Let's think...
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   Leo, what's on the...
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   Say again?
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   Angry robots again.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   Oh, that's...
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   Oh, that's...
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   Come on.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   Give me something tough.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.800]   There are more angry robot images.
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:07.800]   What's in debt?
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:08.800]   Robots in debt.
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:10.360]   How about robots in debt?
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:12.520]   Bots in debt might be a little too granular.
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:13.520]   They might be like...
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:14.520]   Angry robots.
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:15.720]   What about debt?
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:17.240]   What about debt?
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.760]   People frustrated by debt.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:19.760]   Yeah, people frustrated by debt.
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:20.760]   That's gonna...
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:21.760]   They're gonna have that.
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:22.760]   That's easy.
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:23.760]   Like just college graduates.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:24.760]   Because people like with their heads...
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:27.920]   Stage call me with a pile of bills.
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:30.160]   I went to college and all I got was a second...
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:32.120]   That was the second guessing major life decision.
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:33.120]   Look at...
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:34.120]   Look at...
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:36.240]   I am frustrated by debt.
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:37.240]   What is killing me?
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.240]   I don't know what to do.
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:40.240]   It's just like bank people are like...
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:41.240]   Dude, this is a...
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:44.240]   No, we should do a gambling game where it's like...
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.240]   You...
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:46.240]   Somebody...
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:48.240]   Like it's like a family feud style thing where somebody proposes...
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:50.240]   I think you...
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:53.120]   That money on whether or not Shutterstock has a photo on it.
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.120]   I want to use this...
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:56.880]   I'm gonna make a power print presentation just so I can use this image.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.840]   Best is good for a powerpoint karaoke.
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:51:59.840]   You give somebody that slide.
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:00.840]   Oh, that would have done.
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:01.840]   I would have done.
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:02.840]   Explain.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:05.000]   So karaoke is you have just a bunch of slides and then you have to do a speech.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:10.640]   So the best powerpoint karaoke I've seen or been a part of, someone puts together a
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:11.640]   story.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:13.560]   They put together 15 slides roughly.
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:15.720]   You don't see any of them ahead of time.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:21.880]   Your job is to go and present them in as cogent and clear and convincing away possible.
[00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:22.880]   This is so much like my usual speeches.
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:27.160]   And then you leave the room and then another person comes up and does the same thing.
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:28.160]   Same deck ideally.
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:29.160]   Oh, what's funny?
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:30.160]   Or they might switch it up one.
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:33.320]   But it's ideal to see them do the exact same deck because then you see where people's
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:36.120]   comedic and improv instincts take them.
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:37.120]   It's good.
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.120]   We did that at DragonCon.
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:43.880]   In fact, Patrick De La Hante put together a bunch of random slides.
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:45.320]   Nobody knew what the slides were.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:47.480]   But we just took a random subject from the audience.
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:50.560]   You had to give a presentation setting up each slide with that.
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:51.560]   It was freaking hilarious.
[00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:52.640]   It was awesome.
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:54.400]   It's like improv meets tech.
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.400]   It's this fun comedy tech Patrick.
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.400]   Goodness, mashup.
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:00.480]   I think for the next time we do a Shutterstock ad, we're going to have to get Patrick to
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:02.240]   do a deck and we could do a little image.
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:03.240]   That would be amazing.
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:05.040]   Wouldn't that be fun?
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:07.480]   Hey, speaking of improv, tell me about this comedy.
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:08.480]   Comedy hack day.
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:09.480]   All right.
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:11.400]   So for those who don't know, I no longer work for the onion.
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:15.720]   I left last summer and started this company called Cultivated WIT.
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:16.720]   That's your new company.
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:17.720]   That's the new company.
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:18.720]   Comedy, technology.
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:22.680]   We're essentially a comedic creative digital agency and product shop.
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:23.680]   We make funny apps.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:25.880]   We do funny experiences.
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:30.440]   And we advise people who want to punch up their marketing and make it be less terrible
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:32.360]   by adding WIT and creativity to it.
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:33.360]   Love it.
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:37.280]   So the comedy hack day, take a hackathon, get developers overnight over a weekend and
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:43.840]   add comedic intent to the mix by adding comedians themselves and comic writers and also developers
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:44.840]   with that sensibility.
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:46.440]   And you'll come out with- Wait a minute.
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:47.840]   There's an awesome hand comedy.
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:49.840]   At the same time.
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:51.240]   This is so cool.
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:56.200]   So we did it first in New York last September shout roulette one.
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:58.360]   This was an app that a premise on a chat roulette model.
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:01.280]   It allowed you to find people on the internet you disagreed with.
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:04.680]   I know for most of us that's very difficult.
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:08.280]   So you imagine and then you can yell at them in real time through a video.
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:11.160]   And they performed at the demo, definitely stole the show.
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:15.600]   There was an onion and like UCBM-prov guy who led the comedic part of the team.
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:18.160]   Some great developers, beautiful design.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.160]   So they won best overall.
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:20.160]   So here's the video.
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:22.680]   It's a shot in an idiot about a thing.
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:24.240]   And shout roulette.com is still up.
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:27.360]   So that gives you a flavor for the sort of things that come out.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:30.000]   And then this week you're going to be doing it at Twitter and Twitter.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.080]   Twitter's hosting it Saturday and Sunday.
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:33.760]   Funny or die is one of our partners.
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:35.560]   Can you go as a spectator?
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:36.560]   Yes.
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:38.080]   You can go virtually or in person.
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:39.280]   So you're going to stream it.
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:44.160]   Comedyhackday.org will be streaming it Sunday next week, almost exactly one week from this
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:47.920]   hour, essentially 2.30 p.m. Pacific Sunday, April 7th.
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:48.920]   Comedyhackday.org.
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:49.920]   Awesome.
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:50.920]   Register for a spot.
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:51.920]   We don't want to blow up the stream too much.
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:52.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:53.920]   Because we're experimenting with that.
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:54.920]   That's awesome.
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:58.320]   And if you want to show up, just provision a ticket, we'll let you.
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.600]   You can see Twitter's headquarters too, which are actually pretty nice.
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:01.600]   Don't steal stuff.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:02.600]   Don't steal stuff.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.840]   Will they give you free food there?
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:09.240]   We're going to be providing four participants, free food, free beer, free whiskey.
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:10.240]   Is it Neil Dash?
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.240]   Was he one of the judges?
[00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:12.240]   He was one of our judges.
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:13.240]   He was a great judge.
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:16.240]   We had Hilary Mason was one of our-- we'll write as a judge.
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:17.240]   Oh, we'll write these off.
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:18.240]   He's some of the Sims.
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:19.240]   Yeah, Sims and Spore.
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:20.240]   Spore.
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:21.240]   Spore.
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:22.240]   This is getting serious.
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:24.880]   Yeah, we have W. Kamau Bell, who's a bear in a comic.
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:25.880]   He's great.
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:26.880]   And totally biased.
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:34.960]   We have Issa Rae of Angry Black Girl, web comic series fame, Awkward Black Girl.
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:35.960]   And--
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:36.960]   Difference, big difference.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:37.960]   Awkward Black Girl.
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:38.960]   Totally different show.
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:39.960]   It's different.
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:40.960]   For what I said before.
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:41.960]   She's no longer angry.
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:42.960]   I was looking at someone yelling.
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:43.960]   And so angry guys.
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:44.960]   I'm saying that yelling or yelling is hysterical.
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:49.080]   But yeah, but the idea was, can you get-- but this is an actual product.
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:51.040]   It's not just somebody brainstorming it.
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:52.040]   They had to code it.
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:53.040]   That's the beauty of putting in a hackathon.
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:54.040]   That's so cool.
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:58.880]   I want brainstorm to your mind's content, but actually committing code to a database.
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:55:59.880]   I have an app.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:02.600]   I have an app I've been wanting to make, which is definitely a funny app.
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:03.600]   Oh, good.
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:04.600]   Maybe we can get to it.
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:07.400]   And I should learn how to code and then fly to the West Coast.
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:08.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:09.400]   You have six days to pay.
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:10.400]   I mean, if you're serious.
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.400]   Let's go to Code Academy.
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:14.600]   Six days later, you're coding like a champ.
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:15.600]   Yes.
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:16.600]   How hard could it be?
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:17.600]   Not very.
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:20.840]   Some of the bugs I see in Java, I think they got monkeys coding that stuff.
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:22.800]   That's just anybody could do that.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:23.800]   All right.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:25.800]   So thanks, man.
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:26.800]   Comedy.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:27.800]   Comedy.
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:28.800]   .org, if you want to know more.
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:29.800]   That's the future of tech and comedy.
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.800]   I didn't hear what date that was.
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:33.320]   April 6 and 7.
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:35.840]   So the demos are April 7th, one week from today.
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:36.840]   It's Saturday and Sunday.
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:38.840]   So--
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:39.840]   That's there in the Bay Area, right?
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:40.840]   Yeah.
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:44.320]   If you're showing up physically to code, that's in San Francisco, design code, et cetera,
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:45.360]   starting Saturday morning.
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:49.840]   If you just want to see the projects and see the live demos, I'm seeing it, see the
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:53.640]   judging, you can show up physically at Twitter,
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:56.180]   register beforehand, or go to our livestream.
[00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:59.240]   - Is this your idea of your business for CultivatedWitter?
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:01.560]   - This specifically is the idea of one of my co-founders,
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:03.900]   Craig, Craig Cannon, who was with me on the book,
[00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:07.280]   also former Onion Dude, but this idea of bringing
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:10.300]   developers and comics together fits the premise
[00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:12.760]   of the business, which is like, okay, we wanna sell
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:14.220]   some services to other companies,
[00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:15.820]   we'd love to make our own products.
[00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:18.140]   Can we just bring people together to make good things happen?
[00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:21.020]   This isn't about taking ownership of the apps
[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:21.860]   or anything like that.
[00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:22.680]   - It's a little peanut butter and chocolate,
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:24.060]   you know, it's two great tastes.
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:25.680]   - What's nerd or nerd, right?
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:26.680]   - Nerd or nerd, by much.
[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:28.180]   - You get like nerd, the most awkward humans
[00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:30.840]   from two different spheres combining them
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:34.240]   into nerd Voltron, and that's Comedy Hack Day.
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:36.440]   - Comedy CultivatedWitter.org.
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:38.040]   - It's like funny, funny hackin'.
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:38.880]   - Comedy Hackin'.
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:39.720]   - Funny Voltron.
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:41.040]   - Yeah, funny Voltron.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:43.280]   - If he's, instead of fighting, if he was able
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:44.320]   to just make people laugh.
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:45.920]   - If he thinks it's great bits,
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:47.860]   yeah, he was just like amazing timing.
[00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:50.780]   - He demonstrated, he was just a huge microphone.
[00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:52.580]   - I actually think that Joshua Topolsky
[00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:53.820]   is the embodiment of this.
[00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:55.900]   - No, he is, I'm actually gettin' a good feel
[00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:57.020]   'cause we should have you involved
[00:57:57.020 --> 00:57:58.220]   in our next New York one, do I think so?
[00:57:58.220 --> 00:57:59.380]   - I would love to be involved.
[00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:01.220]   I would do anything with you, anything at all,
[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:02.180]   anything you want.
[00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:03.940]   - Okay, so we're gonna be doing a lot of crime,
[00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:04.780]   a lot of drugs.
[00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:05.780]   - That's fine.
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:07.860]   - Crime and drugs, I thought it'd be worse than you.
[00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:09.940]   - Just mildly hallucinogenic drugs.
[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:12.420]   - I played Grand Theft Auto, you know what to do.
[00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:14.100]   So I couldn't help but notice Joshua,
[00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:14.980]   you're wearing glasses.
[00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:17.000]   In fact, all of us are wearing glasses.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.820]   All four of us are wearing glasses.
[00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:19.740]   - These were all so smart.
[00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:20.640]   - So when Google Glass--
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:21.660]   - Glass have broken.
[00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:23.480]   - Invited you in, did they put the glass
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:25.200]   on top of your glasses?
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:27.000]   - They forced me to the ground.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.560]   (laughing)
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:30.280]   Two Googlers wearing brightly colored shirts
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:31.160]   forced me to the ground,
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:34.920]   one on top of me and forced the glasses on the market.
[00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:36.760]   - Actually, I'm glad you're talking about this
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.520]   because I watched the video on the verge
[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:40.200]   of Joshua wearing the Google Glass
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:42.000]   and there's one moment that to me
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.960]   appeared to be genuine magic.
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:46.500]   It's the moment when you put on the glasses
[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:49.340]   and they say, is everything okay or is everything
[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:50.180]   set up right?
[00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:51.960]   And you say to them, you're like, yeah, yeah,
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:53.260]   it says okay glass.
[00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:55.820]   And there's a moment you kind of freeze until your head
[00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:58.980]   and I guess the glasses heard you say okay glass
[00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:00.780]   and responded at that moment.
[00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:03.900]   Like the fact that you in casual conversation said that
[00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:05.340]   and all of a sudden it got picked up.
[00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:07.500]   Like that was very, very exciting to someone like that.
[00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:09.420]   - That's how you trigger the,
[00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:11.700]   that's how you get the glass to listen for a command
[00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:14.700]   is that when you have to wake them up.
[00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:15.700]   So there's two ways to wake them up.
[00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:16.980]   You can touch the side of the glass,
[00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:18.680]   which is like a little touch panel
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:20.820]   or you can tilt your head up like that.
[00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:22.500]   And when you do that, it wakes them up
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:25.060]   and then you say okay glass to engage a command.
[00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:30.060]   Like okay glass, Google, whatever, or navigate to,
[00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:32.420]   you can do all sorts of different, take a picture.
[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:33.820]   - But what about all those times?
[00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:37.180]   I know we all must experience this at least 3000 times a day.
[00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:40.140]   I say okay glass in casual conversation.
[00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:41.740]   - Yeah, what else is that? - What else is that?
[00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:43.060]   Is that not an issue?
[00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:45.180]   - The nice thing is that it has to be woken up.
[00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:46.900]   So it can't just do it on command.
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:49.260]   Like you have to at least be,
[00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:50.860]   you'll see it that it's on.
[00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:53.100]   - I just go to restaurants like okay glass.
[00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:55.740]   Now let's do this beverages.
[00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:56.580]   - It's your thirsty.
[00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:57.420]   - Yes.
[00:59:57.420 --> 00:59:59.780]   - That's how I satiate my thirst.
[00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:02.980]   - Every time I shout like Jesus, for crying out loud.
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:05.740]   - They should have made it for crying out loud.
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:07.420]   No, oh snap.
[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:08.260]   - I can make anything you want.
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:09.180]   - You can make anything you want.
[01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:12.220]   Can you reprogram it to be like, listen up buddy.
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:13.140]   - No, you can't.
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:14.500]   But I said they needed to add a command
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.700]   which they don't have which is okay glass get me out of here.
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:19.820]   - Which shows you the nearest exit.
[01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:20.740]   - That's a good one.
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:21.580]   - That's a good one.
[01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:23.260]   - It might take it metaphorically.
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:25.780]   Like get me out of this segment of my life.
[01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:27.500]   Things aren't going so well for me.
[01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:29.180]   They recommend courses.
[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:31.580]   - I think if you ever place bigger like the planets,
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:32.860]   like when you talk at ship.
[01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:33.940]   - He's just going to Houston.
[01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:35.100]   - Honestly though, Joshua.
[01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:37.300]   Because everybody's talking about this.
[01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:38.660]   There's a lot of hype around it.
[01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:41.460]   I feel almost like about this as I did about the VR helmets.
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:42.300]   Is it?
[01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:44.180]   So you've convinced me Oculus Rift.
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:44.980]   Good thing.
[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:45.820]   Glass.
[01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:47.700]   - In fact, can I modify your question?
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:48.540]   - Yes, modify.
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:51.020]   - Oculus Rift versus Google Glass.
[01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:52.180]   - Oh, no.
[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:53.660]   - If you have to bet on one,
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:55.660]   dude, you're only going to even make it more than one.
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:56.740]   - Which one?
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:58.860]   - Okay, if I could augment my current world
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:00:59.900]   or go into another one,
[01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:01.820]   I'm going to take the go into another one option.
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:02.940]   - Yeah, we have similar lines.
[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:03.780]   - That's a point of view.
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:04.620]   - No confidence.
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:06.300]   - My current world stinks and you'll only get a little bit
[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.300]   better if I augment it. - Yeah, I'm with you on that.
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:11.220]   - The new world could be amazing, I don't know.
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:12.540]   So here's the thing about glass.
[01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:15.900]   It's not, it's a very cool idea and I think actually makes,
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:17.540]   there are a lot of good arguments
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:19.260]   for what they're trying to do with the product.
[01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:22.300]   Like I think they made some compelling arguments
[01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:24.180]   for why it should exist.
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:25.540]   And I think the biggest one is like,
[01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:27.420]   look, everybody's basically taking these things
[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:29.340]   out of their pockets and staring at them all the time.
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:31.220]   And just to get little bits of information,
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:33.020]   it takes you completely out of the moment,
[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:34.420]   takes you away from what you're doing.
[01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:35.700]   And there might be a better way
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:37.980]   to get that information without it being so totally
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:41.820]   controlling as far as your attention goes.
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:43.500]   And I think that's a really compelling argument.
[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.540]   I also think it's kind of amazing to be able to just
[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:47.860]   suddenly take a picture, suddenly take a video
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:48.980]   when something is happening.
[01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:52.500]   Like my example is my dog does hilarious stuff all the time.
[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.340]   And by the time I get my camera--
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:55.420]   - Oh, how do you think?
[01:01:55.420 --> 01:02:01.540]   - Your dog, your Leo, can you do something about this?
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:02.620]   - I gave him whiskey.
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:05.420]   I thought I gave him as much of a sedative as I felt.
[01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:09.180]   - I think it's great that his dog alone does amazing things.
[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:10.700]   - My dog is really talented.
[01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:12.220]   She does our taxes.
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:13.060]   And it's amazing.
[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:15.060]   (laughing)
[01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:16.740]   - Which is why you want to leave this world now.
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:18.580]   - I can't, I don't know which is more scary.
[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:20.740]   Him doing street surgery or the dog doing taxes,
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:21.580]   either way.
[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:23.100]   - She messes them up, that's the problem.
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:23.940]   - Oh yeah, well.
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:26.620]   - But so there's a good, there's an interesting,
[01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:27.980]   there's a lot of arguments for it.
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:29.980]   But the problem is they do look ultimately
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:31.420]   completely stupid on a person.
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:33.340]   I mean, like they just look silly, right?
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:35.820]   And I spent a long time trying to find glasses
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:36.980]   that look right on my face.
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:38.460]   And they don't, they're making them
[01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:42.060]   so you can put lenses in them, but they still look like glass.
[01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:44.820]   I think this thing is going to be really meaningful
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:46.900]   when they partner with somebody like Warby Parker.
[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:48.980]   - Which they're like, yeah, here's these cool
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:50.060]   chunky hipster glasses.
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:52.340]   And if you want to spend an extra $500,
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:54.380]   you can get them with Google Glass notifications.
[01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:56.260]   - So here's where I'm gonna disagree with you.
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:59.820]   Like there is one situation in which I find myself
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:03.820]   constantly putting myself in serious mortal danger.
[01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:05.260]   And that's when I'm riding my bike, you know?
[01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:07.940]   All right, I'll go on these 32 mile bike rides.
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:12.460]   And every time my butt buzzes, I pull out the phone,
[01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:15.420]   I ride one-handed, I look at the black screen.
[01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:16.420]   - You have children, sir.
[01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:17.260]   - Like in the, that's stupid.
[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:18.100]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:18.940]   - That is so irresponsible.
[01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:20.020]   - Why are you wearing your phone?
[01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:21.060]   What is wrong with you?
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:22.500]   - It's a total no-brainer.
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:23.580]   It's a total no-brainer.
[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:25.340]   Like Google Glass would be perfect for that.
[01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:26.460]   - No, that would be perfect for that.
[01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:28.100]   But while you're on your bike, but like when you get
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:29.580]   off your bike, you're gonna put on glasses
[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:31.420]   that don't make you look like an android.
[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:33.620]   You know, like you're gonna not wanna wear those
[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:35.500]   into a dinner.
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:38.020]   - Josh, I've said this before.
[01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:39.980]   And to me, it's the segue effect.
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:42.700]   The segue really sounded like a great idea
[01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:44.940]   until you saw people riding them.
[01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:48.100]   - I think that the way those thinking on this needs to be
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:52.780]   not, it's like, look, you can't think about it like,
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:55.060]   like Google Glass is going to be a cool new thing
[01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:55.900]   that everybody wears.
[01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:57.060]   The way you have to think about it is,
[01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:59.020]   Google Glass is the beta version
[01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:00.660]   of what will eventually be something
[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:01.900]   or could eventually be something
[01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:03.900]   that everybody really wants and uses.
[01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:05.100]   But it has to get to a point.
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:06.620]   It's like, look at smartphones, okay?
[01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:07.980]   Smartphones used to be bulky,
[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:09.700]   used to have to use a stylus with them.
[01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:11.340]   And you know, like I had a trio,
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:12.900]   I mean, you've used the old smartphones,
[01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:15.060]   you know, Windows, mobile devices, they were terrible.
[01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:17.500]   Only businessmen or people who really needed
[01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:18.940]   a smartphone used a smartphone.
[01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:21.820]   And now it's like, it took the iPhone for us to all go,
[01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:22.940]   oh, wait a second.
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:24.500]   This could be really cool and really useful.
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.820]   And we'll wanna have them like with us all the time.
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:30.740]   It's gonna take a moment, like something that is cool.
[01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:32.980]   - I think that you guys nailed it
[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:34.100]   when you compared it to the segue.
[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:38.420]   The problem with the segue was not that it was a bad device.
[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:40.940]   It was a fantastic device that when you asked,
[01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:42.460]   well, who would use this?
[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:43.660]   They didn't have an answer for it.
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:44.500]   - Yeah, let's go on.
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:45.340]   - It's up to the same way.
[01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:46.180]   - To tell a story.
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:48.180]   They have to construct a narrative.
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:50.060]   They have to say when it's appropriate
[01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:52.540]   and more importantly, when it's not appropriate.
[01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:53.900]   And then how we can--
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:55.900]   - Can I ask you a question about the same way?
[01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:57.660]   - I just don't know one of these when they go out to dinner.
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:58.500]   You know, this is--
[01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:00.500]   - I take issue with your statement about the segue,
[01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:03.020]   that it was, I mean, I don't think the segue
[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:04.140]   was that cool of an idea.
[01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:06.100]   I mean, walking is not that hard.
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:09.060]   I mean, it solved a problem that didn't exist.
[01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:09.900]   - Well, exactly.
[01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:10.820]   It solved a problem that didn't exist.
[01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:13.180]   But we actually have, this is solving a problem
[01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:16.380]   that I believe does exist in a pretty material way,
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:20.140]   which is like intense distraction because of devices.
[01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:20.980]   And I think that--
[01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:23.900]   - But the distraction isn't just the device,
[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:26.460]   I think is missing some of what the core distraction is,
[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:28.100]   which is attention.
[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:30.820]   - All it's doing is moving this distraction
[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:32.580]   from very hand to your upper eyebrow.
[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:35.180]   - You're able to lie a little better.
[01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:38.140]   - It moves the distraction from your pocket
[01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:41.140]   to the other people, the other party that you're talking with.
[01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:43.580]   Like socially, as long as you're talking to someone
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:45.260]   and you know there's a camera pointed at you,
[01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:47.020]   it affects you and it's gonna be a problem
[01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:47.860]   when you're--
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:49.140]   - And it's not just about the camera though.
[01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:52.420]   It's like you, the idea that you can somewhat
[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:55.620]   more secretly access information,
[01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:58.300]   pull up new bits of content and imagery,
[01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:00.380]   start recording or snapping,
[01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:03.260]   that's not gonna solve the distraction issue.
[01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:05.940]   It may solve the image of distraction.
[01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:07.300]   We'll be able to lie a little better
[01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:08.500]   about actually paying attention.
[01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:11.300]   We say, "Uh-huh, uh-huh, but we're just playing some game."
[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:12.300]   - All right, I wanna move on.
[01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:14.380]   We've said enough, I wanted to ask Joshua
[01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:16.420]   'cause he's the only guy I know is actually warning them.
[01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:19.540]   He's, whether you agree or not, Joshua,
[01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:22.660]   I could feel a lukewarm response to this.
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:25.460]   And this was my thought that it wasn't gonna be something
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:26.900]   that we're all gonna run out.
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:28.580]   Compare that to his Oculus Rift endorsement.
[01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:29.420]   - Yeah, no, no, no.
[01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:30.260]   - And there's someone in the chat room
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:32.260]   who keeps pushing Google nose.
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:33.100]   - Uh-huh.
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:34.380]   - Mr. April Fools, please don't--
[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:35.220]   - Yes, there is.
[01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:36.140]   - Don't talk about the bad April Fools.
[01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:38.260]   - I know, I hate April Fools.
[01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:41.860]   I'm thanking God, it's gonna be tomorrow on my day off.
[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:42.860]   It's the worst day on the internet.
[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:44.500]   - It's the worst day on the internet.
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:45.340]   - Hate it.
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:46.180]   - You guys are terrible.
[01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:48.260]   - No, I've set it over and over again.
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:50.140]   - April Fools is internet Christmas.
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:51.140]   It's where all our people are--
[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:52.980]   - Whoa, whoa, you believe in people
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:53.820]   and wait so much.
[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:54.660]   - Yeah, there's Christmas for us.
[01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:56.300]   - And then get a horrible holiday.
[01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:57.460]   - If Christmas was no fun
[01:06:57.460 --> 01:06:58.700]   and everybody had a terrible time,
[01:06:58.700 --> 01:06:59.780]   that would be people.
[01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:01.340]   (laughing)
[01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:04.100]   - This is maybe a New York versus Texas thing, I don't know.
[01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:06.420]   - Oh, that was gonna be, I'd see.
[01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:08.180]   - April Fools in Texas.
[01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:09.660]   - I'm in news, right?
[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:10.500]   Like, I'm in news--
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:11.420]   - It's the worst, right?
[01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:13.340]   You can't tell what's real.
[01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:14.940]   Like literally somebody from Sony was like,
[01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:16.340]   "Hey, do you agree to an embargo?"
[01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:17.180]   They sent me an email.
[01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:18.380]   "Would you agree to this embargo?"
[01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:19.820]   I was like, "Sure, send it over."
[01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:21.060]   And it's an April Fools joke
[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:25.060]   and it's like you just wasted precious time and energy on--
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:27.060]   - How about making your devices not feel so bad?
[01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:29.340]   - Yeah, like you know it, not of it, it's funny.
[01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:30.180]   It's never funny.
[01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:31.020]   - It's not funny.
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:33.700]   It's more like, it's more like hit yourself in the head,
[01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:35.260]   like, "Oh crap."
[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:37.780]   Kind of, I mean, it's like, it makes you feel bad.
[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:38.620]   So let's not do it.
[01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:41.780]   - Except for when Think Geek comes up with joke items
[01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:43.260]   that become like best sellers later.
[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:44.100]   - Those are good.
[01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:47.500]   Like the Tonton guts sleeping bag.
[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:51.460]   So is the price, is it worth the collective sacrifice?
[01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:52.300]   - Yes.
[01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:54.460]   - That this whole planet must endure
[01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:56.460]   to get a few shots from Think Geek?
[01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:57.620]   - The Iraq war.
[01:07:57.620 --> 01:07:59.100]   Do we get the oil?
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:07:59.940]   - Yeah.
[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:00.780]   - Not really.
[01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:01.620]   - Or freedom?
[01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:02.460]   - I think it's more like--
[01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:03.300]   - We didn't get any more freedom.
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:06.500]   - For anything it's more like when the deaths are destroyed.
[01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:07.340]   - What do I just--
[01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:09.540]   - Destroyed just caddoine and 1,000, a million,
[01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:13.620]   how many voices, lots of voices cried out in horror.
[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:16.580]   - How are we talking about the Iraq war?
[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:19.940]   Third of all, because it started as an April Fool's joke, Brian.
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:22.700]   That's how badly April Fool's can end.
[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:23.540]   - You don't like the--
[01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:25.180]   - With an unnecessary invasion.
[01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:26.260]   - Yeah.
[01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:27.940]   - That's what April Fool's is like.
[01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:30.500]   - I'm sorry, Al-Zurad, I just destroyed the wrong planet.
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:33.660]   And you see, that's where April Fool's gets you.
[01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:34.980]   You destroy, we're gonna take a break.
[01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:36.540]   We'll come back, there's so much to talk about.
[01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:39.060]   Facebook, Mazzophone, doesn't have a phone, don't know.
[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:39.900]   We'll find out.
[01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:41.700]   If you guys don't know, I don't know.
[01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:44.940]   Bitcoin, a billion dollars worth, is that a lot?
[01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:46.300]   Could be, it's money?
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:47.460]   No, it's Bitcoin.
[01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:48.300]   Is it bits?
[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:49.180]   I don't know.
[01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:53.860]   T-Mobile is done with the BS in wireless pricing, they say.
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:55.340]   We'll talk about that.
[01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:58.940]   Amazon spends a billion dollars on another social reading site.
[01:08:58.940 --> 01:08:59.780]   - By the way, I just don't know if that's
[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:01.220]   no way we're gonna all these stories.
[01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:04.140]   - I know, and they're getting into the comedy business.
[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.140]   You see, they have a pilot.
[01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:05.980]   - I did, I did, yep.
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:09.980]   - And Yahoo pays a 17-year-old $30 million
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:13.980]   for a program that doesn't really do anything.
[01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:15.500]   - So like, most startups.
[01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.060]   - It's so much to talk about.
[01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:18.300]   - I don't have another show.
[01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:19.860]   - I don't even know where to start.
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:21.380]   Let's take a break and we're gonna come back
[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:22.780]   'cause we gotta get Joshua out of here.
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:24.100]   'Cause guess what?
[01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:26.060]   It's Game of Thrones, Premier Night.
[01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:26.900]   - I gotta get back to that.
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:28.100]   - I gotta start painting my body.
[01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:29.620]   - To the face.
[01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:31.260]   - I gotta start sharpening things.
[01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:33.460]   - Are you a Lannister or a Stark?
[01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:34.820]   - I mean, there's no choice.
[01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:36.020]   - I'm down with Call Drogo.
[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:36.860]   So I'll be just--
[01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:37.700]   - Ooh.
[01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:38.540]   - Oh, wow.
[01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:39.660]   - If you're a master of dragons.
[01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:40.500]   - It's off-rackling.
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:41.340]   - Ooh.
[01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:42.340]   - Like a buddy of the master of dragons.
[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:43.180]   - Ooh.
[01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:44.980]   - A buddy of the master of dragons.
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:46.900]   - As long as someone's gonna die very soon.
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:47.740]   - Good friend.
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:49.380]   - Yeah, I'm like, my buddy died.
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:50.740]   How did that happen?
[01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:52.060]   - Ooh.
[01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:53.500]   - I'm excited.
[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:54.620]   I have friends who've seen it.
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:55.460]   They had a premiere.
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:57.700]   They didn't invite me last week in San Francisco.
[01:09:57.700 --> 01:09:58.860]   Did they do that in New York too?
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:09:59.700]   - Did they have?
[01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:01.340]   - Yeah, they, I don't know if they did one in New York.
[01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:02.780]   I know they did one in Los Angeles
[01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:04.540]   that was apparently amazing.
[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:06.900]   - You had to be like on some list that I'm not on.
[01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:08.380]   - You gotta get better at lists.
[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:10.260]   I gotta get better at lists.
[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:12.780]   Our show today brought to you by ShareFile,
[01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:15.860]   another fine Citrix product, Joshua.
[01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:16.700]   - Yes.
[01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:18.020]   (laughing)
[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:19.500]   - You wanna take a walk now?
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.660]   Or I don't wanna get you angry.
[01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:23.300]   - We're gonna have this drink of water.
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:25.060]   (laughing)
[01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:25.860]   - I'm there at you ShareFile.
[01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:26.700]   - Actually, you're good.
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:28.940]   - No, ShareFile is really amazing.
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:31.620]   So we've all had this experience.
[01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:32.580]   You attach a file, you know,
[01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:35.260]   you wanna share a spreadsheet or a presentation or,
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:36.260]   I don't know, sales contract,
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:37.940]   something, you attach it to email.
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:40.860]   And you mail it, it either bounces back or they,
[01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:41.700]   I mean, it's just a mess.
[01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:43.380]   They didn't get it, you know, know if they got it.
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:45.500]   ShareFile is a better way of sharing files.
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:47.940]   You can still use email because it has an Outlook plugin,
[01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:48.940]   but it's not email.
[01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:51.700]   What you're sharing actually is a secure link.
[01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:53.420]   Size doesn't matter.
[01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:55.180]   You can send files in almost giant files,
[01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:56.420]   in almost any size.
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:59.060]   You control not only who gets to see it,
[01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:00.980]   but you'll get an email when they check it.
[01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:03.060]   You could say for how long they can see it,
[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:05.180]   how many times they can download it.
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:06.380]   You have total control
[01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:09.780]   because your ShareFile stuff is synced automatically
[01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:10.620]   with the cloud.
[01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:11.740]   You can check your ShareFile anywhere
[01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:14.620]   from any device, smartphone, tablet, laptop.
[01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:16.260]   And that's nice too, because that means,
[01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:18.180]   if you forget, as I often do,
[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:19.140]   to send a file out.
[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:22.420]   I use it for sharing audio with radio stations
[01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:23.700]   on the radio show.
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:24.540]   And they call and say,
[01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:26.300]   we didn't get the ad, you recorded, oh no,
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:27.420]   but I got it on my phone.
[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:30.340]   I just press a button and it's there, it's shared.
[01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:31.180]   I'll tell you what,
[01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:32.460]   if you're not using ShareFile yet, it's great.
[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:35.100]   Look at all the industries, hundreds of industries.
[01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:36.180]   It's HIPAA compliant.
[01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:38.700]   So it's compliant with a lot of government regulations
[01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:40.180]   in a variety of industries.
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:41.980]   If you're not using ShareFile yet,
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:43.940]   I want you to sign up for my free trial.
[01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:45.860]   No credit card required, it's very easy,
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:47.260]   nothing to lose.
[01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:49.020]   Go to sharefile.com,
[01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:50.700]   click on the microphone at the top of the page
[01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:53.860]   and enter TWIT, T-W-I-T, that's all you need.
[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:54.940]   See, at the top of the page,
[01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:57.060]   there's like a microphone or a,
[01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:59.180]   I heard it on a podcast thing.
[01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:00.140]   That's the one you want.
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:01.940]   And then you enter the offer code TWIT.
[01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:03.620]   Thank you so much, ShareFile and Citrix,
[01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:06.140]   for sponsoring the show, even though Josh,
[01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:06.980]   was on it.
[01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:10.220]   - Sir, look, I just,
[01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:13.180]   don't wipe it off. - No, no, no, no, stop!
[01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:14.700]   - I'm just baiting you.
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:16.980]   Stop making reference to my problem.
[01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:20.260]   - Wait a minute, there's two people where one was before.
[01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:22.900]   - All right, hold on, I'm about to enable in studio audio.
[01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:24.780]   So you're gonna hear echo for a little bit
[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:26.820]   when you hear yourself, but why?
[01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:28.660]   - Is that a double box or is,
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:30.540]   I don't know, whoa, this is cool.
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:32.220]   - Who's the author of the day?
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:35.980]   - I could sit on myself, the luckiest man.
[01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:37.580]   - On the face of the earth.
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:40.860]   - It takes a bit for Skype to figure it out,
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:43.420]   but you know, we were talking about Google Glass,
[01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:45.660]   and you know, one of the people who got accepted
[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:46.580]   was this guy.
[01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:49.220]   I didn't know this until last night.
[01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:50.500]   - Yeah, yeah, I got that.
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:52.020]   - Justin Robert Young, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:52.860]   and what did you say?
[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:53.700]   What was your tweet?
[01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:54.540]   - Tweet.
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:57.700]   - I believe the exact wording was that,
[01:12:57.700 --> 01:12:59.300]   'cause I run scavenger hunts now,
[01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:01.940]   and I travel over the country and sometimes the world,
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:05.260]   and so I would run scavenger hunts with Google Glass
[01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:07.700]   and travel the country and sometimes the world.
[01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:08.900]   - Well, and that brings up--
[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:11.140]   - You just added Google Glass to the thing you do.
[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:12.300]   You're a genius.
[01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:13.580]   I'm like, I just wanna drink whiskey.
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:15.260]   - I'll host a couple of US drink whiskey.
[01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:18.460]   - Go check one tech podcast every once in a while.
[01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:20.900]   - Dude, that's about apparently what it took
[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:22.580]   to get in on this thing, right?
[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:26.660]   Because sometimes just making random, revolved threats
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:27.900]   to Google and the product.
[01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:28.980]   - Yeah, that's good.
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:30.740]   - Like, did you read this, Leo?
[01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:32.420]   About the people who just basically threw,
[01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:33.780]   you know, were like, if I had glass,
[01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:35.980]   I'd throw it in your face, and then Google's like,
[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:37.500]   okay, congratulations, you're in.
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:39.380]   - I think they thought they could win them over.
[01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:41.780]   - Well, I'm thinking that maybe not as many people
[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:43.860]   as they thought would apply, applied,
[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:45.180]   so everybody got in.
[01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:46.020]   - Great deal.
[01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:47.220]   - Well, okay, yes.
[01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:51.180]   The privilege of spending $1,500 is an unusual one,
[01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:53.860]   to say the least, but specifically,
[01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:55.580]   if you look at this article,
[01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:59.300]   if you, basically, New York, I guess,
[01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:00.940]   yeah, New York, New York Magazine.
[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:02.300]   - Right, had an article that says,
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:05.140]   Google appears to have selected all of their glass winners
[01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:07.660]   at random, but as you go through,
[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:09.380]   there's a bunch of these terrible tweets
[01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:11.540]   that are followed up with, congratulations,
[01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:14.540]   you're in the program, and almost all of them are girls,
[01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:17.220]   which makes me wonder if maybe just maybe--
[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:19.780]   - Hey ladies, who wants glass?
[01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:21.100]   (laughing)
[01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:23.180]   - All right, I want you to go to the bathroom.
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:24.540]   You see that mirror?
[01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:26.380]   Look at it.
[01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:27.700]   - What's happening with this?
[01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:30.020]   - They're horrific, that's the only way it would work.
[01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:31.860]   It's pointed out.
[01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:32.700]   - Oh, that's true.
[01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:34.380]   - It's pointed away from you.
[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:35.620]   - Yeah, what is the goal there?
[01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:36.460]   - You gotta look in the mirror.
[01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:38.100]   - She should have gotten one, though.
[01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:40.780]   Krista Bohan says, "I would promise not to record
[01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:42.700]   "take pictures of my poop, no matter what."
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:43.540]   - She wins!
[01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:44.380]   - If I had glass.
[01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:45.220]   - She wins!
[01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:47.340]   - Everyone to be able to sign that.
[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:48.340]   - Go on, yeah.
[01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:51.940]   - To get Google Glass, you have to sign agreement, binding,
[01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:53.700]   no poop, on paid of death.
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:55.940]   - Here's the weird thing, do they even say,
[01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:58.020]   at the beginning, how many they were gonna choose,
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:14:58.860]   do they say a number?
[01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:00.020]   I don't remember.
[01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:00.860]   I should know this.
[01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:01.700]   I don't think they did.
[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:02.540]   - I don't think you just look at it.
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:03.380]   - I think you just look at it.
[01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:04.860]   - I think they're like, we're just gonna pick people
[01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:05.700]   who we like.
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:07.740]   They didn't have to pick a ton of people at first.
[01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:09.780]   They could have said, "Here's our first 20 people.
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:11.060]   "We'll be announcing more later."
[01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:13.220]   And it could have been 20 interesting people.
[01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:15.540]   They did, I don't know what kind of criteria they use,
[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:17.660]   but let's just say that, you know,
[01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:21.940]   they didn't use App Store style guidelines
[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:22.780]   for getting off the table.
[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:25.700]   - My question is, do we know anyone who did not get
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:28.180]   an invitation, like were there people turned down?
[01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:29.060]   - Yeah, me?
[01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:30.060]   I have been live.
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:30.900]   - Are you guys really bad?
[01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:33.300]   - I said like 8000 of some of them.
[01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:35.060]   - Padre S.J. got in.
[01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:36.620]   You got in.
[01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:37.460]   - I got it.
[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:40.500]   - Brian's magician friend, C.J. Johnson got in.
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:41.820]   - Irma Gurd got in.
[01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:43.780]   - The dog at the Twits D.O. got in.
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:46.020]   - Did Jeff Jarvis get in?
[01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:47.100]   - They had a dog model.
[01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:48.460]   - Jeff, I think did get in.
[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:49.300]   - Yes, he did.
[01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:50.340]   - Real or fake, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:51.580]   - Real Jeff Jarvis got in.
[01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:53.180]   Fake Jeff Jarvis, I don't know.
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:54.580]   - He might have got in too.
[01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:57.140]   - How did, old John Smoky got in.
[01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:58.460]   (laughing)
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:15:59.860]   - So the question is.
[01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:01.180]   - Markins Bradley got in.
[01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:03.060]   (laughing)
[01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:04.980]   - The question is, it's $1,500.
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:06.540]   It's not like you got a free pair.
[01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:07.380]   - Here's the best part.
[01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:08.700]   I don't know if anyone's mentioning this yet.
[01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:10.900]   So Google did have a third party
[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:12.980]   doing the acceptances on Twitter.
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:14.780]   And some of those people that we just showed
[01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:16.220]   from the New York Magazine story,
[01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:18.100]   the one that was like, I'm gonna throw it in your face.
[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:19.740]   So I won't take pictures of my poop.
[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:21.620]   Their offers were rescinded.
[01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:22.460]   - Oh.
[01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:24.500]   - So they no longer have the first right
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:27.380]   to spend $1,500 on Google Glass.
[01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:29.260]   - Just kidding because it turns out,
[01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:32.900]   once we read your tweet, it turns out it wasn't that good.
[01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:35.220]   - Yeah, like it turns out you're not good for Google Glass.
[01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:38.340]   Neil Patrick Harris, Newt Gingrich, Newt Gingrich.
[01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:39.180]   - That's good.
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:40.020]   - Adam Savage.
[01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:42.020]   - I'll tell you what, I'd like to see all three
[01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:43.620]   of those guys in a room wearing Google Glass.
[01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:44.980]   - Yeah, soldier boy.
[01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:45.820]   - Yeah.
[01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:46.660]   - Add him to the list.
[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:47.500]   - Great choice, perfect.
[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:48.340]   - Great choice.
[01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:49.180]   - I'm looking forward to it.
[01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:52.380]   I wonder if they'll have a special channel on YouTube
[01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:55.100]   for all publicly published glass videos.
[01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:56.940]   - When these come out, or hang out, so whatever.
[01:16:56.940 --> 01:16:59.620]   - When we have a Twitter, you guys all come back
[01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:00.580]   and you wear your glass.
[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:01.740]   - Yeah, I'll steal someone's glass and I'll come back.
[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:02.580]   - Oh, you didn't get one?
[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:03.420]   - I didn't get one.
[01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:05.180]   - I didn't submit either, so that might have something.
[01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:06.020]   - No, Brian didn't get one.
[01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:07.020]   - I think it's a combination.
[01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:07.860]   - I think it's a deal.
[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:11.940]   - I think you can do hangouts using glass.
[01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:12.780]   - Yeah.
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:17.980]   - You got a bunch of people in glass doing a hangout together.
[01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:19.780]   - Did Fallon get one?
[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:21.500]   - You can only see other people.
[01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:23.940]   You can only see the people that they're looking at, right?
[01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:24.780]   - Right, that's weird.
[01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:25.620]   - That's weird.
[01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:27.340]   - They're looking at each other.
[01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:28.780]   - Yeah, it's like what they showed in the commercial
[01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:29.900]   was like your skydiving.
[01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:30.740]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:33.620]   - And you start to hang out to let people watch your face.
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:34.620]   - You fall, it's fine.
[01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:38.100]   - Or you're handling a snake and your kids can see it
[01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:38.940]   from your perspective.
[01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:40.140]   - Okay, it's right before you bite
[01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:41.780]   and then your kids see you get points.
[01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:42.700]   - They see you crying.
[01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:43.540]   - Yeah.
[01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:44.380]   - Which is, thanks Google.
[01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:45.220]   - No, they don't see you die.
[01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:46.620]   They see what it looks like as you die.
[01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:47.860]   What you're seeing is you die.
[01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:48.700]   - No, yeah, I see you.
[01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:49.620]   - It's like a video game.
[01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:50.460]   They see you.
[01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:52.860]   - It's in your field of view, go sideways.
[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:54.620]   - You think for children it would be scarring
[01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:57.900]   if they watched from their father's perspective is he died?
[01:17:57.900 --> 01:17:59.540]   - That'd be upsetting or not.
[01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:00.380]   - I don't need that.
[01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:02.940]   - I'm gonna say yes, Joshua.
[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:03.940]   - That's what it's.
[01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:04.780]   - Safe bet.
[01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:07.580]   - Okay, so here's my question.
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:11.460]   Is what's the overunder on people who were offered invites
[01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:12.900]   who actually challenged them?
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:14.340]   - Oh yeah, what's the conversion?
[01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:15.500]   Like you think 50%?
[01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:17.020]   - Yeah, tweet is $0.
[01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:19.460]   Google Glass is $1,500.
[01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:20.300]   - Yeah.
[01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:21.620]   - What's the question?
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:23.660]   - The overunder, if we're gonna do an overunder
[01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:24.980]   and the overunder, we're gonna do it.
[01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:26.580]   - We're gonna buy this.
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:27.580]   I'm not a gambler.
[01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:30.500]   - Going over 30% of the people who got it.
[01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:32.580]   - Yeah, fewer than that, I think 5%.
[01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:33.820]   - 20%, it's gonna be low.
[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:35.100]   - And then of those who go through,
[01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:36.780]   how many actual clear funds?
[01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:39.420]   - $1,500, it's quite expensive.
[01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:40.660]   - That's a laptop.
[01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:41.980]   - A lot of buys it.
[01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:42.820]   - You're for you.
[01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:43.660]   - You're for you.
[01:18:43.660 --> 01:18:44.460]   - The friend factor, because like the moment,
[01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:46.420]   the moment I found out that Justin,
[01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:48.060]   and this is not even a lie, not an exaggeration,
[01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:49.700]   the moment I found out Justin was in,
[01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:50.980]   the first thing I thought was like,
[01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:52.060]   hey bro, if you're not gonna do it,
[01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:52.900]   I'll give you 15 minutes.
[01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:54.940]   - No, you've, well that's the other thing is,
[01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:56.580]   you probably should buy it because you could sell
[01:18:56.580 --> 01:18:57.420]   an eBay for 15 minutes.
[01:18:57.420 --> 01:18:58.980]   - You sell value, yeah.
[01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:01.900]   - Right, you, 15, I want, they're gonna.
[01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:02.740]   - You think?
[01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:04.340]   How much will it go for on eBay?
[01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:05.660]   - I don't know, I mean if you,
[01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:07.580]   look if they're accepting the poop woman,
[01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:08.860]   it doesn't do it.
[01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:11.180]   See if I can't do value the product a little bit here,
[01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:12.020]   you know?
[01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:13.980]   Like you need to, if you really wanna make it special,
[01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:15.980]   you only give it to Soldier Boy and Newt Gingrich,
[01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:17.580]   and then everybody's like, and I gotta get one.
[01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:18.980]   - And you do what the way my space seems
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:19.820]   to know about.
[01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:21.380]   - I wanna have Soldier Boy and Newt
[01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:22.220]   here on the phone.
[01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:23.340]   Hey Soldier Boy, did you get one?
[01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:24.580]   Yeah, I got one, did you get one Newt?
[01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:25.420]   Yeah, I got one.
[01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:27.740]   But you see that poop lady got one too.
[01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:30.620]   - What if they only take pictures of their poop?
[01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:33.020]   Then, I love, I love Soldier Boy,
[01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:34.420]   you're gonna take pictures of your poop?
[01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:35.620]   Yes I am.
[01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:36.460]   - Exactly.
[01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:37.460]   - I didn't say I would.
[01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:41.460]   - Newt, all I'm saying is that now a poop lady
[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:42.300]   is the same thing. - That is not the title
[01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:43.140]   of the show.
[01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:43.980]   - Congratulations on Chris.
[01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:46.140]   - No, I'm detouring in advance.
[01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:48.220]   - I feel like she's being unfairly maligned.
[01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:50.580]   She was the, will not take pictures.
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:52.740]   - Well she's the hero of this whole fiasco.
[01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:56.380]   - But I think the point is no one asked her if she would.
[01:19:56.380 --> 01:19:57.220]   (laughing)
[01:19:57.220 --> 01:19:59.900]   - What I like about that, Joshua,
[01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:02.060]   my respectfully cut you off,
[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:06.620]   is that she anticipates a lot of poop imagery
[01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:07.900]   coming from Google Glass.
[01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:09.260]   - It's the terms of service that they're--
[01:20:09.260 --> 01:20:11.700]   - And she is already getting out in front of this thing.
[01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:12.540]   - Yeah.
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:14.820]   - Right, and she is preventing bad things from happening.
[01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:16.580]   - She's not the poop lady, she's the not poop lady.
[01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:19.340]   - She's a futurist, and she's our leader, she's a profit.
[01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:20.180]   - Yo.
[01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:23.900]   - I think, maybe you're giving her a little more credit.
[01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:25.220]   - I feel like you're not giving her enough credit.
[01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:26.860]   - I don't want to overstate this.
[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:27.700]   - Let's agree to--
[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:32.700]   - Mr. Heitman on the face mirror glasses VR thing.
[01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:35.220]   - I'm gonna go off on the hostel.
[01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:36.900]   - I'm not gonna hostel, hostel is--
[01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:37.980]   - We're gonna risk you, look at you,
[01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:40.220]   look at how angry you get with a little bit of whiskey.
[01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:41.060]   - Now I'm very calm.
[01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:42.740]   - All right, Timo, you were excited about that.
[01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:43.980]   - Timo, I am, and in terms of,
[01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:46.020]   I don't know how much time we have left for actual stories,
[01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:46.860]   but-- - One minute.
[01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:48.940]   - We got one minute to Game of Thrones.
[01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:51.340]   This idea of, you know, the press release
[01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:52.820]   that Timo put out was a little annoying,
[01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:55.580]   but the idea that they are trying to be more accessible,
[01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:57.820]   cut through the BS, the marketing BS,
[01:20:57.820 --> 01:21:00.140]   the actual BS of some of our cell phone,
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:02.580]   like they could be that hope that we've been--
[01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:03.420]   - I'm run for it.
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:05.020]   - We don't have real competition.
[01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:06.340]   - And where-- - If it's not them,
[01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:07.660]   I don't know who it is, that has spectrum
[01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:08.500]   that can really do something.
[01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:09.900]   - I will say this, this is cool, here's the thing,
[01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:11.300]   T-Mobile, they're basically saying,
[01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:12.180]   I think that here's the thing,
[01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:14.620]   if you look at their plans, you buy a phone on their service
[01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:17.140]   and you do whatever your regular thing is that you normally do,
[01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:20.460]   it's still almost as expensive as the other companies.
[01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:21.940]   They've always been a little bit cheaper,
[01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:22.980]   they're still a little bit cheaper,
[01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:24.980]   but it's not like super cheap.
[01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:26.820]   The interesting thing is the idea that
[01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:30.980]   if you're buying a phone, right, like I've got a phone
[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:33.420]   or I have an iPhone and an AT&T and I'm sick of AT&T,
[01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:36.460]   you can go to T-Mobile with your phone, get service,
[01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:38.260]   you hate it, you're like, all right, I'm out of here,
[01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:39.620]   there's nothing stopping you from doing that.
[01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:40.780]   You're not trying to pay them back--
[01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:41.620]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:43.980]   - And the word, what was that word
[01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:45.660]   that we came up with earlier today, Josh?
[01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:47.740]   - I believe it was freedom.
[01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:48.580]   - Freedom?
[01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:49.420]   - Freedom.
[01:21:49.420 --> 01:21:52.300]   - The word that we invented here on the podcast.
[01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:54.020]   - Do you think anything's different?
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:55.980]   This is, I mean, this is marketing hype
[01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:56.820]   and it's like--
[01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:58.140]   - Think different, Brian.
[01:21:58.140 --> 01:22:00.980]   - It's mark hype that I love, but it's still just like,
[01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:02.820]   this is what you do when you're in fourth place.
[01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:05.020]   You thought, yeah, that's why competition is good,
[01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:06.020]   that's why we're at this.
[01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:08.020]   - Are we not glad now that the government
[01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:10.140]   stopped the AT&T T-Mobile merger?
[01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:12.540]   This isn't why we wanted them to stop that.
[01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:15.060]   - Brian, can you go to Verizon with whatever phone you want
[01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:15.900]   to say, give me service,
[01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:17.020]   and if I don't like it in two months,
[01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:18.900]   I'm out of here and they won't charge you anything for that?
[01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:20.700]   - That's real freedom, Brian.
[01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:21.620]   - That's freedom.
[01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:22.940]   Welcome to America. - That's what freedom looks like.
[01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:24.380]   - Thank you, welcome to our great land.
[01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:26.300]   - I can't just freak them. - Take that.
[01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:27.660]   - I don't know what's going on,
[01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:28.980]   I don't know what's going on where you are right now,
[01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:30.700]   but we're living in a free place.
[01:22:30.700 --> 01:22:35.260]   - But I would say one, the clarity of what you get
[01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:39.140]   for the money you give is higher with what they're proposing.
[01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:40.780]   And the contract thing is a real thing.
[01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:43.540]   So, Brian, if you could specifically respond to the,
[01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:46.820]   you know, back up your claims of this all being marketing spin
[01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:49.740]   with respect to getting out of a non-existent contract,
[01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:51.740]   how is that not real value?
[01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:54.900]   - Yes, and obviously getting out of the contract is good,
[01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:58.020]   but this is nothing new, this is what Ting
[01:22:58.020 --> 01:22:59.500]   felt their whole service platform.
[01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:00.740]   - Right. - We've talked about
[01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:02.460]   and the whole disclosure Ting is a sponsor,
[01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:05.140]   Vanessa W. Show, who's been like Ting?
[01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:07.820]   - It's an MVNO that does exactly the same thing
[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:09.100]   with the sprint network. - That works now.
[01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:10.940]   - Yeah, well, if you listen to Twitter,
[01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:12.180]   you would know. - Brian, I don't want to call you out,
[01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:13.740]   that just seemed like a plug.
[01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:15.340]   (laughing)
[01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:18.180]   - No, obviously, everybody, you've heard of Ting,
[01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:20.540]   but what about Ting and Walla Walla Bing Bang?
[01:23:20.540 --> 01:23:23.220]   Those, those are where freedom is really happening.
[01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:24.220]   - That's a lot of people you've been into the show.
[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:25.780]   - I'm honest with you, it makes that plug.
[01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:28.220]   - That plug, Brian makes you want to run out of here
[01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:29.260]   in my Nike shoes.
[01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:30.620]   - Go ahead, get out of here.
[01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:31.460]   - It's a podcast.
[01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:33.660]   - Go ahead, 'cause Game of Thrones is on in an hour
[01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:35.020]   and apparently he's got to prepare.
[01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:35.860]   - I gotta get back to the bay.
[01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:36.700]   - I need to pay.
[01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:38.020]   - We're gonna get my body.
[01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:41.340]   - We're gonna let you go, I'm gonna do one more ad.
[01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:44.020]   - You don't have to talk about the comedy pilot you do
[01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:45.540]   on Amazon. - You're gonna put some fake.
[01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:47.380]   Leo, before we wrap, let me be here.
[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:48.740]   - We're not wrapping.
[01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:49.900]   - I'm not against him.
[01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:51.340]   - No, Josh was leaving.
[01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:52.860]   - I hate it. - I thought we were wrapping.
[01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:53.860]   - I'm not--
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:56.740]   - I wanna stay until this thing is over.
[01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:58.180]   - Without Josh, there is no twit.
[01:23:58.180 --> 01:23:59.340]   - I have no state. - I have no state.
[01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:00.340]   - I'm not falling in loss control of this.
[01:24:00.340 --> 01:24:01.180]   - 'Cause I'm falling in that contract.
[01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:05.020]   - Leo, listen, I decided I'm in till the end of it.
[01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:05.860]   - You're in!
[01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:06.700]   - All right, we'll end up--
[01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:07.540]   - We're gonna make these for more than--
[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:08.380]   - We're gonna make these for more than--
[01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:09.740]   - Pay the iron price.
[01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:11.340]   - If it goes for more than 10 or 15 minutes--
[01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:12.460]   - No, no, we're almost done.
[01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:13.300]   - We're almost done.
[01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:14.140]   - Let's do it. - Yeah.
[01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:14.980]   - Together.
[01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:15.980]   - Together. - You and me.
[01:24:15.980 --> 01:24:17.340]   - It's a family. - It's a family.
[01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:18.700]   - It's a family. - Yeah.
[01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:20.900]   - Even Brian. - Even Brian.
[01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:22.020]   - Especially Brian.
[01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:23.740]   - You know what today is world backup day.
[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:24.820]   Did you know that?
[01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:26.500]   - No, but I do use a new backup service
[01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:27.380]   I'm actually quite happy with.
[01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:29.380]   - Don't tell us about it if it's not carbonite.
[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:32.380]   (laughing)
[01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:34.020]   - And that's what the opposite of freedom is.
[01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:36.060]   - You know, I think we're gonna have to go to a
[01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:37.220]   listening supported model.
[01:24:37.220 --> 01:24:39.940]   I'm just thinking it's all over for the average person.
[01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:41.420]   - Go ahead, do your carbonite thing.
[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:42.420]   - I'm getting a little hot.
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:44.340]   I'm getting some flop sweats here.
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:45.260]   - Nice.
[01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:46.420]   - No one needs to know that.
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:48.020]   - So how great.
[01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:49.300]   - You sweaty for what he thinks about
[01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:50.740]   how amazing carbonite is in the middle.
[01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:51.660]   - That's it.
[01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:53.740]   - I'm sweaty when I'm thinking about all that data
[01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:55.620]   that there's millions of people out there
[01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:57.260]   who do not back up, you know that.
[01:24:57.260 --> 01:24:58.100]   - Oh, definitely.
[01:24:58.100 --> 01:24:59.660]   - There's millions of people who think they've got a backup.
[01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:00.700]   I asked my dad, do you back up?
[01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:02.980]   He said, yeah, everyone so I'll put my USB key in there,
[01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:03.980]   drag some stuff to it.
[01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:05.580]   I said, dad, that's not a backup.
[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:08.100]   First of all, you gotta remember to do it, right?
[01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:09.100]   Which you're not gonna do.
[01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:11.460]   In fact, inevitably your hardware's gonna fail
[01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:13.580]   the longest possible amount of time between the time
[01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:17.020]   you did that last and now.
[01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:20.980]   That also is sitting right next to the computer.
[01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:23.380]   What if really there's a disaster, a fire or somebody comes
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:25.220]   and steals you, so you need to have offsite,
[01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:26.500]   automatic, continuous backup.
[01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:28.340]   I think you'd agree with me on that very interesting.
[01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:29.180]   - I do very strongly agree.
[01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:31.340]   I've suffered a catastrophic data loss before.
[01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:32.380]   I don't wanna do that again.
[01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:34.180]   - How did you overcome that?
[01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:35.940]   - I cried a lot.
[01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:39.060]   I blogged about it, got the rage and self blame
[01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:39.900]   out of my system.
[01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:40.940]   - You went through all the stages,
[01:25:40.940 --> 01:25:43.020]   you went through denial and acceptance.
[01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:44.580]   - I added a few bacon bullets.
[01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:45.900]   - Bacon is always a great stage.
[01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:46.740]   - Definitely helped.
[01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:47.580]   - It's very tricky.
[01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:49.220]   - Yeah, psychologically, but it didn't help
[01:25:49.220 --> 01:25:50.060]   the future data.
[01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:51.060]   - Francis for a couple of weeks,
[01:25:51.060 --> 01:25:52.620]   he was in Argentina a couple of years ago,
[01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:54.700]   they stole his computer and they stole his backups.
[01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:55.980]   - Who's there?
[01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:56.820]   - Some bad guys.
[01:25:56.820 --> 01:25:57.660]   - Okay.
[01:25:57.660 --> 01:25:59.780]   - Did you just say who's that to Francis for?
[01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:00.620]   - No, no, no.
[01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:01.460]   - Who's the big?
[01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:02.300]   - Who's the big?
[01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:03.300]   - We don't know bad guys.
[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:04.140]   - I think it's a bad guy.
[01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:04.980]   - I think it's a bad guy.
[01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:05.820]   - I think it's a bad guy.
[01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:06.660]   - I think it's a bad guy.
[01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:07.500]   - I think it's a bad guy.
[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:08.340]   - I think it's a bad guy.
[01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:09.180]   - I think it's a bad guy.
[01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:10.020]   - I think it's a bad guy.
[01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:10.860]   - I think it's a bad guy.
[01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:12.020]   - I think it's a bad guy.
[01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:12.860]   - I think it's a bad guy.
[01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:13.700]   - I think it's a bad guy.
[01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:14.540]   - I think it's a bad guy.
[01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:15.380]   - I think it's a bad guy.
[01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:16.300]   - I think it's a bad guy.
[01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:17.140]   - I think it's a bad guy.
[01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:17.980]   - I think it's a bad guy.
[01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:18.820]   - I think it's a bad guy.
[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:19.660]   - I think it's a bad guy.
[01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:20.660]   - I think it's a bad guy.
[01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:22.380]   - I'm excited about Peggy's who got married too.
[01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:24.180]   But, you know, A, okay.
[01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:26.900]   So, one not from the heart he was gonna do.
[01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:27.980]   That was gonna be good.
[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:31.380]   But anyway, the bottom line is if you back up with carbon
[01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:33.780]   and it's automatic, it's continuous, it's in the clouds.
[01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:35.580]   You could see it, by the way, it's a cloud storage.
[01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:36.620]   You should consider this.
[01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:38.860]   You could log on with your iPhone or your iPad
[01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:41.220]   or your Android device and there's your stuff.
[01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:43.580]   Anytime, and here's the best part.
[01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:44.940]   I don't tell me the other one,
[01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:46.860]   but how much are you paying for the other one?
[01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:48.860]   - I'm paying $70 a year.
[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:50.580]   - $59 a year.
[01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:52.740]   And if you use the offer code TWIT,
[01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:54.580]   two free months, $14 for $59, okay?
[01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:56.260]   - I've got one that's $49.
[01:26:56.260 --> 01:26:57.100]   - Shut up.
[01:26:57.100 --> 01:26:58.860]   (laughing)
[01:26:58.860 --> 01:26:59.700]   Go away.
[01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:00.580]   - No, it's not a real service.
[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:01.860]   It's just a signup page.
[01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:03.860]   - Oh, oh, it's a mess with you.
[01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:05.020]   - Peggy Sue got divorced.
[01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:06.220]   That was gonna be the sequel.
[01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:07.660]   And I'm sorry that we missed that one.
[01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:08.500]   - Wow, wow.
[01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:09.780]   - With Boston or Mac on.
[01:27:09.780 --> 01:27:10.860]   Thanks to no carbonite.
[01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:11.700]   - If carbonite--
[01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:13.220]   - It's been there.
[01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:14.660]   - You'd have Peggy Sue got divorced.
[01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:15.980]   - Peggy Sue got divorced.
[01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:17.180]   - Actually, we should really,
[01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:18.820]   maybe he shouldn't have backed up.
[01:27:18.820 --> 01:27:19.780]   So try it today.
[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:21.740]   It's free for the first two weeks.
[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:22.580]   You don't need a credit card.
[01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:23.980]   Just the offer code TWIT.
[01:27:23.980 --> 01:27:26.140]   If you decide to buy afterwards,
[01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:27.380]   you get two free months.
[01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:29.620]   - Yeah, people should do the backup thing.
[01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:31.060]   - We all agree on that.
[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:31.900]   - Absolutely.
[01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:32.740]   - We all agree on that.
[01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:33.580]   - Absolutely.
[01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:34.420]   - Thank you, carbonite.
[01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:35.260]   - Thank you, carbonite.
[01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:36.100]   - Thank you, carbonite.
[01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:38.500]   - Yes, it's World Backup Day.
[01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:39.500]   - That's a good day to have.
[01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:40.340]   I'm the Easter.
[01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:41.180]   - Yeah, Easter.
[01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:42.020]   - It's coinciding with great movies.
[01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:43.420]   - That's gonna be a bad day for World Backup Day.
[01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:45.140]   - No, the future of it's bigger than backups.
[01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:45.980]   - You know why they do it?
[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:48.060]   The day before April Fool's Day is World Backup Day.
[01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:49.220]   Why do you think?
[01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:53.340]   If you're not participating in this broadcast right now,
[01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:56.620]   you can't hear the sound of all of Leo's sponsors
[01:27:56.620 --> 01:27:57.460]   pulling out.
[01:27:57.460 --> 01:27:58.580]   (laughing)
[01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:00.740]   - I feel like rush Limbaugh right now.
[01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:04.860]   - Are you gonna have to have a backup day today?
[01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:05.780]   - Ooh.
[01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:08.940]   - Basically your data can return, you know?
[01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:09.780]   - You date it?
[01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:10.620]   - Like Jesus.
[01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:11.460]   - Oh, there you go.
[01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:12.300]   Is it the resurrection?
[01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:13.140]   - Oh no, stop.
[01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:15.940]   - This is why we don't let Justin Robert Young do ads.
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:18.140]   - Stop, stop right now.
[01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:19.540]   - That definitely was not a poo-pop.
[01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:20.380]   - I don't know why.
[01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:21.620]   What is wrong with you?
[01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:22.820]   What is wrong with you?
[01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:24.060]   Why do you go there?
[01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:26.940]   You're like, it's like you've got Tourette's,
[01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:28.220]   offensive Tourette's.
[01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:29.460]   It's like, what can I say that would be
[01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:30.740]   the most offensive thing right now?
[01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:34.220]   - Leo, just, this is my first time ever meeting Justin.
[01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:36.940]   But I do think there's only one member of this panel
[01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:38.260]   who referred to his penis today.
[01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:39.300]   - Okay, all right.
[01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:40.380]   (laughing)
[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:41.220]   You're right?
[01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:43.060]   No, I'll grant you that.
[01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:43.900]   - What?
[01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:44.740]   - Wait a minute.
[01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:46.900]   Is it time to drink from the green zippy cup?
[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:48.740]   - Whoa, whoa, you got it, I got it.
[01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:50.700]   - That's the winner, I got it green zippy cup.
[01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:53.740]   - What's amazing is when they can key out that green
[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:55.020]   and put green bows on it.
[01:28:55.020 --> 01:28:56.300]   You have a magic zippy cup.
[01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:57.140]   That's amazing.
[01:28:57.140 --> 01:28:57.980]   - You're a monster, not or not.
[01:28:57.980 --> 01:28:59.420]   - Didn't you guys bring your green zippy cups?
[01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:00.780]   - I did not today bring my green.
[01:29:00.780 --> 01:29:02.580]   - Somebody's got to fill you in on a quick tradition, man.
[01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:03.420]   I don't know, check my--
[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:04.260]   - Holy cow.
[01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:05.100]   - Hmm.
[01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:05.940]   - Mine eat one.
[01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:07.060]   - Good read magic.
[01:29:07.060 --> 01:29:07.900]   - Leo.
[01:29:07.900 --> 01:29:09.940]   - Good read, so didn't Amazon buy shell fari,
[01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:11.340]   not so long ago, like a couple years ago.
[01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:12.180]   And now they have good news.
[01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:14.900]   They own the entire social reading spectrum.
[01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:15.740]   I'm not happy with that.
[01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:16.940]   - But there's a whole internet out there too.
[01:29:16.940 --> 01:29:18.980]   - The rumor is they paid the point of busy week
[01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:20.660]   a billion dollars for good reads,
[01:29:20.660 --> 01:29:21.580]   even though they have shell fari.
[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:22.420]   That's not a lot.
[01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:23.500]   - The rumor is not true.
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:24.860]   Not true, you want a debunk.
[01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:25.700]   - It's not true, it's not true.
[01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:29.620]   - I can't personally say for sure that they didn't,
[01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:32.940]   but there's a lot of evidence that they might not have.
[01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:33.780]   - Oh, good.
[01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:35.220]   - Let's put it that way.
[01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:38.380]   - It would vat, there are 202 million active accounts.
[01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:39.220]   - Yeah, that's a lot.
[01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:40.060]   - That's a lot.
[01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:40.900]   - That's a two million nerds.
[01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:44.220]   - $100 a user that would be about, you know?
[01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:45.060]   I don't know what that is.
[01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:45.900]   - But $100 I can't do math.
[01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:46.740]   - But it's a lot.
[01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:47.580]   - It'd be 200 million.
[01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:49.380]   That'd be 200 million.
[01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:50.460]   - No, that's a dollar a user.
[01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:51.940]   - No, that'd be 200.
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:52.780]   I don't know, I can't do math.
[01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:53.620]   - He said he's a writer, right?
[01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:54.460]   - He's not a--
[01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:55.300]   - He's not a--
[01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:56.700]   - And you're doing surgery on the street?
[01:29:56.700 --> 01:29:57.540]   What is wrong with you?
[01:29:57.540 --> 01:29:58.460]   - Bad surgery.
[01:29:58.460 --> 01:29:59.460]   - Street surgery.
[01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:00.540]   - A lot of corpses.
[01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:02.900]   - Mostly medical research.
[01:30:02.900 --> 01:30:04.580]   - It's mostly showmanship.
[01:30:04.580 --> 01:30:06.980]   It's 90% showmanship and 10%,
[01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:09.780]   like actually stabbing somebody with something.
[01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:11.660]   - What is Amazon doing with the comedy pilot?
[01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:13.340]   Are they following in Netflix footsteps?
[01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:15.740]   Netflix of course brought a rest of the development back.
[01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:18.300]   They brought Game of the House of Cards,
[01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:19.140]   back which is wonderful.
[01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:19.980]   - House of Cards is good.
[01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:22.740]   It's not a top 5% show for me, but it's a good show.
[01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:23.580]   - It's a good show.
[01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:24.740]   - That was spoilers.
[01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:25.580]   - Thanks.
[01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:27.180]   - I'm not the person to do that does that,
[01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:28.980]   but I have to change your math.
[01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:29.940]   - I think you're mean.
[01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:32.620]   - So Amazon Studios, they did Zombieland.
[01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:36.900]   I didn't know this, but they're gonna do a comedy pilot
[01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:38.060]   called Baitis.
[01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:39.740]   - Yup, it's about, it looks like a set in the valley.
[01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:43.700]   - This is something that we talked a lot on frame rate about.
[01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:47.540]   The fact that Amazon following the footsteps of Netflix
[01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:50.100]   is investing a lot of money in originals,
[01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:53.060]   which is good news, like more competition is better.
[01:30:53.060 --> 01:30:55.300]   Whether or not you're an Amazon Prime fan or not,
[01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:56.940]   the fact that another player is deciding
[01:30:56.940 --> 01:30:59.940]   to bypass the traditional television media.
[01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:01.860]   - There's the libertarian I love.
[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:02.780]   Thank you, Brian.
[01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:04.740]   - Freedom, let me throw something in an idea out
[01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:07.620]   to you really quickly, Leo and gang, if I may.
[01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:08.460]   - Are we a gang now?
[01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:10.100]   - Yeah, you're a gang.
[01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:10.940]   - All right, good.
[01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:12.140]   - We're close to freedom left,
[01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:12.980]   we're freedom left.
[01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:16.220]   - Yeah, we're like a militia really,
[01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:18.860]   but anyhow, you know, look, a few years ago,
[01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:21.460]   AMC just showed old movies, right?
[01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:23.500]   And they were like, hey, let's make a show.
[01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:25.860]   And they made some amazing television movies.
[01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:28.220]   I see that as we bring down the barrier
[01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:29.580]   of what looks like television,
[01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:31.900]   like I turn on my Xbox and watch TV, right?
[01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:34.700]   Like I don't make a distinction between Netflix and Hulu
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:36.900]   and my cable box very much at this point.
[01:31:36.900 --> 01:31:38.620]   And so-- - But to be honest,
[01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:39.700]   are you one of those people who says,
[01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:41.500]   I don't watch TV, even though you watch TV?
[01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:43.660]   - No, I watch TV as much as possible.
[01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:45.020]   - Me too, me too.
[01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:45.860]   - Me too.
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:46.700]   - Because I love TV.
[01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:47.700]   - Primly relaxing and entertaining.
[01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:49.180]   - Exactly.
[01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:51.460]   - But so the thing is, when that comes down,
[01:31:51.460 --> 01:31:54.020]   like when there's no difference for the viewer
[01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:56.380]   between where they're getting it from,
[01:31:56.380 --> 01:31:59.700]   why shouldn't Netflix, why shouldn't Amazon,
[01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:01.300]   why shouldn't it be making their own style?
[01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:03.140]   - I'm not as sanguine about this as being,
[01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:05.220]   as you are, Brian, as this being a great development,
[01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:06.900]   I see this as purely economic,
[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:09.020]   they look at who's making the money,
[01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:12.620]   and what is the future of offering streaming content
[01:32:12.620 --> 01:32:15.180]   as Netflix is doing versus being an HBO,
[01:32:15.180 --> 01:32:17.020]   and they wanna be an HBO, that's all they say,
[01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:18.020]   this is where you make the money.
[01:32:18.020 --> 01:32:19.100]   - And that's good, I'll have an owner.
[01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:19.940]   I support this.
[01:32:19.940 --> 01:32:20.780]   - Better to be an owner.
[01:32:20.780 --> 01:32:21.620]   - Very much.
[01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:24.300]   - You don't wanna be in a world where content is king,
[01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:25.500]   you don't wanna be the pipe.
[01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:29.060]   - And the also the idea that you'd have to go through
[01:32:29.060 --> 01:32:33.100]   so many legal hurdles to acquire content rights,
[01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:34.380]   to have a library-- - They're killing it.
[01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:36.900]   - The movie industry is killing Netflix really hard.
[01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:39.460]   - I mean, Hollywood uses, Hollywood uses their,
[01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:42.060]   the rights as leverage, the cable companies use rights
[01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:44.300]   as leverage, everybody's trying to use the access
[01:32:44.300 --> 01:32:45.500]   to the content as leverage.
[01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:48.020]   If Netflix suddenly has its own content,
[01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:49.580]   they don't have to worry about the leverage, right?
[01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:50.420]   They've got it. - This is good.
[01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:51.340]   This is good for companies.
[01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:52.820]   - This is also-- - It's good for freedom.
[01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:55.380]   - It's great for television in general,
[01:32:55.380 --> 01:32:56.740]   because all these companies that are right now,
[01:32:56.740 --> 01:32:58.580]   studios that are making television shows,
[01:32:58.580 --> 01:33:00.500]   aren't gonna go away even if television,
[01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:02.380]   as we know it right now, is going to go away.
[01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:06.220]   Right now, their relationship is having a cost per subscriber
[01:33:06.220 --> 01:33:08.820]   model with cable companies, and there's no reason
[01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:11.300]   why that model can't continue to shift further and further
[01:33:11.300 --> 01:33:14.420]   to a direct to consumer relationship.
[01:33:14.420 --> 01:33:17.660]   So right now, from a person who wants to make television,
[01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:19.180]   you now have more places to go,
[01:33:19.180 --> 01:33:20.780]   and companies like Amazon and Netflix,
[01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:22.420]   'cause they want to establish themselves,
[01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:26.300]   are outpacing budget-wise, established and entrenched people,
[01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:28.820]   even the ones that do it right, like HBO.
[01:33:28.820 --> 01:33:32.260]   Netflix outbid HBO, which is an important distinction to make,
[01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:33.860]   is not like they just went to Netflix
[01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:35.420]   because they think it was gonna be a better thing,
[01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:37.300]   or they were the only people who wanted to make it.
[01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:38.820]   They were the ones who wanted to pay them
[01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:42.180]   way more than HBO did, and I think Amazon's going the same route,
[01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:44.340]   which really lifts all tides for people
[01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:45.700]   who are fans of good television,
[01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:48.220]   and not necessarily just common denominator television,
[01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:50.180]   which is currently what is dominating.
[01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:51.020]   - I agree.
[01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:53.100]   And also-- - It is to me
[01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:55.980]   the end of bad reality shows.
[01:33:55.980 --> 01:33:58.340]   Like maybe we'll be able to just go find this stuff we want.
[01:33:58.340 --> 01:34:00.220]   - That's a proud American tradition,
[01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:01.140]   and if you support freedom,
[01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:02.740]   you support the freedom to make crashes as well.
[01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:03.580]   - Actually, I think bad reality--
[01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:04.420]   - Well, it's interesting.
[01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:06.220]   - 'Cause there's this gulf now.
[01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:09.260]   There's almost every basic cable's channels
[01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:11.860]   running bad reality, making bad reality shows.
[01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:12.700]   Let 'em.
[01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:13.620]   I don't know who's watching that.
[01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:15.580]   Obviously somebody is, although I heard American Idol
[01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:18.340]   got the worst ratings ever in history this week,
[01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:19.940]   but somebody's obviously watching on the--
[01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:21.540]   - Here's the people who are gonna start to figure out,
[01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:23.340]   reality is terrible.
[01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:25.580]   I mean, look around you, it's not good out there.
[01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:27.700]   And I don't know why-- - I mean, okay,
[01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:29.340]   that's not the most part of the game.
[01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:31.540]   - I think we gotta put him on a second yet.
[01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:35.540]   - Reality is a gamble, but it's not necessarily terrible.
[01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:37.260]   Remember that the Mythbusters,
[01:34:37.260 --> 01:34:39.140]   one is them in reality category.
[01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:40.900]   I mean, it's like-- - Unscripted and true.
[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:43.660]   - It's a gamble, and you don't know if it's gonna pay off.
[01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:45.300]   If you're gonna have a honey boo boo, then yes.
[01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:47.500]   You know, throw $300,000 at something,
[01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:49.540]   and now you have a $30 million empire, that's great.
[01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:50.940]   - Sorry, honey boo is good in your--
[01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:53.260]   - But if you have a lottery ticket, you can win.
[01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:54.940]   - You're saying honey boo is on the plus,
[01:34:54.940 --> 01:34:56.020]   like the positives.
[01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:57.100]   - That's a winner.
[01:34:57.100 --> 01:34:57.940]   - That's a winner.
[01:34:57.940 --> 01:34:58.940]   - Yes.
[01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:02.100]   - Yeah, I'm sorry, Justin and Brian,
[01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:03.900]   are you in one of those weird houses
[01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:05.300]   where the perspective distorts,
[01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:07.900]   so it looks like one of you is smaller than the other one,
[01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:09.540]   but you're actually in the same plane.
[01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:11.380]   - I'm not sure what you're saying.
[01:35:11.380 --> 01:35:12.540]   - I feel like Justin's not a real person.
[01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:15.340]   - There's something very creepy about this shot.
[01:35:15.340 --> 01:35:17.820]   - It's not a good shot, it's a weird shot.
[01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:19.980]   And here's something that is going to happen.
[01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:20.980]   - Oh my God, that's too much reality.
[01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:24.500]   - So we have, TV has succeeded in part, I think,
[01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:26.740]   and I don't have data, this is just me making things up
[01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:28.900]   that sound reasonable, because it's simple.
[01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:32.180]   And when we start diversifying the different outlets
[01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:34.460]   that all these shows can come through,
[01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:37.500]   Netflix over here, Amazon over there, Hulu over here,
[01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:40.580]   iTunes only, in certain cases,
[01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:43.620]   plus traditional pay cable, premium cable,
[01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:45.220]   over the air broadcast,
[01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:48.100]   there will be a mess made of trying to find the market
[01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:49.420]   for some of these things.
[01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:52.140]   And how does the person who just hears about a show
[01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:53.220]   from their co-worker, from their friend,
[01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:54.740]   from somewhere in their family know
[01:35:54.740 --> 01:35:57.580]   why need this kind of box or this type of subscription
[01:35:57.580 --> 01:36:00.660]   that may end up being a bit of a mess down the line.
[01:36:00.660 --> 01:36:01.620]   - Well, and I think we're there yet,
[01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:02.460]   but it's a mess right now.
[01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:04.180]   - We make it an assumption.
[01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:07.260]   - We make an assumption because we're in the media leader
[01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:09.180]   or whatever, that is actually not true,
[01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:12.620]   which is that these shows that we love Game of Thrones
[01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:14.940]   and Mad Men and stuff are actually gaining audience.
[01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:17.220]   The truth is, far more people watch Honey Boo Boo.
[01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:19.500]   In fact, 7 million people watched American Idol,
[01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:20.940]   that's more than watching Mad Men,
[01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:22.700]   that's more than watching a lot of these shows.
[01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:24.140]   - The more the treasure was it hit?
[01:36:24.140 --> 01:36:27.020]   - Right, so, but what is really
[01:36:27.020 --> 01:36:30.140]   to be celebrated is that a show with a much smaller audience
[01:36:30.140 --> 01:36:33.500]   than traditional network television can be made
[01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:35.180]   and can be made profitably.
[01:36:35.180 --> 01:36:36.820]   And that's what's celebrated.
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:38.580]   And so, really, the truth is,
[01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:40.340]   that's why we have so much diversity now
[01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:41.540]   and that's a good thing.
[01:36:41.540 --> 01:36:43.460]   And it's why people like me and Joshua,
[01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:45.460]   who are actually brilliant intellectuals,
[01:36:45.460 --> 01:36:47.900]   can admit to liking TV again.
[01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:51.140]   - I think part of it is when you kind of democratize this
[01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:53.140]   and look, it is a mess, you're right,
[01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:54.100]   it's a mess right now.
[01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:57.140]   But when you democratize the production of this stuff
[01:36:57.140 --> 01:36:58.780]   and the distribution of this stuff,
[01:36:58.780 --> 01:37:00.140]   what you find is, first off,
[01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:02.860]   it's way cheaper and easier to make really high quality stuff
[01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:03.860]   now than it used to be.
[01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:05.460]   It's way cheaper and easier to distribute
[01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:06.580]   that high quality stuff.
[01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:08.140]   When you democratize that,
[01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:10.820]   what you find is you can build very passionate,
[01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:13.340]   smaller following that can make things profitable
[01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:14.580]   and make things viable.
[01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:17.100]   You don't have to convince every person in America
[01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:18.380]   that they've got to watch the show.
[01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:20.140]   And I think as HBO demonstrates,
[01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:23.540]   they found small groups that love shows
[01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:25.140]   and they're willing to pay for it.
[01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:26.740]   And so their business is profitable.
[01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:28.820]   - But the other thing that you also--
[01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:30.500]   - I think you're on the right track, Joshua,
[01:37:30.500 --> 01:37:32.580]   but I think you're looking in the wrong place.
[01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:36.420]   If you want to see the place where Fleetfooted,
[01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:40.260]   Agile, cheap television, compelling content is made,
[01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:41.420]   it's going to be in YouTube.
[01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:43.140]   And that's the reason that you're seeing Google
[01:37:43.140 --> 01:37:44.740]   just throw millions of dollars and stuff
[01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:46.420]   like that, free space down and down.
[01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:47.580]   - You were just talking about the fact
[01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:49.620]   that that was thrown down the hole.
[01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:51.660]   None of those channels made their money back.
[01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:53.940]   - That's right, and actually one of our sister sites,
[01:37:53.940 --> 01:37:55.180]   SPSB Nation, is one of the channels
[01:37:55.180 --> 01:37:56.900]   and they're doing a different deal now.
[01:37:56.900 --> 01:37:57.980]   It's a much smaller deal.
[01:37:57.980 --> 01:37:59.340]   I think they threw a lot of money and stuff
[01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:00.500]   and they didn't know exactly what they're doing.
[01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:02.220]   I actually think your point is right,
[01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:03.380]   but it's not just about YouTube,
[01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:05.100]   it's about creators on the internet.
[01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:06.980]   It's about people who are like us, for instance,
[01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:10.420]   we make, I like to think pretty high quality video content.
[01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:13.180]   We make it at a budget compared to,
[01:38:13.180 --> 01:38:14.820]   it's a tiny budget compared to what most people
[01:38:14.820 --> 01:38:15.820]   would spend on it.
[01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:18.700]   And we have a huge growing audience who loves that stuff.
[01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:20.100]   And I think that we wouldn't be able to do that
[01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:22.020]   if it weren't for the internet existing
[01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:25.620]   as a distribution method and the cost of creating that stuff
[01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:27.860]   coming way, way down, thanks to new cameras
[01:38:27.860 --> 01:38:30.300]   and new editing technology that's made it way easy.
[01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:32.220]   - I was thinking, what's that?
[01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:35.060]   - No, you're about to hit your ultimate point, please do that.
[01:38:35.060 --> 01:38:35.980]   - No, no, I didn't have it.
[01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:38.260]   My ultimate point is just that it's not about YouTube
[01:38:38.260 --> 01:38:40.020]   or some other particular channel.
[01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:41.900]   Channels are over, that's the thing.
[01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:43.940]   The idea is the content can live on the internet,
[01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:45.620]   you can go get it when you need to get it,
[01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:46.700]   where you need to get it.
[01:38:46.700 --> 01:38:47.860]   That's the whole point of how it's occurred.
[01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:49.220]   I mean, yes, Netflix is making it
[01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:50.540]   and distributing it on Netflix.
[01:38:50.540 --> 01:38:52.020]   But the idea that you can make a show here,
[01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:54.860]   13 at 12 episodes, go get it, we've already done it,
[01:38:54.860 --> 01:38:56.900]   we paid for it, it's on there for you to watch.
[01:38:56.900 --> 01:38:59.340]   Like, that's the thing that has happened,
[01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:00.260]   that's a big deal.
[01:39:00.260 --> 01:39:02.700]   YouTube is a big part of it, but it's not just YouTube,
[01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:04.060]   it's everywhere, it's all over the internet,
[01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:04.900]   people are doing it.
[01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:06.860]   I mean, YouTube's a distribution method, right?
[01:39:06.860 --> 01:39:10.460]   But it's not, you know, it's not the creator of the content.
[01:39:10.460 --> 01:39:12.300]   They're looking for people who will create the content
[01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:14.460]   for them and it's about the creator.
[01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:16.660]   - I promised we'd let you guys go,
[01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:18.980]   the problem is this panel has two freaking good.
[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:20.980]   - And there's two much, really quick.
[01:39:20.980 --> 01:39:21.820]   - I got one, I got one.
[01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:22.660]   - Really quick to say here.
[01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:25.660]   - Quick, so just one more depressing view from you on life.
[01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:27.100]   - We just gotta do this all again,
[01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:28.900]   because you guys have so much good stuff to say.
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:31.740]   - I wanna challenge a little bit the idea
[01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:33.340]   that channels don't matter at all,
[01:39:33.340 --> 01:39:35.740]   because what I think is also absolutely true,
[01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:38.100]   along with general more freedom being generally good,
[01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:40.700]   more shows being created, lots terrible,
[01:39:40.700 --> 01:39:42.660]   lots of bad sloppy stories out there,
[01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:44.460]   bad shooting, bad audio.
[01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:47.260]   But getting attention to the good thing
[01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:50.100]   is possibly harder, because not everyone's looking
[01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:51.500]   in the same place to find it.
[01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:54.100]   So marketing that stuff is a great challenge,
[01:39:54.100 --> 01:39:56.540]   finding your audience, saying vaguely,
[01:39:56.540 --> 01:39:58.900]   good people make good things and other people find them,
[01:39:58.900 --> 01:40:00.380]   doesn't actually solve the problem
[01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:01.700]   of how people actually find the show.
[01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:02.620]   - The problem, no, I agree.
[01:40:02.620 --> 01:40:04.900]   We were just looking at a great video on our show
[01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:07.460]   this week in YouTube, which precedes this,
[01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:09.980]   a really well done, what was that, rap,
[01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:14.380]   it was YouTube, rap reviews, hundreds of views, hundreds,
[01:40:14.380 --> 01:40:15.220]   not thousands.
[01:40:15.220 --> 01:40:16.580]   - On really, upon a good stuff.
[01:40:16.580 --> 01:40:18.340]   - Amazingly good stuff.
[01:40:18.340 --> 01:40:20.900]   It's hard to get noticed, search,
[01:40:20.900 --> 01:40:23.620]   like discoverability right now is broken,
[01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:25.820]   'cause you've got a hundred different services,
[01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:27.060]   a hundred different boxes.
[01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:28.340]   I think that's gonna come together,
[01:40:28.340 --> 01:40:30.860]   it's gonna move in a direction where it's about,
[01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:33.220]   it's the Google of finding shows,
[01:40:33.220 --> 01:40:35.340]   not so much like picking a service or a box
[01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:36.180]   and going with it.
[01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:37.860]   But I think to your point, like, yes,
[01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:39.500]   it's hard to get noticed, but hell on wheels
[01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:41.980]   followed madmen or whatever,
[01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:43.500]   and like who watches hell on wheels?
[01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:46.300]   I mean, it's canceled right now.
[01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:49.420]   - So, but this is something that we've talked about before,
[01:40:49.420 --> 01:40:52.460]   because what we're seeing is the death of channels
[01:40:52.460 --> 01:40:55.300]   as we know them and the rise of content curators,
[01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:58.220]   essentially, you know, VJs, the channel can be.
[01:40:58.220 --> 01:41:00.020]   - Which channel, the best channels are,
[01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:02.660]   I mean, HBO has a clear voice.
[01:41:02.660 --> 01:41:04.340]   - The word is a channel is it?
[01:41:04.340 --> 01:41:05.940]   - The Verge is a channel.
[01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:07.260]   - That's right, that's where you go to.
[01:41:07.260 --> 01:41:08.020]   - You go to these networks,
[01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:09.020]   they ask you're right.
[01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:10.020]   - And that's the difference.
[01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:11.740]   You just said it, Twitter is a channel,
[01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:12.780]   The Verge is a channel.
[01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:15.900]   YouTube is not a channel as much as it allows channels
[01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:17.020]   to exist. - The box, yeah.
[01:41:17.020 --> 01:41:17.940]   - Right, it's the box.
[01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:18.860]   - Helps you.
[01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:20.980]   - So, the thing about it is,
[01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:23.380]   discoverability and getting noticed is always gonna be hard
[01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:25.540]   when it comes to entertainment or something you want people
[01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:27.380]   to, you know, you want people to love the stuff you make,
[01:41:27.380 --> 01:41:30.780]   it's hard, it's becoming less hard for more people.
[01:41:30.780 --> 01:41:31.620]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:33.900]   - But it's hard in general, you know?
[01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:34.740]   - And it's hard to agree with.
[01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:35.900]   - I think the people- - We can agree on that, yes?
[01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:36.900]   - I don't wanna agree with him.
[01:41:36.900 --> 01:41:37.900]   The people coming in.
[01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:40.580]   (laughing)
[01:41:40.580 --> 01:41:44.420]   - No, but I would say part, when we sell it as like,
[01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:46.620]   yay, everybody has a shot and everybody make a show
[01:41:46.620 --> 01:41:47.900]   and everybody this and that.
[01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:49.460]   And then they get hit with the hard reality.
[01:41:49.460 --> 01:41:50.300]   - I didn't say that.
[01:41:50.300 --> 01:41:51.140]   - I know you didn't.
[01:41:51.140 --> 01:41:52.780]   I like, I like arguing- - I like arguing with most points
[01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:55.460]   that you're not quite making to make me look slightly smarter.
[01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:57.260]   - That's very germane though, you're absolutely right.
[01:41:57.260 --> 01:42:00.140]   There is a kind of a lie being told
[01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:01.820]   that you can make it, anybody can make it.
[01:42:01.820 --> 01:42:05.100]   - That's American lie.
[01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:06.820]   - Right, it's not a- - It is the American lie.
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:08.140]   - Yeah, we all have a shot.
[01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:08.980]   We don't. - We get billionaire,
[01:42:08.980 --> 01:42:09.900]   that's not true. - Yeah, okay, well,
[01:42:09.900 --> 01:42:11.380]   see, now we're back to the depressing-
[01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:12.820]   - Thank you. - We gotta go to war.
[01:42:12.820 --> 01:42:15.700]   - We gotta go to war now, you know where this is discussed
[01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:17.580]   best and most often is a great show
[01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:19.900]   that you do, Brian, with Tom Erick called "Frame Ray".
[01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:20.740]   - Yeah, buddy.
[01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:22.860]   - A show for cord cutters, highly recommend it.
[01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:24.580]   In fact, let's check in with Tom Erick
[01:42:24.580 --> 01:42:26.900]   because he's gonna tell us what's ahead.
[01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:28.820]   This, he's not, he's not here?
[01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:31.020]   Yes, he is, he's gonna tell us what's ahead this week.
[01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:33.020]   - Take it away, Tom.
[01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:34.540]   - Hey Leo, here's some of the things happening
[01:42:34.540 --> 01:42:36.660]   in the week ahead that we'll be keeping an eye on
[01:42:36.660 --> 01:42:37.500]   for Tech News today.
[01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:40.460]   I hope you're having a happy 20th anniversary
[01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:43.620]   of the term spam being applied to a use net post.
[01:42:43.620 --> 01:42:45.460]   That's today, Sunday, March 31st.
[01:42:45.460 --> 01:42:47.740]   April Fool's Day, April 1st, of course, tomorrow,
[01:42:47.740 --> 01:42:49.780]   and Venture Beats Mobile Two Day Summit
[01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:51.820]   begins in Sausoleidos, not a joke.
[01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:55.380]   Tuesday, April 2nd, Twitter is having their developers' event
[01:42:55.380 --> 01:42:57.340]   that the press are not welcome at.
[01:42:57.340 --> 01:43:00.980]   Wednesday, April 3rd is the birthday of the Osborne 1.
[01:43:00.980 --> 01:43:02.580]   - We have one. - Thursday, April 4th
[01:43:02.580 --> 01:43:04.500]   is the anniversary of Bill Gates and Paul Allen
[01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:05.500]   forming their partnership.
[01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:06.500]   Also Larry Williams, - Wait a minute.
[01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:08.880]   - became CEO of Google on that day in 20-
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:10.340]   - Bill Gates is dreaming. - And Facebook
[01:43:10.340 --> 01:43:13.220]   is having their come see our new home on Amazon.
[01:43:13.220 --> 01:43:14.860]   - We haven't talked about that yet.
[01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:16.060]   - That's a look at the week ahead.
[01:43:16.060 --> 01:43:16.900]   - Back to you Leo.
[01:43:16.900 --> 01:43:19.900]   - I can't believe it, the biggest story of the week.
[01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:20.900]   - Oh my God.
[01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:21.740]   - We missed it.
[01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:22.580]   - What was the story?
[01:43:22.580 --> 01:43:23.820]   - Facebook's having an announcement to announce.
[01:43:23.820 --> 01:43:25.820]   Well, okay, we're gonna make this quick.
[01:43:25.820 --> 01:43:26.820]   - Lightening round. - We're gonna make this easing.
[01:43:26.820 --> 01:43:28.700]   Lightning round, thumbs up, thumbs down.
[01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:32.100]   Joshua Topolsky is Facebook gonna announce a phone
[01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:34.300]   or just an Android app.
[01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:36.780]   - Probably some kind of phone I think.
[01:43:36.780 --> 01:43:39.220]   - An actual hardware phone, you know, 'cause you have one.
[01:43:39.220 --> 01:43:40.780]   - I'm using it.
[01:43:40.780 --> 01:43:44.380]   I'm doing this over the Facebook phone right now.
[01:43:44.380 --> 01:43:45.780]   - I do it.
[01:43:45.780 --> 01:43:46.860]   - That's what the camera is.
[01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:47.700]   - It's an-- - No, I don't know.
[01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:49.540]   I think there's gonna be like,
[01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:51.820]   I think there's gonna be some kind of partnership.
[01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:53.380]   - Is it crazy for,
[01:43:53.380 --> 01:43:54.820]   I think this is the ultimate in hubris
[01:43:54.820 --> 01:43:56.780]   where you think we got a billion users.
[01:43:56.780 --> 01:43:58.060]   We're the biggest thing on the internet.
[01:43:58.060 --> 01:44:00.180]   Let's create a phone.
[01:44:00.180 --> 01:44:01.740]   It's stupid, it's wrong,
[01:44:01.740 --> 01:44:03.740]   and it's the beginning of the end for Facebook.
[01:44:03.740 --> 01:44:05.460]   What do you think? - Amazon did it.
[01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:06.820]   - And they made a tablet.
[01:44:06.820 --> 01:44:07.660]   They're like, we're gonna make a tablet.
[01:44:07.660 --> 01:44:10.180]   That was a reading platform for their content.
[01:44:10.180 --> 01:44:14.180]   - I think they should do it just to mess with people, like you.
[01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:15.020]   (laughing)
[01:44:15.020 --> 01:44:16.780]   Like when seeing you in Cinced
[01:44:16.780 --> 01:44:18.580]   provides me with a level of joy and happiness.
[01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:19.580]   I haven't known in weeks.
[01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:21.100]   - Justin, Robert, what do you think?
[01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:23.300]   Facebook, phone, up or down?
[01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:25.860]   - I think it's going to be a new phone,
[01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:28.140]   but not necessarily a Facebook exclusive phone.
[01:44:28.140 --> 01:44:29.740]   It's basically just gonna be a skin on top of it.
[01:44:29.740 --> 01:44:31.660]   It's going to launch into Facebook applications.
[01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:33.500]   And they need to do it
[01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:36.580]   because the dominant form of social communication
[01:44:36.580 --> 01:44:38.820]   around the world with younger people
[01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:43.140]   is phone to phone contact, in-line chat communication
[01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:44.380]   that is phone based.
[01:44:44.380 --> 01:44:46.460]   And that is the generation that you,
[01:44:46.460 --> 01:44:49.020]   or Facebook will lose if they do not get into them.
[01:44:49.020 --> 01:44:50.500]   - Well, and Facebook is very aware of this.
[01:44:50.500 --> 01:44:51.580]   They're very afraid of losing it.
[01:44:51.580 --> 01:44:53.460]   That's why they spent a billion dollars on Instagram,
[01:44:53.460 --> 01:44:55.820]   which was about to take over from Facebook.
[01:44:55.820 --> 01:44:59.540]   - I do not think a phone will help them in that department.
[01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:00.380]   - I agree.
[01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:01.220]   - I mean, they may make a phone,
[01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:02.860]   but I don't think that people are gonna wanna buy it.
[01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:04.060]   I don't think people will use Facebook
[01:45:04.060 --> 01:45:04.900]   because they have to.
[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:06.140]   Everybody hates Facebook.
[01:45:06.140 --> 01:45:08.180]   - But they have to use it.
[01:45:08.180 --> 01:45:09.380]   What do you think, Brian Rushwood,
[01:45:09.380 --> 01:45:12.020]   you have the final word, Facebook phone?
[01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:13.620]   - I'm not familiar with this Facebook,
[01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:15.180]   but I look forward to seeing their work.
[01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:17.260]   They sound like they got a lot of potential.
[01:45:17.260 --> 01:45:18.100]   - Wow.
[01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:18.940]   - Well done, Brian.
[01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:19.780]   - Well done.
[01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:20.620]   - Yeah, I agree.
[01:45:20.620 --> 01:45:21.940]   - That's amazing.
[01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:25.020]   - Brian Rushwood is on NSFW scam school.
[01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:27.140]   And what else do you do, Brian?
[01:45:27.140 --> 01:45:28.220]   You're just a magician.
[01:45:28.220 --> 01:45:29.060]   - Too many things.
[01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:29.900]   Check out Frame Rate.
[01:45:29.900 --> 01:45:32.140]   If you like me smart, then see me on Mondays
[01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:32.980]   to in Frame Rate.
[01:45:32.980 --> 01:45:34.740]   If you like me dumb, watch me on Tuesdays
[01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:35.740]   with Justin Robert Young.
[01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:36.580]   That's all you need to know.
[01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:38.740]   - The King of Dumb, J-R-Y.
[01:45:38.740 --> 01:45:40.460]   In fact, the special edition of NSFW
[01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:41.900]   coming up right after this show.
[01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:44.700]   Joshua Topolsky is editor in chief of The Verge
[01:45:44.700 --> 01:45:47.180]   at The Verge.com, where they do simply
[01:45:47.180 --> 01:45:49.700]   the best coverage of technology out there.
[01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:51.420]   I read it every single day and highly recommend
[01:45:51.420 --> 01:45:52.260]   you do the same.
[01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:55.220]   And of course, if you would just get out of that video podcast
[01:45:55.220 --> 01:45:57.340]   thing, I'd be much happier about everything you're up to.
[01:45:57.340 --> 01:45:58.780]   - I were expanding it.
[01:45:58.780 --> 01:45:59.620]   - Damn you.
[01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:00.700]   - Damn your eyes.
[01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:01.540]   - Competition.
[01:46:01.540 --> 01:46:02.380]   - I hate it all too now, Brian.
[01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:03.540]   - And then you were right.
[01:46:03.540 --> 01:46:04.380]   - No, I don't hate him.
[01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:05.220]   I like this guy a lot.
[01:46:05.220 --> 01:46:06.060]   - We're gonna hang out already.
[01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:06.900]   We're gonna come back out.
[01:46:06.900 --> 01:46:08.900]   - We're gonna go to somewhere in Brooklyn.
[01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:10.660]   - No, no, actually some great stuff.
[01:46:10.660 --> 01:46:12.140]   - 90 seconds with The Verge is awesome.
[01:46:12.140 --> 01:46:13.140]   - Yes.
[01:46:13.140 --> 01:46:14.460]   - Great stuff being done.
[01:46:14.460 --> 01:46:16.580]   And of course you can catch Joshua frequently
[01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:18.820]   as a frequent contributor with Mr. Jimmy Fallon.
[01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:20.100]   - Yes, that's fun.
[01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:21.300]   - I'll be back in April.
[01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:23.540]   - Soon to be on The Tonight Show, which will be found.
[01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:26.420]   - Yeah, you're gonna move upstairs with him, right?
[01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:27.260]   - I hope so.
[01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:28.300]   - If they'll have me.
[01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:29.180]   - Then you're on The Big Show.
[01:46:29.180 --> 01:46:30.020]   - I'll make sure that happens.
[01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:30.860]   - I think you made it.
[01:46:30.860 --> 01:46:31.700]   - I'll make some calls.
[01:46:31.700 --> 01:46:33.540]   - You're the next Stan Can.
[01:46:33.540 --> 01:46:34.740]   - I don't know what that is.
[01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:36.020]   - I know 'cause you're a young guy
[01:46:36.020 --> 01:46:38.180]   and you don't remember the old stuff.
[01:46:38.180 --> 01:46:40.180]   - That's why I remember all of the 90s experience.
[01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:41.660]   - Wrong with kids today.
[01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:44.260]   They have no memory for stuff they never experienced.
[01:46:44.260 --> 01:46:45.900]   - Sweet man, call me be a kid.
[01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:46.740]   It's the one.
[01:46:46.740 --> 01:46:47.580]   (laughing)
[01:46:47.580 --> 01:46:49.020]   - That's 'cause I'm old.
[01:46:49.020 --> 01:46:50.540]   - In my day.
[01:46:50.540 --> 01:46:51.820]   - Go to comedyhackday.
[01:46:51.820 --> 01:46:53.140]   It's gonna be at Twitter, April 6th

[01:46:58.540 --> 01:46:59.380]   - That's my new home.
[01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:00.380]   - With his scarf.
[01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:01.220]   - You must. - You must.
[01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:02.140]   - You must buy How To Be Black.
[01:47:02.140 --> 01:47:04.700]   By the way, on the back, picture Baratunde with.
[01:47:05.060 --> 01:47:06.140]   - A scarf. - Bam.
[01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:06.980]   - It's your look.
[01:47:06.980 --> 01:47:07.820]   - It's kind of my thing.
[01:47:07.820 --> 01:47:08.660]   - It's your thing.
[01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:09.660]   It's been a real pleasure.
[01:47:09.660 --> 01:47:10.660]   Thanks for having me back.
[01:47:10.660 --> 01:47:12.620]   Brian, you know, I love doing the show,
[01:47:12.620 --> 01:47:14.380]   especially with you 'cause we have a charm.
[01:47:14.380 --> 01:47:16.140]   Joshua, you're added to that list
[01:47:16.140 --> 01:47:17.500]   of people I super love doing the show.
[01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:18.860]   - I'm telling you, this is great.
[01:47:18.860 --> 01:47:19.700]   I had a blast.
[01:47:19.700 --> 01:47:21.140]   - And I don't want the other.
[01:47:21.140 --> 01:47:22.340]   I don't want those other guys to hear it,
[01:47:22.340 --> 01:47:25.140]   but this is the best Twit panel we've ever had.
[01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:26.580]   - You said it on the internet, you know that, right?
[01:47:26.580 --> 01:47:27.420]   - I know.
[01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:28.260]   - Okay.
[01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:30.620]   - And also tell me when the MyStark
[01:47:30.620 --> 01:47:32.060]   is definitely pajama bar.
[01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:32.900]   - It's nice.
[01:47:32.900 --> 01:47:36.340]   - And thanks to the chat room, especially as well.
[01:47:36.340 --> 01:47:37.180]   - I love it.
[01:47:37.180 --> 01:47:39.180]   - Brian, Russian, I salute you.
[01:47:39.180 --> 01:47:41.820]   - I salute you and you green cup of destiny.
[01:47:41.820 --> 01:47:42.660]   - Yes sir.
[01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:45.020]   - All the cool kids rock the green cups.
[01:47:45.020 --> 01:47:46.980]   - Thanks, thanks for joining us.
[01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:48.020]   Game of Thrones is next.

[01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:53.780]   Another Twit is in the can.
[01:47:53.780 --> 01:47:56.060]   (mumbling)
[01:47:56.060 --> 01:47:58.640]   (upbeat music)
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:01.220]   (upbeat music)
[01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:03.800]   (upbeat music)
[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:05.800]   Do it to it alright
