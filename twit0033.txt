[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   This is Twit, this weekend tech episode 33 for December 4th, 2005.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:31.800]   [Music]
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.880]   Welcome to Back to Pixel Core. We're doing Twit in Studio mainly because Bob
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.640]   Heilsen has a care package of microphones and I just had to show this off.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.000]   Leo's got this new mic, he's in pig heaven, it's unbelievable.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.080]   This is why I got in a radio 30 years ago, just for this, this one moment.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.160]   Thank you Bob. Actually if anybody has one of those all RCA mics that they use in the studio,
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160]   we probably should collect it for you and give it to you as a gift one of these days.
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.760]   Send me a note, devork.org.
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.520]   I'll give you some information that might help you with that. My 30th year in broadcasting,
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.680]   my 50th birthday are both next year, year from...
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.680]   That's perfect timing. You could time to do that.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.240]   It's a big hole condenser. Dip it in the tube.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.240]   [Laughter]
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.360]   Let me introduce the Twits ladies and gentlemen. Obviously John C. Devorak is here.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.560]   Also sitting to his right, Robert Herron from PC Magazine.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.120]   Also from Digital Life Television, which is going great.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.560]   The Guns now that Patrick's back from Baja, is also here.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.400]   Patrick Norton is always on vacation.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.800]   I learned that from you.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.000]   We saw how important he was to the production.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.360]   You could only do a three minute show while he was gone.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.360]   [Laughter]
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.800]   I don't want that. I'm going to be gone next week.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.800]   We should do a one minute tour.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.800]   I didn't have a tour.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.800]   I didn't have a tour.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.800]   Really? What was the three minute show?
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.160]   That was when we were like, "Hey, I'm going to be gone. We're going to do more shows next
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.160]   week."
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.160]   We're not going.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.360]   We got some questions for us, kick us an email. We got huge.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.360]   Basically, you asked a bunch of questions.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.360]   That's good.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.360]   So you got more response with the three minute shows?
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.360]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.360]   No, we asked them.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.360]   We specifically targeted him.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.360]   We did three minutes of like...
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.360]   He did.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.360]   Please send us an email answering these specific questions about how you want to receive.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.360]   That was the week I was on TV.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.120]   Yeah, that's why you couldn't do a show.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.600]   Also here from Pixel Core, Mr. Alex Lindsey, who has a gift for all of the Twit Army members.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.760]   We'll talk about that a little later on.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.920]   We also got a little gift for all of the panelists.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.920]   This is...
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.760]   Yeah, presumably he gave us to us for a plug, so let's give him a plug.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.160]   It's called "Droid Maker."
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.160]   Tell us what is this?
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.360]   I actually asked for it.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.960]   Michael Rubin used to work at Lucasfilm back in the...
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.960]   He was the original video-droid demo guy.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.640]   He was at Lucasfilm a long time ago.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.560]   He persuaded Lucasfilm to let him write this book about not so much the movies, but how
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.720]   all the technology came together.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.000]   The only reason I asked for it for everyone, because he was talking in an event I was at,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   and it was just fantastic.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I can't wait to read it.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.640]   It's all these stories about the Pixar machine and all the techie stuff that George brought
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.640]   to life.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.640]   You had an autograph.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.640]   I had one that's not fair.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.640]   You know where my son is right now?
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.640]   I just know who is going to be here.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.880]   At 11-year-old birthday party where they've rented all nine Star Wars movies and they're
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.880]   going to show them sequentially.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.880]   Ooh!
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.880]   That's going to be a long...
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.880]   Can you imagine anything worse?
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.880]   It's only six.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.880]   Lord of the Rings.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.880]   Only six?
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.880]   That's the only reason I asked for it.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.880]   I didn't do all three.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.880]   Did you do a trilogy of trilogy?
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.880]   No, we did three.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.880]   That last one.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.880]   Oh, alright.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.880]   That's the last one.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.880]   That's a mere 15 hours.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.880]   Oh, and this sounds miserable.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.880]   It's not to get through episode one.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.520]   Is he going to do it in order for episode one through?
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.240]   They're going to do it in chronological order.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.240]   It was digital this time.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.240]   When they were released?
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.360]   Or when they were in the chronological order of the story.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.600]   Now see, they were doing exactly what we're not supposed to do.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.600]   We're all talking at the same time.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.600]   Yeah, you're talking in the same time.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.600]   What is this?
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.600]   It's not a cocktail party, guys.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.840]   Okay, we're going to do this one in surround found.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.840]   Why is it that when we do a surround sound radio broadcast?
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.960]   We were around and the person sits in the middle and it's like they're in the conversation.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.200]   We can do that.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.720]   We're going to do a stereo.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.720]   We should do it.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.720]   We'll do a version of that.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.720]   Yeah, the pixel works, guys.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.560]   Over here, the sound guy's going, "Oh my God, this guy's nuts."
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.040]   No, we can do a--
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.040]   There is a--
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.040]   Stop him from talking.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.040]   There's a 5.1 podcast.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.600]   Somebody's doing one.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.920]   It's just panning this stuff.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:11.920]   It sounds awesome.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.920]   We did some internal tests.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.920]   We just haven't put it out.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.080]   So we can definitely--
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.000]   The problem with it is that these file literally is five times bigger, right?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   No, it's just twice.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Oh, stereo.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Well, it's just stereo.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Oh, you do a--
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   It's just stereo.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   It'll sound right.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   It'll sound right.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   It'll sound--
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Yeah, it's a little nerdy.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I forget I even mentioned it.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.600]   We did launch a couple of-- we launched one new podcast and we're going to launch another
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.600]   new podcast.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.600]   We did very busy.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.240]   Amber's inside the net.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.880]   Amber McArthur, my co-host on Call for Help, she's doing Inside the Net, which is a look
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.880]   at 2.0 web services, that kind of stuff.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.520]   That was debuted at number one on iTunes in the first day.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.520]   Is that me?
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.520]   You're going to ditch us now?
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.520]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.520]   I'm through with you.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.520]   She's a lot cuter.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.880]   And then-- but no, actually, John and I did a trial of a new show.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.840]   We're still working out the kinks on this one.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:57.840]   It's your idea, though.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.200]   I was going to say, you guys actually did this podcast you've been talking about for
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.200]   what, 22 weeks?
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.200]   No, no, no.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.240]   Not the podcast we were talking about for 22 weeks.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.240]   We're still talking about that one.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.240]   This is a new show that--
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.240]   Which means, you know, that's typical.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.440]   No, this is another show.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.120]   This is where we got together with Larry Lessig and we discussed the Google case in the show
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.080]   called Triangulation, which is Three Guys.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.080]   There's the idea.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.080]   Three Guys, one topic.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.080]   Three Guys, one topic.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.880]   But three guys that are in kind of agreement because, you know, these shows that are these
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.720]   debate shows where you have artificial dichotomies, which-- oh, you know, yes, because you're
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.680]   a George Bush guy and no, because you're a Democrat, you know, these kinds of phony
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.680]   baloney.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.680]   Oh, you liberals!
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.680]   Right.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.680]   Why do you act?
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.680]   You liberals.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.680]   You don't think.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.680]   Exactly.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.680]   It's all heat and all light.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.400]   Well, which is kind of what we do here, which is you build on the total combined knowledge
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.640]   of everybody involved, you know, like when we do do it, we have five, six guys here and
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.560]   we kind of-- nobody knows everything or even the whole pieces of all the puzzles.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.120]   And then-- but combined is kind of interesting.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.840]   So it's the true educational software or educational broadcasting model that was-- when
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.960]   broadcasting was invented and when they-- when the FCC formed, it was to promote this kind
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.960]   of thing, we're doing it.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.320]   Yeah, because nobody wants to do all light and no heat.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.760]   This is so cute because you look like-- yeah, you look at you.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.960]   You're believing-- you'd say-- you'd just get another one.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.960]   You'd get a specific radio and this is-- yeah, right, yeah.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.240]   This is the-- no, this is the perky-- I've never seen this in a decade.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.880]   This is beyond-- tell them about the other podcast you want to do or you want to keep
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.880]   that a secret.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.880]   I don't know.
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.880]   What was it?
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.200]   Oh, we're going to do-- oh, yeah, we have a potential wine and food podcast or probably
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.480]   just a restaurant review podcast.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.680]   I've got a bunch of people lined up.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.680]   We want to do a website.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.640]   We'll spin a podcast out of it.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.360]   Throbbing Gristle, it's going to be cool.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.360]   Actually, that's a band.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.360]   Oh, that's right.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.360]   We can't use that.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.360]   I knew there was a better one.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.360]   That's a terrible name.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.360]   What's it?
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.360]   You have a better name for it?
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.360]   I thought you were going to use Coney Island--
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.200]   No, yeah, we used Coney Island Frog's legs, yeah.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.360]   I hope you registered that.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.360]   No.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.360]   You have two days to register.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.360]   Yeah, we got other names.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.000]   Top story today-- I mean, it's hard to pick.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.480]   We had a lot of stories, but I thought the most interesting one is actually two stories
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.360]   about Wikipedia.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.400]   Starting with John Seagenthaler, the father of the NBC News correspondent, he was an aide
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.280]   to Robert F. Kennedy.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.400]   And there is an article, a biographical article about him on Wikipedia, which makes the very
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.280]   false assertion that he was somehow suspected in the JFK assassination.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.280]   And Seagenthaler, really.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.280]   I understand why.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.280]   I'm curious to see this entry, which is, "You Read It, You Crack Up."
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:23.200]   Well, and that's-- so he's desperately kind of old-school trying to-- well, who wrote
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.200]   it?
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.200]   He wants to know who wrote it.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.040]   Well, I like to know who wrote it, too, because they found out that Adam Curry, which
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:34.680]   is this follow-up story you're going to bring up, was putting in beefing up his role in
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.680]   the podcast.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.160]   But they found out he did it.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.560]   Well, yeah, because you can get the IP addresses, and they figured it out.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.000]   Why couldn't they find out who did this?
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   I don't get it.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.640]   They wouldn't reveal it, I guess, to Seagenthaler.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.080]   He could do a John Doe lawsuit with the IP address, but you have to then go to the I.S.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.440]   Or maybe the person who did that was more clever about covering the tracks.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.280]   Maybe Adam signed it.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.440]   Or John should talk to Adam about how he can correct the wiki.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.440]   I mean, you know, that's--
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.720]   Well, it's an interesting-- that's exactly what it is, a collision between kind of old-school
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.840]   and new-school.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.440]   You think there's a responsible party.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.440]   There's the New York Times.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.040]   There's somebody who can go for a retraction.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.200]   There's editorial, and that's not what Wikipedia is.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.240]   Now, it makes the very good point that not only did it show up on Wikipedia, but then
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.720]   a couple of reference sites picked it up.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.720]   About.com, as well.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.280]   Yeah, and I think-- I can't remember the two.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.040]   I don't want to be sued for libel.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.720]   But two people picked it up just kind of without even looking at it and just included it.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.720]   So it did get--
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.720]   It's great legs.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.720]   It's great.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.720]   Yeah, it did get legs.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.720]   So I think he has a point there.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.720]   What do you think?
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.720]   I think the Wikipedia doesn't work.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.680]   No, I think it works, but I think eventually they're going to get sued out of business seriously.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.680]   For something like this.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.760]   I mean, it's not a new problem.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.120]   You know, and it goes on at different levels and different places, and it has been for
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.120]   quite some time.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.400]   It's why there's certain articles on Wikipedia that kind of reach consensus and they lock
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.160]   it down so nobody can edit it.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.680]   Because they have problems with people who are arguing back and forth, you know.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.200]   Israel, Palestine, that kind of thing.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.200]   Where there's just abortion.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.200]   It's like a fucking Democrat, dog cat, whatever it is.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.200]   And it's one of the things-- you have this incredible assemblage of knowledge, some of
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.200]   which is more viable than others.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:16.200]   Yeah, I was going to say I can-- my wife, the librarian, I can hear quivering in the back.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.200]   Like--
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.200]   She can come over here.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.200]   How do we verify this?
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.200]   How do we make sure it's legit?
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.120]   But-- and yet I think Wikipedia is wonderful.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.120]   It's amazing.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.120]   Yeah, for quick information.
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.120]   Well, and so I'm always skeptical when I read--
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.120]   Well, you should be.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.800]   The funny thing is if you're like-- and your librarian wife would know this.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.240]   And sometimes you can kind of smell whether I--
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.240]   Is that with love, John?
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.240]   No, I think you can.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.880]   I think that's what we have to train our kids to do.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.080]   Right, so you can smell out the BS.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.840]   You knew when you read it that-- I mean, you said it was funny.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.320]   It wasn't-- you didn't take it seriously the posting.
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.320]   But who would?
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.880]   I mean, because I mean, if anyone has a clue, they'd know all of it.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.880]   Right.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.880]   We'd be beating the Kennedy thing to death.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.880]   I mean, where's this guy's name?
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.880]   You can crop up on the wood.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:55.880]   All of a sudden.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:56.880]   All of a sudden.
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:57.880]   I mean, I think that's an obvious one.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:03.160]   I think that we assume that WIC is that much less accurate than the regular press.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.680]   And that's not necessarily true.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.680]   And I know from reporters.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:11.400]   I mean, the thing is that most of the time when anyone writes about anything in a major
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.120]   magazine that I know a lot about, I look at it and go, these guys have no idea what
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.120]   they're talking about.
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:22.440]   Or I was in Zimbabwe during the 2000 elections, watching the elections happen on CNN.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.480]   And the city that they were reporting that they said they were coming from was not the
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.480]   city I was standing in.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.480]   I mean, it was just a completely different idea.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.560]   Well, anyone who was the first trip to China figures this out because what anyone thinks
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.880]   China's like is completely alien to what it's actually like when you go there.
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:44.000]   And I've always said, when you travel a lot, you always have this preconceived window,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   what you think the world's going to be like.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.880]   And then it opens up this where that way with China, it's over here behind you.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.080]   And it's like, so you go there, you go, well, this is interesting.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.080]   I always thought everybody in Germany were later, I was in a drink beer and ate pretzels.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.880]   I just, what did I know?
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.880]   Actually, they do.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.640]   It does a little known fact.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.680]   Doesn't it seem like this guy just did this for the publicity?
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.280]   See, you can tell it more or Adam.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:09.040]   I mean, because every, I mean, why raise such a fuss about a source of information that
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.840]   on every entry campaigns tabs for editing discussion?
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.840]   Because he's old school.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.840]   He's old school.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:15.840]   He's an older fella.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:21.760]   He got very upset, wrote an article in the USA today, excoriating Wikipedia.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.840]   Well, like, some of us are whining, bitch.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.080]   I mean, I just lost short story.
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.080]   I don't know.
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.080]   You know what, please.
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.840]   Somebody doesn't understand what Wikipedia is clear.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:30.840]   That's clear.
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:31.840]   It doesn't.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.840]   My mom doesn't either.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.280]   Somebody that I wrote about to some of my blog and somebody wrote in, why didn't I
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.800]   just go to Wikipedia and change it?
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.800]   Edit it.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:38.800]   You know, I do that once in a while.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:39.800]   Well, the info.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.800]   They, uh, it's what you're supposed to do.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.080]   My bio said I wrote an article for Hustler, so I went in there and took it out.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.080]   Did you cut it?
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.080]   Well, I just say two articles.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.080]   Yeah, it's two articles.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.080]   Yes.
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.080]   That's right.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.080]   I want to get it right.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.080]   Two kid out.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.080]   It said kind of centerfolded.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.080]   It did.
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.080]   When somebody put that in there?
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:12:00.680]   I mean, I'll give you another example and it's very easy to create a false page on my space.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:01.680]   Somebody's done that for me.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.240]   I don't make a big deal about it because who cares?
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.240]   But it looks pretty credible.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.240]   Oh, it's a funny, bologna-leo.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.800]   Yeah, but it looks pretty credible and I think people believe it.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.080]   We live in the world now where that can be done in a very public way.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.480]   What do you do about it?
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.480]   You want to have it?
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.880]   It's also called the National Inquirer.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.040]   It's called the, I mean, you know, all this stuff is, you know, I don't see it.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.040]   I don't see the separation.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.040]   That's public figures.
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.040]   I'll give you an example though.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.600]   A friend of mine is a high school teacher.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:30.160]   And old former students of his made a nasty sight about him.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:35.320]   And by the way, try to get a bad sight about you that's phony off of my space.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.280]   Have you seen this arcane process you have to do?
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.520]   You have to take a picture of yourself holding up a newspaper.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.840]   Have you guys heard about the, do you guys know a local blogger named Thomas Hawk?
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.080]   Rice Wright photo.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.280]   So it's a guy wrote a guy went to buy a camera.
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:55.280]   Some weird stuff happens when they try to charge him for a bunch.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.280]   Because we're talking about this on, on DL.tv.
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.280]   They go to the, you know, they, you know, you should buy, you know, you should buy, you
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.280]   know, you should buy, you know, four extra batteries and a lens cap and all this other
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.280]   stuff.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.280]   He's like, no, no, no, just ship it.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.280]   They call back.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.280]   So it's always back and forth, right?
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.280]   So they upsell you.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.280]   They keep trying to upsell him and he's finally like, look, this is horrible customer service.
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.280]   I'm going to write about it on my blog.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:21.480]   So somebody at the, at the, the camera place is like, I will never, what's, let's say,
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.120]   I will make sure you will never be able to place an order on the internet again.
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.120]   I'm an attorney.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.120]   I will sue you.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.120]   I will call the CAA.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.120]   Just because he said bad things about the company.
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.120]   Just because he said he would.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.200]   He hadn't even put anything up on the blog.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:37.640]   So the guy writes the blog entry, post it up on dig in about 20 minutes.
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:43.440]   It goes berserk and about two days is about 4,000 digs, which is a huge story on dig.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.880]   It's about 700 digs.
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.880]   It's close to 7,000.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:46.880]   Huge story.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.040]   It's the biggest story of the year.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.040]   So far.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.080]   Well, it's some other bone head lawyer comes along.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.240]   Oh, but this gets, no, you'll like this part.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.360]   The dig, the dig community just went off on this camera store.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.360]   Oh boy.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.520]   They went completely off.
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.360]   They posted the store's aliases because they do the same place basically as business under
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.600]   like three different websites.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.600]   The phone numbers.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.600]   They started.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.440]   No, you get a, get a bad boy.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.440]   They dig.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.440]   Don't mess with us.
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.440]   They crank calling him.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.440]   They kept hotto down.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.600]   The 800 number.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.600]   They skyped him.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.040]   They just dossed attacks against the websites posted bad reviews on websites.
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.040]   We are not advocates.
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.880]   No, no, we're not advocating it.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.480]   We're abused by it.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.000]   We could use the Twitter army this way, but we don't.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.640]   Let it be known.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.280]   They basically, they jam the fax machine.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.800]   Basically, so thousands of people just assaulted the store for like three days.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.800]   Wow.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.200]   And did it, so did he buy the lens cap?
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.200]   Go back.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.200]   Oh, you eventually.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.200]   I want to read some of the time.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.440]   No, actually he ended up canceling his credit card because they threatened to charge his
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.320]   credit card to the bunch of extra charges.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:52.680]   And eventually the CEO, the company, wrote him a letter basically apologizing and telling
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.440]   him that they were very sorry and that they fired the guy who had been offered him on
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.440]   the phone.
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.480]   But so what did they really fired him or not?
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.480]   Well, the guy.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.480]   He's got a reaction.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.960]   He's now living in a cave in Afghanistan.
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:08.560]   Well, apparently they just, the business was pretty much shut down for about three days.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.560]   It doesn't take much.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.560]   I didn't do that.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.400]   I don't know if you should be encouraging this with a thumbs up.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.400]   Anyway, so.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.880]   That was only for the video.
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.800]   So I'm looking at Leo's phony blogs that they're one that he did.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.640]   MySpace.com/leoisbetter.
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:25.360]   So it's obviously a fan, but it's also a guy with some sort of a perverse sense of humor
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:31.960]   because you read Leo's interests and it goes computers, technology, video games, call for
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:36.040]   help, screen savers and fixing appliances.
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.040]   It's quirky.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.880]   Actually that part's true.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.380]   I think that.
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.880]   You should see me with a toaster.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:43.880]   Yeah, I'll bet.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.960]   It says you're straight though.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:46.960]   That's the good news.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:47.960]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.960]   It wasn't too bad.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.120]   And it says body type 5, 7 with some extra baggage.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.920]   They got a lot left from the audience.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.320]   The gallery loves that.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:02.240]   First of all, I do have extra baggage, but I'm a little taller than that.
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.400]   It's hard to tell on TV.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.560]   511 it says there.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.560]   511?
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.560]   Oh, that's, I'm a little shorter than that actually.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.560]   Okay.
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.560]   That's the problem.
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.560]   I'm too short for my weight.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.560]   So the.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.560]   We all.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.560]   Yeah.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.560]   So the.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.800]   What's his name?
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:21.360]   David Byrne, talking head fella, has gotten trouble with the recording industry.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:26.240]   You know, you know, you know, you're in trouble when you start attacking your own artists.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.400]   You start going after that.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.400]   That's a bad sign.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.000]   So David Byrne has a, I guess he has a downloadable radio show.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   It's not even streaming.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.200]   And he did a Missy Elliot special.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.760]   And apparently the RIAA.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.400]   The rights for any of the songs.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.600]   Didn't pay an ask answer.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.600]   No, that wasn't what they were mad about.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.600]   What were they mad about?
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:50.960]   They, apparently the law or the K, the law forbids that streaming radio feature more
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.040]   than four tracks by any one artist in a three hour period.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.840]   So you're not allowed to do a special about a single artist.
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.720]   He says, my stuff's not even streaming, but apparently they considered streaming and downloadable
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.480]   the same thing.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:09.160]   The assumption being the sale is lost is lost because I guess you'd record all the
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.160]   Missy Elliot songs.
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.160]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.160]   I know I do.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.160]   Those 64 case dreams are.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.160]   Yeah, he makes us down.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:20.240]   Ever since Sirius and XM did the satellite radio Elvis and Sinatra channels.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.800]   All Elvis, all the time.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.760]   He does make a kind of stunning admission.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.800]   Back in the day, I used my boombox to tape things off the radio all the time.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.080]   That's how I found out about music I didn't even know about.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.080]   He's really, it's his.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.240]   So what's the fine?
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.240]   What's the, what's the final thing that happens to him?
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.240]   Are they going to sue him?
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.680]   Well, he pays the statutory fee.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.920]   He pays the fee to stream it, which is actually fairly steep.
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.080]   That's how they put most of these streaming stations out of business.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:50.200]   He says, is there a higher licensing fee I could pay that would let me do this?
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.600]   Is there a reason a radio station can play springsteen around the clock, but I can't stream
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.760]   Missy Elliot?
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:59.200]   Apparently you can, but you have to license every song separately.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.400]   Pay for each one instead of a lump sum.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.400]   It's a nightmare.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.000]   I just think that it's amazing that the recording industry is going after David Byrne.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.040]   Well, I mean, they're going after David Byrne and then it doesn't hit for a while.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.200]   What have you done for me lately?
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:17.760]   They're going after David Byrne and then they're going after 14 year olds, mothers of five,
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:21.280]   you know, over, you know, they, you know, they, you know, this is a great PR.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.520]   Just, just really a great way to make friends.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:28.760]   You know, it's, it's really just watching a whole industry take themselves down.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:33.120]   So far in the last two years, the recording industry has sued 14,000 or it has threatened
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.120]   to sue.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.280]   We should say that many of the, most of these don't go to court, but it's threatened to
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.640]   sue 14,800 people.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:43.960]   They filed 14,800 lawsuits and most of the time people settle, but now people are starting
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.000]   to fight back and I think that that's actually very good news.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.320]   I said, clog up the courts, clog up the courts.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.680]   I think they also, they have to, they have to, I think they, people need to start making
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:57.120]   the RIA proof that it was them, that they were there, that, you know, it was them in
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.120]   front of the computer.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.280]   I mean, there's a lot of, I mean, it's, you know, you can, you can tie it to an IP, but
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.640]   there's a lot more to it to really know whether to, and I think people start forcing the RIA
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.440]   to make, to really prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.960]   So that's also, I mean, a lot more complicated.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.560]   When you're in your room with a lawyer in a $3,000 suit that's looking at you and saying,
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.720]   I'm going to own this house.
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.720]   Right.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.720]   I'm going to keep your ass in board for weeks.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.720]   I'll give them five grand.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.720]   Absolutely.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.720]   You know what I mean?
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.200]   It's, you know, and so really it's, it's, the judgment proof.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.200]   That's my motto.
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.200]   And how do you do that?
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.200]   Stay broke.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.200]   I'm working on it.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.200]   I'm doing my best.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.840]   Stay broke.
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.960]   I get no span.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.360]   I love this case.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:38.400]   A severely disabled mother of an eight year old girl, the RIA claims the eight year old
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.880]   girl was downloading gangster rap at 4 30 in the morning.
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.440]   Of course it was.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.440]   That's possible.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:53.400]   Here's one, a Seattle resident allegedly downloading 1200 songs.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.480]   She's being sued.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:59.360]   She owes between $750 and $150,000 as a result.
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.920]   That's a range there.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:01.920]   A big range.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.840]   I mean, the laws that they're using, the suit people were designed to put, you know, large
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.920]   pirating operations out of business where they were.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.880]   And that's what we're seeing and distributing CD.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.880]   That's what makes me mad.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.880]   There are good laws.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.280]   Go after the pirates.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.280]   Don't go after us.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.280]   Here is the support.
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.280]   You don't seem to understand the severity of this.
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.160]   The great piracy in the entire world is in Malaysia.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.760]   Go into Malaysia and bust it.
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:23.760]   Start shoving them in.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.920]   It's run by the Chinese triads and, you know, maybe it's a little more difficult.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.920]   But, you know, you guys are tough guys.
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:29.920]   Go after them.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:30.920]   They're the way you're in a three-piece.
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:34.520]   The guy with a tattoo of a headless corpse.
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.480]   I don't know.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.680]   You know, you've gotless guys.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.160]   They go after little girls and they leave the triads alone.
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.160]   Come on.
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.160]   Eight-year-old girl is easy.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.160]   We got her.
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.600]   How about going after podcasters?
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:49.160]   Apparently, a podcaster, he runs vegan.com.
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.160]   He's heard this.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.960]   He's got this like 1,000 or 500 customers.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.040]   He's got 2,500 listeners.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.440]   Somebody hijacked his RSS listing.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.040]   And a pod keyword.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.040]   And then he contacted them.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.280]   They said, "Well, you could give us enough money.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.280]   We'll give it back to you."
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:05.800]   Yeah, I thought that was kind of an interesting story.
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.320]   But I couldn't quite figure out what was really going on.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.800]   I read that and read that and it could not make heads or tails out of what happened
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.800]   to him.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:18.720]   It couldn't happen to us, he said, hoping and crossing his fingers because we could contact
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.240]   the problem is that many of these sites...
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.240]   What happened?
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.800]   You explained this story to me because I read it, didn't quite get it.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:25.800]   What happened?
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:26.800]   I mean, how did he get hijacked?
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:27.800]   I don't understand.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:28.800]   He didn't lose his website.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:34.520]   No, what you do is you tell Apple or you tell somebody else that your RSS feed address is
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.280]   shifted.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:41.600]   And so all of a sudden on iTunes or ODO or Yahoo, when people go to what they think is
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.880]   your podcast, it's pointing to a different location.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.880]   Not your location.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.880]   So you just change the pointer.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:47.880]   Yeah.
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.320]   So they think they're going to be in and out the beef council.
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.320]   It should be easy to fix.
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.200]   But I mean, we actually...
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.840]   And it sounds illegal to me.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:58.360]   It seems like it should be.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.680]   I mean, it's probably some sort of...
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.640]   That this lawyerly constricting can put together.
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.440]   The thing that we would do is we have friends at Apple or we have friends at ODO at my Yahoo,
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.200]   we'd call and say, "Hey, dudes."
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.520]   But most people don't.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.520]   But most people don't.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.040]   Does it not require a password?
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.040]   No, that would change the information.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:18.520]   That's what happened to Dig Nation early on is somebody...
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:23.280]   You could go and if you don't want Apple's iTunes to carry your podcast, like let's say
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.240]   you're getting slammed on bandwidth or something or you don't like Apple or you could email
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.360]   them and say, "Please remove this podcast."
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.960]   And they were just auto-deleting it without doing any verification on the ownership of
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:33.960]   the podcast.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:38.960]   So somebody who was, you know, decided to pull a prank on Kevin made Dig Nation disappear.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:39.960]   That's right.
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.520]   The day after it showed up on the front page of it.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.360]   But now Kevin has friends and he doesn't have to worry about that.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.760]   There's a couple of crackpots that...
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:50.680]   What they do, which is kind of sneaky, is they point the feed to their own feeds, but
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.720]   they continue to make it work.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:56.440]   So people are downloading and you as you build that audience, everything seems to be working.
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:01.000]   So if the podcast is not paying attention, you can get...
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.040]   Then you have a big podcast and all of a sudden you have no control over it at all.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.280]   And Apple says, "Well, what do you mean if for the last six months it's been pointed
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:07.280]   to this address?"
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.840]   Then it's a little harder.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.840]   Nerd extortion is the worst.
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:11.840]   I'm a vegan.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.840]   I don't have a lot of energy to invite.
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.840]   There's one.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:17.840]   That's right.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:18.840]   Yeah, right.
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:25.920]   Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, it's Leo@leoville.com.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.640]   All you vegans out there who are loyal listeners are like, "I'm on your side."
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.400]   Vagons are from the planet Vega.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.400]   Vegans don't eat vegans.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.400]   Don't eat vegans.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.480]   I don't know.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:39.120]   Universal tries to claim it's illegal to email their employees.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.120]   There's a website.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.120]   Have you seen this website?
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.120]   This is unbelievable to me.
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.120]   The story.
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.120]   I love this website.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.120]   It's called Everyone.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.120]   The website's really cool.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:51.920]   I think it would be completely useless to use the actual emails on it, but it's a...
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:52.920]   It was amazing.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:59.160]   The website's called EveryoneWhoIsAnyone.com and the idea is if you're a screenwriter, you
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:03.320]   get all the agents, all the studios, all the addresses are there and you can bombard
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.320]   them.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.720]   That's how we got this job.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:12.480]   I'll never forget all the poor Patrick, the begging, the pleading, the emails.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.800]   He sent me flowers once.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.800]   Candy.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:20.760]   The flowers were some other reason.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:25.120]   Never Morgan asked for Smarties once and then got inundated with Smarties Candy.
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.360]   Like 40 pounds worth.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.280]   You know what I found out recently?
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.480]   She's Canadian, right?
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.840]   The Smarties in Canada are very different than Smarties in the US.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.600]   Smarties in Canada are basically M&Ms.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.880]   She wanted M&Ms.
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:36.880]   She got Smarties.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.880]   Smarties.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.320]   Yeah, they're like sweet tarts.
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.320]   They're like, "Ugh."
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.640]   Hey, I like those.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.160]   She never said anything though.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.160]   I'm surprised.
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.160]   She never said, "No, no.
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.160]   This is the wrong kind of Smartie."
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.560]   She took another 40 pounds of seminars.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.560]   It's just the gift horse issue here.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.560]   You don't have to send him in more Patrick's.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.560]   I'm pretty sure.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.560]   You'd be excited.
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:57.560]   Oh, this is my friend, Tila Tequila.
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.640]   Yeah, I have 109 friends.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.400]   Rick James is one of my friends.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.400]   And well, he should be.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.880]   Back to my space, I'm sorry.
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:08.240]   So how about that Skype in the video call update?
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.040]   You want to talk about that?
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.040]   Skype's going to do video.
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:14.880]   I'm still trying to get over the fact that Skype got purchased.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.240]   You do it for $3.5 billion.
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.840]   Which is a funny story because when I met with Michael Robertson and the guys, when they
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.560]   did Gizmo, they sat down at lunch with me before they rolled it out.
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:28.920]   And they were talking about the guys, the Skype guys, were asking $3.5 billion.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:29.920]   They were laughing.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.920]   They said, "Who's this guy?
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:31.920]   He's nuts.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.480]   He thinks he's going to get $2 billion or $3 billion."
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.600]   Actually, maybe it was $2.5 billion.
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.600]   He got it.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.160]   So, Logitech's doing a deal with them.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:44.520]   They're going to offer a Skype video software with the cameras, I guess.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.520]   I don't know.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.520]   Who cares?
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.520]   You get the name, does it?
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.520]   Yahoo, does it?
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.520]   Everybody does it.
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.520]   Everybody does it.
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.520]   What's the big deal?
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.520]   He did it six years ago.
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.520]   We started the NetCam network.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.960]   Yeah, which I think helped bring down tech TV.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:01.120]   I always thought the NetCam network was the sleasiest thing that was on that channel.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.080]   And if you remember the...
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.080]   Sorry.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.080]   I say I mean...
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:09.640]   No, I mean, NetCam people leave and I talk to you in the course of the years.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.640]   So every review of the tech TV, ZDTV, things are the same.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.920]   And except for the amateurish kind of thing.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:18.040]   And they would always mention Mona about these sleazy little images that were...
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.040]   The voices was wrong.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.040]   It looked crappy.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.040]   That was Lee and I.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:25.760]   And then it was the worst part about those things is that the image was really small and
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.440]   the whole thing was not even put on the screen correctly.
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.440]   It didn't...
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.840]   You know whose idea that was?
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:31.840]   Probably Peter Hammer's leave or something.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:32.840]   Oh, that's my idea.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:33.840]   I'm sorry to say.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:34.840]   It was?
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:35.840]   Yeah.
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:36.840]   Well, you could have put the key-wash on it.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.240]   No, that was the whole idea.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.240]   Before the...
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.240]   What he's trying to say is you've emotionally...
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.240]   You've discarded me.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.240]   I was starting with Candy Miner.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.240]   That's cool.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:51.560]   And we were still doing the site on MSNBC.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.160]   But it was pretty clear MSNBC was about to dump us.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.160]   Right.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.160]   Because of Diana.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.720]   Yeah, Diana died and Ziff Davis announced they're going to do a network and so why would
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.720]   you do a TV show?
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.720]   Was it Davis?
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:05.040]   And so we went to the cafe around the corner.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.040]   What was the name of that?
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.040]   Universal or...
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.040]   No, the New York club.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.040]   Slow club.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.040]   Right.
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.040]   What the service is fast or is it the other way around?
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.040]   Actually, the food was quite good.
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.040]   The food was great.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.040]   The service was brutal.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.840]   We should do this show from the slow club.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:17.840]   It's too noisy to join.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:18.840]   It's like a good joint.
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:19.840]   Yeah, after hour.
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:20.840]   Good lemon drop stuff.
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:21.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:22.840]   Oh, man.
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:23.840]   Hey, back to the...
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:24.840]   So you're there with Candy Mires.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:25.840]   You're toasted.
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:29.560]   So she's saying, you know, what would you do?
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.960]   And I said, well, I do this call-in radio show and be really cool.
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:36.560]   You could turn it into TV if you only had some way to see the callers.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.560]   And that's when...
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.560]   Bingo.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:39.560]   Bingo, brother.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.600]   And, you know, they got 20,000 of those use robotics cameras.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:44.680]   Literally, 2010.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.440]   It doesn't matter.
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.960]   Past 5,000, it's all the same.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.240]   Yeah, we're giving them away like water.
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:50.800]   We couldn't get rid of them fast enough.
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.080]   They discontinued the camera.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.600]   We still had 5,000 left.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.400]   They didn't even couldn't get software for the thing.
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.640]   We still had 3,000 left.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.040]   Well, you could still get it.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.720]   We just had to make it available in strange ways.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.720]   Microsoft OneCare.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.720]   Right.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:07.160]   This is the Mikey and the Snurti store.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.320]   This should have been killed this story for today, but go ahead.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.320]   Why should it be killed?
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.320]   It's just the stupid...
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.880]   I mean, they try this stuff all the time.
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.880]   It's not...
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.880]   No, no, no.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.880]   Microsoft's brilliant.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.880]   Listen, here's what you do.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:21.160]   You create an operating system that's full of security flaws and holes, and then you
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.680]   make people pay you monthly fee to keep it up to date.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:26.560]   This is the first real strategy we've seen from Microsoft in a decade.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.200]   It's brilliant.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.200]   It's unbelievable.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.200]   It's free right now.
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.760]   It just launched.
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:36.200]   And by the way, the Microsoft product manager calls the beta a home run.
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.200]   Next story.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.000]   Microsoft Macs, though.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   The new beta.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.160]   It's a photo editing slash...
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.160]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.040]   It has, honestly, a very sweet interface.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.040]   I don't know how well...
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.040]   No, what's this?
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.040]   Microsoft Macs.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:53.280]   It's a new beta that you just put out, and it is essentially code name Macs.
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.920]   It uses the FX, WinFX Runtime Components, which are...
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.560]   It's like some of the graphical components that will be part of Vista.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.560]   So you have to download a big chunk of...
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.280]   This is your photos, turn them into beautiful slideshows and share them with family and
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.280]   friends.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.640]   It sounds like an open platform for...
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.920]   It will be more than just photos.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.080]   It's Flickr 4.0, essentially.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.800]   I've used Google Prime too.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:12.800]   Have you tried to play with it?
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.800]   I love because it just discovered it today.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.200]   It's been out for a month or two.
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.200]   Have you played with it?
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.200]   Anyone play with it?
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.200]   I play with it briefly.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.200]   It's beautiful.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:24.120]   I think it's one of those things where it looks great and how useful is the...
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.600]   Please check it out.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.600]   It's worth checking out.
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.920]   The basic stuff, though, from Macs, it seems like it needs a couple of basic...
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:32.400]   Basic image fixing features that...
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.760]   Walt Mossberg has gone over to the dark side.
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:35.760]   He's always been over there.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:36.760]   No, no, but this is it.
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:37.760]   This is the worst.
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:38.760]   This is the worst.
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:39.760]   What happened?
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:40.760]   Walt Mossberg...
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.400]   Not the worst.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.720]   He says, "I've been testing the new iMac.
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:48.640]   Our verdict is it's the gold standard of desktop PCs.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:53.280]   To put it simply, no desktop offered by Dell or Hewlett-Packard or Sony or Gateway can
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.640]   match the new iMac G5's combination."
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.640]   Sounds like ad copies.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.720]   It sounds like ad copies.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.880]   This is the Wall Street Journal.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:00.880]   Can match the new...
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.600]   Walt Mossberg of the Wall Street Journal.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.600]   It's even weirder.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.960]   I mean, listen to these adjectives.
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:06.960]   Power, elegance, simplicity.
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:07.960]   This is one sentence.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.960]   If he retires where you go to work?
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:09.960]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.280]   Well, you know, he gets great treatment.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.080]   I've seen him at Macworld.
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.360]   We were slogging and wasting...
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.120]   Mr. Jobs, Mr. Jobs, Mr. Jobs.
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:22.840]   And Steve literally pushes us aside and puts his arm around Walt Mossberg and they go off.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.440]   Well, wouldn't you?
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:30.200]   The President was working on an Apple booth at a trade show about two years ago before
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.120]   they started getting the processor speed up.
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.120]   And he's got...
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:39.000]   There's sort of a young, very enthusiastic Apple employee there that he's trying to contain.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.480]   And Mossberg comes walking up to one of the iMacs and the kid runs up and he's like,
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.480]   "Mr. Mossberg's right there.
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.880]   I hope you complete your experience."
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.640]   And Mossberg's hands are going up to the keyboard.
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:55.440]   And apparently he just turns to him, looks and says, "Do you want to ask me any questions?
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.440]   Leave me alone.
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.240]   You can tell me why these things are so...
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.240]   I'm slow."
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:02.240]   But that was a couple of years ago.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.240]   That was...
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.240]   He doesn't...
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:08.080]   I see elegance, simplicity, ease of use, but I don't stability, security.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.200]   I don't see slow anywhere in here.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.880]   And he also says it handles all common Windows files as well as the internet and email with
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.800]   a plomb.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.920]   And he says, "A contract of misconceptions is Mac because of the complete price."
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:21.560]   Actually, I have to say, I do like the new G.iMac.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:25.320]   The one thing that they did I really like, have you seen this new front row application?
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.280]   It's basically a media server.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.440]   It's got a remote control.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.440]   It's cool.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.240]   I think it's really good about the rumors about the next generation.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:34.520]   Mac Mini that's a media machine.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.520]   It has potential.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.520]   It could be.
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.520]   Or '99.
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:39.520]   Well, it will be the hardware support.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.520]   And that will make it break it.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:41.520]   I think you're less.
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.520]   It's vaporware at this point.
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:43.520]   And it has...
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:46.080]   Microsoft has it in the bag right now with Media Center Edition.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.120]   Now, 2005 is an amazing app.
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.120]   It supports.
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.280]   It's as good of a front end as I've seen on any of you.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.280]   It's actually quite good.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.760]   And what's really nice is the way it interfaces with the Xbox 360.
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.200]   So you can just hook that to your TV to your ATV.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.200]   I think what you're going to have is a keyboard.
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.200]   It's a keyboard.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.200]   It's 200 bucks.
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:01.200]   But I think that what we're talking about.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.200]   That's a good point.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.400]   The rumors are with Mac Mini, you're going to talk about a DVR that will record it straight
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.880]   to your iPod.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:06.880]   Your iPod to you.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.520]   That would be their version.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.520]   You know, I think that iPod...
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.320]   And that would just be a pass from you.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.520]   I think that's a dead end technology.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.520]   Tebow's right there.
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:16.000]   Hem and M and selling any of them at all.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.680]   Yeah, I said that you can't sell them, but I'm telling you, these things are going to
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:19.680]   be...
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:20.680]   These things are going to be door stops.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.680]   We talked about this.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:22.680]   Nobody's going to watch television on this screen.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.680]   It is a little small, I have to say.
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.680]   I have.
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:26.680]   It's not compelling to me.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:29.840]   I have to say that it may not be compelling, but for the whole face there are a lot of
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.840]   people downloading a video on that format.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.840]   Yeah, it's short term.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.680]   It's a bump in the road you watch.
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.480]   Two years ago, you said what happened.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.400]   You offer an iPod version of DLTV?
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.320]   Is that the biggest version that you download?
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.320]   No.
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.320]   But it's up there.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.320]   What is the word?
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:47.840]   I haven't gone over the last two weeks of log files, but we've been pretty neck and neck
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:52.120]   with W-M-V-H.264 in the iPod format.
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.120]   We talked about this last week.
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:56.800]   Tebow announced they're going to offer a way to offload your Tebow to your iPod on
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:57.800]   your PSP.
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.160]   Well, they already offer with the latest to go software.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:04.240]   You can now easily move, well, easily as in moving it through USB One-Catch and large
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:07.160]   video files back and forth to your PC already.
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.240]   From that point, you can do whatever you want with it.
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:10.240]   Sure, you can always put it.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.240]   USB One.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.240]   But they say...
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.240]   That's too slow.
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:16.040]   They say direct download to the iPod and PSP.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.040]   I think that's what I gathered.
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.840]   Well, that'll just mean that the Tebow to go software will add the functionality for
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.440]   encoding to that format.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.200]   As it is right now, if you want to encode that to anything that will play outside...
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:30.520]   Don't you want to pay the extra five cents for the USB Two technology or what?
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.800]   Or how about just an ethernet connection?
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:32.800]   No, I bet you.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:36.560]   It's the movie company saying, "You could do it, but it has to be really slow."
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:39.400]   And there's...
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.880]   You seem like you're trying to be funny there, but in fact it's possible.
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:42.880]   Of course it is.
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:46.080]   Well, there are also actually selling, apparently, going to be selling movie tickets over the
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.080]   Tebow.
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.080]   One of the many strange options that are kind of...
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.560]   Actually, I talked to Samsung when they were bringing out all this up-link.
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.720]   You know, they have all these up-converters for their DVD players.
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:57.560]   You can get 720p off of a regular DVD player.
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.920]   And it's only through HDMI, you know, and I'm saying, "Why can't you get all of the
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:02.920]   early ones that DVD-i?"
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:07.400]   And there's still some company that has one with a regular component video.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.400]   And HDMI.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.400]   Really?
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.640]   And HDMI?
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:12.640]   It doesn't lock into the connection.
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:16.360]   And a lot of these TV's are putting the connection straight up.
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.360]   And now, oh, what's the solution?
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:20.800]   Add a little strap to hold your cable in place.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.200]   Don't worry about it.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.200]   It's like a dollar television.
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.200]   $150 cable.
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:25.200]   And besides that, how many people...
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.200]   How many people...
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:30.080]   How many people realistically need audio and video on the same cable?
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.880]   What's wrong with that?
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:32.880]   One cable.
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:33.880]   How many TVs have 5/1?
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.880]   Oh.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:35.880]   Why am I getting back?
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:36.880]   It's easy to finish my story.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.360]   Let me finish my story so people don't...
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.240]   Because when you listen to radio people, what was the end of that story?
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:46.320]   The end of it was they wouldn't do it in a component video because Hollywood said no,
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.320]   we wouldn't.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.320]   They want digital because they can copy-protect.
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:52.320]   Wankers.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.320]   I mean, what doers does it make?
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.320]   I want to rent a DVD.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.320]   I want to watch it at 720p.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.920]   I've got an older HD screen or projector or whatever.
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:34:59.920]   I want to watch this thing.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:00.920]   No, I can't.
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:06.760]   Well, Mac, everyone's responsible for not being able to do the upscaling over component.
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:10.840]   All the upscaling DVD players can only do it through digital output.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:13.360]   I can find you one that actually has a component.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.360]   Oh, no, I know.
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.360]   They have component connections.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.360]   No, that would does the up, the up...
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.360]   Or the copyrighted disc.
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.360]   Or as I know, I mean, maybe there's some gotcha.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.360]   Why does HDMI?
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.360]   I mean, I've just never seen a player.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.360]   That's legit.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:30.400]   There might be a hack that enables that feature, but macro vision protection is part of the
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.480]   macro vision protection is that you can't do that over.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.880]   Is the president of APEC still in custody in China?
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:36.880]   I think he is.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:37.880]   Isn't that a wacky story?
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:38.880]   Did you hear that?
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:39.880]   No, tell us.
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:40.880]   So APECs is...
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:44.840]   Remember, we all ran out and bought APECs DVDs.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:50.520]   The deal was a Chinese American fella, Chinese American fella realized that you could make
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.400]   cheap DVD players that were good.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.760]   And he did a deal with the Chinese government.
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:55.760]   Kind of.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:56.760]   Kind of good.
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.760]   It was kind of a 50/50.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:01.160]   It either ran for years or it blew up in the first two weeks.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:05.880]   And they actually, I think the later ones were better and then they started making TVs.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:09.360]   But apparently he wasn't paying the Chinese government for these things he was selling
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:16.040]   or they claimed he was under stating sales because he's in China now in custody.
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:18.760]   It was things with no country code and they had all these features.
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.240]   Yeah, that was the great thing about the APECs at a backdoor.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.440]   But anyway, so yeah, poor guy now.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.440]   I mean, he's kind of...
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:27.440]   There's no legal proceedings.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.440]   Was he not paying royalties?
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.440]   Not whether angry.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:32.200]   Well, this name royalties to who to China.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.840]   China was making them building them.
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:34.840]   And he never paid them.
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:35.840]   He never paid them.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:36.840]   That's what they claim.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:40.760]   I'm sorry, if you make a deal with the sovereign nation or maybe it's the high ranking general
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:41.840]   on a sovereign nation.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:42.840]   That's who it was.
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.840]   You don't, you know what I mean?
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:45.840]   You should pay them.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:46.840]   Yeah, it's very simple.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.440]   It claims they were being paid.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.440]   You know what, maybe it was.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.440]   You should have kept the receipt.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.760]   You don't want to mess around.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.320]   You know, if the Chinese government is making you TVs, you're right.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.320]   Pay the bills.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.320]   Pay the bills.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:02.640]   You didn't mention, if Apple were going to do this media center, would they announce
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.440]   it at this TV Expo?
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.440]   It'd be unlikely.
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.440]   It'd be a super product.
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:08.240]   It'll be a consumer product.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:13.480]   I mean, next week, DV Expo is where people will be showing off and announcing stuff.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:14.480]   It's DV Expo.
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.120]   DV Expo is kind of like a smaller NAB.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:18.840]   I mean, a much smaller NAB.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:19.840]   Where is it?
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:20.840]   It's down in LA.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:21.840]   There's a DV Expo West and East.
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:22.840]   DV.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.960]   Digital Video Magazine puts it on.
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.480]   It's been a growing show, very successful.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.280]   Scuttle Buddies that Apple might say do something with professional video now.
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.280]   They're not going to do anything.
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.280]   There's Mickey Mouse.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.960]   I'm sorry, a small show like that.
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:36.960]   They have in the past.
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:37.960]   So that's why...
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.880]   But not a big thing like a Mac mini.
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:40.880]   No, no.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.720]   It's a hard thing to see them just standardize the interface on Final Cut and Compressor and
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:44.720]   everything.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.720]   Sorry, I just been in the back.
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:46.720]   They're slowly moving that direction.
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:49.920]   Well, it's like, you know, the first nine versions of the operating system were tightly
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:55.600]   controlled and you like, you start shifting applications in OS X and it's like, "Wow!
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:58.200]   This is a wicked, ripping pain in the ass!"
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.520]   You know, it's right clickable here.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.600]   It's not very clickable there.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:01.600]   The menus come down there.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:02.600]   They don't...
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.160]   Is that because they bought it or is it because...
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.160]   Well, Final Cut...
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.600]   I mean, everything kind of wraps around.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:07.600]   You know what?
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.120]   Final Cut kind of came the way it came.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.560]   But you'll find the DVD Studio Pro and sound...
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:12.920]   Like in Soundtrack Pro.
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:17.360]   For instance, the interfaces are almost identical because that's when Apple really has...
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.360]   Right.
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.360]   You know, they wrote it from scratch.
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.360]   From scratch.
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:23.160]   You know, well, I mean, DVD Studio Pro, the first one wasn't written from scratch, but
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.160]   the second one was.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.560]   Or almost, I mean, it was really rewritten completely.
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:28.560]   Until...
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.560]   In January?
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:30.560]   That's...
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:31.560]   Now, the Citigroup...
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:32.560]   The Citigroup, I think...
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:34.360]   I think this is definite now.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:37.160]   Once the analysts start saying it's going to happen, it's going to happen.
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.160]   That means they probably told them.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:41.160]   They got to tell some of these guys in advance before this clock.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.760]   I'd be totally blown away if we don't see it.
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:43.760]   He says...
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:47.600]   I'm guessing the mini, the iBook, and possibly iMac.
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:48.880]   Think Seeker was saying iBook.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:49.880]   This guy's saying PowerBook.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:50.880]   The laptop...
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.880]   That's the one they need to be revved.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.200]   I mean, they are getting really long on the tooth.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.360]   I love a penny amount.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:58.360]   And so I think that...
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:01.600]   I think that's why we haven't seen any major revision, but I don't know whether it's going
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:02.600]   to be January.
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.600]   There's a couple dates that Apple can use in spring.
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:06.760]   Yeah, but he can roll it out in January and ship later.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:07.760]   It's possible they can do it.
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:08.760]   It's a big shot.
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:09.760]   They tend not to do it way ahead of time.
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.760]   Yeah, but they seem to like to ship right away.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:12.760]   Yeah, but Apple stores.
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:15.040]   Yeah, but there's no reason they can't ship this thing already.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.760]   What they really like is everybody leaving the keynote, running across the street to the
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:21.400]   Apple store and buying every single unit.
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.400]   That's what they like.
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.400]   That's what they like.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.400]   That's pretty much...
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.400]   It's right across the street.
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.400]   I'm always...
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:31.000]   Why don't you just go to the Apple store, folks, and be on a cell phone.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.360]   And then when the word comes out and they throw it in the box, in front of you, you
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.920]   have to get products for review.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:40.560]   Well, a lot of these guys are selling them on eBay.
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.400]   They know that they'll be a shortage.
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:47.600]   Yeah, I think that the Mac Mini is one that's pretty high up on the list, I think, because
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.240]   Apple looks at it as their Switch machine.
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:52.160]   So I got some viewer mail this week, I want to mention.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.160]   Yes.
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:40:00.040]   One is that people are complaining or suggesting that you, Leo, get the store together because
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.560]   Christmas is coming.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:02.560]   It's coming.
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:05.320]   I'm working right now with a company in...
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.320]   I don't know, somewhere.
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.920]   I got to be careful.
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:14.120]   We said something about Tennessee and I got a hate mail from people from Tennessee.
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:15.120]   Tennessee.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.120]   Tennessee.
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:17.120]   I love it.
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:18.120]   It's from Nashville.
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:19.120]   Actually, it's a very nice place.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.120]   They got a great barbecue there.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:22.120]   Francis and Luskey, they're putting a store together.
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:24.040]   It looks great.
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:27.320]   We're trying to figure out how many items we can have so that people can...
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:32.000]   I don't want to have too many items because then there might be delays in getting them.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   So I want to have a reasonable selection.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   At least start selection.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   No, we're going to have t-shirts.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   I've already ordered huddies.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   We're going to have hats.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   The John C. Devorah.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   I get no spam on your huddies.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   Underhoots.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   Yeah, so look for that soon.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.520]   I actually hoped it would be up by this week.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:50.360]   I got another note from someone saying I was a bully last week or the week after.
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.360]   Especially I was bullying Patrick.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:56.360]   I guess these guys never seen Patrick, you know, lifting your dead lifting.
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:00.600]   You know, bullying Patrick is like a laugh.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.000]   You were all over my ass.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   It happens.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   You know what?
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   Sometimes it goes right back the other way.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.280]   You know, as well, these guys think that you're helpless.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.440]   So I'm just mentioning it to you.
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.560]   Well, I am the sort of a wallflower.
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.560]   He is.
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:12.560]   He's a shrinking vial.
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:15.360]   Patrick can walk down Market Street wearing a killed, incurring a high performance off-road
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:19.000]   shock over a shoulder and still gets the looks from the women.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.080]   I just, you know, the funny thing is about, well, you know, Patrick's an interesting guy
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.320]   from the one perspective.
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:28.720]   He's, because I've taken this picture a few times because I'm a photograph photographer,
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:30.880]   junkie, basically, and take everyone's shots.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.520]   Patrick's the most photogenic, one of the most photogenic guys I've ever shot.
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:34.520]   It's unbelievable.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.520]   Really?
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.520]   Oh, he did tell him.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:37.520]   I mean, you know you're photogenic.
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.600]   I mean, if you look at him in person, it's like, nah, this guy can't be photogenic.
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.600]   He's not really that good looking.
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.560]   But I'll tell you, now picture holy mackerel.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.360]   It's astonishing, to be honest.
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.360]   I've worked with him for years, and I've never noticed that.
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:51.360]   Oh, no, it's astonishing.
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.880]   I'm telling you, you and my mother together, you can really be all over.
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.680]   I'm telling you, no, seriously.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:59.840]   It's, you know, when you take a lot of pictures, you see what you learn.
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:04.120]   And you get, but the thing is, the one weird thing about photogeneity is you don't necessarily
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:05.120]   know it.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.120]   You can't tell how it's done.
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.120]   You can try to tell you.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.120]   Is it bone structure?
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.120]   Yeah, I think it's bone structure.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.120]   With him, it's bone structure.
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:11.120]   I'm not absolutely sure.
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:14.120]   He's got a big jaw and he's got a funny squint.
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:15.120]   I have no idea.
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:16.120]   And the cabs.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.120]   It's a mirror.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:19.120]   You look at it, you go, man.
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.120]   Cover it with cheap shoe.
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.120]   They call you.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.720]   When they say, you're the lunchbox Larry guy, what is that?
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:25.520]   I own the lunchbox crap.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:26.520]   Lunchbox crap.
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:29.320]   Anyway, so that's the two letters.
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.600]   Did you steal my blackberry?
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:31.600]   You did.
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:32.600]   Yes, right here.
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:33.600]   You're going to talk about it.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.800]   I can make calls with this thing.
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.480]   We need candles on it.
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:38.480]   This is an awesome phone.
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:39.480]   I actually really like it.
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:40.480]   Leo's got the new blackberry.
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:41.640]   Oh, look, it crashed.
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:42.640]   That's one thing I don't like about it.
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:43.640]   It crashes a lot.
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:44.640]   It crashed right in front of me.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:45.640]   Yeah.
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.480]   There are number 200 reset.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:49.040]   It doesn't just press return.
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.840]   Does it have a touch sensitive screen?
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:51.840]   No.
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:52.840]   But it's a beautiful screen.
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:56.120]   Anyway, it may be completely useless in a month when blackberry, because blackberry
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:57.840]   lost their court case on Wednesday.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:58.840]   Well, did they lose it?
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:42:59.840]   Let's talk about that.
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:03.240]   Yeah, I remember when you would buy something, then the price would drop and the rest of
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.240]   us could afford it.
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:07.640]   Now you buy something and they lose court cases and they go out of business.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.480]   You're definitely some sort of a jinx.
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:10.520]   No new max for you.
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:14.280]   So the deal is that there is a patent holding company.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.280]   This is the thing.
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.080]   You create a company, you buy some patents.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:18.560]   No, no, that's not true.
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.800]   NTP is not a patent holding company.
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:23.840]   No, the guy actually did some inventing and he's not like one of those sleazy patent
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:24.840]   holding companies.
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:26.640]   It's a legitimate guy with a legitimate patent.
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:27.640]   He owns several patents.
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:29.640]   And they're all around this sort of thing.
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.640]   And they're all around patents and he goods another issue.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:33.880]   Well, but it's not like that's not to store them.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:35.760]   Okay, so he's not a sleaze bag.
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:36.760]   No.
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:40.400]   He has several patents, though, about how blackberry delivers email.
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:44.240]   Something about a proxy server and email delivery claims that blackberry is infringing
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:45.240]   on the bank.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.240]   They negotiate.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:50.240]   Blackberry claims they have a settlement early in the spring of $450 million settlement.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:52.000]   NTP says, "No, there was no settlement."
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.640]   Actually, it started with the 60 million and it went to one something and then it went
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:56.640]   to four something.
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.560]   It kept building every time you read.
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.240]   It started in 2002 or something like that.
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.240]   And it's been going for three years.
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:03.800]   And it's been going on and the money hasn't been paid to anybody.
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:06.400]   It's been going into an escrow account just in case they do lose.
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:09.240]   Well, and this is what the judge ruled on Wednesday.
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:11.040]   He says, "I've had enough.
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:16.040]   There is no agreement.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:19.040]   We're going to settlement hearings."
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.040]   And that's it.
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:23.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:27.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:34.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:35.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:39.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:41.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:43.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:46.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:47.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:49.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:53.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:55.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.040]   Both of them.
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:00.040]   Both of them.
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:01.040]   Both of them.
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:02.040]   Both of them.
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.040]   Both of them.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.040]   Both of them.
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.040]   Both of them.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.040]   Both of them.
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:07.040]   Both of them.
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:08.040]   Both of them.
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:09.040]   Both of them.
