[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Hey, welcome to TWiT 202. I'm John C. Dvorak, substituting for Leo Laporte, who's off in China.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Ni hao.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   I'm taking pictures and probably being arrested as we speak, at least that's what he thinks.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   And we've got some guests lined up that are -- I keep you probably, I think, entertained for the next hour and a half or so.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Beginning with Becky Worley. Hello, Becky.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Good afternoon, John C.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   So what are your monikers currently that you're going to plug here for --
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Oh, it's Plugorama?
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Well, I mean, I'm introducing you.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Well, you know, you can check out the blogs at abcnews.com.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   I'm filling in for Bill Weir on Monday, so check out the Quick Fix.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   That's one. And you know, anything else?
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Anyone looking to rent a condo on Maui? Email me.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Wow.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   How's that for a straight-up plug?
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And then we have a couple of virgins here for the show, insofar as they've never been on the show before.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Ouch.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Including Natalie Del Conti, the famous now CBS person, who is -- what's your -- what do we want to refer to you as?
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Well, I'm an anchor for CNET TV, and I'm a correspondent for the CBS Early Show.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And congratulations, by the way.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I'm sure you're killing them.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Oh, well, I don't know about that, but --
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   And another virgin is Carlos Rodela, who is --
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   What's up, people?
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   -- at CarlosRodela.com, also one of the -- he's actually running the tech network at Mevio.com.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   What, anything else we want to put you down for there, buddy?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Yeah, we do episodic web show content at Mevio, and then I work with you.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Talking about you.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Well, I work with you, and so that's fun.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Okay, well, that's good enough. It's good enough for me.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   So everybody here knows about tech, so we can talk about topics until we're blue in the face, and that's what we're going to do.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Stop. You have not said ChannelDvorak.org yet.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   ChannelDvorak.com --
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Oh, sorry.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   -- and Dvorak.org.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Okay, I just was -- it was just too weird that everybody else was plugging, but I just needed to stop for a second.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   It's a good point. I'm glad that she's here now.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Okay, so what do we got for news stories?
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   You know, the thing that kind of jumped out at me was this crazy story that Sony Ericsson had -- or somebody slipped it into the public domain that they've got a phone now that's going to be running Android,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   and along with all the -- what we now hear are 20 new phones coming out running Android before Christmas, it could cause a kind of a tidal wave of interest in Android. Anybody --
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Yeah, but --
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   The pre-weekly fix --
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Well, wouldn't you expect that, though?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   -- this thing looks like a Blackberry Storm.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Yeah, it does.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   But Sony Ericsson already makes really great phones. The only problem is we never see them in the U.S. because they have too high of megapixels on their cameras, and our U.S. carriers just won't accept them.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   So we never get to see them, but Sony Ericsson phones are great.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   This phone is supposed to have an 8.1 megapixel camera and a flash.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Yeah, well, that may be part of the reason, but aren't the phones that they generally have made until now using Windows Mobile?
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   I think so, yeah.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Who's the primary carrier for these guys?
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   But generally, when I have a couple of these phones -- not this one, but I just get the unlocked phone and just throw anybody's card in there, and I don't really care who the carrier is. Is anybody selling Sony Ericsson stuff, Verizon or AT&T? Does anybody know?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   I don't think so. I think you have to get them unlocked. None of the carriers subsidize them, and a lot of it is because the carriers won't subsidize a phone with such a high megapixel camera.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Yeah, how much are you talking about?
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   I'm sorry, Carlos, does anybody but me think that the Android phone is going to eventually overtake the iPhone in popularity?
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Survey says, "Mwaaah, mwaaah."
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   I actually think maybe. I played with the HTC Magic recently, and I really liked it, and I think Android is a great operating system.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   I think that because so many other carriers are going to be open to it besides just mobile OS X, then yeah, I definitely think that that's true.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   This seems like an inertia question. I mean, just there's so much momentum going the iPhone's way.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   So you're going to stick with iPhone in this argument?
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   I'm going to stay there because I just feel like it's also about the content, and in terms of the App Store, in terms of iTunes, I just feel like for the average Joe,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   the momentum is already pushing so much towards the iPhone that while there will be a niche subset who finds the sort of more boutique phones like the Sony Ericsson a little bit --
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   to have more cachet, more geek cachet, I think that the lion's share is going to stick with the iPhone.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Carlos?
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Yeah, Dvorak, this is a perfect opportunity for me to talk about MetroPCS yet again.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   And I'm not sponsored by them yet. But yeah, I mean, talk about Joe Schmo.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   This phone right here, $50 unlimited text data voice and everything like that, it's 300 bucks.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   But when we're talking about all these fancy, expensive phones, usually, yeah, they're tied into contracts.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   And for me, Joe Schmo, I want something that I have no contract and it's all in one kind of advice.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   What is that phone?
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   $50 a month all included is pretty awesome.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Yeah, yeah. And the phone's of 300 bucks. And it's pretty cool. It looks -- it feels like an iPhone.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   You know, today iPhone is on my poo-poo list because I --
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   What list is this?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Your poo-poo list.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   My crap list. It's my nice way of saying my -- because I have been chasing Apple all day because this morning I had an appointment at Apple to go in and get my iPhone subsidy because I pre-ordered iPhone 3GS.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   And then they came out and changed the subsidy rules and said, okay, people who were eligible for upgrade within July, August or September can now get the subsidy.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   But I had already paid and they charged my credit card the full amount. And I can't figure out how to get that money back to save my life.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   I've called AT&T. They won't help me. They told me to call Apple. I called Apple and they said go into the store.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   I went into the store and they said to call AT&T. So I feel like I've been chasing my head. It's like a Mobius strip.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   And I'm so upset with Apple right now.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Did you use -- do you use an Amex card for this?
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   I used a Visa, just a regular Visa.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Because you know with an Amex card you could just say, no, I'm not going to pay this and then the dispute goes into play.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Look at you, David Horowitz.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   I guess I think I'm going to have to send the phone back.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Just saying.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   I think that this is really -- you either play the correspondent card or you go into the Apple store and cry.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   See, I'm so uncomfortable with you that I tried --
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   This is exactly why.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   I tried to get really nice at the store and that didn't work. It didn't work at all.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   So I -- and I'm so uncomfortable pulling the correspondent card. So I just didn't do it at all.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   And now I'm just -- I think I'm just going to send the phone back.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   I'm just so tired of dealing with Apple. This is why I don't deal with Apple. You know what I mean?
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   I just -- I want a phone that I can just pay quick and just be done with it.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Are you getting paid by these guys by the way?
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Yeah, yeah. It's by the minute. By the minute I actually got paid.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Pull up that hoodie and show us your Metro PCS t-shirt. I know it's on there.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   We can also sub them by saying Boost Mobile also $50 a month, right?
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   And some of the other carriers --
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Hey, you know, I use a track phone. It's $39 a month.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   But it's not -- but it's like a prepaid card.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   I mean, you don't get unlimited anything. You pay for the minutes and you just don't use the phone much.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And they also have those deals with Verizon and AT&T now where you can pay by the day.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   It's like a buck 50 to two bucks a day for a 24-hour period.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   So you're not on a contract at all. So they're --
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Is that what the price is? You sure?
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Yeah, it's not that expensive.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Some of these -- you know, the bigger carriers are getting it that people want that kind of flexibility.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   And, you know, places like Shrink My -- Bill Shrink, Myvalidos, these companies that will -- you upload a PDF of your bill,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   they'll analyze it, and then they'll assess how your usage fits into the best plans
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   and then send you a better deal that you should be doing within your same carrier.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Did you bring the Sham Wows?
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Dude, an entire bag of them.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   All right.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Wait, why do you have those?
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   What?
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   She's a pitch man for Sham Wows. She's going to take over when this guy quits the Sham Wows guy.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Hey, camera guy. Hey, camera guy.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   You know, it's really interesting. Okay, I got to have my slight Billy Mays retrospective just to follow up on last week.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   So I did bring you a Billy Mays product, which is Mighty Menditt, with a picture of Billy Mays and his throat beard, just an homage to last week's show.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Sham Wow is pitched by Vince Offer -- thank you, Colleen -- who would have been the natural successor to Billy Mays,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   except that he got arrested a few months ago for allegedly punching a prostitute.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Yeah, well, what choice did he have?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   So then we get Anthony Sullivan, the British guy who co-hosts the show on Discovery with Billy Mays called Pitch Men.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Billy Mays, untimely passing, and now Discovery has ordered a whole new season of Pitch Men.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Without Billy Mays.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   They had ordered it before his passing.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Wait, is the British guy the guy who does that chopping thing, the chopper where you like hit it a bunch of times and it chops up?
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   That is the same guy who does Sham Wow. That's Vince Offer.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Anthony Sullivan does shuffles, which are mops that you wear on your feet.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   And they have these great pads that are Velcroed onto the bottom, and you can throw them into the washing machine after you've mopped the kitchen floor.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Dvorak, you need to do that in Mevio.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Unbelievable.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Dvorak, wear those in Mevio. I'm serious. That would be awesome.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   I could just wear them around the house.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Yeah, but you can clean our office. It's really dirty.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   I brought a bunch of... and I also showed you a before and after of Sham Wow. I gave you some used... those are the used ones and these are the fresh ones.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   This is a used Sham Wow?
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   For you, the best.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   What is it?
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Well, they come in different colors.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Oh.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   But I just wanted to show it does not act like your traditional Shammy, which has the leather-like...
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Yeah, Shammy's are great.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Yeah, this is not a Shammy.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   No.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   This is a rag that costs $20 plus shipping and handling.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Okay.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   You know, we should do a show about the technology behind these things because these are really amazing products.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   My mom used to have the Miracle Thaw, and that stuff you could take a frozen chicken, a whole chicken, put it on this plate, and it would defrost your chicken in like two minutes.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Yeah. Well, that was because it was made out of aluminum. You have high heat transfer.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   If you actually had one of those things made out of copper...
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   There you go. There's the answer.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   In fact, I use a copper pot to do this. If you take a copper pot and put the chicken, you take and flip it over, made out of copper, it's a real lot faster than aluminum, and you put the chicken on top of the bottom of the pot, because it's upside down now, the thing will be... it thaws out in two seconds.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   John C. DeVore.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   What?
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   From solid rock to thaw.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Wow.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Well, it's not quite two seconds, but it's something like that.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   This is really advanced science that we're talking about.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Crunch pad.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Awesome. Technology. Awesome.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Crunch pad. I want to talk about it.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   All right. Crunch pad is... so there's a story that shows up in the... it was interesting because somebody called out Michael Arrington on the fact that he released the news about his Crunch pad in this traditional print media, some one of the business magazines or business newspapers.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   And so apparently Michael Arrington was floating around Southeast Asia and found some manufacturing company that would make this Crunch pad, which is like a giant iPhone.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Right. It's 12 inches diagonally. It's a glass touchscreen. It's internet browser only. Runs on flash. Adam Chips, I think. Right?
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   I don't know.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   And this is what he wants. He just wants an internet only device that's bigger than a Kindle.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Right.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Well, he got a call from manufacturers about a year and a couple months ago, and he was saying, you know, anyone, I'll work with anyone. Just give us some ideas on what you think this will be.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   And I thought that that was kind of a neat idea. But now we're in the age of netbooks and iPhones. And why do I need this when I've got a Kindle, a netbook and an iPhone?
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   He wants it to replace the Kindle.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Well, yeah, the Kindle is still black and white. I mean, you know what I mean? We still need color. We still need the ability to do a magazine type experience.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Okay, but is it going to give me wireless downloading? Free?
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   I hope. Isn't Apple working on something just like this too?
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Well, if that's the case, then it's over.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   I mean, because Apple, if Apple rolls out a netbook or a pad, I suspect that it's going to have all those patents on the multiple hands thing where you can move things around with two fingers.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Multi-touch.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   And some other features that would probably make it a dynamite device. I'm just guessing.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Well, Apple also put in last week for some new patents, including haptic feedback. And the idea here being that it could provide...
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   Haptic, meaning it shakes when you move?
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Yeah, there's sort of a tactile feedback, sort of like the Blackberry Storm, that would...
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   It could either supplement this tablet idea that it's sort of more than a tablet, more than a netbook, justifying cost, all about interface, or it could be an upgrade to the iPhone in this respect in terms of you touch the right button and it gives you some sort of a pushback.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   So I get a haptic feedback. I have an N97, which is the new, not yet released in the US as far as I know, Nokia, which has got the big screen and it's got a flip open thing and a keyboard, a full keyboard and the whole rest of it.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   I think the thing's terrible, personally. But when you touch it, you have this haptic thing going on.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   But what's interesting, I think, that makes it kind of intriguing is they've added even more radios, like there's not enough already on these things. You have GPS, you've got all these different receivers.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   This one has an FM radio built into it and an FM transmitter.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   And so you can take and load it up with your, say, a bunch of MP3s and then you tune the transmitter to 88.3 or whatever you don't have on your normal radio and then you put it in your car, hit the button, turn on your radio and you get the stereo from the player.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Yeah, that's great, Dvorak, but are you listening to the radio still?
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Well, old class that don't have mini jack inputs.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   That's all I listen to is I listen to right-wing talk radio.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Yeah, I know.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   At work. You must have had a field day this weekend with the Palin departure.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   I got some good stuff from Palin.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   Oh, this sounds like a conspiracy theory.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   It'll be on the No Agenda show. It'll be doing it tomorrow.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   Hey, but Dvorak, on this home, all these types of touchscreen-type tablet things, I mean, you just got to look at the company who's going to evolve and look at the evolution of technology, right?
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   And they're going to be the winners. I mean, just think about Minority Report and that whole thing. And that's happening on Fox News now or whatever, or those news channels.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   I mean, look at the people who are pushing that envelope and they're the ones that are going to succeed because at the end of the day, we have to evolve that tablet.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   You OK?
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Everybody's. Yeah. I've had too much pet-sleep.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   I like the Dvorak. I like the little note in the back. You watch Pardon the Interrupt. What's the one? It's not Pardon the Interrupt. No, no. It's the one before that. It's the round the horn with Tony Reale.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   One of the guys always has a sign behind him.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Well, it's Dvorak is hilarious.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   That says something.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   That's subliminal, I think.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Well, remember the thing with haptics was we always thought that it was going to be the porn companies that would develop it to its height because you would have some sort of a USB device that you would plug in.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Teledildonics.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   That's right. Teledildonics.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   That's what it was called and that's what it's still called.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   That's how it would be remembered.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   No, but I don't know that it's ever taken off. But why would I know?
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Apple, iPhone, apps.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   I saw something a little bit like this at demo last year that was the same size as the TechCrunch.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   What? It figures? Is that what you said?
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Well, the thing was, I thought that it was such a needed device and it would be made to replace your PDFs or any of your book readers.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   I thought you were talking about Teledildonics.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   I got exposed. I was like, whoa.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   No. You guys.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Is that on your Pupil list too, Natalie?
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   No, I don't know anything about that.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   I don't know anything about it. Never heard of it.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   She's never going to come on the show again. We're harassing her.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   You see me blushing if you're watching the show live. You can see me blushing.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Actually, yeah. Not quite. I mean, you might be, but we're not getting it.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   All right. Next.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   Can I stay with our slightly adult theme and talk about Apple, iPhone apps?
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Just sorry, more Apple, but that have been pulled because of inappropriate content.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Yeah, they have naked people or scantily dressed people.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   And so they decided they don't want to have anything to do with it.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Right. And these particular apps are sort of like hot or not apps.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Remember, you would rate, am I hot? Am I not?
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   And then users upload their own photos.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   So, of course, you can't control every photo unless it's approved by the app company themselves.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   Right.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   So Apple pulls it because the user generated content is adult and inappropriate.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   I get that. But the thing that seems so just hypocritical about this is
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Apple has an app on my phone right now that gives me complete access to inappropriate material.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Yeah, this browser.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Safari.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Yeah, I don't know. I don't get it either.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   I just called. I don't think so.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Well, my comment was that I think they took the scantily clad girls off the iPhone
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   because they were already having enough trouble with smudges on the screen.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Gross. John, bad.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   What? What?
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   OK. I have something I just wanted to ask.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   I'm not there to kill it. What?
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   I'm somehow feeling the Dvorak role of like moving the tech a lot.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   Yeah, move it along.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   Sorry. How many of you guys downloaded Jackson songs this week off the web?
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Natalie, you're too young.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   Yes, I did. Actually. No, I'm not too young. Come on.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   What did you get?
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   No, I did. I actually and well, because I realized that the Jackson music that I still own is either on tape or record.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   So I had to go and buy iTunes and I just bought the best stuff.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   I have actually an interesting story about that because I used to have CDs, Jackson CDs,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   but I was raised a Jehovah's Witness and so when when Michael Jackson disassociated himself from the Jehovah's Witness faith,
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   everyone who is still Jehovah's Witness was told to throw away all of his CDs.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   So my mom made my sister and I throw all of it in the trash.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   My sister kept the Remember the Time. I think that I don't remember the name of that album anyway.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   So she kept it and she just hid it. But we had to throw away all of our CDs.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   So I only had the tapes and the records that we had from the 80s and that I hid from my mom.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   That's the most wholesome reason to like have one license that spans your entire life for a piece of music.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Yeah, I think. Yeah.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   When did he associate himself with the Jehovah's Witness? You said he didn't.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   He went away. He disassociated.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   He was raised a Jehovah's Witness, just like I was. His mother, I believe, still is.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   And he disassociated himself from the faith in the 90s, I believe, in the early 90s, like around 92 ish.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Isn't there some code word, Natalie, that's something like disassociate or you've been disassociated or something that
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   if you tell any Jehovah's Witnesses that come to your door, they'll never come back again?
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Well, you can be disfellowshipped, which means they kicked you out.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   But he disassociated himself, which means he was the one who removed himself.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   They're two different words. So if you're disfellowshipped, that means they kicked you out.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   If you're disassociated, you kicked yourself out.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   OK, so if you give so the Jehovah's Witness comes to you, do we have nothing but good facts on this show, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Jehovah's Witness come to your door and you say, I'm sorry, but I've been disfellowshipped.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   They never come back again.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Wow, because they're not allowed to talk to you.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   I heard that too. You could as soon as you see open the door and Buddhist, sorry.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   I know we got to get back to tech, but how do you get disfellowshipped? Is there like a set of things?
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   You have to do something that violates the rules and not be repentant for it.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Oh, not sorry.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   I am neither disfellowshipped nor am I disassociated. I am just inactive, which is a whole third year of we don't need to talk about it.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   Let's not talk about it.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   It's like everyone's friends or tangents.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Yes.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Yeah, that's it. Jehovah's Witnesses and Friendster. That's about that's a good.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   So let's get back to Michael.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Email is Becky at ABC.com.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Carlos, did you download Michael Jackson stuff?
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   No, I listened to on Pandora and then when I went out to, you know, dance or whatever, it was everywhere.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   I couldn't escape it.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   But yeah, he was a big deal.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   When I grew up, I had the whole bubble card, bubble gum and stickers and, you know, the picture with him in the sweater on the wall.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   I mean, I had the whole deal until he went crazy a little bit.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   Yeah, Off the Wall was my first album.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   So I was fascinated by these stats.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   Check this.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   So Last FM says at its peak, 42,000 people were listening to Michael Jackson at one time.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Post death, Michael sold four hundred and twenty two thousand albums in the week.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   He was at 10K the last week before he was alive.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   So massive explosion.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   And half of those were downloaded albums.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   Two point three million downloaded singles.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   And prior to that, no one artist had ever downloaded more than a million singles in a week.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   So the guy's like five hundred million in debt.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   I'm thinking that he took a substantial chunk out of that this last week.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   And probably as the hype dies down, significant amounts will be ebbed away in his five hundred million debt.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Well, they think it will also be covered by the Beatles.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   He has the Beatles.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   What's it called?
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   The publishing rights.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Yeah. But it's a name for the for somebody on the chat room.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   That's probably worth about Sony's going to buy it probably for about four hundred.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   Well, they already own half of it.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Yeah. They get their first rights for the rest of it.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   And I mean, the whole thing about the cataloging, it was the Beatles catalog that Google thought that it was a malicious attack in terms of all the Michael Jackson Jackson traffic.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   It's unreal.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   Well, Adam Curry was on MSNBC.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   And we have a clip that will be on no agenda not to plug that.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   But I will.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   Where he apparently since they asked him a dumb question, he decided to go off the deep end and he started ranting about it.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   Why aren't they investigating this as a murder?
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   That was it. They kind of cut him off the show.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   And that was the end of it.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   They hung up on him.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   Adam has such great stories about Michael Jackson, too, about them putting him on a box when he did tosses to him and stuff.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   He has great stories about MTV in the 80s and the 90s.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Hi, Leo Laporte here.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Hello, guys. Hope you're having a good time sitting on my ball drinking my liquor and doing twit without me.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   I'm in China right now, but I had to just stop by and say hi and thank Audible for supporting the show.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   And besides, if I don't do the commercial, then Dvorak has to do something else in the commercials.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   If John had to do the commercials, he wouldn't get to get up, wander around, baste his meat, that kind of thing.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   So this is the portion of the show where John wanders and bastes.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   While I tell you how great Audible is, we've got a special deal, the Audible Platinum deal.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Now, I'm an Audible Platinum member.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   That means I get two books a month.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   Believe me, I use them.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   But even if you don't, the nice thing about Audible, you can collect your books and you never lose the right to play them or listen to them.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   Even if you lose them from your hard drive, you can always re-download them from Audible.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   So you're building a collection of wonderful audio material.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   I just love my Audible books. I've got over 300 books now.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   It's like my own little audio library.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Audible.com/twittoo is the place to go to get that Platinum deal.

[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   And there's so many wonderful things to choose from at Audible.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   I'm not going to make a recommendation today. I'm just going to let you go.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   I want to encourage you.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   One of the things about doing these recommendations is maybe I'm taking some of the initiative out from you going and discovering.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   Go to A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com and browse around.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   Pick a section of material that you like, whether it's sci-fi or self-help business, romance, erotica and sexuality.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   New releases. They also have new releases.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   They have New York Times bestsellers.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   It's the kind of place that I go at least every few weeks to look for new books.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   And that's when you're really going to be glad that you have Audible Platinum playing because one book is not just not enough.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   Audible A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com/twittoo.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Sign up today for the Platinum account.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   You get two books absolutely free, two credits, which in most cases means two books absolutely free.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   Audible.com/twittoo.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   We thank them for their support.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   And I see John wandering back into the studio.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   So I'll give it back to John C. Dvorak and the rest of the Twits.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   Have fun, guys. I'll see you in a couple of weeks.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   So anyway, back to tech. Becky?
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   What am I? Okay. All right.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   What have I got here?
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Becky's like my--you're going to be like my Ed McMahon.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   I know.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   Becky, what else you got here on the list?
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   Great. I'm on the death list again.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   What do you got on the list there, Becky?
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   I like this story.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   So coming out of an Australian blog, they're saying that Lenovo's making a bigger delete key and getting rid of the caps lock key on their new notepad.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   Well, I applaud them because the caps lock key is idiotic.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   The delete key doesn't go there, of course.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   It goes up in the other right-hand corner.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   But the delete key should be bigger because people pound it.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Right.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Pound, pound, pound.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   They're going to make delete and escape bigger because apparently the average user uses it something like 700 times per week or something like that.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   But I actually do use caps lock all the time to write scripts for broadcasts.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   But I don't think there's any other reason to use it unless you're just being a jerk, an instant message.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   Yeah, no, I agree. There's no reason for it.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   It used to be useful in certain kinds of programming languages that required all uppercase and some other things.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   But they left it on here.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   And every once in a while, you accidentally tag it.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   And the next thing you know, you're typing in all caps and people are yelling at you for screaming at them.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   Or your passwords are all jacked up and you don't notice because you're seeing an asterisk and you're not seeing it.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Right.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   And so many of us who are keyboarders, we don't touch type.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   So we're looking at the keyboard anyways.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   So my question is what -- the keyboard has been underrepresented in terms of innovation.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   So what would you change about the keyboard?
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   You know, there was a company --
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Oh, I think you'd probably go to the Dvorak keyboard.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Ma, ma.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   You know, there was a keyboard that these guys -- what was the name of this company?
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   Somebody -- well, it's not Gateway, but it sounded like Gateway.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   It was a company in the '80s.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   And they redid the keyboard specifically with the caps lock key moved.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   And they moved a couple of other things.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   And I always can remember that somebody would come up with it.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   But anyway, they -- and I still have one of those keyboards.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   And it has a big star, like one of the keys -- so when you do star dot star or anything like that,
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   it just was like Northgate.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   That's the name of them.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   And they had this really good keyboard.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   And they were selling like hotcakes.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   I mean, people would buy the Northgate keyboard.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   And then I don't know what happened.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   It just -- people just -- Northgate went out of business and nobody decided to keep up with the --
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   By the way, chat room, you guys are great.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   I can be like an idiot here.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   Well, I am anyway.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   But I'm just saying.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   So you just -- Hart's Northgate says Miss M.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   Nice.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   I would have definitely the dot com button like you have on the iPhone.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   That's great.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   I would get a huge mute button.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   Sort of that not safe for office video comes up and suddenly you realize it and find it.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   I would change print screen to screen grab.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   What's the point of print screen?
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   It doesn't even do anything.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   But it's -- why is it such a vestigial appendage?
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   Can't we get it to just say screen grab?
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   That's what it is.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   It would be a great idea.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   Nobody gets that.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   That's a good idea.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   Go ahead, Natalie.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   Well, they try with those email buttons that are just like a picture with a little envelope
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   or the back or the browser.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   And no one really uses those.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   Those never really took off.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   Right.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   But those would be a good idea if we can actually get them working with our operating system.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   I don't see why not.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   The chat room says get rid of insert, scroll lock.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   Scroll lock is another dog.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   I hate that one.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   So meanwhile the chat room is going nuts about making us want to talk about Compuserve dying.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   And so this story comes out, by the way.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   So I'm reading it and somebody said, oh, Compuserve.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   Compuserve, rest in peace.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   Somebody blogged it on one of my bloggers.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   Wait, hold on.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   Let me fire up my Mosaic browser.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   And I'm going, Compuserve was out of business.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   I thought they were out of business 10 years ago.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   Well, I ran down to Radio Shack and I bought internet in a box.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   And I got the Compuserve membership along with my Mosaic browser.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   I think it was 150 bucks.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Yeah, remember those old -- your address is always something like 71377.6543, something like that.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   And by the way, you notice that the funny thing about Compuserve people don't realize is that if you look at those numbers that were your Compuserve numbers, there was never an 8 or a 9 because they were using an octal computer.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   Seriously.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   So nothing could go above 7.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   What's an octal computer?
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Instead of a base 16 like we have hex, it's a base 8.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   Wow.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   So it's 0 to 7.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   The only number is allowable.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Wikipedia says Compuserve was founded in 1969.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   They're that old?
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   Well, it wasn't what it was.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   It wasn't an information utility in 1969.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   It was something else.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   It became an information utility after -- I think the source was the first one.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   So here's a little sidebar that was -- again, thank you, Chatroom, reminded me of this.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   So last time I was on, Leo was talking about how he uses newsgroups to get music downloads because nobody ever keeps an eye on them.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   And what happens this week?
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Well, thank you, Leo.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   All your newsgroup users can thank Leo for pointing this out.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   Apparently the R.I.W.A. was listening.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   The R.I.W.A. loves listening to Leo's show.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Good work, Leo.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   They've tried to clamp down on newsgroup transmission of the old newsgroup.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   Oh, they're suing them.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   They're suing them for transmission of the old download files, song files.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   So anyway.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   This is -- I won't get into it then because that opens up a huge can of worms for me because the music industry and digital and -- if you want to go down that road, let me know.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   Go down the road.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Give us what your pet peeve is besides your phone.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   My phone's awesome.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   It's right here.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   It's a Samsung for this.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   It's really good.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   Well, before you say this, I think we should say that it's not necessarily -- I mean, this sets a disturbing precedence, but Usenet was just -- this was lazy.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   You know, like they didn't provide evidence when they needed it in the trial.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Like they just didn't defend themselves representative of the whole music industry.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   They could have done a much better job.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   And that's their bad.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   They didn't have to lose this case.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   I mean, just in general, you put this together with that case that we know against the lady for what was it?
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   $1.92 million or a billion dollars or whatever.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   It's just them failing to evolve.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   And, you know, they're an old dinosaur that's dying out.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   Instead, they could be looking at new ways to deliver digital media to the fans who want it.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   And on top of that, the things that -- I'm actually starting a music site at some point in the end of the year.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Well, just a little side note there.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   And, you know, all the things that people want, like the t-shirts and the concert tickets and all this kind of stuff, the secondary stuff that people love from artists, that's what they should be focusing on.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   And that's what people are -- you know, that's what the artists are making money on anyhow.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   So instead of just keeping going over and over this whole, like, all right, don't get the songs, don't get the songs, it's just give away free songs, you know, promote the artists that you really care about, and then sell things in the back end.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   I mean, that's the model that it works in other countries.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   It works, you know, in Spain and other places that are trying it.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   So they're just totally off the mark.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   And I think everybody knows it.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   It's just how they, you know, move their whole old system over.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   And we should mention, by the way, it is a Usenet.com, not the giant Usenet as a whole.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Correct.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Got sued.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   So, Carlos, how do you feel about the ASCAP issue that now they're talking about charging more for ringtones because they're perceived of as a concert or a public broadcasting of song.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   Unbelievable.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   That thing's been funny a story all week.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   Which, I mean, my favorite part about this is --
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Who comes up with this?
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   So somebody said -- and how long did it take them to come to this conclusion? You've only had ringtones that are songs for the last, what, 15 years.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   So somebody is taking a -- obvious.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   Shouldn't use bad language.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Language.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Virgin ears.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   Poopoo.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   Somebody is in the crapper.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   Poopoo.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   And they dawned on him.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   Holy -- because their phone rang or somebody's phone rang.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   And they said, wait a minute, isn't that a Sly and the Family Stone tune?
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   They should be -- we should be charging a nickel for that.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   They said, holy crap.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   That's right.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   Holy poopoo.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   So the backstory is they're already charging for the ringtone as a distribution of the song.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   But now they're wanting to add extra costs --
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   Performance charges.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   Performance charges because it's broadcast publicly.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   And so the parallel that's being thrown down is, so do you have to pay extra if you're going to listen to music in a convertible?
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Do you have to -- or on a boombox?
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   And what's even more insane?
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   I mean, this is all insanity.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   We're talking about crazy talk right now.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   We are, but let's indulge this crazy talk.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   I know.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   We could talk for a long time.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   But the ringtones themselves are preposterous.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   They're like $3.49 and yet the actual song's $0.99.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   I mean, the model's already broken.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   Yeah, I still can't believe that that model exists.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   When ringstones started to become popular, I thought that that was going to be something that was popular for like two weeks with the teenagers and then gone.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   But people still buy the same song that they already own in their library just to ring on their phone.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   I really do not understand it.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   I feel like it's a complete generation gap.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   You know, I can tell you a little bit.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   It's like using a song for an ad, that using a song for an ad should get -- should cost more than just using a song, say, in a movie or something because it brands -- it brings the emotion of the song to the brand.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   Well, the same thing is true of a ringtone.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   It brings the emotion of a song to you.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   When people hear it, they associate that song with you and it becomes sort of like your personal soundtrack.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   And it's -- I just -- I get that.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   That makes sense to me.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   I don't like it, but I get it.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   It makes sense.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   But it is amazing how much traction it's had.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   But like --
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   Yeah, but it's a generational thing.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   It's not us.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   Like, would you pay 2.99 for a song that you paid 89 cents on Amazon for just so it can ring out loud when you're in public and people hear that you like "Bootylicious"?
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   If I had the time, yes.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   If I had the time, I'd do it.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   If you had the time, you could just make the thing into a ringtone yourself.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   Right.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   Yeah, Natalie, there's programs that can convert all these songs that you download into a ringtone.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   So, yeah, it's ridiculous.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Well, there is, but I mean, I live in Manhattan.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   And if someone on a bus or any kind of public area just starts blaring "Bootylicious" on their phone, I'm going to give them a dirty look.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   Like, I don't like that.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   And I just don't think that people appreciate it anymore.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Like, once it was kind of a cool thing.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   Like, I had the -- when I moved to LA, I put the 90210 theme song on my phone because it was --
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Natalie, what's a dirty look from you?
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   Yeah, I want to see this.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Show me your poopoo look.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   Ooh.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   That's the stink guy.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   That is the stink guy.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   Oh, you know what I'm talking about.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   That's what it looks like if you have "Bootylicious" on your phone next to me here in Manhattan.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Hey, Natalie, where are you in Manhattan?
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   I'm from New York, actually, originally.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   Where are you at?
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   I don't think I want to say that on --
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   Oh, right.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   But I'll instant message you.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   I have another personal question, though.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   What would your ringtone be now?
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   Now?
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   I don't know.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   Carlos?
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   I'm so against ringtones in general that I just can't come up with anything.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   Do you have a rooster?
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   What is -- you have to have a ring.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   John?
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   I have some crazy New Age thing that is in three dimensions on this Nokia that floats around the room.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   Oh, it's very spatial.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   And then it says the person's name.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   Oh.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   Yeah, actually, that's what I have, too.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   I was going to say, John, you want to call me or I'll go get an player?
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   It has like this lady's voice.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   I don't have my phones in the other room or somewhere.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   Oh, well.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   It has a lady's voice on the phone and it just says, "John Dvorak is calling."
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   Oh, celestial.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Very celestial.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Mine sounds more like somebody with some speech defect.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   It would be like --
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   Ooh, in the chat room, they're saying keyboard cat.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   I think keyboard cat would be a perfect ringtone.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   Ooh, what's that?
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   Sing it.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Keyboard cat?
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   Just a melody.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   No singing on the show.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   Don't we have any more news?
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   Let's go.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   Okay.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Yeah, let's get back to tech.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   Let's go to tech.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   You know, I have a Bing question.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   So, Natalie, you want to throw in some Bing stuff from this week in terms of the facts and figures?
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   Let's see.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   I don't have that.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   Just some of the like -- I know that there's --
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   Oh, the fact that Bing has gained a whole point in percentage.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   I don't have the numbers in front of me.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   That was the one I think that was most interesting is like the whole -- sorry, I didn't mean to put you on the --
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   No, that's okay.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   I just don't have the numbers in front of me.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   You go ahead and then I --
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   No, you just did it.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   It's like they gained a percentage point.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   Wow.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   They pulled from Yahoo and from Google.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   That's a poo-poo Bing, but isn't it -- remember, I think me and Dvorak were talking about this.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   It's just MSN Live Search, right?
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   I mean, it's got --
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   It's got Facebook.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.320]   I was thinking about this as I was walking along the street today, which makes me a loser,
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.680]   but I was thinking, why did Google come in and sweep in over Yahoo?
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:38.000]   And it's not because the users understood the algorithm was better for Google.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.800]   It's because it was cleaner, I think, that people really understood that it's not clogged
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:46.600]   up when I search for something like shoes, that they would get a simple result.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.240]   And I think that's what Bing is going after.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.240]   And I think they have it right.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.240]   I don't think --
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.740]   Now, that's interesting you should bring that up because Yahoo had a very simple interface
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:55.040]   for years when it was doing really well.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.200]   And it was the same thing.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.920]   It was just Yahoo and it had a little box.
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:00.920]   It didn't have that front page like they have now with a bunch of news and stuff.
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:01.920]   No, but it was a directory.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:02.920]   People perceived it as a directory.
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.680]   And it was also a directory, but even when it was becoming a search engine, normal search
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:06.680]   engine, it wasn't that complicated.
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:12.000]   Then they got the new -- all of a sudden, all the experts started to show up, these professional
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.480]   managers.
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:16.460]   And they had to start mucking with that simple interface.
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:21.400]   And I will predict right now, this is a little early, that this will happen eventually to
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.840]   Google.
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:23.840]   Somebody's going to come along --
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.920]   Well, it already is happening with my Google.
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.880]   And then if that becomes your default page, then you have all the same crap that you have
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.880]   on Yahoo with sports and news and all that stuff that I still --
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.000]   I agree with you, I think the simple thing, you got a box, you type in it, and then you
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.200]   get your list, and now you go on your way.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.440]   That's exactly why I never did that on my Google because I saw my friend use it and
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.440]   it's just full of stuff.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:43.440]   And yeah, that's not what I want.
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.440]   That's not what I want.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:47.800]   But it's interesting because now it's gone full circle that Yahoo -- I just don't think
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.720]   people perceive it as a search engine anymore.
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.600]   They perceive it as a news outlet.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.120]   So get these numbers.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:57.040]   Yahoo News, 4.3 million unique viewers in May.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.720]   CNN, 3.29.
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:04.200]   And their point is they are the number one news source in the world.
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:09.360]   They kill ABC, CBS, CNN, BBC --
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:15.480]   But at the same time, they're portals to those sites.
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:20.520]   But they also house that content in their own windows.
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:24.120]   So I mean, it's interesting that it's come full circle.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:28.960]   So we're returning to Yahoo as a news source, not perceiving it as a search.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:33.800]   Bing, I wonder if the average population even equates it with Microsoft.
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.400]   The name is genius.
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.520]   I think so too.
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:41.120]   My other thing about the name is it's a great verb.
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:42.600]   I binged it.
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:45.920]   I'm not saying I would use it, but it sounds like ping.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:46.920]   And that sounds sort of geeky.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.760]   They should have named it ping.
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:49.760]   That's not --
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.080]   Okay, but what's the past tense of being bong?
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.080]   I bonged it.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:55.440]   Oh, jeez, Louise.
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.440]   I'm not doing it.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:57.440]   I'm not using it.
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:58.440]   I know.
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:40:59.440]   You don't like the pictures.
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:00.440]   You will.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.440]   You might have said you wouldn't have Googled before.
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.440]   No, no.
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:05.240]   When Google became a verb, I thought it was a good idea.
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.240]   It made minor sense.
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.240]   And I remember when it happened.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.560]   Back in the olden days.
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:16.320]   The picture on Bing today is of some sort of a village in China.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:19.920]   No doubt Leo Laporte's reach extending.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.920]   I think he took that picture and he stitched it together with --
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:25.600]   I think that might be him right there in the top right corner in the yellow shirt.
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.600]   I see him.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:27.600]   I definitely see him.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:28.600]   That's Leo.
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:30.600]   Mm-hmm.
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:31.600]   Mm-hmm.
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:32.600]   A lot of bing.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:33.600]   A lot of bing.
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.600]   Chandler bong.
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:39.720]   It's Chanandler bong if we're really going to get technical.
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:42.040]   If we have friends trivia.
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:43.040]   Mm-hmm.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:45.240]   Hi, Leo Laporte here.
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:49.600]   We have some great sponsors I want to give them their due and GoToMyPC is one of them.
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:54.640]   GoToMyPC does that great remote access software that you're probably familiar with.
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.640]   We certainly talk about it a lot on all of our shows.
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:02.200]   GoToMyPC.com/twit is the place to go to try it free for 30 days.
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:07.720]   The thing about GoToMyPC that's so fantastic is it makes remote access easy.
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:10.320]   Remote access, if you haven't tried it, is fantastic.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.240]   It means you can try it right now.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:16.760]   GoToMyPC on your office computer or wherever you are right now and then wherever you go,
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.280]   you can get to that computer, you can get critical files.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:24.640]   You can use it as a safe way to surf as a VPN from places that are a little sketchy.
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.640]   It's absolutely 128-bit encrypted secure.
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:33.960]   It couldn't be an easier solution and yet it is the top as far as sophistication goes.
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.240]   I want you to try it right now.
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:36.240]   So here's how it works.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.240]   You open up a web browser.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.240]   This is the hardest part.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:44.560]   Right now you're going to type in GoToMyPC.com/twit, that was the hardest part, not that hard.
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:47.480]   You sign up for the free trial, click download.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:49.400]   It'll take two minutes to install the software.
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.680]   You do not have to configure the router.
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.520]   You do not have to go to the IT department.
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:54.520]   You don't have to do anything.
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:57.440]   It's just there and it's done.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.440]   That's it.
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:04.560]   Now the next time you're out and about, whether you're at home, whether you're at work, traveling,
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:09.400]   you just go to a web browser on a Mac, a PC, on Linux, any web browser, you go to GoToMyPC.com.
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:15.260]   You enter your secure username and password, click connect and there it is, your desktop.
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:19.400]   With all the programs, you can run any program, send and receive email, access any network
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.080]   resource, even drag and drop files.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.760]   It's so easy and so useful.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.240]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:28.680]   Go to GoToMyPC.com/twit.
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:32.200]   We now return you to This Week in Tech, already in progress.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.640]   All right, so what else we got, Becky?
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:37.920]   You are the laziest kid I have ever met.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.920]   What else we got on the agenda, Becky?
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:41.920]   I know.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:42.920]   I sent some stories too.
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:46.440]   Okay, Natalie, give us your story.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:51.800]   Let's talk about advertising on the Kindle because Amazon has filed for a patent to put
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:54.360]   advertisements in books.
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:58.680]   So if you're reading about something like China, then on maybe some little subset of
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:02.840]   the Kindle somewhere, you could get an advertisement for Chinese food, which is location aware
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:06.920]   because the Kindle has Sprint on it so it will know where you are.
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:08.200]   So what do you think about advertisements in your books?
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.200]   I don't like it.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.200]   I don't like the idea.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:13.640]   If I'm reading a book, I don't want the book telling me to go buy stuff unless I'm reading
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:14.640]   a catalog.
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:19.160]   Yeah, I mean, but the same thing can be said for email.
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:22.200]   The same thing can be said for search or reading anything online.
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:23.200]   We don't get to choose.
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.200]   So you apparently like the idea.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.920]   If it brings the price of the Kindle down, I would be okay with it because I still think
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.320]   the Kindle is too expensive.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.600]   The only difference is we're talking about competing with real books.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:37.200]   Real books is an experience that is being challenged by Kindle.
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:40.400]   But the minute you start putting ads in it, I'm taking out the experience and that's the
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:41.880]   reason I was reading a book.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:44.880]   I was reading a book because there was nothing else to distract me.
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:47.640]   It was a book and it was a great story or whatever I was reading.
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.680]   So I despise this idea.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.680]   Silly.
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:51.680]   Good for you.
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:56.880]   You have an opt-in model where you either buy the content full price or you get a great
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:00.360]   discount because it's going to be ad supported and that allows more people to have access
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:01.360]   to it.
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:04.280]   I mean, it's part of the greed because it should be cheaper anyhow.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.280]   Well, it is.
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:09.000]   That's the one thing I'll say is everybody disses the Kindle and the prices.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.920]   But I mean, I just got, this is so embarrassing, the entire Jane Austen collection for 99 cents
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:14.920]   on the Kindle.
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:15.920]   What?
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:18.320]   99 cents for the whole collection.
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:23.640]   I went back and got Roger Kipling's Kim, 99 cents.
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.000]   These are all public domain books.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.080]   They should be free.
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:32.160]   But the convenience of having them within seconds, I'll pay 99 cents for that.
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:36.520]   So you don't have to convert it or email it to your Kindle account?
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:37.520]   I do that too.
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:38.520]   Yeah.
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:39.520]   Yeah, I'm totally okay with that.
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:42.160]   I agree with Web, whatever is Web 89.
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.880]   99 cents is too much.
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:45.560]   The guy's right.
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:50.960]   But wait, I want to ask Carlos, he said that I'm only reading a book because nothing else
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:51.960]   is available.
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:54.960]   Like books are just the last resort to entertain.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:55.960]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:56.960]   You misunderstood.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:57.960]   I'd buy that.
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:03.080]   No, I meant like if I want to read a book, if I want to read a book that I don't want
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:06.800]   anything else around, you know, I don't want the other experiences.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:10.640]   There's lots of things to obviously to do and to watch and see.
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:15.200]   I just mean, if I have a book, I want that to be the only experience that I'm having.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.200]   I don't want to be distracted.
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.480]   You want it to have your undivided attention.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.480]   Yeah, totally.
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:23.200]   I mean, and plus my attention's all over the place.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.200]   It's divided.
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.200]   We're noticing.
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:30.680]   Well, but that is so true that for those of us who are way multitasking, that the discipline
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:33.600]   of going back to a book is one of the few things that holds true.
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:37.240]   I wonder if the kids nowadays will feel that way.
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:40.480]   No, maybe not.
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:41.480]   I don't know.
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.480]   I don't know.
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:47.360]   The problem is, yeah, he's right, though, if you're like reading a book, for instance,
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:51.920]   when I read Memoirs of a Geisha, I was starving for sushi the whole time.
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:55.760]   And so if I was reading that book and they go for sushi and then I'm like, there's an
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:56.760]   ad for sushi.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:57.800]   I'm like, yeah, I want that.
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:01.320]   And then I put the book down and I'm eating my sushi and then I don't go back later on
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:02.320]   UPS rotten.
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:03.320]   Yeah, right.
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:08.920]   So and then I have food poisoning and then I'm not for this idea now that you put it
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:09.920]   that way.
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:12.400]   So OK, so Becky, what else we got?
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:14.600]   Did you read the New York Times article I sent you?
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:19.040]   I know I sent it to you late, but I just wanted to kind of brief it about the new press, the
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.280]   new PR in Silicon Valley.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:25.280]   So I wanted to throw this out there because there's this article about how with blogs
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:30.320]   and with Twittering, with Facebook, that and especially, I think, with podcasts and influential
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:39.040]   sites like and Gadget and CNET and GDGT, that PR is a totally different game than it used
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:43.160]   to be back in the day of Silicon Valley.
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:48.000]   And I just kind of wanted to get your take on what was the PR machine when you first
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.960]   started in this business and what it was.
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:55.120]   When I was a kid, it wasn't what it was today.
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:48:01.280]   I remember back when PR wasn't PR, it was P.S.
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:05.520]   Dorek loves it when I date him, but come on.
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:07.520]   She hasn't dated me for years.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:16.040]   Spinning the web PR in Silicon Valley, an article by Claire Kane Miller, if that is indeed her
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.040]   real name.
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:22.800]   Oh, and it starts off with Brooke, Brooke Hammerling as the lead word in the whole thing.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.280]   Brooke, congratulations.
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.280]   Good work.
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:26.280]   So Brooke wrote this.
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:29.240]   No, but this was good PR for Brooke.
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:32.400]   Yeah, Brooke wrote this.
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.720]   Let me synopsize for you as you sort of roll through it.
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:36.040]   But basically what they're saying is.
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.040]   She's got her name on the side.
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.040]   Wait a minute.
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.040]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.040]   She's got you got to see this thing.
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:41.040]   You will have a link.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.040]   No, it won't.
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:43.040]   Whatever.
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:44.840]   Brooke Hammerling starts off in the first graph.
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:46.880]   Brooke Hammerling, publicist and blah, blah, blah.
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:51.280]   Then the second graph, Ms. Hammerling, she gets her name again in the first word of the
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:52.280]   it's unbelievable.
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:57.280]   This is like typical New York Times piece of graph.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:01.400]   On the second page, it calls her a doyen of modern day PR.
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:02.400]   She's got her name again.
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:08.200]   Like the woman who's the most respected person in her field, like it's a full on PR.
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:11.320]   We love you, Brooke, but doyen, please.
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:12.320]   Yeah, right.
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:18.520]   Well, the point is, is that in the past, PR was about writing a great press release and
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.400]   really getting it out to the right people.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:24.120]   And now that it's all about relationships and that everybody's friends.
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:28.000]   And I just think this is funny because John is friends with no one and I'm friends with
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   no one.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   I'm friends with Brooke.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   Oh, I think.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   So am I.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   We all know Brooke.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:39.120]   Well, the thing is, we all, I'm going to move my camera because the sun's going down.
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:41.840]   The thing is, we can see right through this though as journalists.
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:45.600]   I know Brooke and I'm friends with her and I'm happy to be, but new PR people who come
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:50.400]   in and then try and just kind of be your friend in this way in order for you to get them to
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:51.520]   cover your companies.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:52.520]   We can see through that.
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:55.640]   I'm not sure this is really the new way of PR.
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:59.560]   Most of the time, it just annoys me when you falsify a friendship that's not preexisting.
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:03.800]   Now, Becky, I'll tell you, I don't think it's changed that much.
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:10.320]   I think what's changed is that they don't have, except for Walt and a few, one or two
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:12.840]   others, they don't have the outlets anymore.
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:16.120]   They used to have a bunch of computer magazines and a whole bunch of people they could rely
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:17.120]   on to write stuff up.
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:20.880]   And there were computer columnists and all the newspapers across the entire country.
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.480]   And they could do a lot of stuff.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:25.000]   Now they got a few bloggers.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   They got Walt.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.920]   They got Natalie, you to some extent.
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:31.760]   But again, it's not the same as, sorry about that.
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:32.760]   No way has, Becky.
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:37.320]   It's not the same as having a million press releases out and get action.
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:39.280]   Now you do have to be friends.
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:42.760]   If these people don't know you personally, you're not even going to take their call knowing
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:43.760]   you.
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:44.760]   I mean, you won't take my call.
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:45.760]   That's so untrue.
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:49.760]   No, I'm talking to, what's her name over here?
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:54.840]   But I mean, I think what's interesting is that it's become such a layered animal that in the
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:56.400]   past, like you said, it was very clear.
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:51:02.280]   You had newspapers, you had TV, you had local, you had national, and you had magazines.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:06.400]   And now it's like this filtered system where you have to start at these really sort of
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:08.520]   niche boutique types of websites.
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:09.520]   I think it's impossible.
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.080]   I think the business is shot.
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.280]   I think the PR business is a mess.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.280]   I do too.
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:15.280]   I think it's a wreck.
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:21.040]   I noticed, you know, working for a major news outlet, what we put on ABC that's technology
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:26.800]   related, we get it about 75% right in terms of what we pay attention to.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:30.240]   But we disproportionately pay attention to Google.
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:34.160]   We diss Microsoft, we diss Yahoo because it's not as cool.
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:38.760]   We're obsessed with new, but we don't go back and check in when things have been improved,
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:42.120]   which is second gen, third gen products.
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:48.520]   I just feel like it's sort of, it's like high school all over again and we're only dating
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:52.600]   the pretty girls and not looking at the substance.
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:56.280]   And it bugs me because PR companies don't help.
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:59.400]   And I know for myself, I need that help.
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:05.560]   You know, I would love to have better help determining getting through all the mess.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:10.960]   But are you saying that companies are hiring PR people based on their looks?
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:12.880]   And so it's, I mean, because that does seem to be true.
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:13.880]   If you go to any...
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:14.880]   That's always been true.
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:16.320]   I don't think that's what the point is.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:19.360]   Yeah, I am, I'd have noticed that trend, but it's more that...
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:20.360]   It's not a trend.
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:21.360]   It's not a trend.
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:24.480]   I'm talking about the products themselves that we get obsessed with what's sexy and
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:31.640]   new and at a national level looking at products and we don't dig in and see the meat of the
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:35.720]   stuff that's really, really effective and the products that are really life-changing
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:38.800]   as opposed to the products that are just really sexy.
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:43.720]   And I think PR is part of the problem, but the whole machine seems broken to me.
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:46.520]   I think the machine is broken completely.
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:48.480]   I'm going to have to look...
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:49.480]   I'm looking at this article.
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:51.480]   This is the worst article I've ever read.
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:53.640]   I'm telling you, because it just rambles.
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:54.960]   It doesn't really say anything.
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:56.920]   It's just blabla, blabla, blabla.
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:59.040]   You know, hammerling, hammerling, hammerling.
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:02.080]   I mean, you have good work on her getting herself a bunch of publicity.
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:03.080]   It's not going to help.
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:06.920]   But I mean, but that's the whole thing is the story is about all of her personal relationships
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:09.720]   and all the parties she throws and the expensive dinners and I personally...
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.200]   I don't get invited to any of these things.
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.200]   Hey, what's the deal?
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.200]   You do...
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.200]   You do too.
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.840]   You're always complaining that you don't, but you do.
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:17.840]   What?
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:18.840]   Yes.
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:19.960]   This is a myth.
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:20.960]   You are so full of it.
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:21.960]   It is a myth.
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:24.120]   I haven't seen many parties and I'm at all of them.
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.000]   So, you know, he's not there.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   The work is missing.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   But who...
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.680]   Natalie, come on, you go to these parties.
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:31.120]   Who's there?
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:32.120]   Not me.
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:34.960]   You know, it's the PR people talking to the PR people.
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:40.160]   In the ones in New York, I'll go and stop and have some free crab cakes or whatever.
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:44.600]   And then I'll leave before I can get taken a photo of by Brian Solis, which, you know,
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:48.520]   I like Brian Solis, but I don't want to be photographed and put on his blog so that it
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:51.320]   looks like he has this relationship in which he can...
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:53.960]   And I'm not saying anything bad about Brian and I hope I don't make it on his blog for
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:57.480]   saying this, but you know, like I'll see myself.
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:58.480]   It's sort of...
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:05.200]   He's creating this nano story that says that he knows the influencers, but I'm not sure
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.600]   that that really gets his clients covered.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:08.600]   I don't know.
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:12.000]   I do know Brian and I do know Brooke and I like them.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:17.440]   But for instance, I had someone pitch me once this ATM technology story and they're like,
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:20.760]   you know, when you're drunk in the mission at 4 a.m. and you're looking for an ATM, this
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:21.840]   is a product that can help you.
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:24.760]   And I was like, I don't think you can talk to me that way.
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:27.120]   We don't have a pre-existing relationship.
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:34.120]   So I'm not exactly sure how that translates into ROI.
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:35.760]   Drunk in the mission at 4 a.m.?
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:40.200]   Yeah, don't you think that's an inappropriate pitch for someone who's never talked to you?
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:41.200]   No, I think it's a brain dead pitch.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:43.440]   I don't know how inappropriate it is.
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:48.120]   For one thing, since you live in New York, that's a long way to go to get drunk.
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.120]   So I think...
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.600]   Well, this is when I was still in the Bay Area.
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:51.600]   Okay.
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:52.600]   Wow.
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:53.600]   You didn't step on my joke there.
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:54.600]   Come on.
[00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:55.600]   So anyway, okay.
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:59.600]   So the point of this little diatribe is what, Becky?
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:01.600]   Well, John.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:02.600]   PR sucks.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:03.600]   No.
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:04.600]   I just think the machine...
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:06.320]   I just am curious as to...
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:07.800]   It's always been about relationships.
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:13.320]   I mean, and as someone who's trying to make good decisions, we need as much help as we
[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:16.000]   can getting the newest stuff under our eyes under NDA.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.760]   You should probably have the phone ringing off the hook.
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:20.700]   You're on television, right?
[00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:22.520]   Big network television.
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:26.640]   I am fascinated by what makes it across my email and what doesn't.
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.800]   Probably a lot of stuff that you must be stunned.
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:29.800]   This would be my guess.
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:34.080]   And I would say the same for you, Natalie, because you're on network television.
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:35.280]   This is big audiences.
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:39.960]   This is not like 25 people and their dog.
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:41.300]   This is big audiences.
[00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:47.140]   You must be stunned, I'm guessing, by the amount of stuff you don't hear about.
[00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:48.240]   That is my truth.
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:50.320]   I am shocked when I don't hear about something.
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:51.880]   And I don't hear about...
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:52.880]   Because it's all going to...
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:53.880]   You don't hear probably about most.
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:54.880]   It goes to Arrington.
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:57.720]   And Gadget, and Gizmodo, and Arrington, and Scobel.
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:00.080]   And who are just talking to each other.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:01.080]   Yeah.
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:05.600]   And as I said, I can talk about toothpaste coupons and it's the number four search term
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:06.900]   on Google.
[00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:09.600]   But I haven't heard about something new coming in.
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:10.840]   And I don't get to put it on TV.
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:12.360]   It's crazy how weird this is.
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:15.800]   Well, I've mentioned this to Leo because Leo has this show here that people are out there
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:16.800]   listening to.
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.080]   This happens to have a huge impact.
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:19.780]   It's got a big following of people.
[00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:23.320]   And he should be getting pitched on everything.
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:26.900]   But I can't use him as a very good example because he refuses to answer email and he doesn't
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:27.900]   take phone calls.
[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:28.900]   And so I don't know.
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:32.220]   But that's one of the things I'm saying is that the people who actually reach out and
[00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:38.240]   influence the most users, quantity, we don't play the game.
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:39.240]   We don't go to the parties.
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:40.240]   I don't...
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:41.480]   I mean, it's just weird.
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:43.440]   It just seems like a circle to me.
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:46.240]   And when you're not in the circle, it's just weird.
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:47.240]   I 100% agree.
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:49.040]   I 100% agree with you.
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:52.320]   I think the wrong people are going to these parties and communication is not happening
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:53.360]   with the right people.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:58.880]   And by the way, if nobody's out there's noticed, and I also put this on the head of the internet,
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:03.160]   the people that don't advertise much anymore, the industry is in the toilet.
[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:07.360]   So all they're doing is going to parties and talking to each other.
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:10.680]   And one guy talks to the other guy and they had the little, you know, the circle of bloggers
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:13.680]   that all read each other's blog, but it doesn't really get any further.
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:18.040]   And the amount of influence is only amongst the insiders and it's like a click.
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:22.760]   And then the entire industry is in the tank and everybody wonders why?
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:23.760]   Well...
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:24.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:28.760]   John, it's very much like the music industry too, because I do music as well.
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:33.280]   And a lot of these bands, I come from the Northwest, I just came out from Seattle, and they all
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:37.120]   kind of like pat each other on the back and go to each other's shows, but they're not
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.640]   doing anything outside of that state, right?
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:40.840]   So it's the same type of mentality.
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:44.920]   I mean, these guys are just talking with each other and again, patting each other on the
[00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:48.640]   back, but they're not communicating, evolving and learning how to grow the business in the
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:49.640]   right directions.
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:50.640]   Right.
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:55.160]   It tends to be incestuous and just like I said, there's no ROI there.
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:58.360]   And one of the things that I've always complained about, and especially in this industry, which
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:03.040]   is one of the reasons I don't go to conferences for a lot of different reasons, I go to some.
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:05.720]   But generally speaking, I don't because you can get as much as...
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:08.940]   So they're over covered and you can get the information other ways.
[00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:13.400]   But it's this group think mentality that really gets me the most, which is that these one
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:15.000]   guy says something...
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.640]   I say to...
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:19.800]   Guy A talks to Guy B and says, "This is happening."
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:22.200]   And then he talks to Guy C and says, "This is happening."
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:25.220]   Then B and C talk to each other and they both agree, "Yeah, it must be happening because
[00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:27.040]   you heard about it and I heard about it."
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:29.440]   And I understand what's his name's talking about it.
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:33.960]   And the next thing you know, it's in the Wall Street Journal that's happening when the normal
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:34.960]   people go, "What?
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:35.960]   This isn't happening."
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:39.360]   But Dvorak, I should bring you with me to the conferences because that's why I go to
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:44.680]   them is because I feel like I stand out because those people are all doing that kind of incestual
[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:45.680]   thing.
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:48.640]   And when I'm there, I just feel like, "Ooh, what's that guy?
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:51.080]   He doesn't seem to be part of our group."
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:53.040]   And I think you can make a lot of headway that way.
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:54.920]   I have a funny story about that.
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:58.480]   When I first started at PC Magazine, John was like, "Natalie, let's go to the Intel
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:00.920]   Dual Core press conference."
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:05.000]   And so the two of us went and he's like, "The food's good here, but don't talk to anyone."
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.800]   And we sat there and they made a huge deal about Dual Core and how this is the future
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:13.120]   of computing and you just wait for Quad Core and then Tera computing and you just hold
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.360]   on to your horses.
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:17.040]   And John goes, "There's going to be a flaw in this chip in two weeks."
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:18.040]   Mark my words.
[00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:20.040]   "Get some crab cakes and let's go."
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:21.040]   Remember?
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:22.040]   Yeah, pretty much.
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:26.480]   I live and you're there, you're working, you're typing up your story.
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:27.480]   Get your free lunch.
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:31.280]   I know I had that little Lenovo, that PC mag and I was like, "I got a file story."
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.280]   He's like, "No, you don't.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:33.680]   Get your food and let's get out of here.
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:34.680]   Don't talk to anyone."
[00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:38.080]   Hey, Dvorak, that brings me to a good segue.
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:39.400]   She was talking about computers.
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:42.080]   I just put a link in the IRC.
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:44.800]   You ever heard about the quantum computer story that I sent over?
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:49.800]   I haven't heard about it, but these quantum computer stories, they're always cropping up.
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:50.800]   I know.
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:51.800]   Well, they just did a couple...
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:52.800]   I haven't heard about it now.
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:53.800]   Okay.
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:58.800]   There's a couple new developments, but essentially, without getting into it too much, they're
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:03.120]   coming up with how to store data in these things called qubits, which is basically like
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:07.600]   when you talk about quantum physics, you talk about probability clouds.
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:11.480]   Everything is a probability when you get down to a small level, which again is a very long
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:12.560]   discussion.
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:16.720]   Them coming up with these actual qubits allows them to store data.
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:21.280]   Computers use data as ones and zeros, and that's how we see everything displayed.
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:25.840]   These qubits can actually hold one and a zero at the same time, which is ridiculous, which
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:31.360]   means they can do computation at almost zero time, like nanoseconds.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:38.800]   It can do computation of a huge level, creating potentially unlimited energy, black holes
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.640]   and crazy business like that.
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:46.560]   But they're not that close yet, but the fact is that they got these qubits to work and
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:50.320]   actually hold information as one and a zero at the same time.
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.040]   And so it's a big deal.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:54.320]   Okay, next story.
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.320]   Next story.
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.320]   Oh man.
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:00.280]   It's really important to the face of the computers though.
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:02.280]   How this story goes, goes computers.
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:07.000]   Yeah, well maybe, although I'm actually more of the opinion that we're going to go organic.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   What?
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   That's what I said.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   And I used to play Q*bert all the time.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   Q*bert.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   Ethanol.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   That's called quantum physics computer.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.480]   See, Dvorak ignores the future, says some guy.
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:24.320]   I feel the air just rushing from my ear.
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.160]   That's the last time I bring up quantum computers ever.
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:29.000]   I'll go talk with quantum computers in the chat.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   That hurts.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.200]   John, I will just blatantly rush into, tell me your economic-
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:36.200]   Meet computing.
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:39.640]   Tell me your economic theory for tech recovery Q4.
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:43.620]   Oh, well I think it's possible that we're going to probably see recovery in Q4.
[01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:45.920]   You can read my articles in MarketWatch.
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:48.280]   I've long since forgot the details.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.280]   I Twittered it actually.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.280]   I re-Tweeted it.
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.280]   Yes you did.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:52.280]   Thank you very much by the way.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.680]   I got a lot of attention because people just think you're the best.
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:56.880]   Oh well, thank you and ditto.
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:00.400]   And I thought that it was really interesting and then a few days later-
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:03.400]   No ditto to you.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.400]   What?
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:05.400]   No you're the best.
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.400]   No you are the best.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:13.320]   That's John, you say something nice to him and within seconds you go, "Screw you!"
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:19.360]   But I believe Forrester came out with estimates the same, exactly what you said just two days
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:22.920]   later that Q4 looks to be a turnaround for the tech sector.
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:28.240]   I got some email on that and thinking that, well maybe some guy argued that the budgets
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.480]   are done and you can't do that kind of thing.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.840]   Things can't change that rapidly.
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:37.080]   But most budgets, a lot of corporate budgets are really, they're over in Q2.
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:38.640]   They don't end at the end of this year.
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.640]   They end at other spots.
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:43.920]   A lot of them end in the end of the second quarter of this year.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:47.720]   And the third, I mean everybody's, their calendar years are all every which way.
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:49.960]   So I didn't buy that.
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:53.640]   But is this you being contrarian because everyone else is so doom and gloom?
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:54.640]   No it's not it.
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:58.700]   It's because I have these theories about cycles and it seems to me for things to really work
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:04.240]   out and I also think the tech sector leads the rest of the economy that it has to happen
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:06.400]   first and I'm convinced of that.
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:10.200]   And it will be determined by looking at the semiconductors.
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:14.120]   Can you throw out stochastics in this too because I really get excited when you talk about that.
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.120]   Stochastics.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:19.480]   Once was used, I remember when stochastics was the main way people were picking stocks.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:20.480]   That was you.
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:21.480]   It was like that conversation.
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:23.480]   It's going to be plastics.
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:24.600]   You had this conversation with me.
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:25.600]   It's going to be stochastics.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:26.600]   I never said stochastics.
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:27.600]   You did.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:28.680]   I never used the word.
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.120]   I can tell you the bar where you said it.
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:32.120]   Are you kidding me?
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.720]   I think you were imagining you being there.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:35.720]   Your imaginary friend.
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:36.720]   Hey, DeVorek, back to the tech story.
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.720]   I would like a regression analysis.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.720]   Yeah, okay.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:40.720]   Carlos, what else you got?
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:41.720]   Back to the tech story.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:42.720]   Here you go.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.720]   There's one another one in REC chat.
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:44.720]   Yeah, I see it.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:49.000]   Just what do you think about that 11.4% share to Firefox, Safari and Chrome Internet Explorer
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   losing.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.280]   You're checking up on this story.
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:57.600]   You think that Internet Explorer is losing a lot of market and the version, what is it?
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.600]   Version 25.
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:03:59.600]   What is the one they're at now?
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.600]   11.10.
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:01.600]   I don't know what it is.
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:02.600]   Oh, the bar version.
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:03.600]   Number 18, IE8.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.400]   I don't know what it is.
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:14.080]   But anyway, the apparently is a piece of crap and it looks like, you know, I use on the
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:19.760]   Macintosh, I'm using a Mac, I use Safari and it's actually quite good.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.800]   And I use the Firefox most of the time now.
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:23.800]   Yeah, I'm using the Firefox 3.5.
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:28.440]   And I rarely use IE8 because it's always so susceptible to viruses and craziness.
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:33.560]   Yeah, I'm just wondering because like, you know, we always whenever we talk about browsers,
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:38.040]   we always go, OK, well, just so you know, Internet Explorer is the leading one in the world and
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.880]   we have to program for it.
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:41.600]   But now it looks like maybe the tide is turning.
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.600]   I don't know.
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:43.600]   Maybe it's finally getting what it deserves.
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:51.800]   Well, looking at the global stats thing that was actually run in TechCrunch on today shows
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:56.840]   that IE is about ready to fall beneath Firefox 3.
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:58.520]   Firefox, yeah.
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.640]   I thought Brian Cooley actually made a really interesting point.
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:04.200]   This is the first time in years he's been simultaneously using three browsers.
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.760]   And I think that's much more common.
[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:13.620]   People are kind of all over the map in terms of it doesn't seem like it has to be an exclusive
[01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:18.240]   thing for a much larger segment of the population.
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:24.640]   Well I use I don't use IE hardly ever except when something automatically opens it and
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:25.640]   I'm stuck.
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:29.440]   I mean, I could obviously cut and paste and go to something else, but I figure why not.
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:31.560]   And I do use Safari for printing though.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:34.720]   I think Safari's got a better algorithm for printing web pages.
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.840]   Do you guys use bookmarks?
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:37.840]   No.
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:39.520]   I'm like so not a bookmark user.
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:42.920]   I use lots of bookmarks and I have so many of them that I can't find anything.
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:43.920]   That's my point.
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:45.600]   This is a great point to bring up.
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:46.600]   I love bookmarks.
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:50.520]   I mean, I have so much stuff that I work on tech and tech stories and stuff like that.
[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:52.640]   But I still need something that's awesome.
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:57.600]   Some sort of flash even like little sphere that has all my bookmark design and can get
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.600]   to them quickly because yeah, I can't find anything.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:00.840]   But don't you just Google it then?
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:02.920]   I mean, isn't it so much faster to Google something?
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:07.120]   Yeah, but the problem is you have a bookmark you made from three years ago on some website
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:12.440]   that is now so buried in Google you'll never find it again.
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.440]   That's why you tag it.
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:14.880]   I use delicious for that kind of thing.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:20.480]   But then I think when Google announced Chrome, they said something like 75% of the websites
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:23.880]   we go to on the internet are things that we've been to before.
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:27.040]   And that's why they have that little dashboard when you open a brand new page in the same
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.560]   way that Opera does.
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:31.120]   And with that, what do I need bookmarks for?
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:32.720]   Yeah, I use that too, Natalie.
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:36.400]   And I've used it since Opera had a long time ago, but it's still not done enough.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:40.680]   I mean, I have like, I have like folders full of stuff, you know, whether it be for the
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:42.560]   game show I do or the text show I do.
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:45.400]   And it's just it's impossible to navigate all of it.
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.400]   I don't know what to do.
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:49.200]   I think if you use an RSS reader, then you don't need bookmarks.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.960]   And I don't think most people use both.
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:54.160]   Yeah, I just I just can't keep my bookmarks organized.
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:56.280]   What do you mean by that?
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:07:00.160]   I have a website I found that I just wanted to go back to once in a while because it does
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:03.880]   have something information or a site I can buy something from.
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:05.880]   What has RSS got to do with it?
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:08.080]   Well, I don't bookmark.
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:10.640]   I mean, you can RSS things.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:13.080]   What has RSS got to do with it?
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.200]   I think that's my new ringtone.
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:19.840]   That's a ringtone if I ever heard one.
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:25.120]   If I want to check back on a site that I use often, which I'll admit is endless.com.
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:27.000]   I go there almost every day.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   Then I will RSS it.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.640]   What site is this you go to every day?
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.160]   I'm being a total girl right now.
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:35.240]   Endless is Amazon's shoe page.
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:36.240]   It's fantastic.
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:39.640]   You know, something like that.
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:40.760]   I can RSS it.
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:42.480]   For news, I can RSS it.
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:46.400]   There's nothing that I need to revisit every day and I actually need to see the page.
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:49.320]   Yeah, no, I'm not talking about using it for that purpose.
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:50.680]   Yeah, that RSS would make sense.
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:53.120]   I'm talking about the you see this page.
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:58.800]   You know, I want to buy this Lamborghini and I know that I'll be able to afford it someday.
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.960]   And I know this dealer's got the best prices there in Florida.
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:02.960]   Why wouldn't they?
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.200]   You're obscurity man.
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.920]   You trade in obscurity.
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:11.040]   So I would bookmark it saying five years from now, I hope to go back to this page.
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:13.840]   And you know, and I know I'm not going to be able to Google it because you know, there
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.920]   probably be under indictment by then, let's say.
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.880]   But whatever the case is, I want to still have the page available to me, but I'm not
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:19.880]   going to RSS it.
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:20.880]   That's for sure.
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:23.920]   And Natalie, I gave you a YouTube video about shoes.
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:24.920]   Wow.
[01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:25.920]   Thank you.
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:26.920]   Oh, is it Becky?
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:27.920]   Shoes.
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:28.920]   You have a lot of shoes, Natalie.
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:29.920]   So and so loves shoes.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:30.920]   What's her name?
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:31.920]   Becky loves shoes.
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:32.920]   Is it Becky?
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:33.920]   No, it's just a funny comedian.
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:34.920]   It's really awesome.
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:35.920]   Let's get some shoes.
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:36.920]   Kelly?
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:37.920]   Kelly.
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:38.920]   Kelly loves shoes.
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:39.920]   Kelly loves shoes.
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:40.920]   Oh my God.
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:41.920]   Chicks and shoes.
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:42.920]   You have a lot of shoes, Natalie.
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:43.920]   Yeah, I do.
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.840]   And that's the one way in which I'm a total girl.
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:47.840]   Well, how many pairs?
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:48.840]   Yeah, there we go.
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.840]   Let's get some shoes.
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:52.840]   Shoe.
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:53.840]   Ow.
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.840]   That's one of my favorite things ever.
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:57.840]   Mine too.
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:00.840]   This reminds me of my pod show days.
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:03.840]   What is it with chicks and shoes?
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:04.840]   I don't get it.
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:05.840]   Yeah.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:06.840]   What's the dude equivalent?
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:07.840]   There's none.
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:08.840]   There is none.
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:09.840]   Baseball mitts.
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:10.840]   Video games.
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:11.840]   Video games for me.
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:12.840]   Maybe flat screens.
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:13.840]   Maybe.
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:14.840]   I get that.
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:15.840]   Shut up.
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:17.520]   Can someone please explain this pirate base story to me?
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:18.520]   What is the business model?
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:20.320]   Let's talk about pirate base.
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:22.520]   What is the business model?
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.520]   Napster.
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.040]   They're exactly like Napster.
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:27.240]   I don't know why they didn't learn their lesson.
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:31.880]   They're thinking that if you upload a song and then I download that song, then you can
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:32.920]   get a portion of that.
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:37.200]   And I suspect that the RAAA is going to have a problem with this.
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:40.720]   But I think at first I thought they were just buying the name Pirate Bay.
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:46.600]   So the back story is Pirate Bay has been sold to a Stockholm software developer, internet
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:47.880]   gaming type franchiser.
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:49.560]   He bought the brand.
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:50.560]   Right.
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:51.560]   60...
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:53.600]   What is this number here?
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:55.080]   60 million Krona.
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.800]   7.8 million dollars.
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:57.800]   What?
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:58.800]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:09:59.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:00.800]   It's going to be Napster all over again.
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:03.040]   I mean, Napster is not Napster, right?
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.680]   Napster was something that created a new way of dealing with music.
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:06.680]   It's a brand.
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:07.680]   It's a brand name.
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:08.680]   Yeah, it's just a brand.
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:10.480]   So whatever they do with it, it's not Pirate Bay.
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:12.720]   So it doesn't, you know, it's something else.
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.040]   It's some sort of business.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.320]   And I don't have any real faith in it yet.
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:18.320]   I want to hear.
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.320]   Okay.
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:21.320]   So it's so odd.
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:22.320]   It really is.
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:23.680]   So we're out of stories.
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:24.680]   Is that what you're telling me?
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:25.680]   Dvorak, bring it to the table.
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:26.680]   What do you got?
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:27.680]   Come on.
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:28.680]   I got more.
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:29.680]   No, I have stories.
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:32.640]   Do you want to talk about the over heating iPhone or the...
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:33.640]   Overeating iPhone.
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:34.640]   The overeating iPhone, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:37.920]   Is that when you go to a foreign country and your bill is like 60 grand?
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:38.920]   I hate that.
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:39.920]   Yeah.
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:41.920]   Well, that happened to Adam Savage, of course.
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:42.920]   Yeah, that was interesting.
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:43.920]   Or what about the...
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:46.160]   Yeah, he walked away.
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:52.320]   I think $11,000 bill because he's using his unlimited iPhone in Canada where it's apparently
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:54.280]   not unlimited there, but who knew?
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:11:00.320]   Twittered about it and then got AT&T to take the bill back due to his...
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:01.560]   You see, that's what you need to do.
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:08.720]   You need to play the same card that the Mythbuster guy did to get AT&T to fold and hook you up
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:12.960]   with the cheaper iPhone.
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:19.480]   So the latest in terms of the Apple iPhone overheating, besides the fact that some guy
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:24.600]   got burnt, is now they're blaming it according to at least one story on global warming.
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:27.520]   Anybody get to catch this?
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:29.240]   It's on the blog, by the way, if you want to look at it.
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:30.240]   Well, they said in temperatures of 110 degrees or something.
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.360]   Well, apparently it will come out with a...
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:35.800]   The screen will flash a little warning and say, "Hey, you're somewhere that's a little
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:36.800]   too hot.
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:37.800]   The iPhone can't take this."
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:42.360]   But I think we should remember that it has a processor that used to live inside a computer.
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:44.640]   So I don't know.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.640]   Just keep it away from your junk.
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:47.640]   What?
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:48.640]   Nice.
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:51.640]   The old high tech vasectomy.
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:55.800]   What kind of New York argot are you speaking?
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:56.800]   So...
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:59.480]   Hey, Dwork, I got a story too.
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.480]   All right.
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:03.120]   Close and near to our hearts, Ziff Davis.
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.320]   Here, I'll see it.
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.480]   EGM was a video game magazine.
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:11.680]   Yeah, I am a nerd and deal with it.
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:14.640]   And so EGM went under.
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:16.520]   You've probably heard about that.
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:18.200]   And it was a Ziff Davis property.
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:23.800]   Well, I guess they just gave the rights back to the original owner, Steve Harris.
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:26.480]   So this is interesting because everybody loved that magazine.
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:30.800]   I read it since I was like 12.
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.320]   And a lot of people lost their jobs because of this magazine closing.
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:35.680]   But now, yeah, just interesting.
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:39.560]   They're giving it back to the owner.
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:40.840]   That sounds like a good deal.
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:41.840]   Yeah, I know.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:42.840]   I don't know how he got it.
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:43.840]   They sell it to somebody and they give it back to you.
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:44.840]   I know.
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:45.840]   No, we don't want it.
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:46.840]   Never mind.
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:47.840]   Wasn't that the Skype plan?
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:48.840]   Nice.
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.840]   And then we're going to buy it back at a discount.
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:54.760]   It's just interesting because a lot of people lost their jobs over this whole thing.
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:57.000]   And now I'm wondering what he's going to do.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.880]   There's a story to be told there somewhere.
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:12:59.880]   Yeah.
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:00.880]   Just saying.
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:04.880]   So, I wonder if people are going to start going back to it now or are going to continue
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:07.320]   to go to it with the original guy running it.
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:11.560]   Well, I mean, from 1UP.com, a lot of people went off and did their own things like Co-op,
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:13.600]   which is an awesome show.
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:15.280]   So there's not a lot of people left to hire.
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:17.480]   So I'm going to go talk to them.
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:18.960]   You going to talk to them?
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:19.960]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:22.400]   I thought you were happy over there doing what you're doing.
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:25.400]   Oh, no, I could do all of it at the same time.
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:28.160]   GDGT, do you go check it out?
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:29.160]   No.
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:30.160]   Natalie?
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:33.080]   I did, but it wasn't open when I looked at it.
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:34.080]   I'll have to go back.
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:38.360]   Yeah, they had looked like they had a massive traffic spike and then they fell off a cliff,
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:39.360]   came back.
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:42.760]   Veronica Balmont doing their video.
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:44.960]   Super cute.
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:46.280]   Reviews look good.
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:49.560]   You know, I mean, the one thing I noticed is all the things they're touting in terms
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:54.960]   of user interactivity, having sort of a library of your own gadgets and your wish list.
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:55.960]   I don't think.
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:57.440]   That's Yahoo tech.
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:01.160]   It's the same thing just in a way cooler package.
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:04.600]   It was just really interesting to me to see everything old is new again if it's done with
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:05.600]   the cool kids.
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:08.160]   Yeah, it's basically all it is is personalities.
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:12.320]   I mean, it's just another iteration of Engadget.
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:16.440]   It gives Modo and now it's the same, you know, and they're all competing with each other.
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:19.200]   So it's kind of interesting to see how it happens.
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:20.200]   Well, there was this great one.
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:21.200]   What are my producers?
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:26.720]   We're basically breaking into the show floor at the LVCC at the Consumer Electronics Show
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:28.520]   trying to scoop each other.
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:32.960]   And they're just I mean, the frenzy about the information and being first.
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:34.640]   It's it's weird.
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:36.520]   I mean, it's what's it?
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:37.520]   What's the problem?
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:38.520]   I don't like their names.
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:39.520]   EG.
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:40.520]   What is it?
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:42.320]   GDGT gadget with four letters.
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:45.480]   No, no vowels, no vowels allowed.
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.480]   Yeah.
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:47.480]   Yeah.
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:52.200]   One of my producers on unloaded Randall Bennett left to do something just like this called
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:56.920]   obsessive and because he just didn't have the star power, it was almost exactly like this
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:00.640]   where you could compare gadgets and talk with people who had it.
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:05.320]   And they also cover tech news, but he just didn't have the star power behind it.
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:07.200]   And also, I think this maybe looks a little bit nice.
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:09.240]   And also the name obsessive is not great.
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:10.880]   It doesn't roll off the tongue.
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:11.880]   The site looks great.
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:12.880]   I mean, it was clean.
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:13.880]   Looking at it now.
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:14.880]   I mean, what do you think?
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:15.880]   I don't know.
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:16.880]   It's another site.
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:17.960]   It almost looks like a blog.
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:18.960]   It's not a blog.
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:22.000]   Yeah, it's with back end software.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.080]   They use it probably as a blog.
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:25.080]   So where's Veronica?
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:26.080]   I don't see her on here.
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:27.080]   She's on the video portion.
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:29.200]   I don't even see how you link to that.
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.200]   I had to dig.
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:31.200]   I don't know.
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:32.200]   You have to dig with us.
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:33.200]   She should be on the front.
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:35.680]   They should put her right on the front, right at the very top.
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:36.680]   She's great.
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:39.760]   We chicks in tech have to stick together.
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:42.440]   Well, you should be sticking together on the front page.
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:46.000]   We should be front and center all the time.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.280]   Yeah, no, seriously, you should.
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:48.760]   I mean, just from the marketing perspective.
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:50.120]   Yeah, that's you know what?
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:55.120]   Molly and Veronica and Natalie, me, we're going to gang up.
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:56.320]   We're going to do our own.
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:59.560]   There's a bunch of people you left out of this list, by the way.
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:00.560]   Our own what?
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:01.560]   Just so I know.
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:02.560]   Our own one of these.
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:03.560]   And we're going to have shoes.
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:05.120]   Carlos, who are the others?
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:07.320]   We have Sumi Das that works for us.
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:08.800]   Oh, yeah, bring Sumi on.
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:09.800]   She's cool.
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:10.800]   She's very nice.
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:11.800]   Wait.
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:12.800]   She works for Cedan.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:14.160]   What other women are in tech that we...
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:17.480]   Well, we have Neha, who I work with in a show called Rad on the Web.
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:18.480]   Me and Neha.
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:19.480]   Neha's awesome.
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:20.480]   There's Caroline McCarthy.
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:21.480]   Oh, yeah, she's great.
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:22.480]   And Maggie Reardon.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.480]   What does she do?
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:25.480]   I was talking to someone about this recently.
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:29.360]   I was like, yeah, you know, the girl version of tech, I pretty much have a hundred percent
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:31.360]   chance of getting asked to be on Twitter.
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:34.120]   So there's not that many of us, but there are some for me.
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:35.120]   You know who's in one of my faves?
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:36.120]   I think it's about 50.
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:37.680]   What about Mary Jo Foley?
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:41.760]   She is not a gadget girl, but she is a star.
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:43.520]   She knows everything about Microsoft.
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:45.400]   Yeah, Mary Jo's good.
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:46.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.400]   There's a bunch.
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:48.400]   There's so many senile people.
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.040]   I think there's about 50 high end women that are all doing this stuff.
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:53.800]   And they all, by the way, and guys out there, you all know this is true.
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:57.080]   They bitterly complain that they're not getting enough attention.
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:58.080]   That's not true anymore.
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:16:59.080]   What?
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:01.160]   I think we get an inordinate amount of attention.
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.640]   Maggie Reardon.
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:03.640]   Love her on CNET.
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:04.640]   Don't know who.
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:05.640]   I don't know her.
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:06.640]   She's good.
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:07.640]   She does a lot of consumer stuff.
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:08.640]   Isn't that Marguerite Reardon?
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:09.640]   Hollywood shout out.
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:10.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:11.640]   No, I've already given her her props.
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:13.640]   I mean, I actually think we get an inordinate amount of attention.
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:15.760]   Yeah, not to mention Amber.
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:16.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:17.760]   Sarah Palin.
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:18.760]   Oh, wait, sorry.
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:20.760]   Sarah Palin.
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:22.480]   Well, see, that's the thing.
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:28.040]   It's like you can't play the girl card to its pluses, which is, you know, you get a
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:30.160]   lot of free passes as a chick.
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:31.160]   So you can't.
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:35.680]   Yeah, but you get a lot of sort of short end of the stick too.
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:36.680]   I agree.
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:40.120]   But I just think you have to walk that line like it's a razor.
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:43.360]   And I'll just say it like that.
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:44.360]   You get a lot of flack.
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.360]   Yeah.
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.360]   You get a lot of flack.
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:48.960]   You get way more flack than me.
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:51.080]   Yeah, I know, but I don't get flack for the same reasons.
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:54.080]   I get flack for being, you know, opinionated about the Macintosh more than anything.
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:55.080]   They don't say you're vapid.
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:56.080]   They say you're a dick.
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:57.080]   Well, there you go.
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:58.080]   Yeah.
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:00.080]   I tend to think you're much more vapid.
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:05.360]   If you take the buzz out loud emails, and sometimes I set them aside and I just realize
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:09.760]   if I say something wrong, it's usually in an email attributed to my gender.
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:13.600]   Like she's stupid and she only looks good when she looks at the camera and that's why
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:14.600]   you chose her.
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:19.320]   But Tom can say the exact same thing or make an error that's comparable and never do they
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:23.360]   say it's because he looks the way he does or because he's a dude or because he's a guy
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:25.360]   or because of his age.
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:27.360]   And it's supremely unfair.
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:28.360]   Did I just say D word?
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:29.360]   I didn't mean to.
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:30.360]   I don't know what you said.
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:38.920]   All I know is that, uh, I think it's, I think it's a, it's the only advantage us guys have.
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:39.920]   True.
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:40.920]   True.
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:41.920]   Give the women crap about being women.
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:43.400]   What are we even talking about?
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:46.080]   I don't know.
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:48.920]   He's still irked about the quantum computing story.
[01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:49.920]   It's an important story.
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:52.360]   And I'm going to pound you on it.
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.640]   Hey, by the way, me and Dwork did a funny little outtake.
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:55.640]   We're at McCastello now.
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:56.640]   I'll put the link in the somewhere.
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:57.640]   I'll show you, show you.
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:58.640]   Can't wait.
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:18:59.640]   So anyways, so how are we doing for time?
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:00.640]   I think we're about to wrap.
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:09.640]   So you guys got any more, one more new story and then we're going to be out of here.
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:10.640]   Okay.
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:11.640]   What else do we have?
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:14.200]   Going to my notes.
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:18.320]   Do you want to talk about the biggest wifi network in Europe is now in Venice?
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:19.320]   Oh, is it really?
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:22.640]   I think that's a very interesting idea if you think about it.
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:28.440]   So it's 10,000 kilometers of cable, which is about 6,000 miles for those of us not familiar
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:30.000]   with the metric system system.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.720]   It blankets the entire city.
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:36.600]   It's free for residents, but about $6 per day for tourists.
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:40.200]   And it gets between 20 and a hundred megs per second and it costs the city $15 million
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:42.200]   And it's all wifi.
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:43.920]   There's no Y max or any other wifi.
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:44.920]   Yeah.
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:45.920]   No, not Y max.
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:46.920]   Interesting.
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:51.120]   We should, you know, $7 a day to be a tourist over there.
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:52.120]   It sounds okay.
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:53.600]   If you get that kind of speed.
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:54.600]   Right.
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:58.520]   By the way, the chat room says John's only credible because he's sexy.
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:19:59.520]   Oh, please.
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:01.160]   Just want you to know.
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:02.660]   Are you sure?
[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:06.280]   Maybe 30 years ago when I was a kid.
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:07.280]   All right.
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:08.280]   Is that it?
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.280]   We done?
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:10.280]   We're done.
[01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:11.280]   Well, I have to say it then.
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:35.840]   Another twit is in the can.
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:39.200]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
