[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.320]   to talk about Intel. Seems like they're really messing it up. Why we'll never get good in
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.560]   the United States unless we fight for it and how using fitness trackers can reveal top
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.920]   secret information. It's all coming up next on Twit.

[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.960]   It's time for Twit this week at Tech the Show where you cover the week's tech news.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.960]   Today we decided because we have two flamethrowers in house that we really didn't need a third.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.280]   Elon Musk is in the house. Actually that's a question of the week. Joining us from the
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.200]   packet pushers net. Mr. Greg Ferra. Wonderful to have you. Last time we had you on Skype
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.240]   because you had injured yourself in a bar brawl I believe.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.840]   The real story is I was walking home after an evening of refreshment. I must have misplaced
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.840]   my foot. Sadly.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:47.160]   It's no funny fell right over. But no I'm healed. It was all where I'm using. You know when
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.840]   you, one of these stories about data, I went to the hospital mode. Why forced me to go to
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.160]   the hospital this time. I had previously damaged my ankle a couple of years back and thought
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.360]   I'd just sit at home and wait till it heals thinking it was just sprained. They took
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.680]   an x-ray and they said it's broken. And I was like oh god I didn't think I had damaged
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.920]   it. Turns out I'd actually broken it two years ago because it wasn't on record as being
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.120]   broken. It used to be broken. It used to be broken. Once broken always broke. So I spent
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.600]   two weeks with a plaster cast that you didn't need. No because I hadn't broken my ankle.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.920]   I just sprained it. They didn't look at the this is like people read post blog posts.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.080]   Oh my god. David Bowie just died. It's like no dude look at the date. Well the thing is
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.440]   that the the file didn't have anything about having a broken ankle. So if they had had
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.440]   in the file you broke your ankle two years ago they probably would have gone into strain
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.280]   go home. So they saw it in the x-ray. They saw it in the x-ray. Couldn't they tell it was
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.280]   not fresh? Well it takes an orthopedic surgeon too.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.680]   Was it a plumber reading your x-ray? On the plus side you know he'd get quality seating
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.800]   on the trains with plaster cast on. As he is on the register.co.uk and you might notice
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.180]   we have all three primary accents of the English Commonwealth. We're lacking kunuk.
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.400]   Kunuk. And he's an a key weight. You're right we don't have you. I also want to welcome
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.200]   the Canberra grammar school in studio today about 30 students strong. Nice to have you
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.840]   fellas. We get a lot of groups from Australia come up and they do they tour Silicon Valley.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.240]   They've already been to Facebook. They've been to Seattle and Microsoft. Oh wow. So and
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.440]   they apparently got inside access at Facebook which explains why this morning I woke up
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:36.560]   to a fake account. So nice to have you. Wonderful. And actually now that you mention it the story
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.200]   of the week what the hell is Elon Musk making a flamethrower for the boring company. What
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:49.200]   is that? I don't know. It's brilliant marketing. It's well no they're useless. They're useless
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.320]   in a zombie apocalypse. You know everyone's saying well maybe the boring company's gone
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.720]   down and opened and that latter gates a hell. Flamethrow is a useless again zombies particularly
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.800]   fast ones. You need a good axe. You know that's all we're gonna order it. It's got to be illegal
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.400]   right? No no perfectly legal. It's legal in most states. Yeah it's not legal here. There's
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.800]   a guy in Minnesota who's my my producers making up laws quickly. Not legal here. No there was
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.320]   a guy in Minnesota who who broadcast himself on social media using one of these things to clear
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.000]   the snow off his front of his front drive. Oh you know you know. Why is Elon saying obviously a
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.600]   flamethrower is a super terrible idea. Definitely don't buy one and yet they are apparently
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.680]   offering pre-orders. Oh yeah. Oh unless you like fun is his subsequent tweet. He says these should
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.720]   be legal. The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms allows throwers with flames shorter than 10 feet.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.760]   So not really a thrower. To me is an advanced cigarette lighter.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:54.640]   Yeah. Good light. Yeah putting a lightsaber with two sabers on either side. It's just it's
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.200]   just asking for trouble. I mean you've got to promote your company one way or the other and
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.520]   well it worked. Yeah. Did you see that there was some corresponding articles this week about
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.920]   the pointlessness of the boring company. This idea of running a tunnel from one side to the other
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.680]   just big enough so that you can put a car in it and fundamentally it restricts that
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.200]   wrong for the elite. Oh yeah. You can't move. Again what's wrong with that?
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:21.200]   No that's what Elon says. Why would he say I don't like public transit. You know why would you
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:27.440]   want to be in because it's really because it's really efficient at moving large numbers of people
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.160]   from point A to point B. Which the boring company is not because it's. Well if you can only. You
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.000]   can have a boring bus. You can have a charge for one car. Because you dug a hole in a way. You
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.720]   dug a hole for that distance and at the end of the day it's actually not going to solve the transport
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:47.040]   problem or the society as a whole because it's only going to move a few hundred people at a time.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.680]   Yeah. Most like at any given interval you're only going to have a few hundred cars inside the tunnel.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.280]   You know. I do have to admire him though because he is launching his roadster.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:03.840]   Yeah the date has been set. February 6th. Of course that may well slip. It is only four years late.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:10.240]   This is the largest commercial rocket ever made. It's as big as what the Apollo rockets of Falcon
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.360]   Heavy. A slightly smaller little. Slightly slightly thinner at about the same height.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.680]   Yeah. And in order to test a rocket you have to give it a payload. He says well we could give it a
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.880]   bunch of cement bricks but why not. Why aren't they just. They just play loads in there.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.280]   I can't understand why you would put it like you're talking about shifting 40 ton. I think it's a
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.240]   40 ton payload or something like that. Yeah. That's not the roadster. So why not just take a bunch of
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.920]   fraction. Charity projects up there and or educational projects for people who.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:44.160]   Are unable to afford. They're not putting them in orbit or are they. Well he's he's flinging it on a
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:50.400]   a supposed. I mean it will go round Mars at one point. But in probably about a thousand years
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.560]   down the line. I think with regards it would be great if you know people could hitch a free ride
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:59.760]   up there. But I think what they're worried about is the insurance because it's if you if it does
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.920]   go kaboom those will still be counted on their actual aerial record space ships destroyed.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.240]   One of these. One of these. Yeah. Even though you're sending up payloads that have zero value.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:13.200]   Yeah. Yeah. But this whole thing. Are you being facetious? No no no the insurance market is
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.920]   amazing coral enormously important space X. Because they've got so little actual
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.160]   tables to work from. They're getting killed on the premiums. Yeah. So they want every safe launch
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.320]   they can possibly get. And the line himself has said it's pucker factor with this one. It could
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:31.600]   well either blow up on the lot on the launch pad or blow up hopefully. Because it's so big. Yeah.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:36.480]   And complicate this 27 rocket motors in this thing. And they will have to fire at milli
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.240]   sink like milli seconds. Well even that even tighter I would imagine if you're putting that much
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.960]   slightly off. Yeah. There goes a Tesla down.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:51.280]   It's a minor fault in rocketry. It's either you know that. Yeah. It either works or yeah.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:56.720]   No, that's a well taken point well. But it is just the video that thing for doing the test
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:02.400]   firing this week was trying to I'm trying to run the video. I don't I think I got so aggressively
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.880]   punishing auto start video and web pages. I think I can't run any video at all.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:12.480]   Fine if you're going to be like that. It's just like it's just sitting there spinning.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.440]   But yeah, you can see it on Twitter on the @spasix Twitter feed. Yeah, they got it in the
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.680]   YouTube channel. The SpaceX YouTube channel as well. It's a pretty amazing site. So.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:31.920]   Yes, Elon's nuts. But he's a good kind of nuts. It's not it's not a crazy kind of nuts like
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:38.400]   Zuckerberg or or Tim Jong-e. Yeah. It's like it's a it's a I wouldn't I wouldn't say healthy.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:44.160]   No, I mean the boring company thing really is nuts. But a lot of this stuff. I mean,
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:50.560]   PayPal worked out. SpaceX is working out. Tesla's working out. You can do it. Tesla's got some
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.960]   pretty big problems like it's ability. It's running into literally the other ability to scale up
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.440]   production. Here you go. Here's the we're going to bring the thunder. This is the Falcon Heavy.
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.920]   This is a static test. So the engines are firing, but nobody's they're not going.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:16.000]   You know, I'm told if you're there if you're and by the way, there means within a mile. Yes.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.640]   No closer. The earth moves. So what we've just done there is validated that it's actually a rocket
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:30.960]   and not a bomb. That's what static firing is. It's actually a big step forward. Will it go boom or
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.280]   like a wash in a bermain? How do they hold it in place though? It's a lot of lift. It's not going
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:40.720]   out for us. Well, it's because when you actually fire it off for the first couple of seconds,
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:45.200]   the inertia of the thing is so heavy because it's what it feels like that it'll just like you
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.920]   can move it within parameters. So they just did limited bursts and that sound you heard that's
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:55.200]   even with them piling water into the base to try and deaden the sound as well. So we get a little
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:01.200]   of the steam from February 6th, everybody. Yeah, I'm so tempted to plan out. Did you also admire
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.000]   your taxes in action there? We paid for this. I thought it was private. The jet, the rocket's
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.680]   private, but all of the supporting infrastructure isn't. Oh, that's Cape Canaveral. Well, it's leased
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:15.680]   by SpaceX from NASA. Yeah, but it's all NASA. It was all built in Texas. Hey, does anybody mind
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:23.360]   taxes for NASA? Hell no. Hell no. You want to pay more? Please take my money. Yeah.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:29.200]   I wanted to, Elon makes a big point about how much support he gets from NASA to make these rockets
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.640]   work and how. NASA saved the company basically with the space. It wouldn't be possible if he had
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:38.240]   to build the actual launch pads and get the permissions in the space, like finding that much real estate.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.960]   And then like, did you see there was a YouTube video that NASA published of testing the fire
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:50.480]   suppression system? They pump out 450,000 gallons of water per second. It's on YouTube. So basically,
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.200]   all the good, the Tesla company is doing to save the environment is being completely offset by
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:03.520]   SpaceX. I've often thought that. Yeah. It's a zero sum. Yeah. Oh, wait. I, you know, I don't know
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.360]   why I led with that except that I didn't, I saw this flamethrower all week and I thought, is this a
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.880]   joke? Is this serious? No, it's a genius bit of marketing. And I can't see any over
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:17.840]   any reason why anybody would want one. Well, I, well, actually, you know, there is that kind of,
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.240]   there's that thing. It's the kind of thing it would be great to have for like a few minutes and
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:26.560]   play around with. But if you just had it around the house, you'd find yourself, yeah, there's a
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.400]   raccoon under the house. I'll just go and burn it out. The next thing you know, I'm living in a tent.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.480]   So this is the water flow test. Holy.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.920]   Where they shoot out just this.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.840]   Is that also in the, in the,
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:42.240]   just do a NASA water flow test on YouTube. Bring that up. It's, it's pretty amazing to watch.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:47.040]   Wow. I like, we all love space. Geeks love space stuff, right?
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.040]   Yeah. I watch every launch. I actually put it in my calendar and I'll stop what I'm doing to watch.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.000]   You guys are a little younger than me, but I grew up watching Walter Cronkite.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.360]   Yep. And the, and the home. So this is, so, yeah.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.280]   Oh my God. What is that about? Why are they pouring so much water?
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.040]   So they're testing the fire. That's a fire suppression.
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.480]   Oh, that's the fire suppression. Yeah.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.000]   Really, you think water is the best thing?
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:11.440]   We've had some fancy chemical. Yeah.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.320]   It's the sound suppression on the rocket engines, but yeah, it's.
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.960]   Yes. Wow. Here's the sound supremacy.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.560]   The sound suppression system. It's, it's curiously similar.
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.320]   This is the Aries rocket, which is your
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.040]   thousand gallons of water at high speeds from a holding tank.
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.840]   Half a million gallons. Just
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.960]   it makes much a koozie look like a complete piece of that.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.920]   I guess this is not nearly as spectacular.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.920]   But it's like, oh, well, here comes. Here comes.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:46.800]   There's like a little, so this is like, they spray that during the launch to, to dead in the sound.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.120]   Dead in the sound and it keeps everything relatively cool.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.960]   Did they, is this something new that they do now?
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.640]   No, they did this with something, with something.
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.000]   Really? I don't even remember this.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.440]   Probably, probably,
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.400]   I wasn't pad reusable.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.640]   Wasn't paying enough attention to Walter Cronkite.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.240]   Otherwise, you'd end up melting down the pad.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.560]   Now they're spraying the water suppression.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.600]   Your engine's cool.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.160]   The best part is,
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.720]   isn't it funny? You set a rocket on fire and then you pour water onto it.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.320]   Crazy notion.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:12.960]   Science.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.440]   Thank you.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:18.480]   I think, I do think that Tesla is having some troubles.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.840]   We're seeing the Tesla cars really not being manufactured in the volume set.
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:22.960]   You know, somebody says that.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.240]   Then the Tesla army comes in and says, oh, you're just, you know,
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.320]   shorting the stock, you're an A-sayer.
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.200]   They're doing fine.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.520]   They're able to, it's hard to say.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.200]   I mean, the burn rate is very high.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.560]   Well, they're spending a lot of money.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.120]   It doesn't sound like they laid off so many of the manufacturing people
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.640]   off earlier in the month.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.520]   That's not a good sign.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.920]   That doesn't make an awful lot of sense, but you're right.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.800]   It's all about whether or not they can ramp up the number three production.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.960]   They need to be producing like a thousand vehicles a day.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.000]   At some point, I'm sure they're not.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   And that's really only something that forward,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   and you know, the big motor companies that we have now,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.200]   let's assume for a minute that the big companies are actually smart enough to change their ways.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.480]   But generally, yeah.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:58.960]   Big assumption.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:14:59.920]   But, you know, let's go with that.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.400]   It is also pretty amazing to be able to produce a thousand cars a day.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.360]   You need an awful lot of metal.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.480]   You need an awful lot of parts.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.680]   They all need to be in the right place.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:12.400]   And, you know, you just need vast amounts of capital to set up that production capability,
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.200]   that production engine.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.800]   And Tesla doesn't really have a lot of money, seriously,
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.880]   like he doesn't have a lot of spare cash lying around
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.400]   to build more factories and buy new robots and all that sort of stuff.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.360]   So I think it's reasonable to ask,
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.880]   can he actually scale up the production of either Teslas and his roasters and the threes
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.080]   that he's talking about?
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.200]   And he may actually stumble on the most prosaic and tedious of things,
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.200]   production, manufacturing.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.280]   Yeah. Well, they've got this factory out in China now,
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.320]   which they're starting to ramp up.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.720]   But even so, there's a, you know, there are,
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.640]   is it 400,000 people who are still who are waiting for their model less
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.640]   and soon or later they're going to want for their money back?
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.200]   I hate it. I'm waiting all the way to as long as you need it.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:49.200]   Yeah.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.000]   I got a thousand dollars on an Elon Musk.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.680]   I'm pushing it all in. I'm all in.
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.520]   Is this a concern for investors only, frankly, right?
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.480]   I mean, well, yeah, because the Tesla is valued, what?
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.840]   50 times, 75 times.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.160]   Fundamentally, no earnings.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.760]   It's burning cash at a phenomenal rate.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.560]   If you bought Tesla stock, you probably kind of knew you were
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.800]   saying you're probably going to take a haircut.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.560]   I mean, at some point, they're going to acknowledge the fact that ramping up
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.320]   productions harder than expected.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:18.640]   It's tough.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.480]   How many times have you heard that in the last?
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.760]   And yet I still feel like a lot of the naysayers come from Detroit
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.320]   and come from people shorting the stock.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.520]   Admittedly, there are a lot of cheerleaders like me who,
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.040]   I mean, I put my money where my mouth is.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:31.920]   I bought a Model X.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:32.720]   I have a Don Payman.
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.360]   I'm a Model 3 who want Elon to succeed because he's doing something really important.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:41.840]   And look, if it were for Tesla, would we be seeing every manufacturer?
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.560]   That is the rub.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.640]   And this is where the real value is being.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.080]   Or is that governmental point?
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.680]   No, no, we will virtually all car manufacturers have announced that
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.080]   within five years they'll be producing only electric cars.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:52.400]   Right.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:52.720]   Yeah.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.280]   So that's not entirely Tesla, but that's--
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:55.680]   No, it says--
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.640]   That's going to be petrol cars.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.080]   Well, all new models.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.680]   Well, let's be clear here.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.360]   All new models will be electric.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.400]   You'll still be able to buy petrol or diesel cars in five years' time,
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:09.680]   probably just petrol, because the existing models have a sales cycle of gas cars.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.520]   Interesting.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:11.600]   That's interesting.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.040]   In some countries you won't be able to--
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:13.760]   You won't be able to.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.200]   Norway says by 2020.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:15.520]   No.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.000]   No.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.040]   The Netherlands as well.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:22.560]   The interesting part is that if you look at the distribution mechanism around petrol,
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:27.760]   and oil, like these flammable materials, it's actually incredibly difficult.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:32.400]   The whole market for petrol stations collapses if petrol consumption reduces by just a third.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.840]   Well, and also gasoline is very toxic.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:41.360]   And in fact, there are places in Petaluma that will never be built because they were gas
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.600]   stations and the gas tanks down there cannot be economically--
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.160]   It can't be remediated economically.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.040]   They will never be used.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:49.920]   That's not a good--
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.760]   Meanwhile, we have already a pretty good electric distribution system,
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.040]   admittedly not designed for fueling cars, but the electricity is everywhere.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:57.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:03.120]   I think you're going to see what we're seeing now as an emergence of a point mode of electricity,
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:08.320]   where you're most likely the electricity production is going to become from solar cells or wind
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.760]   localized.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.840]   So imagine a roadhouse on the side of the road.
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.040]   And it's going to have like 50 to 100 charging points.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.120]   The supercharges, I think, are already solar power.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.240]   Many of them are, because why would you want to run the extra electricity there?
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.760]   Why not just put a bunch of batteries and a bunch of solar panels out there?
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.280]   And then you can just generate electricity.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.280]   That's how I charge my car at home.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.160]   We have solar panels.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.080]   And it's not direct because it goes to five back and all that.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:32.800]   It's the way it's moving.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:37.680]   And I mean, initially, you've got the supercharger stations where you can drive in,
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:42.480]   spend 20 minutes, have a like meal while you're cars charging or something like that.
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.040]   And we're back to a very traditional model.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:49.120]   But when you look at how this is going to disrupt so many industries in terms of,
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:53.840]   change making that shift, and also what we're going to do with the infrastructure that's left
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:58.080]   at the end of the day, because as you rightly point out, getting rid of an old petrol station
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.600]   is incredibly expensive because you've got to haul the tanks out of the ground,
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.480]   get all the, you know, the gobbons out from underneath them.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:07.680]   It's going to be a really interesting shift.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.920]   So throw all Thomas Carlin to the mix.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:14.880]   So I just like the idea of actually generating your own electricity and then putting it in
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.160]   cars. It feels good.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.280]   Like local production.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:17.840]   It feels good.
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.800]   Because you just feel like you're doing something positive now.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:25.680]   And on the motorway, like those big motorway fuel petrol stations and, you know, they've got the
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.240]   space to lob up as many solar panels as you want.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.840]   You know, why not?
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:35.040]   Meanwhile, the United States has just put a 30% tariff on solar panels from China,
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:41.040]   which may cost as many as 40,000 jobs in the US because it turns out there's a market for
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.400]   solar panels in the United States.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.320]   Who does a lot of people installing them?
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.400]   Do we not make solar panels here?
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.720]   We used to and then the Chinese and Germans flooded the market out with cheap imports.
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.280]   So there maybe is a reason to be protectionist.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.040]   Yes and no.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.000]   But the problem is that the US doesn't have the capacity to actually
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.040]   We can't deal with that.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:19:59.680]   So what they've done.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:00.320]   It's too late.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:00.560]   Yeah.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.400]   They should have done it while Cylindra, like the solar companies went under.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.120]   Indeed.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.800]   I mean, that would have been the logical thing to do.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.320]   But you know what the US government's like.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.320]   It's being a penny smart and dollar stupid.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:15.520]   But yeah, I mean, this is why they built various protections.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:21.040]   It wasn't the tax thing is coming in, but only after you bought a certain number of solar panels.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.680]   So they're trying to roll it back a little bit that way.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.680]   But yes, a profoundly stupid move in a year of profoundly stupid moves on both.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.480]   It was government.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:33.280]   So we saw three or four years ago, we saw a couple of the big solar manufacturing plants go under.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:36.960]   They were originally financed with government money and then they couldn't float in the market
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:41.760]   because the Chinese had actually come out with cheap and flooded it with under cost.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.600]   And the Chinese government, it was thought at that time that the Chinese government had priced
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:49.040]   the panels to kill the companies in the US so that they could then ship the panels here.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:53.360]   Because 80% of the panels in the United States last year installed in last days were
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.160]   Now you could also make the case that you actually don't want to make them here because
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.760]   it's an incredibly toxic process.
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:02.000]   It's incredibly dirty and incredibly toxic and requires vast amounts of energy
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.800]   that you may or may not have.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.480]   Hmm.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.880]   It's complicated.
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:13.520]   If you wanted to preserve the solar panel in the United States, you probably should have acted sooner.
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:13.840]   Yes.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.040]   Basically.
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:15.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.160]   Three or two years.
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.760]   Because you're closing the more absolute.
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:23.920]   Or invested more money into basic research to sort of technologically leapfrog the Chinese.
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.960]   But you know, they know that China isn't dumb.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:30.400]   They know exactly where the market's going and the market's going solar and renewables.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:35.680]   I think it would be smarter to look at storage systems. How are you going to store the excess
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.520]   energy? And it would be...
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.640]   Well, Australia's got a great example of that with the Tesla battery that's...
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.400]   The power wall.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.400]   Well, I've been trying to buy it.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.280]   No, they built a huge...
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.160]   I think it's a 100 gigawatt battery farm out in the middle of nowhere.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:50.960]   That's in Adelaide.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:55.680]   To balance out the power because if a coal station goes down, then large numbers of people
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.560]   are suffering brand-outs.
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:01.680]   This is the problem with solar power is it's tied to the sun and it's tied to sunny weather.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.080]   Well, you need to smooth out demand.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.200]   So what Tesla's did was said, "We will build you this battery plant
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.200]   pound to smooth out demand. And if we don't do it in 100 days, you get it free."
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:15.840]   And they came in just, just like, "But this thing has made a million in the last month
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.480]   allowing energy trading by the company that holds it."
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:23.600]   So I think if you're going to evaluate Tesla, an Elon strategy, you have to evaluate as a whole,
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.320]   not just the Model 3, but there is a much larger...
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.600]   And he's been very forthright about this much larger plan of foot.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.760]   Obviously, he could trip himself up by a failure.
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.640]   How much resources can you...
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:41.680]   I think people invest in him feel like they're investing in a larger plan,
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.680]   rather than just the Model 3 product.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.560]   For the amount of money that's being thrown around, it has to be some sort of wisdom or something.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.920]   Same thing, it's like Uber.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.360]   You're not investing in a ride-sharing, a ride-hailing company.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.600]   There's no way Uber makes its money back.
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.920]   It's losing faster than Tesla.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.760]   It's losing more money than any company's lost in the history of losing money.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.120]   Well, they're fundamentally, at this point in time, they're still subsidizing the taxi rides.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:05.920]   By 40%.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:10.400]   So at some point, Uber prices will increase substantially in demand,
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.120]   will drop and car...
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:17.200]   Is this crazy time that the investors are willing to support companies
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.320]   with kind of long-term, almost crazy goals?
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.280]   Because there's such a big win at the end of that rainbow.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.640]   Well, Uber win is ultimately what we were talking about in the car,
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.720]   the way up, which is autonomous vehicles.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.200]   Autonomous vehicles.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.200]   The end of ownership, car ownership entirely.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.760]   Yeah, you'll have a transportation module will arrive,
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.560]   and you'll get in and it will take you where you wish to go.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:37.600]   Nobody will own cars.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.960]   It's a little bullish on the future.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:43.760]   You see here that the new CEO Dara Kastrawasa Haoyichi is saying,
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.400]   and I'm so sorry Dara, but that's the best I can do,
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.720]   is saying that we'll have self-driving cars in service in a year and a half.
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.200]   That's even...
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:51.920]   They might.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.600]   Is it level four, level five autonomy?
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.360]   I mean, is there a steering wheel?
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.080]   Even if they did get to that point,
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.080]   they wouldn't be allowed to run them on the roads,
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.120]   because it's not the technological...
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:01.680]   Not legal yet.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:01.840]   Not legal yet.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:02.560]   ...back now.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.880]   It's the legal framework, the insurance.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.880]   Although you think insurance would be all down.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.560]   Well, yeah, but on the other hand, those two have...
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.280]   Are...
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.040]   I mean, these cars are safer than you...
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.360]   Oh, they are safer, but then you've got the liability
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.840]   of the when they crash, because these cars will crash.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:18.880]   It's just...
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:19.520]   You'll have to ask...
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:19.840]   You'll have to ask...
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.720]   No, actually, in the UK,
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.200]   the insurance companies are now offering a 20% discount
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.640]   if you drive a Tesla Model 3.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.200]   How are we?
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.080]   And you activate the auto driving feature on the highway.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.040]   A year and a half ago when I...
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.320]   Because those cars are that much more reliable.
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.080]   A year and a half ago when I got my Model X,
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.920]   the insurance company said,
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.240]   "Oh, you're not going to use the autopilot, are you?"
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.280]   And I am actually...
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.640]   I have a huge deductible,
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.000]   because it's quite the opposite.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:44.400]   Yes.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.360]   They didn't trust it.
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.480]   Now they're coming around, I hope so.
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.600]   They're coming around, they're actually saying that...
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.240]   That's true, though.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.160]   Actual tables should tell you as we get more and more.
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.520]   The National Traffic Safety Board,
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.760]   and they report into that guy that got decapped
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.160]   in the Tesla when it missed the trailer.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.680]   Said that when she did miss the trailer,
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.320]   that was the problem.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.160]   It actually hit the trailer.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:00.640]   Well, yeah.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.360]   Okay.
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.520]   The cameras missed the car.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.200]   The car didn't see the trailer.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.560]   The car hit the trailer.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:07.600]   And the guy lost his head.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.920]   But they were saying where anti-collusion has turned on,
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.440]   that cuts accidents by 40%.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:11.840]   Yeah.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:12.720]   That's actually the key.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.440]   It's not driving down the highway with your hands off the wheel.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.160]   It's the car seeing that you're going to run into a car.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:18.720]   Yes.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:21.440]   And it's happened to me many times now, saying...
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.600]   Sometimes, spuriously, sometimes false positives.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.720]   But saying, you're closing on that car really fast.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:26.960]   Yes.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.560]   And it pretensions the seat belt,
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.880]   it starts the brakes and it alerts me.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.920]   And that, I am sure, has saved many a rear end collision.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:34.800]   Superhuman, we call that.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.000]   That's superhuman technology.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.760]   Because it's so much faster than I would be.
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.000]   It just has to be better than human to be superhuman.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:41.680]   Which is not much.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.320]   It's a low bar.
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.520]   No, especially when you're driving and you've had 30 years of driving a car
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.520]   and you're not expecting something going to happen and you're tired.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.640]   And you tell me, you just had dinner and you feel a little bit sleepy.
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.280]   Yeah. I mean, the case the lawyers are really looking for
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.360]   is when somebody was in a self-driving car,
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:26:01.280]   they saw there was a crash coming and it swerved and hit somebody else.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.360]   And there, where does the liability live?
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.960]   And they're still working out the answers.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.160]   You know, it's the old, is it better to kill one person or were to kill five?
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.680]   Well, the question is responsibility.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:13.280]   Human, simple human psychology says,
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.240]   if somebody drove into me and killed me, that's their fault.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.760]   If it's a machine, who do I blame?
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:22.160]   And at some point society, as we see increasing automation everywhere.
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.520]   What about automated trains?
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.360]   What about automated buses?
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.640]   What about when we get to fully automated sewage systems like,
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:32.240]   or electricity systems, all of our electricity systems today are all manually done?
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.440]   There's literally operators.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.520]   This is where the battery pack thing comes in is that
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.120]   because the battery pack can respond in milliseconds,
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:44.080]   it actually is responding faster than the grid operators can flip the switches.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.320]   Normally, what would happen is that it actually be a blackout.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.120]   And if they were unlucky and weren't able to catch it in time,
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.600]   it would actually blow all the transformers up the line.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.240]   And then the power couldn't come down the main east-west corridor.
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.040]   And so what's happening now is the battery packs come up,
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:00.960]   hold the power stable enough time for the organizers to bring up more power,
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.560]   and then the battery pack reptiles.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.120]   Right.
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:08.800]   Now, financially, that battery pack is super financially viable,
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.560]   because that's peak power.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.240]   So that's $10,000 a kilowatt.
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:16.160]   That's the maximum rate, because that's the power at the critical time.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.520]   And then the battery pack pulls back out.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.960]   Now, normally what you would do is,
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.720]   there are guys in the power control, fire up,
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.720]   they press the button for the gas turbine generators.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.200]   Right.
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.960]   So they're all these spot.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.560]   And there's a whole financial business around building gas turbines
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.400]   all over the country for peak power.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.960]   And they only run for about a week out of every quarter.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.600]   But when they run, they run for like $6,000 a kilowatt hour,
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.280]   right through the peak burst when, you know,
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:41.440]   the coal power stations blow on up or a transformer goes in a main cap.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:46.720]   And they fire up at the peak, and that's what makes gas power quite profitable for many people.
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:50.560]   And these companies are like hedge funds just putting power stations on spec.
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:50.880]   That's funny.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:51.680]   Right.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.800]   So these battery packs are able to come in with power much quicker,
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:58.320]   much faster, and fill the void, and then retire out of the grid
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.200]   when the slow acting systems come back up.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.040]   So it's much more complicated.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:06.160]   I did some computers that are power generator,
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.800]   a power distribution company learned just enough to be stupid.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:10.880]   I feel like I can open my mouth.
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.200]   They don't quote me on any of that, but that's so interesting.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.880]   Because obviously all of these solutions are better.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.520]   They're superhuman.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.800]   You named nailed it.
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.480]   10% better than human is superhuman.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.840]   But the psychology of it is what's really holding it back.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.080]   Because we don't want to try.
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.600]   You know, nowadays, I keep saying this and people say,
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.400]   no, no, it's not true.
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.280]   But I think it is true.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.000]   I've been told it's true.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.920]   When you're flying in a commercial airplane, much of the time a human's not flying it sometimes.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:36.560]   Oh yeah.
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:37.200]   When it's landing.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.720]   First five minutes and first five and last minutes are generally one the humans have the most.
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:46.080]   But even in landing, sometimes it will self-land, just to keep up on the stuff.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:50.960]   It is a problem because we do have a situation now where some pilots just aren't getting enough
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:51.920]   stick time.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.720]   So when things go wrong, they don't know what to do.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.640]   Well, they know what to do.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.320]   They just haven't had much practice of doing it.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:28:59.280]   Yeah.
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:05.600]   And autonomous planes make a certain amount of sense in the same way that autonomous cars do.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.280]   But I think people are going to be more willing to get behind the wheel of an autonomous car
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:14.400]   that they're in rather than persuading 300 people to get into an entirely autonomous plane and hope
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.600]   that every, you know, blue screen of death doesn't actually mean that.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.520]   You know.
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:23.440]   Who wrote an article about a motorcycle and a self-driving.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.880]   Oh, the GM lawsuit.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:25.280]   Yes.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:25.760]   This was.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:32.400]   I liked actually this must be you that put the comment in here about the GM lawsuit.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:32.640]   Oh.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.200]   It must that must have been your headline.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:39.760]   Biker nerfed by Robo Chevy in San Francisco, now lobs a subal at GM.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:45.120]   Isn't there a thing in Australia as well as in bikers getting nerfed when they get knocked off by the cars?
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:45.760]   Do you know what that means?
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:46.240]   Nerfed.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.600]   You can imagine though, I bet.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:48.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.400]   They're going, I don't know what he's talking about.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.040]   But yeah, I think this was just an example of this.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:53.520]   Bye.
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:53.920]   Bye.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:54.240]   Mr.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.120]   Biker guy.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:55.760]   Drove my Chevy.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.000]   It's the lefty, but the Chevy was a rock.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.720]   You are really on fire.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:06.800]   What can I say? I mean, I will say my editor came up with a subhead and that was just a peel work of genius.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.360]   That was a motorcycle.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:15.120]   Suing GM after he was knocked off of his motorbike by a self-driving vehicle,
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:21.120]   alleging negligence, demanding damages, photographer Oscar Nielsen said he was hit by a Chevy Bolt.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:27.120]   It had a human driver at the wheel, but the driver was testing GM's hands-free self-driving technology.
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.160]   Testing.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:28.960]   Testing.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.720]   Well, I think this was very-
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:35.840]   You moved into the left lane.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.680]   I'm trying to imagine this of a three-lane, one-way road.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:43.520]   So they have these middle lanes for turning for either direction.
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.240]   While the photographer continued on in the center lane,
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.880]   it moved into the left lane.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:52.080]   The Bolt then veered right, side-swiping Nelson and knocking him down.
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:55.760]   This is the claim, of course, of the plaintiff.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:01.440]   GM says you shouldn't have tried to pass the Bolt as it was changing lanes.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.400]   Clearly, the car didn't see the biker. It wouldn't have gone into that lane.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:09.600]   Well, this is the thing, and we're quite curious about this, because California is unique amongst
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:14.960]   American driving markets, and that is the only state which explicitly allows lane splitting.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:19.280]   That's when you're on a bike and you go down the down the white line between the lanes,
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.120]   rather than actually in the center of each lane.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:23.360]   So it's actually legal over here.
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.960]   It's been nuts, by the way.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.360]   Really?
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:25.760]   Yeah.
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:29.360]   It's a really efficient way to get bikes through, but I understand that,
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:32.000]   but I'm always afraid I'm going to hit one because they're coming up,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.760]   and I don't see them, and maybe I just in-shell to the left a little bit, or whatever.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.840]   It just makes me very nervous.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:38.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.800]   I mean, it should only be if the traffic is really stopped.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:41.600]   Yes, exactly.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.840]   The problem is, and I don't know what the law says,
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.240]   but people lane split even when traffic's running it, of course.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.840]   That does freak me out in awful luck.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.440]   Because if you're sitting in traffic and you're not moving,
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.520]   you can check your mirrors on a regular basis.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:51.680]   That's different.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.320]   You expect it.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:57.040]   But if you're bombing on at 50 miles an hour and somebody's lane splitting at 60,
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:57.840]   then you're just-
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.520]   What speed were these vehicles going?
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:00.160]   This was it.
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.640]   They were only going 17 miles an hour when it happened.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.520]   So what I think happened was that the software wasn't
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.440]   configured to deal with somebody lane splitting.
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.080]   Probably not.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:08.880]   And just-
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:09.200]   Totally not.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.120]   Okay, there's nobody in that lane.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.600]   The fact they're on the white line, I'm just going to ignore,
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.720]   and then I'll cut back in.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.520]   But lawsuit aside, injuries aside if there were any.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.960]   This is what self-driving car people tell me.
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:24.720]   Every accident is a good thing because we now know about lane splitting.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.200]   Yep.
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.480]   And also, I mean, I felt a big-
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.720]   We did this because obviously it's an autonomous car,
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:32.080]   but if you look at the number of motor-site deaths and motor-site injuries
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.120]   and car injuries and the rest of it, or the number of times,
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.360]   you know, there was a story with the-
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:40.480]   It was an accident with a Tesla earlier at the start of this week,
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:45.920]   where it had autopilot on, ran into the back of a fire truck at 65 miles an hour.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.000]   Now the driver got out and walked away.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.360]   Now that's a testament to a really well-built car.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.720]   But cars have accidents all the time.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:58.240]   And the fact that autonomous, all the self-driving, the rest of it,
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.040]   we're going to-
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:01.040]   We will eventually get over the point, which is like,
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.480]   "Oh, it's a car accident.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.600]   I mean, it's not the end of the world."
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.600]   So just to come back to something you said earlier about Uber and saying that
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:11.040]   they were going to have self-driving cars on the road by 2018-
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:11.040]   2018?
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.560]   No, it's going to be 2019.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:13.120]   2019.
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.360]   Yeah, it might just be a very limited trial.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.960]   We saw something come up this week,
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:20.240]   where there was a sealed community that was doing self-driving cars.
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.760]   There are constrained situations where a self-driving car is completely reasonable.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:26.640]   I imagine that Uber is out there right now trying to sign up
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:32.000]   smaller communities that would allow them on to get so they can have a headline about
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.560]   our vehicles as self-driving, blah, blah, blah.
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:38.000]   Because you've got to justify a $60 billion valuation with lies and market.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:38.480]   We'll-
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:44.240]   We see in our lifetime the end of private car ownership, and we will.
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.520]   It'll be done by 2030.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:54.640]   I'd say it would take slightly longer, but I think the costs of driving your own car,
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:58.160]   particularly if it's a petrol car on the road, will reduce it to-
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:04.080]   I think the standard petrol car that you and I have will be the equivalent of the classic car.
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:10.560]   You see, it won't be because of cars, it'll be because there's no mechanics and there's no petrol
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:10.960]   station.
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:16.240]   Right? If you think about your electric vehicle, it has no drivetrain, a gearbox,
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.440]   no differential, no motor.
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:17.920]   There's no maintenance.
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:18.880]   It doesn't need oil.
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:21.920]   I bring it in every year just so they can look at it and polish it up.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.320]   Yeah.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:26.320]   They don't even need disc brake changes like a current car does because they regenerate electricity.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.240]   So they use brakes for a little.
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:28.560]   Yeah.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.600]   They last three years.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:29.920]   Right?
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:34.960]   So if you suddenly see a substantial reduction in cars, you're going to see a substantial
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:39.040]   reduction in mechanic shops that repair these things.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.560]   You're going to see a corresponding, now all of a sudden, instead of there being a petrol
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:46.160]   station, at the end of the street, you're going to spend 20 minutes getting to a petrol station.
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:46.480]   Right.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:50.160]   And the inconvenience of that starts to feed a negative cycle.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:53.120]   And I think, and there's a whole bunch of other things too, the insurance is going to be,
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:57.200]   if you're self-driving a petrol powered car, which is flammable, it's fundamentally a bomb,
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.360]   right? Compared to an electric car.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.800]   In a sense, though, any vehicle with enough energy to propel a several ton
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:08.640]   mass at a speed of 60 plus miles has enough energy stored in it to be a bomb.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:12.240]   So the insurance, what my point is that the insurance cost of a petrol powered vehicle is
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:17.360]   going to be substantially more than, and not just because it's actually a dangerous thing.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:22.000]   It's led to bomb. It's got a tank full of petrol, but also because manual driving is going to be
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.360]   so much less reliable than, then at least semi autonomous autonomous.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:29.680]   We can rationally know that. And as I said, we still have a psychological burden on fair air.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.160]   Enough people like physically driving their own car.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.120]   That's an adhesive.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:38.240]   I used to ask the Ford CEO, former Ford CEO, Alan Malawi, who I knew at the time was working
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.440]   on self-driving cars, but continually denied it. And later we found out they were
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:45.440]   said, people like to drive. We don't see a market because people like to drive.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.480]   No, former GM.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.680]   But we won't get to drive.
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:52.800]   The former CEO of General Motors is on the record as saying that there's no chance that
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:56.080]   self-driving cars will be permitted on the road by 2030. Zero chance.
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.080]   That's just it. The regulatory issue is a big issue.
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.520]   The regulatory issue is just unsafe.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:05.360]   That's not even going to be like jumping off of high cliffs into small amounts of water,
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:09.440]   but does it mean we let them do it? Actually, they don't really let us just say we do that.
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:13.840]   It's going to be a very interesting thing. I wanted to come back to one other point that I made.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:16.240]   You talked about power wall and why your power wall hasn't come here.
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.680]   Where's my power wall?
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:21.360]   I found out I was listening to, I did some research with Bloomberg New Energy.
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:24.800]   There's a Bloomberg New Energy group in London. They talk about all this stuff.
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:28.480]   Turns out that all of the car makers expected the batteries to last three years.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:31.440]   And then they would pull the batteries out and they would, the idea was.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.880]   That would be the power wall.
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:33.920]   That would be the power wall.
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.120]   Used Tesla batteries.
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.480]   Yeah, they wouldn't be good enough.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:40.080]   I'm actually driving on a power wall right now, which has four wheels.
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.160]   Exactly. And some people even use their Teslas.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.360]   You can't with a inverter.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.160]   You can.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.080]   And an interchange system and so forth.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.560]   You can do the same with the press with a bit of the multiple.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:50.800]   I might actually do that because I don't think I'm going to see my power wall.
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.280]   Now you're telling me why? They don't have the batteries.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.360]   Well, no, the batteries are lasting 10 years.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.640]   They're now predicted to last 10 years.
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.280]   So the original idea, remember when we talked about electric cars and it was always like,
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.040]   "Oh, we're going to have to be replacing the batteries.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.640]   It's going to be like your remote control.
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.680]   It's going to be terrible.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.920]   Nobody wants to replace their batteries every three years."
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:08.800]   Turns out the batteries that they were building three years ago and going to last 10 years.
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:13.760]   Is it analogous to where leveling on an SSD that we're just learning how to charge them
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.800]   in a way that they don't get damaged as fast?
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.600]   I think they predicted that in the wild, the lithium...
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.480]   Because the chambers would degrade.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.720]   And the charge and discharge.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:28.160]   Who knows? Maybe people just aren't...
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:31.920]   Maybe the algorithms that they use to charge them from three years ago to where they are now.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:32.800]   A much more sophisticated.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.120]   I mean, look at your iPhone or your Android.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:37.200]   It's so much more sophisticated about power management.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:37.200]   Right.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:37.680]   Look at the recent...
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:38.720]   Forget about it.
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:38.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.920]   The iPhone can decide whether to go for speed or length.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.960]   When you recharge your battery, you can have a fast charge.
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:49.600]   And then now you have the fast charge until you hit 80% and the slow charge and so on and so forth.
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:50.800]   You see why I want to power a while?
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:56.880]   I have 30 solar cells on my roof if you could charge the power well on the way to the electric company.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.440]   There's just no...
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.640]   We have to worry about outages.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.560]   The economics about Renault had the same thing.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.160]   So you'll find Renault with their...
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:06.000]   They have an electric car and the others all had power wall solutions.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:06.720]   They were bringing to...
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:07.520]   They had marketing.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:08.480]   They'd been out there.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.600]   You're not getting the...
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:12.320]   There's no batteries coming back out of the cars as they had paid.
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.360]   And what's the...
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:16.400]   They're trying to cycle up the Nevada Gigafactory as fast as they can.
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.320]   That's another place where they're having difficulty.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:19.360]   Yeah.
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:19.680]   So...
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:20.720]   I want to talk a little bit about it.
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:21.360]   We're going to take a break.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.560]   But I want to talk about...
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:27.200]   When we come back, one of the businesses Uber wants to get into and probably will get into it.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.840]   What it already is, in a way, is Uber Eats is the idea of delivering...
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.240]   You've got all these drivers and all these cars out there.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.120]   Maybe they're autonomous.
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:35.440]   Maybe they don't have drivers, but they're going around.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.640]   There are other businesses.
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.120]   There's some very interesting businesses.
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:43.440]   Steve Yege, who was an engineer at Google recently quit after 13 years at Google,
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:45.280]   said there's not enough innovation going on at Google.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.920]   Went to a Southeast Asian company called Grab,
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.800]   which is a food delivery company who says,
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.040]   "But this is so much more than that."
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.840]   And it's the same kind of promise that Uber has.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:56.800]   That this...
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:57.280]   We are...
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.200]   The new economy is fascinating.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.960]   And it does feel like it's coming at us like a fast-moving train.
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:07.360]   2030, I can handle it, but there's other changes coming.
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.560]   We'll talk about that.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.120]   And also, if you're a convenience store clerk,
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.520]   why you may want to start preparing your resume.
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:16.720]   But first a word from stamps.com.
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.560]   Talk about disintermediation.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.320]   Why go to the post office?
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.520]   I love the post office.
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:22.480]   I like hanging out there.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.360]   But frankly, if you're a business and you do mailing,
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.800]   you should be printing your own U.S. postage from your computer,
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.000]   not a postage meter, and your printer, no special ink.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.720]   You could be doing everything you do at the post office,
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.760]   right at your desk, buy and print postage for any letter,
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.360]   any package, any class of mail.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:42.000]   The mail carrier still comes and picks it up.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.520]   In fact, they even...
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:45.200]   You can even say, "I request a pickup."
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:48.560]   You also save money because you get discount,
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:49.840]   you get it at the post office.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:53.040]   You never have to worry about having the right postage.
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:56.400]   I still get packages from people with extra stamps on them.
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.000]   So just, "I don't want to send it posted to do," or worse.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.920]   I do occasionally get a postage due package for companies.
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:09.440]   And I think that's a bad impression, really, to get stamps.com.
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.800]   You can create your account in minutes.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.560]   There's no equipment to lease.
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.160]   There's no long-term commitment.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.360]   You'll actually...
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.880]   We actually have a great package for you.
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.000]   Go to stamps.com,
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.120]   click the microphone in the upper right-hand corner.
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:24.720]   We will get you a digital scale, USB scale.
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.320]   So you always have exactly the right way.
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.760]   You always have exactly the right postage.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.880]   Would you print yourself?
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.680]   You could actually print it on a label for a package.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.880]   You could print it on an envelope if you're setting bills or brochures.
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.560]   You can...
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:37.920]   It'll help you decide the right class.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:38.560]   I mean, look what else?
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:41.200]   You get $55 in free postage.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:44.560]   You can use that over the first few months of your account.
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:50.880]   You get a supplies package with $5 as to cover the postage and handling of
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.320]   five bucks for the scale.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.680]   And you get a four-week trial.
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.240]   This is a $110 offer.
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.440]   Free.
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:00.080]   All you got to do is go to stamps.com.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:03.280]   Stop going to the post office.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.480]   Do it all at your desk.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.280]   Makes you more efficient, makes you more professional looking.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:07.600]   You know what?
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.080]   You could still go and visit the post office.
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:11.040]   Every once in a while.
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.080]   I have a post office box.
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:12.400]   I go.
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.360]   I say hi to everybody.
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.160]   Oh, bless.
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:14.880]   I like them.
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.160]   I actually...
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:16.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.280]   I like them.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.760]   So I go and I say hi, but I don't buy stamps.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.360]   Stamps.com, click the microphone.
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:24.160]   Use the offer code TWIT for that $110.
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.160]   Bonus offer.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.400]   Did you guys read Steve Yuggie's Medium Post?
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:29.040]   Maybe I am.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:29.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:30.320]   Which...
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:31.920]   So here's a guy who's been...
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.600]   I can't feel the feeling he had a point.
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.120]   And okay.
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.480]   Okay.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.680]   This was an epic piece of bridge burning,
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.440]   considering what he tried to do.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.680]   How he nearly got fired the first time.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:44.560]   But...
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:45.760]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:46.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:46.880]   I didn't hear that part.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:47.760]   How do you get fired the...
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.200]   Almost get fired the first time?
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.120]   I thought I recognized the name.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:51.760]   When we...
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:52.320]   When we...
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.280]   He left...
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.280]   He posted...
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.240]   When he first joined,
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.080]   he posted something online
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.760]   about how all these people were idiots.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.120]   And you know, the bureaucracy,
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:02.160]   that sort of thing.
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:02.720]   And those guys,
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:03.520]   "Are they gonna fire him?
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.480]   Are they not gonna fire him?"
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.760]   They didn't fire him.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.440]   And then now he actually has left.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:08.560]   And so called him.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:11.040]   He's just basically naparmed the bridge behind him.
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:11.840]   No, he was...
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.120]   You know what I think now I understand
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.720]   because there's a paragraph where he says,
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:16.480]   "I love people at Google.
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:17.920]   They're super smart in world class
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:18.800]   and always humble."
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.360]   But the company strategy is a mess.
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.440]   So now I understand why he wrote that paragraph.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:26.640]   And this was...
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.160]   He had learned his lesson.
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:29.680]   He says, "When a company is as
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.920]   dramatically successful as Google has been,
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:32.960]   the organization..."
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.200]   And I think this is absolutely true of any organization.
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.480]   "Can become afflicted
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:38.880]   with a sense of invincibility
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.400]   and almost manifest destiny
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:42.000]   which leads to tragic outcomes.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:42.800]   Complacency,
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:45.520]   non-invented hear syndrome,
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.880]   loss of touch with customers,
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:49.040]   poor strategic decision-making."
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.400]   It's the curse of the industry.
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:50.800]   It is.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.000]   Googlers know this is happening.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.080]   They're as frustrated by it as you are,
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.240]   but their leadership is failing them.
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:57.040]   And so...
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:58.560]   I mean, we've seen Microsoft do this.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.520]   We've seen Apple do this.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.520]   We're seeing Amazon doing it right now.
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:02.800]   Every big company is like this.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.080]   They're all stupid.
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:05.360]   Well, no, which company?
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.880]   Whether it's General Motors or...
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.480]   It's a business cycle too, right?
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.160]   I mean, you have a great success.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.680]   Look at Apple with the iPhone.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:15.680]   That in a way clobbers any hope of future innovation.
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:16.720]   Because you're not...
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.000]   Because you're extracting revenue
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.120]   from the success you've got.
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:21.520]   You're extracting every penny out of this thing.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:22.320]   That's right.
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.240]   That's the rub and that's what kills you in the end.
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.680]   But the point is that any big company
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:27.120]   is a tragedy of the commons.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.360]   It automatically becomes boring and tedious
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.880]   because the only way to keep
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.320]   a thousand programmers in line
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.560]   is to put 250 executives in charge.
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.960]   Making sure that they're all pointed in the same direction
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.000]   instead of running off...
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:38.880]   And that's how I know.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.000]   ...in herberained ideas.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.040]   I mean, all I read there is somebody whining
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.560]   about big companies being boring.
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:45.360]   Well, yeah.
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:45.920]   It's...
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:46.720]   To me, yes.
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:47.760]   And it was all obvious.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.840]   Although it's interesting to hear about Google.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:52.560]   Because for one thing, Google has always tried not to do this.
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.600]   They've been very aware of this.
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:55.680]   Not like it is in the same thing with Facebook.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.920]   I've seen the same thing with Yahoo employees.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.360]   Oh, the company's really boring.
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.560]   That must have been a while ago.
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.440]   Right.
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:03.280]   I've worked in Enterprise IT for 30 years.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:04.960]   How have I survived 25 years
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.520]   in the dumbest area of IT ever?
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:07.920]   And that's...
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.200]   I could have written that for you
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.040]   any time over the last 20 years, you know?
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.720]   But you run your own business.
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:13.120]   Now.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:14.320]   Which is a smart thing to do.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:15.360]   He's gone...
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:16.960]   Now I'm unhappy with myself.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.800]   You know?
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.800]   The thing I thought was interesting was actually
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.160]   not the indictment of Google.
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.200]   Although that's the headline.
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:27.200]   But why he went to this Southeast Asian company
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.320]   called Grab.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.360]   Which is basically...
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:33.200]   The Uber perhaps of Southeast Asia.
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.320]   It's a ride-hailing.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.080]   But he says it's so much more than that.
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.760]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.680]   I work for fun startup all day long.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:40.080]   Okay.
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:40.960]   I could throw this out.
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:42.640]   I just think that what he's talking about,
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.640]   the future is interesting.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:46.560]   For instance, he says once you have the Grab app on your...
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:50.960]   phone, because Southeast Asia is basically a cash economy,
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.440]   there's a huge opportunity as happened in Africa
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:56.000]   with Mpaysa to become a payments platform.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:56.960]   Yeah.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.400]   And I think this is maybe this is the way
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.800]   new companies kind of think of the synergies
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:03.040]   of what they're doing and what Uber is thinking about.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.120]   Food delivery, package delivery.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:07.360]   That's what the opportunity, of course,
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:08.880]   isn't that Southeast Asia.
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:11.600]   He says restaurants are probably dead.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.120]   A lot of...
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:15.440]   He says food trucks were the next thing.
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:18.000]   And then they're starting to die because people are actually
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.080]   building commercial kitchens that don't have customers coming to our...
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:23.440]   They're building a van in containers.
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:24.800]   In parking lots.
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:26.960]   And a bike drives up or a car drives up,
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.240]   picks up the food and drives it to you.
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:28.720]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.240]   It's a restaurant with no tables.
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:30.800]   Yes.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.640]   But with no atmosphere, with no...
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:34.400]   Well, your home is the atmosphere.
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:36.160]   And there's no central...
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:37.200]   If you go to a restaurant...
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.160]   There's no experience.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:41.280]   Well, if you go to a restaurant that is run by a central chef,
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.720]   who you is known and they...
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:43.600]   It's a performance.
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:44.240]   It's an art.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.440]   It's that.
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:46.720]   But honestly...
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:50.800]   Bruce Reichl, the famous New York Times food critic for years, said,
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.960]   "Great restaurants are theater more than anything else."
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:53.520]   Yes.
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:54.160]   Which of course is...
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:54.800]   It's an experience.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.080]   You walk in the door.
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:57.120]   There's a performance.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:57.520]   Yeah.
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:59.120]   McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken.
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.800]   No, it's theater.
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:00.800]   It's theater.
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:01.920]   It's, you know...
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:02.800]   There's tables and chairs.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:04.560]   There's more spongebob than a hamlet.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.320]   Certainly what Taco Bell are calling food.
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:07.120]   I would call this.
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:08.240]   No, it's just...
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:11.360]   So, you know, this story about setting up containers...
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:14.480]   There was a... I read a story this week about a family who had,
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:18.720]   um, literally, uh, been set up a food truck and worked out that the food truck
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:21.200]   game was over and they'd moved to a container kitchen,
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:25.200]   which is an industrial building in some nearby area to a city.
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.840]   And they were now just doing via delivery services.
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:29.680]   That was the new game for them.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:33.280]   Uh, but I do, you know, I think that people who want to...
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:33.920]   Wam...
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:38.640]   are pying about restaurants being an experience that everybody wants to have the experience.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:40.320]   Well, it's a very expensive experience.
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.640]   Just like saying everybody should drive a Ferrari.
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:42.960]   Yeah.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.480]   Because it's an experience, right?
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:44.720]   Right.
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:45.360]   Or, you know...
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:47.520]   What makes me sad is that people aren't cooking though.
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:48.400]   Well, no, this is it.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.200]   That's from places...
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:51.360]   Not only replaces restaurants, but replaces cooking.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:51.920]   I know.
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:52.160]   Right?
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:54.720]   Why haven't we got any decent automation in the home?
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:58.000]   Why is home automation such an abysmal failure?
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   Why do we not have, um, you know, a fridge and an x-ray design...
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.520]   And a machine that just cooks decent food out of raw ingredients.
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:07.920]   Tea, because it's incredibly difficult to do.
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:10.400]   Oh, yeah, but it's water market.
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:11.280]   There's something else.
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:11.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.320]   Like every house...
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.360]   Let's start a company.
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:14.080]   No, no, no.
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:15.200]   You get a billion dollars.
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:15.520]   Yeah.
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:15.920]   Just zero.
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:16.880]   Just zero.
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:17.760]   We'll get a just zero.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.560]   Well, be here and say we're making a juicer, but really...
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:22.560]   First step on a road to automation.
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:23.040]   But no, C.S.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.560]   Was full of this rubbish this year.
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:25.520]   Was it automated?
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:28.000]   You had the robot clothes folder.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.080]   Yeah, that is that thing emerging...
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:31.520]   Which was every January.
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.840]   It never made it to the market.
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:34.960]   How fast?
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:36.480]   Is that still not available?
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.640]   Oh, no, it's coming next year.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.000]   They've jazzed up the price.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.280]   And to use it, you've got to peg the clothes
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.760]   in a specific way onto the robot
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:48.320]   that takes just as much time as folding up your own...
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.760]   Is this the foldy mate?
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:50.080]   Yeah.
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:50.640]   Yeah.
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:52.560]   Take the work out of laundry folding.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:54.640]   This is the juicero of clothes, you know.
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:55.600]   I mean, it's...
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:57.840]   When you see the Rube Goldberg device...
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:58.880]   Oh, I love the music.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:02.800]   And now this lovely young couple...
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.320]   Are about to disrobe.
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:04.880]   No, wait a minute.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:05.680]   That's the future.
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:07.520]   Tea parties with the children.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:08.960]   When are we going to get to the foldy mate?
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:09.520]   I don't...
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:10.720]   I want to see the folding.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:11.760]   What's the point of this ad?
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:15.520]   So she has a lot of clothes.
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:17.360]   It reminds me of homelessness as advert.
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:18.480]   It would send your plow.
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:18.880]   Oh, here it is.
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:19.280]   Here it is.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:21.920]   Look, it looks like a Xerox machine in your living room.
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.360]   So you don't have to.
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.920]   He puts one shirt in after...
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:27.360]   Look at the size of it!
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:31.120]   You spend more time preparing the shirt for the foldy mate...
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:32.800]   than actually folding the shirt.
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.560]   So you don't have to...
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:38.000]   I guess one day I'll grow up and just stop hanging them on the floor.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.480]   Take the work, buddy.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.080]   So give it a sniff.
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:43.040]   That's the automated...
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:44.880]   Yeah, that should have been the work right now.
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:45.760]   So good, 28.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.360]   I mean, that's solving a problem.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.400]   That's not a problem.
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:49.680]   At the end of the day,
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.920]   you can just chuck your clothes on the floor and you're done.
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:53.200]   Having a machine to fold your clothes
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:54.080]   isn't going to move the needle.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.360]   But I think, you know,
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:58.800]   why is it that we haven't seen more automation about home prepared food?
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:48:59.760]   No, it's interesting.
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:00.560]   I mean, technically...
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:01.760]   It's hard to do.
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.160]   You could argue that we have in the terms of
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:05.600]   microwave meals.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.440]   And there are companies...
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:11.360]   But then you get a pre-processed thing that's loaded full of salt and
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.400]   fat and sugar.
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.400]   Well, that's the name of that company that Megan reviewed.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.560]   They sell an oven that...
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:18.480]   It's really kind of silly.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:19.040]   And they sell the...
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:19.600]   The June...
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:20.000]   June?
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:20.880]   No, I have a June.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:21.840]   That's silly, but it's not...
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:23.040]   It's silly in a different way.
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:23.520]   This oven...
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:24.960]   It's...
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:26.320]   Need a better way or a worse way.
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:31.280]   It's kind of a steam table slash oven slash microwave.
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.880]   It has a barcode reader.
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:36.720]   And they send you food, which you scan, and then put in.
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:39.280]   And the oven knows whether it is steam or bake or...
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:39.920]   Yep, yep.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:42.640]   Fry and does does it and then out comes a meal.
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:43.840]   Actually, the meals weren't bad.
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:44.720]   I guess...
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:45.600]   I guess ultimately...
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:48.160]   Look at how hard getting light bulbs into people's homes has been.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.200]   Look at you.
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:50.240]   And you know, the...
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:51.360]   Are they not doing well?
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:53.040]   Well, it's like they're doing well.
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:54.400]   But it seems to me like...
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.120]   This is something that every...
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:56.160]   This is something that every hues.
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:58.160]   Yeah, well, I have a dozen as well.
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:59.280]   I don't know what I was thinking of.
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:49:59.840]   No.
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:02.560]   I still can't convince my wife and daughters to use them.
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.400]   Well, so my wife says,
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:05.280]   "Well, you're putting all these.
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:06.320]   I put them in my office.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.520]   You're putting all these in your office."
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:08.880]   You know, I can now say,
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:11.840]   "Turn wine closet light on to dim.
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:14.000]   Turn desk lights on bright."
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.280]   And then when I leave, I say,
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:16.400]   "And I do this with the echo.
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.640]   Echo, turn off lights and den in the lights.
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:19.760]   Oh, I have a motion sensor for that.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.360]   And she goes, "Okay, well, I could do that,
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:23.280]   but I like talking to my..."
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.880]   But she says, "Put these in the bedroom."
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:25.440]   Nice.
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.440]   That's what I said.
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:28.080]   I'll use the...
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:28.560]   No.
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:30.640]   She said, "Put these in the bedroom."
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:32.000]   And there is a flaw to the hue,
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.040]   which you may not have discovered yet.
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:34.800]   But if the power goes out...
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:35.520]   Yes.
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:36.400]   And if it's...
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.360]   And this happened in the bedroom,
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:38.960]   and the power comes back,
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:40.560]   the lights come on full.
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:42.160]   You can set the default state.
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:42.880]   They've changed it.
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:43.200]   Yes.
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.400]   There's a new setting in the rooms.
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:44.880]   Okay.
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:45.440]   Yes.
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:46.080]   Because that was...
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:47.280]   That was the reason I don't have them in the bedroom.
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:50.880]   And so what I actually have is an IFTTT script
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:53.520]   that goes through and triggers them all off at a certain time.
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:54.000]   Yes.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.040]   And certain preconditions.
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:55.440]   Yeah.
[00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:56.400]   When the sun goes down the light...
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:57.760]   But now you can have a situation that
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:58.880]   if the power goes out,
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:00.400]   what's the state that it comes back in?
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:02.160]   Is that you have to use if this is that or do you...
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:02.720]   No, no, no.
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:03.600]   It's in the hue app.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:03.920]   Yeah.
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:04.960]   Deep down and about.
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:06.080]   I think I'm going to buy another dozen.
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:07.200]   I bought...
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.160]   So I have a whole bunch of them.
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:10.640]   I actually have them plugged in to my home studio.
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:11.760]   I've got some lights like this.
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:13.680]   Have you done the entertainment thing yet?
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:16.640]   Where it matches the TV show?
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:17.120]   Not yet.
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:17.760]   Because I don't know...
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.520]   Well, I don't ever watch TV, so...
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:20.720]   It's just what I love about this show.
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.640]   I feel like a Luddite right now, you know.
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:26.240]   So I do not have speakers in my home listening to what's being said.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:29.040]   I do not have an IOT device to turn on the heatsink.
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:29.040]   What?
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.240]   Well, I don't actually have any of those shows.
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:30.960]   No, I use my hand.
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.400]   It's very reliable.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:34.720]   Here's something I want you to go and research for me.
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:37.280]   There was 39 million Alexa sold over Christmas.
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:40.960]   I wonder how many of them are actually still being used by the end of January.
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:42.160]   Oh, all of them.
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:45.280]   But most of them will be used as a timer.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:46.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:47.200]   Here's...
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.960]   Or just a speaker or something like that.
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:50.720]   Oh, there's another video I can't play.
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:51.440]   Gosh darn it.
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:53.120]   What did I do to my Chrome?
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:55.120]   First, I couldn't get things to stop playing.
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:57.040]   Now I can't think of things to explain to play.
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:58.320]   It's not a click to play plugin.
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:51:59.840]   No, I don't know what I did.
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:00.400]   Maybe it is.
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:01.280]   Let's look.
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:04.080]   Sometimes you have to go like that when they're waiting to play.
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:06.720]   You've got to click the play down the bottom left there.
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.160]   But this thing?
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:08.400]   Yep.
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:09.840]   Stop it and then play it.
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:11.280]   No, you've got to screw it.
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:11.840]   I'm telling you.
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:15.040]   But look, the CNET autoplay is working fine.
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:15.520]   Yeah.
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:18.080]   Odd how that works, isn't it?
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:19.200]   That's genius.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:22.400]   See, anti-adtech is better than you.
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:26.880]   You want this machine to cook my dinner?
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:27.520]   No.
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:28.000]   No.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:28.640]   My clothes?
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.000]   I would never put windows to my dinner.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:30.560]   Draw my bed.
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:31.760]   No, that's really--
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.040]   Honestly, we're always talking about,
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:34.160]   oh, we need more stem, sir.
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:36.480]   It's stem education, research, and that's the--
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.120]   Just--
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.280]   I don't know what it's like when you were going to school.
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:42.000]   But we actually had home economics where they took you out to cook.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:43.120]   They don't teach that anymore.
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:44.640]   And it saves you a fortune.
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:46.160]   Much better for you.
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:50.160]   And then all the automated food preparation systems in the world
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:52.400]   do not taste as good as my mum's shepherd's pie.
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:54.400]   And it's just one of those things.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:56.640]   I just wondered.
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:58.880]   I just thought home automation just seems like a desert.
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:01.360]   So you think that all of these--
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:01.840]   What was it?
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:03.440]   29 million, 39 million--
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:05.920]   There was 39 million Alexa things--
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:08.800]   And Google sold a lot.
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:10.320]   A smaller number, but $10 million?
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.760]   Yes, about 10 to 15 million.
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:13.760]   So maybe 50 million devices.
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:15.360]   Look at all these devices out there.
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:19.680]   And you think that they are just going to end up unused in a month or two.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:22.000]   I think there's a very small number of people.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.520]   So you don't use yours?
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:24.080]   No.
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:25.040]   Are we talking them like--
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:25.840]   You don't use--
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:26.720]   I don't even have one.
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:27.680]   I don't have an Alexa.
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:29.360]   Are you a Siri on my iPad?
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:31.360]   So you think they'll be like the waffle maker machines.
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:32.480]   They'll just stick up in the--
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:33.520]   You buy, you get it.
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:34.320]   Oh, is that gray?
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:34.800]   I'll stick it in the middle of it.
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.640]   And eventually it's like the blooming thing talks
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:37.440]   when you don't want it to.
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.720]   So you just crush it underfoot.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:40.000]   You're like damn thing.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.440]   Oh, accidentally.
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:42.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:44.160]   So we went on a couple of--
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:46.240]   We took a weekend off, went to a hotel,
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:47.600]   and we had some people stay in the house.
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:48.320]   And I came back.
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:50.720]   All the echoes were set into the red mute mode.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:51.440]   Everyone.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:53.840]   They'd gone through the house, disabling.
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:55.760]   All the-- I have cameras in every room.
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:57.360]   I have echoes in every room.
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:59.360]   I have Google assistants in most rooms.
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:00.080]   OK.
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:00.640]   This is--
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:01.680]   But I like it.
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:02.720]   Well, the thing is--
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:05.200]   Don't you want to be able to go into your den and say--
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.800]   Alexa-- well, don't say it out loud.
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:09.520]   But Echo, turn on the den lights.
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:11.600]   No, I have a motion sensor that turns them on.
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:12.480]   I've got a--
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:13.520]   Why do I need a speaker today?
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:16.320]   OK, just roll it around the dimmer switch like that.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.320]   And it works every time.
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:20.240]   So I just have a dimmer switch.
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.920]   I just have a motion sensor.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:23.840]   And the motion sensor is programmed--
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:25.360]   Pretend to be technology lovers.
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:27.280]   No, no, I haven't taken long to--
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:28.080]   I reckon-- what I'm--
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:28.480]   I'm not-- what I'm not--
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:28.880]   I'm not-- what I'm not--
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:29.440]   Well, I think about Alexa is that they--
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:31.280]   Echo, say Echo so we don't trigger people's.
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:34.080]   The thing about the Amazon Echo is that it's fairly
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:36.080]   retarded in terms of its voice capability.
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:37.040]   It doesn't actually recognize--
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:38.720]   It's better than Siri, Mr. Siri user.
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:39.440]   Well, Siri is actually--
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:42.400]   Siri is now the special cousin of Goomba systems.
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:44.800]   Well, if you develop a Siri-- an Alexa skill,
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:47.120]   you actually have to set up all of this--
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:48.800]   like you have to say every single word pattern
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:50.480]   that it's going to recognize.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:51.120]   So you're actually--
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.840]   Only as the programmer, but once you--
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:55.280]   as a user, you turn on the skill--
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:58.320]   Which means you get this inconsistent execution, right?
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:54:59.120]   So you have to--
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:00.320]   The syntax is very common.
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:02.240]   You have to learn how to speak the language.
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:04.720]   Speak the language that the Echo is programmed.
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:08.480]   So that's not-- Siri at least is a somewhat more intelligent
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:11.320]   in the sense that it attempts to interpret what you--
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:13.400]   now, I suspect that in the long-term,
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:16.240]   Siri will eclipse because it's trying to be intelligent.
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:17.240]   No, not even a chance.
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:19.440]   Google's going to win the game here, I think, easily.
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:21.760]   I don't think people want to do business with Google.
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:22.480]   Maybe not.
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:23.280]   Same as Facebook.
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:25.360]   We're talking about the collapse of Facebook here.
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:26.120]   Do you feel--
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:26.640]   Do you feel--
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.640]   Oh, the Apple-- I mean, I understand psychologically
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:30.200]   people trust Apple, but do you think it's actually
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:31.320]   more trustworthy?
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:34.000]   I think conceptually, yes, because the financial incentive--
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.960]   The financial incentives are aligned.
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:36.760]   So in the sense that--
[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:38.080]   You're conceptually trustworthy.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:40.520]   When a big-- traditionally, Apple hasn't made a lot of money
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:41.720]   about selling your data.
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:43.120]   That hasn't been their business model.
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:45.720]   They instead spell you, send you overly expensive hardware
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:48.280]   that's bought so it doesn't work with other pieces of kit.
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:51.160]   Whereas Google and Facebook and the others are monetizing it.
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:51.640]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:54.320]   And I think Greg's absolutely wrong.
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:57.280]   There is going to be a real backlash against firms
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:00.560]   who are selling your data back to you, as opposed to firms
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:02.000]   who should say, here's a phone.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.200]   It's outrageous, expensive.
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:03.200]   So--
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:04.400]   But you might want to buy it.
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:07.400]   Did you guys pre-order an Apple home pod?
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:08.560]   Available on front-air as well.
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:10.840]   I ordered it, and then I canceled it.
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:11.640]   Why?
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.800]   Because it only works with Apple Music.
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:14.640]   Yeah.
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:15.480]   So it's--
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:18.440]   You can pull through Spotify if you're willing to jump through.
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:19.120]   And you never--
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.120]   You can use Apple to Spotify.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:22.440]   You can use Apple, which then just destroys the utility
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:22.960]   that avoids--
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.400]   Yeah, you want to be able to talk to the thing
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:25.240]   and say, play my song.
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:28.800]   So I bought a home pod and joined Apple Music, just like Apple
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:29.560]   wanted me to.
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:30.240]   Yeah.
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.240]   Good boy, Leo.
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:32.080]   Good boy.
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:36.080]   Now you tell me Apple's not predatory.
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:37.840]   I know what you're getting.
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:39.800]   I signed up for the trial for iTunes Music
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:42.920]   and got to the end of it and went like, this is just so meh.
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:43.420]   Yeah.
[00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:44.920]   I'm signed up for Spotify and I'm very proud of you.
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:45.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:47.160]   And particularly the family plan,
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:49.160]   because I've got teenage daughters who--
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:51.480]   and listening to them, listen to ads on Spotify
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:52.840]   was driving me nuts.
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:53.760]   So I felt like I--
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:54.200]   Yeah, interesting.
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.680]   --I felt like I was a really good dad at that point.
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:56.840]   The teenagers--
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:58.840]   Spotify with no ads is definitely a teenage thing.
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:56:59.360]   Let's see.
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:00.440]   Spotify?
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:01.680]   You Spotify all Spotify?
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:02.360]   No?
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:04.080]   Apple Music?
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:06.320]   Anybody use Google Music?
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:07.080]   One.
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.720]   It's the one guy.
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:09.200]   Really?
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:10.200]   One guy.
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:11.200]   Didn't Google have music?
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:12.800]   I didn't even know.
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:13.480]   You didn't know?
[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:13.980]   No.
[00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:14.980]   Google's got a great solution.
[00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:15.980]   I don't want anything to do with Google.
[00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:16.480]   Pandora?
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:17.720]   Anybody use Pandora?
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:18.220]   No.
[00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:19.560]   Nobody in the younger generation.
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:21.240]   Pandora doesn't exist in Australia.
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:22.240]   Oh, it doesn't exist?
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:22.740]   Not Australia.
[00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:23.500]   I used to use it.
[00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:24.460]   Then I used to work--
[00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:26.780]   I used to live next door to somebody from Pandora
[00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:28.460]   and he was a complete--
[00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:29.380]   Well, I can't say that word.
[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:30.660]   That's a personal reason for--
[00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:31.660]   Yeah.
[00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:33.240]   --you didn't like your neighbor.
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:33.740]   Yeah.
[00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:36.980]   I like Pandora, but I find once you have one of these services,
[00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:38.380]   they basically overlap.
[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:40.420]   Every service is roughly the same with the slightly--
[00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:40.920]   Yeah.
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:41.420]   --for instance.
[00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:42.340]   I like Spotify's playlists.
[00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:43.820]   I like it's social.
[00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:45.740]   I like the fact that from the Spotify app,
[00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:47.820]   I can play directly to my Son of Speakers.
[00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:48.320]   Yes.
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:49.340]   So I've got that.
[00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:50.340]   Well, and--
[00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:52.460]   The whole pod says they will support Spotify.
[00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:53.660]   I believe Apple will support Spotify.
[00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:54.260]   Eventually.
[00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:54.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:56.020]   Very roundabout way.
[00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:56.820]   But you like serious--
[00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:58.980]   I think Apple only supports Spotify later
[00:57:58.980 --> 00:57:59.980]   when I haven't bought the time walk now.
[00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:00.540]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:01.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:02.940]   So I think-- things I like about Spotify
[00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:04.820]   is I can point it to my Son of Speakers
[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:08.220]   and then I can be playing it on my laptop or my iMac
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:09.500]   and then pick up my iPhone.
[00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:11.820]   And there's Spotify knowing what the track list is
[00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:13.300]   and showing the streaming to the Son of S.
[00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:15.700]   So that handle feature is really quite nice.
[00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:16.900]   Well, in the biggest--
[00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:19.060]   when coming back to what you were saying earlier,
[00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:23.220]   when iTunes came out, it was the Pops packet of music players.
[00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:25.220]   It was really, really good.
[00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:26.300]   And then with each--
[00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:27.620]   Is that related to a dog's breakfast?
[00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:28.660]   They wanted to kill us.
[00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:30.940]   The Pops packet is the--
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:32.860]   The opposite of a dog's breakfast.
[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:35.100]   Well, no, the packets are different area of a dog.
[00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:36.340]   Which you probably shouldn't get in.
[00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:39.260]   It's referring to the byproducts of a puppy.
[00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:40.260]   All the instigator.
[00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:41.100]   Yeah.
[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:42.900]   First comes a dog's breakfast, then comes
[00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:43.900]   the Pops packet.
[00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:44.900]   That's it.
[00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:45.900]   That's something along those lines.
[00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:46.900]   Yes.
[00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:48.780]   They're related by time and distance.
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:49.780]   Yes.
[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:51.980]   It's the natural course of that.
[00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:53.740]   No, I think Apple Music is--
[00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:54.940]   I'm sorry, and it erupted your thoughts.
[00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:57.380]   No, no, no, it's just-- but iTunes has got progressively worse.
[00:58:57.380 --> 00:58:58.820]   Spotify has got incredibly--
[00:58:58.820 --> 00:58:59.860]   an awful lot better.
[00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:03.540]   And I think people, if you're trying to launch something
[00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:05.740]   to go in the home and you're saying,
[00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:09.140]   it must be all about Apple Music, they're limiting their audience,
[00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:11.340]   the price limits it even further.
[00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:14.020]   It's an astonishing expensive piece of kit.
[00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:15.580]   I don't like the beat service.
[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:16.580]   I think it's awful.
[00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:19.020]   Their curation of playlists and music is--
[00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:20.740]   I don't know where those people keep their taste,
[00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:22.180]   but mostly it seems to be in their pants.
[00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:23.180]   I can't.
[00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:24.180]   They're awful.
[00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:26.700]   Whenever I see someone with beats headphones, you just like--
[00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:32.100]   But if you like Apple Siri, this is the only device right now
[00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:33.100]   that you can use Siri at that point.
[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:34.100]   I don't like it.
[00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:35.100]   I don't like it.
[00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:37.220]   I don't use it barely for an except to set a timer when I'm
[00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:38.220]   picking.
[00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:39.220]   Right.
[00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:40.660]   But what I think-- what I was trying to say
[00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:43.860]   is that I think long-term Siri has got a technological advantage
[00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:46.020]   over time because it is truly intelligent.
[00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:47.980]   And Apple is not predatory.
[00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:48.420]   Yes.
[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:52.020]   And every-- well, we've seen various demonstrations of the echo.
[00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:54.980]   When you say Amazon buy me a shoehorn,
[00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:57.700]   it ships you the most expensive shoehorn, not the one you probably
[00:59:57.700 --> 00:59:58.500]   want to.
[00:59:58.500 --> 00:59:59.500]   Well, that's your fault.
[00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:02.260]   We're just not specifying.
[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:03.380]   I haven't had that problem.
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:03.900]   No.
[01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:05.460]   I was talking to somebody about it this week.
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:07.420]   He got shipped the one that was this long.
[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:08.460]   Well, that's a great one.
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:10.460]   I got a problem fiber and signed by my mother.
[01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:12.100]   And it was two and a half times the price of the cheap--
[01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:12.620]   You might want it.
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:13.620]   --of the cheapness you horned.
[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:15.220]   Usually the way it works, you say echo by me shoehorn and says,
[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:17.940]   I found this for $49.99.
[01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:18.700]   Would you like it?
[01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:21.460]   And then if it says yes, then it says, give me your pin.
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:24.020]   So the guy was a little more complicit than he's admitting.
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:26.940]   That one click patent is really paying off big, right?
[01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:27.620]   Yeah.
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:30.860]   I guess I generally don't trust--
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:33.140]   I believe that all Amazon, Google, and Facebook
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:34.580]   are all predatory.
[01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:36.580]   I feel like Apple probably is too.
[01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:37.820]   I do think they are.
[01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:39.100]   But in different ways--
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:40.100]   In different ways--
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:41.020]   With different goals.
[01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:41.500]   Yeah.
[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:44.140]   And I'm being exploited in terms of paying a premium
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:45.180]   for a product.
[01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:47.020]   And I'm much happier with that deal.
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:48.380]   It's clear to me that--
[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:53.340]   Well, this Apple HomePod plus Apple Music great example
[01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:54.100]   is interesting.
[01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:57.420]   Lock-in is not particularly interested in providing great
[01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:00.220]   services, but would very much like to charge you more
[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:01.060]   for the bad services.
[01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:02.660]   I mean, they've rushed to house as well.
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:03.180]   They've rushed it out.
[01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:03.700]   Yeah.
[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:04.500]   And there are any sort of--
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:05.460]   Does it just stereo?
[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:07.700]   It doesn't do multi-remusic.
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:09.860]   They're all waiting for AirPlay 2 protocol.
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:12.220]   So AirPlay 1 protocol, if you've ever
[01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:16.220]   gotten into the mechanics of it, is really not a very good outcome.
[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:17.420]   And AirPlay 2--
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:21.180]   What is the difference between AirPlay 1 and 2, technically?
[01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:24.700]   I'm not 100% sure I can explain it, so I'm not going to.
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:25.740]   I'll say I don't know.
[01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:26.580]   I don't know either.
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:27.820]   Yeah.
[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:29.220]   There's a lot more features than multi-remusic.
[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:32.580]   AirPlay 1 was basically DLNA with some Apple.
[01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:34.540]   And it does multicast over the--
[01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:36.900]   it relies on multicast for discovery.
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:37.900]   It does.
[01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:38.700]   No one does.
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:39.180]   No one does.
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:41.860]   That's how it discovers all the devices in the system and stuff.
[01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:43.740]   But I think that AirPlay 2--
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:46.060]   sorry, AirPlay 1 was a hardware centric.
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:47.860]   So you had to have a specific chip.
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.060]   Or you had to have a specific--
[01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:50.340]   it had to be embedded in chip.
[01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:52.860]   And you had to have it a license from Apple to put it in hardware.
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:55.060]   AirPlay 2 is going to be software.
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:59.980]   And it's going to allow you to put this in a much greater
[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:00.780]   number of devices.
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:02.460]   So AirPlay 2 is not hardware centric.
[01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:02.980]   It's software.
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:03.420]   That's exciting.
[01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:05.820]   And the Siri then will be able to be put into other people's
[01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:06.180]   devices.
[01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:11.660]   And you won't have the no answers of having to be certified
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:13.460]   by Apple, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:16.580]   We don't have a HomePod, but we have an amazing simulation.
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:20.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:24.380]   One of our engineers, Burke, loves making true to scale--
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:28.340]   not to wait, but to size models of devices we can't get.
[01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:29.820]   And this is his HomePod.
[01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:32.580]   That gives you-- it's a fairly big device.
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:34.140]   Smaller than my Sonos 3.
[01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:36.340]   It's a little bigger than the Sonos 1.
[01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:36.780]   It's smaller than my Sonos 5.
[01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:38.340]   Yeah, but it's much smaller than the Play 5.
[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:38.980]   Much more expensive.
[01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:40.540]   We have 350 bucks.
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:40.940]   Yeah.
[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:41.780]   In fact, Sonos--
[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:43.500]   That's quite a bit cheaper than a Play 5.
[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:44.940]   Well, they'll play 5, but not a Play 1.
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:48.660]   In fact, Sonos is offering two for one Play 1's for $350,
[01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:51.500]   hoping to get some of this market away from Apple.
[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:53.540]   And they've got their new smart speaker now that's
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:54.780]   got Alexa support today.
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:56.020]   And we'll have Siri support.
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:56.780]   That's the Play 1.
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:58.460]   Yeah, that's the Play 1.
[01:02:58.460 --> 01:02:59.780]   Or Sonos 1, not the Play 1.
[01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:01.980]   Sonos 1, I think it's quite--
[01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:03.260]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:06.660]   I'll tell you why I do one of my really absolute main reason
[01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:08.820]   for having a lot of Echo devices in the house
[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:12.180]   is because it's from Amazon, it can play my audio books.
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:13.460]   And all I have to do is say--
[01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:15.780]   and I do like this-- Echo read to me.
[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:18.060]   And it will pick up where I left off on my audio book.
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:19.340]   And to me, that's great.
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:21.220]   By the way, I should say all of these voice devices
[01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:22.660]   are good for podcasting.
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:23.060]   Yes.
[01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:24.020]   In every respect.
[01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:24.340]   In every respect.
[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:26.820]   Because you can finally ask for a show by name,
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:28.220]   it'll play it for you.
[01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:30.860]   And I always said podcasting isn't going anywhere
[01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:32.620]   until it's as easy to do as listen to the radio.
[01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:34.260]   Now it's actually easier.
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:35.980]   So I feel good about that.
[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:38.980]   Let's talk about Audible, our sponsor for the hour.
[01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:40.780]   We love Audible, as you know.
[01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:44.500]   I've been an Audible subscriber for 18 years now.
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:48.820]   Since 2000, I have more than 500 books in my library.
[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:50.860]   If you've never listened to audio books,
[01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:52.860]   maybe you're a little nervous about the idea of listening
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:54.780]   instead of reading.
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:59.580]   But I have to say, I am a huge fan.
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:03.340]   The readers at Audible are uniformly fantastic.
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:04.740]   Sometimes they're the author.
[01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:07.820]   But much more often, they're professionals.
[01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:09.660]   For instance, the new Andy Weir book
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:12.540]   is narrated by Rosario Dawson.
[01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:14.260]   Because as a female protagonist, he's the guy
[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:15.460]   who wrote "The Martian."
[01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:17.180]   She does an amazing job.
[01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:18.580]   The book comes to life.
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:21.260]   Now there are some authors like Neil Gaiman
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:24.140]   that you absolutely want to narrate his own books,
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:26.180]   his Norse mythologies.
[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:29.380]   He has such a great kind of posh accent.
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:30.980]   He brings it to life.
[01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:34.140]   So I really love Audible books, thousands.
[01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:36.420]   I think it's hundreds of thousands of titles across
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:37.860]   all type of literature.
[01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:40.340]   Fiction, nonfiction, periodicals.
[01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:41.260]   I try to mix it.
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:43.340]   Let me show you my current Audible library.
[01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:45.980]   You'll see there's a kind of a, by the way, I see I have
[01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:46.820]   some credits.
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:47.660]   Ooh, that's nice.
[01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:49.500]   I'm looking forward to that.
[01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:50.500]   I try to mix it up.
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:53.380]   So I'll listen to fiction and nonfiction,
[01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:55.100]   and fiction and the nonfiction.
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:56.940]   I'm listening to a book by Russell Shorto,
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:59.300]   which is the history of the American Revolution.
[01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:03.940]   In five of its actors, so six of its actors.
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:08.380]   So a slave, George Washington, a Brit.
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:10.100]   It's really into one of the British generals.
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:11.580]   Really interesting.
[01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:13.500]   Lisa listens to this.
[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:15.700]   You are a bad ass at making money.
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:16.780]   (laughing)
[01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:18.060]   By the way, this is one of the nice features
[01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:18.900]   of Audible now.
[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:19.740]   It's sports family.
[01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:22.700]   So we have, I just listened to Fire and Fury,
[01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:25.300]   the, I, Audible, of course, fantastic.
[01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:26.140]   Oh really?
[01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:27.220]   How was that?
[01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:28.580]   It's good fun.
[01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:29.420]   Yeah.
[01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:30.260]   It's good fun.
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:32.060]   I don't wanna get too political on the show, but it's--
[01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:33.740]   He's burned a lot of sources with that book.
[01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:35.860]   Yeah, Michael Wolf.
[01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:37.340]   Well, it's pretty clear when you listen to it,
[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:38.820]   his chief source was Steve Bannon.
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:39.660]   Yeah.
[01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:41.340]   And one of the things you get immediately from Steve Bannon,
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:44.860]   he's one of those guys who is verbally,
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:48.900]   like very adept, very, very fast, very funny.
[01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:49.820]   You know that guy.
[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:50.660]   Oh yeah.
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:52.780]   Who can, it's like Truman Capote or something.
[01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:54.500]   He's zing people right and left.
[01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:57.420]   And it was clear that for whatever reason,
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:59.460]   he didn't hold back with Michael Wolf.
[01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:04.460]   And so it is just full of those girl that's awesome.
[01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:07.460]   And also, what's your chief man in whose--
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:09.260]   I gotta tell somebody!
[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:11.420]   I think it's not necessarily Scarlett's gossip
[01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:12.940]   because it seems to be real.
[01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:13.780]   Yeah.
[01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:14.940]   Well, there's no evidence that this has actually--
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:18.020]   Nobody's come forward and said, yeah, I didn't say that.
[01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:18.860]   No.
[01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:20.060]   But Melania's not gonna come through and say,
[01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:22.660]   yes, I was in tears and not a joy at the election.
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:23.500]   Weird and that's fair.
[01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:24.580]   No, you'll never hear Melania say that.
[01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:26.540]   But it sure is fun to read.
[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:27.380]   Oh yeah.
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:28.300]   It's true or not, I don't know.
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:30.660]   John Lickarri, I'm on a John Lickarri kick right now.
[01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:31.700]   He's very good.
[01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:35.540]   Like a sea of spies, his new novel, fabulous, fabulous.
[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:38.820]   As you see, a lot of history, Americana,
[01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:40.580]   a 400 year old history of capitalism.
[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:43.540]   It's Buschrita's Vassen, it's really good.
[01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:44.500]   Let me give you some sci-fi
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:45.820]   'cause I know everybody's interested in sci-fi.
[01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:47.820]   Ursula K. Le Guin passed away this one.
[01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:48.980]   88 years old.
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:49.820]   It's been--
[01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:50.660]   I am rich back to--
[01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:52.380]   Which of hers would you read?
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:54.060]   Lave of heaven?
[01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:56.260]   I'd still go back to the Ose trilogy, I'm fine.
[01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:58.940]   Like I read the Ose trilogy as a teenager
[01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:01.020]   and had a massive impact on the way I--
[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:02.700]   I'm still bitter that Raymond Feist Nation
[01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:05.340]   nicked so much of that for the magician series.
[01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:06.180]   But yeah.
[01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:08.500]   You guys are much more literate about this.
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.140]   Yeah, what with her and Maki Smith
[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:12.020]   is a very bad week for creatives.
[01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:13.220]   The Wizard of Earthsea, yeah.
[01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:14.940]   The Earthsea cycle, the three books of the Earthsea.
[01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:16.660]   Start with The Wizard, which is book one.
[01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:18.220]   Yep.
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:19.860]   One of the things that Audible has done so well
[01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:22.700]   is bring back sci-fi.
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:26.100]   So in this case, recorded books for Pub did go out
[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:27.260]   and get her publisher to go along.
[01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:30.380]   But many of these classics, the Heinlein and the Azimals,
[01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:31.740]   were never recorded.
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:33.980]   Because in the '50s and '60s, there's
[01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:35.420]   no market for audiobooks.
[01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:37.140]   So they've gone back with their Frontier series
[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:39.860]   and brought back some of the best sci-fi.
[01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:42.780]   Yeah, they're the only people that carry in banks as well,
[01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:43.540]   which is a real pet thing.
[01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:44.460]   Love it, banks.
[01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:45.300]   Yeah.
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:45.980]   But they're only--
[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:47.500]   It doesn't sound stuff, I'm sure.
[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:48.980]   We want to use to, but--
[01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:49.660]   Not about you.
[01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:51.260]   Yeah, I don't know if they've got doing it now.
[01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:54.900]   But I mean, this Audible gets my wife through a commute.
[01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:57.740]   She couldn't handle an hour and a half in the car every day
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:59.220]   without a decent audio book.
[01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:02.620]   We're going to deal for you if you go to Audible.com
[01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:05.700]   and say you'll be signing up for the Gold Plus 1 plan
[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:07.420]   at audible.com/twit2.
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:08.340]   I'm sorry, let me get that right.
[01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:11.940]   Audible.com/twit2, you get two free books
[01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:14.260]   and a 30-day free trial.
[01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:15.820]   So you start off-- and I think this
[01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:18.900]   is really made for the person who, perhaps like you,
[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:21.460]   has yet to sign up for Audible because you're thinking,
[01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:23.580]   I don't know, am I going to like audiobooks?
[01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:25.140]   So I could say it's triad.
[01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:26.220]   It saved my life.
[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:28.980]   I've been an audiobook listener for--
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:32.220]   since Audible started, I think, for 18 years.
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:33.740]   And I've read hundreds of books that way.
[01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:36.260]   It's the only way now that I really get to read.
[01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:39.580]   Because there's all this dead time in the car,
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:43.660]   or doing the laundry, or walking the dog, or whatever,
[01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:44.180]   where you just--
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:45.540]   In the shower.
[01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:46.940]   I don't listen in the shower yet.
[01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:49.580]   But we actually found that a substantial proportion
[01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:51.820]   of our audience actually has a Bluetooth speaker
[01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:53.140]   stuck in the bath.
[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:55.220]   And they listen either in the shower in the water proof.
[01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:57.660]   I do actually do have all-- we have to do a waterproof Bluetooth
[01:08:57.660 --> 01:08:58.460]   speaker.
[01:08:58.460 --> 01:08:59.460]   Yeah.
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:08:59.960]   What?
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.620]   So you're just not packing it in, Leo.
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:03.460]   I clearly need to do more.
[01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:04.860]   Now my wife's begun the bath.
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:07.660]   So you know, it's just like, this is great.
[01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:10.100]   And I don't have to worry about the electrics being rotted.
[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:11.820]   And I don't have to take the phone in.
[01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:13.380]   And if we've just had a row that I can just
[01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:15.540]   hack into the Bluetooth signal and stuff, play.
[01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:17.140]   How dare you?
[01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:20.180]   Audible.com/trit2, you start off with two free books,
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:22.860]   and then you get a book credit per month.
[01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:25.500]   I'm blessed with all subscriptions.
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:28.540]   Your choice of the Daily Digest, the Wall Street Journal,
[01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:34.260]   or the New York Times Audible.com/trit2.
[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:36.420]   The only problem with Audible is once we get started talking
[01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:40.100]   about books, kind of easily derail this shit.
[01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:41.500]   I just can't.
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.900]   Do any of you guys-- you're young students.
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:45.700]   Do you ever listen to audiobooks?
[01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:46.540]   You do.
[01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:48.220]   But most of you are just reading.
[01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:50.220]   Whether your eyes are old and tired.
[01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:51.300]   Yes.
[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:53.180]   I actually encourage my kids.
[01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:56.580]   One of the research they've done is that kids, even young kids,
[01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:59.100]   who listen to books, kids books and audiobooks,
[01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:00.500]   will read more.
[01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.180]   It just gets you into books.
[01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:03.100]   No, I think it's great.
[01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:04.660]   You have to train your mind to visualize
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:05.580]   the content of a book.
[01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:06.500]   There is a skill.
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:07.820]   There is a skill to reading and visualizing.
[01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:08.820]   But once you do it.
[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:10.300]   Because you have to learn to--
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:12.380]   I learned to speed read at university.
[01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:13.940]   Are you visualizing when you speed read?
[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:15.300]   No.
[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:16.020]   Yes.
[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:16.300]   Really?
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:17.980]   Yeah, I've been speed reading for 30 years.
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:18.900]   How fast?
[01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:21.060]   Or 600 words a minute.
[01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:21.940]   4 to 600.
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:22.900]   It depends on what I'm reading.
[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:23.900]   If I'm reading it--
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:27.620]   Is it as if full and rich experiences if you read at my speed?
[01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:30.580]   I will change up the speed of 40 words per second.
[01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:33.260]   I will change up the speed according to what I'm doing.
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:34.780]   Well, I certainly skim a lot.
[01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:35.740]   If I'm skimming a lot--
[01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:37.900]   The kind of stuff we need to study for the show.
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:40.420]   I've got an RSS feed that looks like a train smash.
[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:44.060]   And so a lot of that, I speed read it 600 words a minute.
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:45.980]   There was an app on the app store that used to do that.
[01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:47.300]   You'd set the speed and then just--
[01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:48.660]   From our friend Clayton Morris.
[01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:49.160]   Yeah.
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:51.540]   And it was designed to teach you--
[01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:52.040]   To speed read.
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:52.540]   --to speed read.
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:53.500]   OK.
[01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:54.700]   Let me find the name of that.
[01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:55.980]   There's a couple of different ways to do it.
[01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:58.340]   So you need to try more than one.
[01:10:58.340 --> 01:10:59.820]   One way is to read word at a time,
[01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:01.620]   but the best way is to read a paragraph,
[01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:03.780]   like a group of words at a time.
[01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:05.340]   And so instead of I--
[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:05.980]   Read quick.
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:06.820]   Read, read, read.
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:07.860]   And I think it's--
[01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:09.140]   I'm pretty sure it's still available.
[01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:10.140]   Read quick.
[01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:11.860]   3.0.
[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:14.660]   And yeah, you get to set the speed and train yourself.
[01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:17.900]   But the weird way it works is you only see one word at a time.
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:19.380]   Yeah, I didn't like the one word at a time,
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:21.340]   because I trained to read a phrase at a time.
[01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:21.860]   Right.
[01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:24.340]   I thought like Evelyn Wood and the old speed reading glasses.
[01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:26.260]   So when you go to-- when you start off at school,
[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:28.420]   they teach you to read one word, then one word, then one word.
[01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:29.420]   Yeah, that's slow.
[01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:30.260]   That's because you're-- yeah.
[01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:33.220]   So what you want to do is read phrase, phrase, phrase.
[01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:34.860]   And you get-- if you really practice it,
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:36.220]   you can get to line, line, line.
[01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:37.260]   Yeah, that's what I want to do.
[01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:40.380]   So I can get through a trashy novel in like six hours.
[01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:42.620]   300 pages of trashy novel in six hours.
[01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:44.180]   And meanwhile, Ian is speed reading
[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:45.340]   goats licking one another.
[01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:45.980]   What is it?
[01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:46.540]   What are you doing?
[01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:47.820]   Oh, it's just something my wife said.
[01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:49.180]   Am I boring you?
[01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:49.860]   No, no.
[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:52.500]   No, I was just thinking.
[01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:54.860]   I post-stohed looking around on social media.
[01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:56.820]   You're wasting your picture of a goat licking another goat.
[01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:58.420]   Is that a love image?
[01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:00.900]   Oh, no, don't-- we not to get into it.
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:02.340]   No, no.
[01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:04.100]   Remember, bam means no.
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:05.100]   BAM!
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.100]   It's just--
[01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:09.260]   But no, it's-- I was just trying to find a picture,
[01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:11.540]   because I had to put on a social media picture myself
[01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:12.540]   in front of a bookcase.
[01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:13.860]   And somebody was just like, there's
[01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:15.300]   no way you've read all those books.
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:18.340]   And it's just like, getting this for more of them round there.
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:18.900]   Have you read them all?
[01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:19.420]   Have you read them all?
[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:20.140]   Before internet.
[01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:21.900]   Yeah, we had to read the books.
[01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:25.020]   I have a lot of books I haven't read.
[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:26.660]   I had a bad habit of buying-- even
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:28.860]   I do this with audiobooks, I'm buying them, saying I'm
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:29.580]   going to read them.
[01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:31.500]   I've weaned myself off that now with a library.
[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.180]   I'll just order them from the library.
[01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:34.340]   I've got a definite deadline.
[01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:36.180]   I have to read them by--
[01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:37.460]   because if I borrow a book from somebody,
[01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:39.980]   a chance they're not going to get it back from six months.
[01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:42.380]   It's the use of your possessions, friends' theory books.
[01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:44.020]   Yeah.
[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:44.540]   Right.
[01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:46.500]   Now I'm listening about five different books at once.
[01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:47.460]   That's another bad habit.
[01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:47.900]   I really have to--
[01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:49.860]   Yeah, I've started doing that with podcasts, listening
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:51.620]   to most of the podcast at the same time.
[01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:52.700]   Not at the same time.
[01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:54.100]   No, not at the same time.
[01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:55.100]   That would be a skill.
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:56.580]   That would be a real speed podcast.
[01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:57.580]   Yeah, podcasting.
[01:12:57.580 --> 01:12:58.580]   Podcasting.
[01:12:58.580 --> 01:12:59.700]   Yeah, that would be a skill.
[01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:01.060]   I do podcasting.
[01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:03.540]   I do listen at like 1.7 times for some of them.
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:05.620]   Are you going to buy-- it's apparently for sale,
[01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:07.180]   although my invitation hasn't come.
[01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:12.860]   The new Google $250 AI powered clips camera.
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:14.220]   No.
[01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:16.380]   They were so funny at the hardware launch
[01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:18.900]   when they announced this because they were just like,
[01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:20.340]   it's not creepy, almost.
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:21.900]   It's really not creepy.
[01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:22.740]   It's creepy.
[01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:24.580]   It's AI just leave it on.
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:26.660]   It takes photos of you when you like it,
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:28.740]   but it's definitely not creepy.
[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:29.740]   It's creepy.
[01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:31.860]   And it's just like--
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:35.500]   So you put it-- oh, so the way you train it
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:37.220]   is you get close to your subject,
[01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:39.220]   and then you put it somewhere.
[01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:42.180]   And it now knows, oh, this is who you're focusing on.
[01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:44.740]   And it will then-- what?
[01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:49.780]   Take pictures randomly and then figure out which ones are
[01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:54.060]   the best, and then upload them to your Google photos.
[01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:56.900]   Yeah, it's the idea.
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:14:00.740]   I mean, the way they pictured the launch was you would stick it--
[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:01.900]   just stick it in a bookshelf.
[01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:02.420]   Yeah.
[01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:02.820]   And it'll take--
[01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:03.660]   That's not creepy at all.
[01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:05.420]   And then just check through the--
[01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:06.300]   Just leave it there.
[01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:07.140]   See what happens.
[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:08.100]   See who's--
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:09.140]   Put it in the bathroom.
[01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:09.660]   Yeah.
[01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:10.220]   OK.
[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:11.620]   Leave around and see what was taken.
[01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:12.980]   Maybe it's just like the family's
[01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:14.300]   lolling around the living room.
[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:17.020]   Maybe it's your teenage son watching the beach volleyball.
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:19.980]   It's just-- there's all kinds of things that it could pick up.
[01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:21.740]   Oh, what fun we can have.
[01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:25.660]   They claim its AI is trained by professional photographers.
[01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:26.420]   Oh, no, sorry.
[01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:29.340]   That's-- I can't say that on that.
[01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:31.340]   I don't even know how you would train them.
[01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:32.900]   How you would say-- no, that's good.
[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:33.660]   No, that's not good.
[01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:35.700]   You've got to take your AI out for a walk every morning
[01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:36.380]   and jump it over the--
[01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:37.900]   No, no, no, bad AI.
[01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:38.860]   No, bad.
[01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:40.340]   It's one of those things that I suggest--
[01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:43.580]   I think that probably sounded good in a planning meeting.
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:46.420]   And yeah, OK, we can knock it out really cheap as well,
[01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:47.380]   just a couple of chips.
[01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:49.380]   250 bucks isn't that cheap.
[01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:51.340]   No, no, they can not do it to actually build it, though,
[01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:52.060]   as far as you say.
[01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:53.300]   Oh, we can-- build it for $10.
[01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:54.020]   We can charge to it.
[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:54.860]   Exactly.
[01:14:54.860 --> 01:14:55.060]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:56.740]   Because you've got to have all the--
[01:14:56.740 --> 01:14:59.180]   there's a sim in there that has to be a sim to do the upload
[01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:00.420]   or a Wi-Fi system.
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:01.740]   No, no, it pairs to your phone.
[01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:03.980]   It doesn't have its own connectivity.
[01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:04.740]   So it merely has--
[01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:06.780]   That is a 10 buck item that needs to--
[01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:07.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:09.260]   --to try to charge the cloud services then.
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:11.340]   Well, it's effectively a lifetime subscription
[01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:12.780]   to a photo or something.
[01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:14.260]   It's the way it's gone.
[01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:16.380]   I mean, Nexus used to be a really good brand of phone,
[01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:17.060]   because it was cheap.
[01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:19.420]   It was pretty powerful and it did everything you wanted to.
[01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:20.660]   Then they all went to Pixel.
[01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:23.540]   Oh, we'll charge Apple prices, but it's not as good as an Apple.
[01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:25.060]   Oh, us you.
[01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:26.940]   So 16 gigs of storage.
[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:29.900]   It does not go to the cloud directly.
[01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:32.580]   If you want to go to the cloud, you have to copy it to your phone.
[01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:36.700]   No removal media, of course.
[01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:37.140]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:38.540]   I'm still on the wait list.
[01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:40.860]   But people apparently were getting their invitations.
[01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:44.140]   So I'm going to-- I'm by it because I buy everything.
[01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:47.180]   Well, it kind of comes with a job.
[01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:50.340]   So I look at this and I'm thinking of the security impacts.
[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:52.340]   I was thinking, did you hear about the exercise company
[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:53.340]   Strava?
[01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:54.340]   And they--
[01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:55.140]   Yes.
[01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:55.940]   Unbelievable.
[01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:57.340]   You told me about this in the way up.
[01:15:57.340 --> 01:15:58.860]   I post the link to the--
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:15:59.780]   I'll post it to Twitter.
[01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:02.540]   So this actually--
[01:16:02.540 --> 01:16:04.820]   app a lot of athletes use runners, particularly.
[01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:06.100]   It keeps track of your runs.
[01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:07.540]   A lot of annoying people on Facebook
[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:10.540]   because I went on a three-mile run with my Strava and--
[01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:14.340]   It has, by a scenario, obviously went out and started looking
[01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:16.300]   at this excellent activity.
[01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:18.620]   And now it's tracking down military bases.
[01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:20.500]   And he's showing-- you can see the running tracks
[01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:23.220]   where these people obviously spend time on fitness.
[01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:26.460]   So is it because it's more used by the military?
[01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:27.180]   Well, yeah.
[01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:28.700]   Well, there's been people tend to a lot of jogging
[01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:29.820]   and they like to keep results.
[01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:33.820]   So yeah, if you actually look at it, then--
[01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:36.500]   when you tell me this, I couldn't believe I checked it out.
[01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:37.500]   What have you learned?
[01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:39.780]   I mean, all you're learning is where jogging tracks are.
[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:41.700]   Well, no, you've got an airport that's
[01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:43.940]   down as abandoned in Mogadishu.
[01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:46.260]   And then all of a sudden, it's-- if you look on the thing,
[01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:48.620]   it's bright red lines going all the way around it.
[01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:51.140]   Someone's exercising around the perimeter.
[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:52.340]   Just about where you put the defense--
[01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:55.420]   Is this Strava's fault or is it the user's fault?
[01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:56.020]   Let's face it.
[01:16:56.020 --> 01:16:57.180]   If you're in a--
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:58.980]   It's just standard intelligence.
[01:16:58.980 --> 01:16:59.300]   Yeah.
[01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:02.460]   I mean, honestly, if you're selling one of those bands
[01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:05.260]   to consumers, they're not going to know to turn it off.
[01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:08.740]   Yeah, but if you're in the military in a formerly closed
[01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:10.460]   Air Force base that is currently--
[01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:11.300]   Oh, you think--
[01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:13.140]   --ink secretly in recommission, you shouldn't
[01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:14.500]   be wearing that band.
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:15.460]   No, no.
[01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:18.460]   But I mean, Russian soldiers got caught like that in Ukraine.
[01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:20.420]   Russian soldiers got caught there.
[01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:21.580]   Right, Ukrainian artillery.
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:22.780]   They had that app that came out.
[01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:24.780]   The Russian intelligence released.
[01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:26.780]   Yeah, there was the ISIS guy who got snuffed out
[01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:29.860]   because he left geolocation on his Instagram feed.
[01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:31.540]   It happens.
[01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:32.940]   The Israelis found this out earlier.
[01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:34.500]   So I always poo these privacy concerns.
[01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:38.300]   But here, I think you have a legitimate reason for concern.
[01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:41.620]   If you're a freedom fighter, you might not want to be using them.
[01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:43.300]   Well, the Israelis found this out very early
[01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:45.260]   when mobile phones became more popular,
[01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:47.220]   because they found that all the servicemen were taking
[01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:48.100]   mobile phones with them.
[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:49.580]   So they could speak to their friends or family
[01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:51.100]   when they're on maneuvers.
[01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:53.860]   And they were just like, this has to stop right now.
[01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:56.260]   You don't take your own personal bit of kit
[01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:58.820]   on and on the operation because they're truckable.
[01:17:58.820 --> 01:17:59.340]   Right.
[01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:00.180]   Here's the Pentagon.
[01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:01.700]   This is kind of interesting.
[01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:05.420]   The heat map shows very little activity inside.
[01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:07.340]   But everybody's leaving the Pentagon.
[01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:08.780]   There's lots of movement outside.
[01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:11.100]   So it must be a shielded building.
[01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:11.860]   Ah.
[01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:12.060]   Right.
[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:14.340]   So that we'd be in our smarting.
[01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:15.540]   You are smart.
[01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:16.780]   They can't get any signal out.
[01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:18.300]   Actually, it's just obvious, I thought.
[01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:19.500]   But--
[01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:20.700]   OK.
[01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:21.220]   OK.
[01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:21.940]   How could you miss that?
[01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:23.660]   But not as gracious as you could be.
[01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:24.660]   Yeah.
[01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:25.140]   Yeah.
[01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:26.540]   See, obviously, I'm not very smart.
[01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:27.700]   I'm never coming back here.
[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:30.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:33.540]   So the military does caution soldiers.
[01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:35.980]   You probably shouldn't be using your four square check-ins
[01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:37.940]   while you're on mission.
[01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:38.940]   Yeah.
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:40.140]   Heading over to the mess.
[01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:42.620]   You shouldn't be checking in to be the mayor of the mess.
[01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:43.620]   I'm the mayor.
[01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:45.140]   I'm the mayor of the business.
[01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:47.540]   Or whatever it is that the four square does.
[01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:49.220]   I just think-- I look at all of these things
[01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:51.660]   that I'm thinking just how quickly you could exploit
[01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:53.220]   these for nefarious purposes.
[01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:58.420]   And we've already seen a number of criminal activities
[01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:00.140]   related to fitness trackers.
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:03.460]   He went upstairs, and that way they concluded that--
[01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:04.340]   Oh, the murder case.
[01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:05.580]   The murder case.
[01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:07.380]   Now, I don't know what the outcome,
[01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:08.660]   whether the court accepted that.
[01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:09.900]   No, the court did accept it.
[01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:11.060]   It's just basically he said that he--
[01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:12.980]   Was this the hot tub murder, or was it something else?
[01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:13.500]   No, no.
[01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:17.900]   This was a guy-- I think they said that someone was accused
[01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:19.220]   of killing their partner.
[01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:21.660]   And they said they came home, and their partner
[01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:22.780]   was dead on the floor.
[01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:26.980]   And their Fitbit showed that, in fact, 20 minutes afterward,
[01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:29.100]   after he got home, then she was moving up and down
[01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:29.860]   the staircase.
[01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:31.740]   And then he was found out on the floor,
[01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:35.060]   and it was just like, did you drag the corpse up and down
[01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:36.580]   the staircase, or did you--
[01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:38.380]   I forget to tell us about it.
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:40.620]   We've got some categories of people
[01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:43.500]   who shouldn't be using trackers, murderers, members
[01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:44.820]   of the armed forces.
[01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:45.260]   Yeah.
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:46.780]   I imagine if you were a podcast host.
[01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:48.660]   If you are doing any sort of criminal activity--
[01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:49.980]   It's chasing the Fitbit.
[01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:52.700]   Take off the Fitbit and the Apple Watch.
[01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:58.100]   I just got 100,000 paces running from the police.
[01:19:58.100 --> 01:19:59.660]   From the dealers.
[01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:01.220]   Yes.
[01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:02.220]   We had some fun this week.
[01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:03.580]   This was a good week on Twitter.
[01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:05.420]   And we've decided that the best way
[01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:09.180]   to communicate that to you is to prepare a short film
[01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:10.540]   for your enjoyment, please watch.
[01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:12.500]   Flee-beously on Twitter.
[01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:15.540]   You're looking more like a lumberjack every time I see you.
[01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:17.620]   Can I just-- oh, I love it.
[01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:18.900]   That is so nice.
[01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:20.420]   I wish I could have a beard like that.
[01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:21.020]   You could.
[01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:21.620]   You could have the beard.
[01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:22.460]   That would happen if I'd say the hair.
[01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:26.140]   All the hair went into your face this week in Google.
[01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:27.460]   The Wall Street Journal had a story
[01:20:27.460 --> 01:20:29.300]   about how the internet was filling up
[01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:33.180]   because a lot of Indians are sending millions of texts
[01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:34.700]   that just say, good morning.
[01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:36.300]   They just got phones.
[01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:37.820]   And so the first thing they want to do
[01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:40.540]   is send a cheery greeting to everyone they know.
[01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:43.460]   And I just think it's funny that people are saying, good morning.
[01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:44.460]   Tech News Weekly.
[01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:48.700]   This week, Amazon opened its cashier-less store to the public.
[01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:51.420]   Walk into the Amazon go, scan your phone, grab your stuff,
[01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:53.100]   and run as fast as you can.
[01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:54.780]   After picking up and dropping things,
[01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:57.940]   I kept doing all this random crap to try to trip it up.
[01:20:57.940 --> 01:20:58.900]   Didn't work.
[01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:02.860]   So then, when I left, I just said, I don't want that yogurt.
[01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:04.500]   And I tapped refund on the yogurt.
[01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:05.620]   And I said, I didn't like it.
[01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:06.780]   And it gave me my money back.
[01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:08.460]   And then I went back for a second trip
[01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:10.100]   and just handed the yogurt to somebody.
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:11.740]   Look, I'm a journalist, all right?
[01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:12.500]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:12.820]   That's right.
[01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:15.140]   It's about ethics in yogurt journalism.
[01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:15.940]   Twit.
[01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:19.940]   Tell your boss it's job-related.
[01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:21.220]   That's a good slogan.
[01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:23.820]   I can't wait for one to use this Amazon go store.
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:26.300]   I just love the idea of just walking in and walking out.
[01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:28.620]   I think they should be on every corner.
[01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:31.220]   I mean, I feel bad for 7/11 clerks.
[01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:34.900]   Oh, that I can live with ads, but things like that.
[01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:36.900]   I'm sure you don't want that.
[01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:38.620]   Like, it wouldn't even be like,
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:39.940]   you wouldn't even have to have a storefront.
[01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:42.620]   You could just have a closet in the office or whatever.
[01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:44.060]   I mean, wouldn't you like that?
[01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:46.580]   A story you just go into, you take what you want.
[01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:48.220]   And eventually you won't have to scan your phone.
[01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:49.620]   It'll just say, well, I know it's Leo.
[01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:51.780]   I actually want my shop stack to have goods on the shelf.
[01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:53.820]   I mean, every time I go to the supermarket in the UK,
[01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:55.340]   they can't stack the shelves fast enough.
[01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:56.260]   They're half empty.
[01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:57.540]   See, there's a job opportunity.
[01:21:57.540 --> 01:21:59.140]   People can get just stock.
[01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:01.260]   They're all on the checkouts, I guess.
[01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:02.260]   That's what you're saying.
[01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:03.460]   Too many people on the checkouts.
[01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:04.340]   No, enough people.
[01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:07.460]   Hey, see, I may be a symptom of a problem
[01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:09.060]   that you can't avoid.
[01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:10.340]   First off that you're buying in bulk,
[01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:14.260]   like toilet paper and the rest of it fine.
[01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:15.380]   But for fruits and veggies,
[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:17.100]   I actually want to see them before I put them in the glass.
[01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:17.940]   You can still do that.
[01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:19.060]   No, you go in, you squeeze it, you choose it,
[01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:20.220]   you take it with you.
[01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:21.860]   You're doing everything.
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:22.940]   The only thing you're not doing
[01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:24.740]   is going through a checkout process.
[01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:26.340]   You're just walking out the door.
[01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:29.980]   You bring your little earthy--
[01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:31.900]   And everything's RFID tagged.
[01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:33.820]   Yes, and all cameras too.
[01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:35.420]   I mean, they have 40 or 50 cameras.
[01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:37.580]   There's an interesting thing here,
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:40.580]   in terms of data points about what Amazon knows about you.
[01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:44.780]   What happens if you pick up something?
[01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:45.620]   Put it back down?
[01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:46.380]   Put it back down?
[01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:47.420]   Does that signal--
[01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:50.300]   No, but they've got the data to say
[01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:51.780]   that you were interested in this product enough
[01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:52.220]   to pick it up.
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:53.860]   You're going to start getting coupons.
[01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:54.220]   Yeah.
[01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:56.020]   What could possibly be wrong with that?
[01:22:56.020 --> 01:22:56.900]   All right.
[01:22:56.900 --> 01:22:58.580]   Well, next time I'll buy that, Sonny.
[01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:00.100]   The next time you're on the Amazon website,
[01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:02.980]   they start retargeting you with ads around that product.
[01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:04.180]   So why would that bother you?
[01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:06.420]   Wouldn't you want ads for things you wanted?
[01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:08.340]   Rather than ads you had no interest in.
[01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:09.300]   Things you had no interest in?
[01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:12.380]   I never understood why people don't like ad targeting.
[01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:13.460]   Not that we do it.
[01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:14.700]   I mean, it's beyond creepy.
[01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:18.060]   This is one of these superhuman things again, where
[01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:19.860]   the fact that I can go--
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:21.940]   But it's so cold, because you're anthropomorphizing it.
[01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:23.620]   There's nothing creepy about it.
[01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:24.980]   You showed an interest in something.
[01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:25.900]   So we're going to show you--
[01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:27.260]   So I bought an Apple HomePod.
[01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:30.500]   I put it in the shopping basket.
[01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:32.980]   And I signaled that I had an intent to want this.
[01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:33.500]   Right.
[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:35.260]   And then all of a sudden, as I move around the internet,
[01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:36.700]   I get peppered with ads for Apple.
[01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:37.500]   It already happens.
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:38.620]   If you go to Apple and you put--
[01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:39.120]   Yes.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:39.620]   --retargeting.
[01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:40.500]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:42.420]   And you'll get-- in fact, Apple, after a few days,
[01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:43.420]   might even send you a coupon.
[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:45.980]   Say, we'll give you 10% off that HomePod you didn't buy.
[01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:46.860]   Yeah.
[01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:47.380]   Now--
[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:48.180]   What's wrong with that?
[01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:49.500]   There's a whole bunch of negative things.
[01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:52.140]   Let's say maybe you've got a fetish for diapers,
[01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:54.960]   or say something that shouldn't necessarily come out
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:58.420]   in public, some sort of personal hygiene issues.
[01:23:58.420 --> 01:23:59.540]   It's not a human.
[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:00.780]   It's just a machine.
[01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:02.780]   It doesn't judge.
[01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:03.540]   No, but--
[01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:05.380]   So Leo likes diapers.
[01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:06.940]   What the hell's wrong with that?
[01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:08.860]   Throw it a little baby powder.
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:10.300]   Sweeten the pot so as big.
[01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:13.060]   So you guys went to the Amazon Ghost Store.
[01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:13.500]   Oh, really?
[01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:16.980]   How old did you go in and buy something and come out?
[01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:18.420]   What was that like?
[01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:19.180]   Fantastic.
[01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:21.060]   Yeah, right?
[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:23.740]   Would you like one of those in your neck of the woods?
[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:24.380]   Sure you would.
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:26.200]   Yeah, yes.
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:27.800]   I want the money to be able to go there.
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:31.640]   Now, were any of you considering a career as a shop clerk?
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:33.640]   No, of course not.
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:34.280]   Of course not.
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:36.120]   You go to Canberra Grammar School.
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:37.760]   Yeah, they want to go in work for Amazon.
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:39.080]   Yeah, they're going to be working in that.
[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:40.520]   They're going to be designing that pot.
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:41.640]   I've found Amazon.
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:43.080]   Don't work for it.
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:45.920]   Did you try to shoplift anything?
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:46.760]   You did.
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:47.720]   You're very honest.
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:49.520]   And what happened?
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:50.720]   Well, they charged you.
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:53.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:55.380]   So you couldn't?
[01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:56.700]   You tried to walk out the door.
[01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:58.620]   Now, did you have to scan your phone going in?
[01:24:58.620 --> 01:24:59.420]   How did that work?
[01:24:59.420 --> 01:24:59.920]   You did.
[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:00.860]   Scan your phone going in.
[01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:01.420]   Yep.
[01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:04.940]   And then you go and you look around and has cameras.
[01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:07.820]   And most of the products have a little special sort of barcode.
[01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:08.300]   On them.
[01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:09.300]   Did it have a price on it?
[01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:10.980]   I mean, do you know what you're going to pay for it?
[01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:11.860]   It's just like a normal shot.
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:12.820]   Just like a normal shot.
[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:13.320]   OK.
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:15.300]   And then you walk in and scan your phone.
[01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:15.800]   Yeah.
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:16.540]   And then you just walk out.
[01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:19.100]   Did they have Marmite or Vegemite?
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:19.580]   Doubt it.
[01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:20.580]   See it.
[01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:22.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:23.980]   Wow.
[01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:25.960]   By the way, thank you for the Vegemite.
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.720]   We've been--
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:30.160]   because I have a guy from the UK and a guy from Australia.
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:31.240]   Although you live in the UK now.
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:31.840]   I do now, yeah.
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:32.920]   And you live in the US now.
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:33.420]   Yeah.
[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:35.200]   I'm totally questions.
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:39.520]   But nominally, you would be a Marmite fan, mystery-intoxed.
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:41.000]   I was born and raised on the stuff.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.640]   And nominally, you would be a Vegemite fan.
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:44.640]   I am a Vegemite kid, born and raised.
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:45.920]   Born and raised.
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:48.840]   And I, having never tried either, find them disgusting.
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:49.960]   Boom, there it is.
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:50.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:52.480]   We can both agree on that one.
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:56.020]   So obviously, this is obviously this consumption
[01:25:56.020 --> 01:26:00.940]   of yeast beverages to go on your carbohydrates.
[01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:03.700]   Toast is the only way to make it as hot toast with butter.
[01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:04.500]   You know what?
[01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:06.020]   It's actually delicious.
[01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:07.180]   It has a charm.
[01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:08.980]   I really like both of them.
[01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:10.300]   Just a very high insult.
[01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:11.300]   It's not salty.
[01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:11.800]   It is salty.
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:12.460]   It's very salty.
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:13.140]   It's high sodium.
[01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:14.100]   So you can't have a lot.
[01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:14.980]   My wife got a lover.
[01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:16.340]   She tried Marmite twice.
[01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:18.300]   And then she's just like, you know what?
[01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:19.340]   I've tried it twice.
[01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:20.540]   I know I don't like it.
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:21.740]   So just get that stuff away from it.
[01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:24.200]   What's fascinating are show today brought to you by Marmite.
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:26.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:27.600]   I would love--
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:28.520]   I don't think it's--
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:29.480]   The first podcast.
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:30.440]   The whole market for that.
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:32.840]   I would love to be the first podcast to get--
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:34.160]   hey, Marmite or Vegemite.
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:34.640]   Marmite or Vegemite.
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:35.480]   I'm not particular.
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:37.800]   I'm going to contact Procter and Gamble on Monday and--
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:39.200]   Oh, Procter and Gamble doesn't.
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:42.840]   You know, Mondeles, for a while, owned Vegemite, I think.
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:45.240]   But they sold it to an Australian consortium,
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:47.240]   as it should be.
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:49.480]   Yeah, they've all been acquired by various brands.
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:50.720]   Now, can you use Vegemite in the same way
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:51.220]   as well?
[01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:53.020]   I think it's like Vegemite roast potatoes.
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:53.520]   So--
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:54.020]   Yeah.
[01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:56.020]   Mm.
[01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:58.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:58.020 --> 01:26:59.420]   You just got this far away looking your eye.
[01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:00.540]   For those of you who have no idea,
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:04.420]   this is a spread made out of the byproduct of yeast,
[01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:05.980]   of brewing beer.
[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:07.580]   It's the yeast byproduct.
[01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:09.580]   It's not even fresh.
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:11.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:17.140]   It says yeast extract from yeast grown on barley and wheat.
[01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:18.140]   That's a euphemism for beer.
[01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:20.460]   Can't I be any worse than things like kombucha or--
[01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:20.960]   Yeah.
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:21.680]   No, certainly no.
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:22.520]   It's not for many.
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:25.680]   Well, that Giuseiro, who's trying to do the rolls, rolls,
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:25.680]   or things like--
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:26.680]   This thing is raw water.
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:27.180]   I don't know.
[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:28.240]   Could you see that?
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:30.840]   It's like-- you remember color epidemics
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:32.360]   from why we don't have them anymore.
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:35.360]   Well, because you all got immunized against color,
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:36.360]   by drinking bad water.
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:37.360]   It's just like--
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:37.360]   It's just like--
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:38.360]   --at least people--
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:39.360]   --at Silicon Valley.
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:41.200]   It's just insane.
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:42.800]   Oh, it's-- it's why I love it.
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:44.720]   It's a fomenting--
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:48.160]   it's as if you had a bat of Marmite just bubbling over.
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:50.940]   It's if we took all of the genetic defects of all over the world
[01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:53.260]   and just put them in one place and just be like--
[01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:56.100]   Are you sure today brought to you by WordPress?
[01:27:56.100 --> 01:27:59.300]   If you are making a blog, a website, if you're a business
[01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:02.380]   and you don't have a website, you need to go to WordPress.
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:06.060]   WordPress.com, 29% of the whole web,
[01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:08.860]   runs on the WordPress content management system.
[01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:11.820]   I have for years, practically since WordPress started.
[01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:14.700]   But it was only recently I went to WordPress.com.
[01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:16.020]   And I have to say I love it.
[01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:17.980]   They handle the installation.
[01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:19.500]   They handle the hosting.
[01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:22.040]   They handle the updates, the security patches.
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:23.500]   So you can just focus on the thing
[01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:26.200]   you care about putting great content on the internet.
[01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:28.200]   And because WordPress.com is a community,
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:31.240]   you get more traffic, more people sharing your stuff.
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:33.720]   They have built-in social sharing automatically.
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:36.840]   So your fans or your customers can share your site
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:39.160]   on their Twitter feed, their Facebook feed.
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:40.800]   Built-in search engine optimization
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:42.520]   makes it easier for you to find.
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:43.920]   They handle the technical details.
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:46.440]   You just make a great website.
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:47.840]   You don't need an expert.
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:49.220]   You don't need an experience.
[01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:50.240]   You can do it yourself.
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:53.800]   In fact, go right now to WordPress.com/twit.
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:55.640]   And they'll guide you through the entire process.
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:58.640]   If you do have questions, a great customer support team,
[01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:01.580]   WordPress experts who are eager to help you get the most
[01:29:01.580 --> 01:29:03.560]   from your site and they're there 24 hours a day,
[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:05.500]   five days a week, Monday through Friday.
[01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:07.500]   They're even there right now on weekends too.
[01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:10.200]   Plan started just $4 a month.
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:11.320]   I have a business plan.
[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:12.160]   I love it.
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:14.680]   I can even bring my own plugins and templates.
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:17.520]   It's really worth it.
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:19.000]   WordPress.com/twit.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.800]   Create your website.
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:22.400]   Find the plan that's right for you.
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:29.160]   And get 15% off at WordPress.com/twit.
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:34.240]   Find out why 29% of the internet runs on WordPress.
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:35.760]   Tell what got started.
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:37.960]   I had a couple of attempts at blogging.
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:41.160]   And then one that finally stuck back in January 2008
[01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:43.200]   was I literally went to WordPress.com.
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:44.520]   And started easier.
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:45.040]   Yeah, it was.
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.400]   I was one of those guys probably like you.
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:47.360]   I thought I can host this.
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:48.600]   I run it on my server.
[01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:50.080]   Yeah, I'm going to--
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:52.680]   I spent so much time-- all I did was update it.
[01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:53.560]   Less time watching with--
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:55.240]   Futs with love than you actually can't.
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:57.080]   Never posted.
[01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:58.800]   But it's a good learning experience.
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:29:59.960]   It's good to run your own servers.
[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:00.920]   It definitely was.
[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:04.000]   But the real success was getting that first year
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.440]   under the belt of actually posting content on the internet
[01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:07.320]   was done.
[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:09.360]   And then I was able to move from that to--
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:09.880]   Yeah, easy.
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:11.280]   --a self-hosted site.
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:13.320]   And then build a full business around that.
[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:14.240]   Nice.
[01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:17.400]   Thank you for the plug and thank you WordPress.
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:18.840]   I want to thank WordPress, to be honest.
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:19.440]   Yeah, I mean--
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:19.720]   Me too.
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:20.600]   I always feel that way.
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:22.640]   Yeah, I love those guys.
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:23.360]   This is sad.
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:28.800]   There was a $20 million lunar X prize for the first privately
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:30.680]   finance venture to make it to the moon.
[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:32.320]   Nobody did it.
[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:33.280]   None of the--
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:35.480]   It spurred an awful lot of--
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:38.440]   There were still five remaining entrants.
[01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:41.120]   But none of them are in a positional launch by March,
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:42.160]   and that's what they would need.
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:43.400]   It's getting the launch window.
[01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:46.920]   But honestly, I don't understand why Google didn't just--
[01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:47.920]   It's $20 million.
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:48.560]   Give it to the closest.
[01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:50.520]   That's down to the closest, right?
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:53.320]   That's Sergey's billiard, the change down the back of his sofa.
[01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:54.000]   $20 million.
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:54.800]   Oh, I know.
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:56.360]   I knew I'd left that somewhere.
[01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:57.640]   But it's--
[01:30:57.640 --> 01:31:02.760]   So space I, Elmoon Express, Synergy Moon, Team Indus,
[01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:08.120]   and Hakuto each have contracts to launch their spacecraft.
[01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:10.440]   But they just didn't get it done in time.
[01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:11.600]   Harder than it looks.
[01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:12.680]   Which is where the west.
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:13.800]   This is impressive as hell.
[01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:16.720]   You got five commercial entities.
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:19.040]   Which makes Tesla quite--
[01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:22.400]   Just remind you how amazing Tesla-- not Tesla, SpaceX is.
[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:23.320]   The fact that--
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:23.920]   They're doing it.
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:24.840]   They're doing it.
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:26.920]   Long before-- these people have been at it roughly
[01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:29.560]   for the same amount of time, and so they haven't got as far.
[01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:32.280]   So partly it's to do with the money and the glamour
[01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:32.760]   that Elmo--
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:33.440]   Well, yeah, true.
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:33.960]   --rese to the game.
[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:35.760]   But you know, you can't get around the fact
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:37.920]   he's actually landing rockets on a regular basis
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:39.000]   and sending it back up again.
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.880]   That is an amazing thing to watch.
[01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:42.640]   Wow, no one's there.
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:44.080]   Yeah, that is amazing.
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:46.160]   Very much so.
[01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:50.880]   Apple now has 27 self-driving test cars.
[01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:51.320]   Is it--
[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:53.120]   They're going to just carry on throwing money
[01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:53.920]   this for a little while.
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:54.480]   Look at the money.
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:55.280]   Just kill it.
[01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:55.760]   You know--
[01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:57.160]   Look at the money.
[01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:59.120]   These are all registered with California's Department
[01:31:59.120 --> 01:31:59.960]   of Motor Vehicles.
[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:03.800]   They're all Lexus RX 450H SUVs.
[01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:05.920]   Those are popular because they have-- they're big enough.
[01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:07.560]   You could put all of that liner on the roof.
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:08.360]   Look at that.
[01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:09.320]   Look at that roof map.
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:11.440]   I've got to love California DMV because they now
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:13.640]   do a regular updated report on crash reports
[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:14.800]   from a autonomous car.
[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:15.320]   Cool.
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:18.480]   It makes doing the job so much simpler.
[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:20.640]   That's where you find all these motorcyclists and others.
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:24.080]   Well, that and generally the minute the lawsuit comes in,
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:25.400]   then we get spammed out with, I've
[01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:27.000]   just seen I'm suing these people.
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.000]   Maybe you'd like to write about it.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.320]   So we've heard that Apple's given up on itself driving
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:32.040]   ambitions, but this doesn't imply that.
[01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:33.160]   This is a--
[01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:35.320]   I think they're winding it down.
[01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:36.920]   They're winding it down by winding it up.
[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:39.720]   They have the car manufacturers are going to do it themselves.
[01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:42.720]   And they're entering the game at about the same level
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:45.040]   that people like Apple are already at.
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:46.240]   So Google--
[01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:47.840]   There's no point.
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:49.640]   Why do these Waymo not competitor?
[01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:50.560]   Google's--
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:52.480]   Yeah, but I mean--
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:53.000]   Waymo--
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.960]   You would say General Motors has an advantage.
[01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:58.640]   Yeah, but I think Google's planning
[01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:00.320]   to build the operating system and then
[01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:01.960]   sell it to the manufacturers.
[01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:04.400]   And the manufacturers are saying, yeah, well--
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:05.440]   We could just build our own.
[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:07.440]   Yeah, we've seen how well the PC hardware
[01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:08.640]   business did with Bill Gates.
[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:10.600]   So I think we'll maybe just develop our own--
[01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:12.720]   So I think it's going to be interesting to see this play out.
[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:14.200]   I think we're going to see the traditional car
[01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:16.920]   manufacturers have a go at this.
[01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:19.760]   And some of them will get it right,
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:20.880]   and some of them will fail.
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:22.520]   So it'll be--
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:25.160]   And then the ones that fail will turn to Google or Apple
[01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:28.240]   and re-license their technology to survive before they die.
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:30.440]   And so it's going to be a fight for whose operating system
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:32.480]   is going to be the one that runs across cars.
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:37.080]   The question is, is this a market where it's only one winner?
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:40.360]   So where are the network effects here
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:41.840]   that mean there's only one winner?
[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:45.800]   Or is it literally a market where BMW or Daimler--
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:47.400]   Yeah, one of the big high-end brands
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:49.760]   says, we're especially integrated with Apple,
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:51.200]   therefore you should buy us.
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:51.800]   Indeed.
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:53.800]   Or is it because they'll develop their own,
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:55.440]   which is just as good as everybody else's.
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:56.840]   It's close enough, so we'll just run that
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:58.520]   because we developed it in-house.
[01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:00.440]   And what's the cost of developing and maintaining
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:03.600]   that software, or is it better that that effort, that research
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:05.640]   and software development effort be shared resources
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:06.880]   between the car makers?
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:10.120]   So I don't think there's consensus here
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:12.800]   about what that business model looks like going forward.
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:15.080]   So we'll see a plethora of choices
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:17.760]   remain until there's some sort of guidance
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:20.040]   as to what the future model will be.
[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:22.720]   Also, like Apple and Google aren't going to make cars.
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:24.960]   So the car makers themselves are in a position
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:27.720]   to control what the outcome looks like.
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:29.600]   So Apple or Google or whoever else
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:31.720]   is going to produce a self-driving car operating system
[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:34.000]   needs to be better than what the car makers can make.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:34.560]   Yeah.
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:35.200]   So--
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:38.000]   You know, it's interesting because this might be somewhere
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.120]   for BlackBerry to play.
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:42.880]   They own QNX, which is a real-time operating system.
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:44.120]   It's a good old BlackBerry.
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:45.520]   I know, but who thought?
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:52.560]   But John Chen spoke at CES and talked about this operating
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:53.200]   system.
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:55.160]   Many car manufacturers are using it.
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:55.520]   I don't know if they have--
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:56.840]   John Chen is Marissa Meyer.
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:58.200]   He's there basically to get the best price.
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:34:59.040]   He's there to shut it down.
[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:00.960]   The best price for the assets that he can.
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:02.000]   And then just--
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.440]   QNX is an obsolete idea.
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:03.940]   Yeah.
[01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:04.600]   Is it really?
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:05.280]   Yeah, pretty much.
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:06.920]   A real-time operating system was something
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:08.840]   that we needed 20 years ago.
[01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:11.120]   So the idea is that you can--
[01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:14.220]   So Jarvis, this artificial intelligence
[01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:17.720]   that they want to put in their self-driving car software,
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:19.520]   is that's a non-starter.
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:21.000]   You don't think that's a business?
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.040]   Compared to the amount of money other people are putting
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:25.200]   into this and the amount of lead time they've got--
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:26.040]   Oh, disappointed.
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:28.120]   I thought there was a second act.
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:29.120]   In black, there is--
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:29.760]   It's possible--
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:32.400]   So QNX is effectively windows.
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:33.400]   What windows is to the PC?
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:33.920]   Oh, really?
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:33.920]   QNX.
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:35.040]   I thought it was a real-time--
[01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:35.800]   Oh, OK.
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:37.800]   It's not in any way comparable to windows in a sense.
[01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:38.360]   Not at all, but--
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:38.920]   Technically.
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:40.200]   You still need apps to run a boat.
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:40.480]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:41.840]   It's a platform.
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:45.200]   So what you're attempting to say is that QNX has a unique value
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:48.280]   as a real-time operating system inside a car.
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:49.840]   Well, why not just use Linux?
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:50.280]   Right.
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:50.840]   Why would I go and--
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:51.640]   That's why it's used Linux.
[01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:52.840]   Yeah.
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:54.960]   And you can actually-- there are real-time versions of Linux
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:55.640]   if you're into that.
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:59.420]   But it's equally just much easier to get a bigger CPU and clock
[01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:01.360]   it so fast that you actually don't need a real-time operating
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:02.280]   system.
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:02.780]   Ah.
[01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:03.760]   Right?
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:06.960]   Even with all the LiDAR data that's pouring in and all that.
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:07.360]   Yeah.
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:09.440]   So you just need a faster processor.
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:12.000]   Yeah, all better software or there are ways to work around.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.320]   It's kind of interesting to play with.
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:15.080]   You've got great cooling systems to play with,
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:18.120]   so you can run these things very hot and very hard.
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:21.440]   And when you have extra cycles, you can Bitcoin mine on the side.
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:22.440]   Yeah.
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:23.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:23.940]   Hm.
[01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:24.440]   All right.
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:25.440]   So I'm not sure that--
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:28.920]   It's like really hopeful that this was going to be the savior
[01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:29.960]   of BlackBerry.
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:30.760]   Anything's possible.
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:32.160]   I mean, I think with self-driving class,
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:33.400]   everything's still to play for.
[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:34.240]   It's all up in the air.
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:35.760]   That's why Apple's still doing it.
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:36.760]   Yes.
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:39.640]   I mean, Google's got a little bit more--
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:42.000]   But it's hard to believe that BlackBerry has
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:42.920]   a competitive advantage.
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:44.840]   I mean, what is it that's unique about it?
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:47.600]   And if they're claiming that Q and X, which is literally
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:50.720]   as a viable alternative to Linux as a competitive edge,
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:51.600]   I find that hard to believe.
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:52.520]   Interesting.
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:54.680]   So yeah, that's why I like having you guys on.
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:56.240]   I learned something.
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:59.280]   Let's talk about net neutrality, the governor of Montana.
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:01.200]   And now the governor Cuomo of New York
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:03.240]   have both signed executive orders.
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:05.600]   They didn't have to go through the legislature on this,
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:07.720]   saying, if you're going to be an internet service provider
[01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:10.880]   in our state, you must abide by net neutrality.
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:11.380]   Yeah.
[01:37:11.380 --> 01:37:14.520]   When Adjut Pai and the FCC threw out net neutrality rules
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:16.880]   a few weeks ago, one of the things they said
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:19.560]   is states can't overrule this.
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:21.960]   There can't be separate state net neutrality rules.
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:23.800]   And frankly, that kind of makes sense,
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:27.400]   because you don't want to have 50 different laws governing
[01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:29.080]   national internet service providers.
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:31.440]   It was remarkable, though, how their anti-states
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:33.280]   rights when it comes to this.
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:36.200]   Very pro-states rights when guns and abortion are involved.
[01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:37.200]   Right.
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:38.200]   It's very similar.
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:39.200]   It's very similar.
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:40.880]   It depends which industry paid the most.
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:42.760]   Yeah, basically.
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:45.280]   In any event, I think this is interesting.
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:47.960]   I don't know if there'll be a court challenge.
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:51.800]   I imagine that there will, because as we know Verizon, AT&T,
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:53.360]   oh, they love that courtrooms.
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:54.440]   Love that courtroom.
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:59.840]   And then to tie this all up, AT&T put big ads in many
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:03.800]   of the nation's newspapers saying, we need net neutrality.
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:05.400]   Wait, what?
[01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:06.200]   Well, they--
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:08.240]   That's why this spends 100 million to get rid of it.
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:09.240]   What?
[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:09.760]   What?
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:12.200]   One of the most interesting parts about the net neutrality
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:15.400]   for me is what it means-- the reason that AT&T and Verizon
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:17.440]   are so much in favor of it is not so much because they
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:18.760]   can charge more.
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:20.400]   That's certainly a part of it.
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:22.040]   But it's to do with the ad tech.
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:25.440]   So how much money they can make by selling your data about you?
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:26.200]   Well, we know this.
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:30.480]   Verizon, before these rules were enforced, Verizon put that super
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:33.240]   cookie on every single Verizon owners.
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:36.280]   The FCC was able to get them to stop, by the way.
[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:37.240]   Well, it's--
[01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:41.440]   So it's about a $75 billion business now, which is--
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:41.880]   Wow.
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:43.920]   --we're getting up to the point where the ad tech data is
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:45.640]   getting the same amount of money they make out
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:46.640]   of selling the bandwidth.
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:48.760]   So why is AT&T--
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:53.440]   By the way, AT&T was one of the telecoms that sued the FCC
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:55.720]   and overturned their original net neutrality rules,
[01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:57.640]   forced them into Title II regulation.
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:38:59.400]   So we know that they are not really
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:01.120]   in favor of internet neutrality.
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:03.520]   Why is it they took these ads out suggesting
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:06.800]   Congress should pass an internet bill of rights
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:08.280]   in favor of net neutrality?
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:09.280]   I think there's two reasons.
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:11.280]   First off is public relations.
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:11.880]   Because--
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:12.760]   Yeah, the headline is--
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:13.240]   I think you--
[01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:13.840]   --ADT supports--
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:15.440]   Yeah, they have been--
[01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:17.680]   the telcos have been a little surprised
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:19.320]   by how much people are actually starting
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:21.320]   to take care of net neutrality now.
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:23.400]   Yeah, they thought normal people wouldn't even
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:24.240]   know what it means.
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:24.800]   Exactly.
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:27.000]   But the other key reason is if you actually
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.080]   get an internet bill of rights, who's going to write it?
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:32.400]   The lobbyists are the people with the deepest pockets.
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:33.960]   So it'll be chock full of--
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:35.480]   I mean, you were telling me about a loophole
[01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:38.360]   from the 1920s, which is still in operation, Greg.
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:40.040]   These things are chock full of loopholes.
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:41.440]   I think it's really-- I think that story.
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:42.440]   Let me just tell that story.
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:44.880]   So the United States is the only country in the world
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:48.240]   that didn't regard telecoms as a public utility.
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:50.920]   I think there's like one other country or two other countries
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:53.680]   where the government didn't actually
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:55.320]   install the cables in the ground and run the telephone.
[01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:56.880]   Australia is a good example.
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:59.720]   The Australian government created Telstra,
[01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:00.600]   put in the infrastructure.
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:04.000]   They eventually kind of spun it out into private.
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:04.720]   But they started it.
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:06.080]   And in the UK, it's BT.
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:08.480]   So British Telecom was a government department.
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:10.320]   For many years, they ran all the cable.
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:11.280]   And then it was privatized.
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:15.280]   But the cable itself is owned by OpenReach,
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:17.840]   which is a government-- semi-government.
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:21.200]   But they rent the cables to over the top ISPs.
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:23.280]   See, that's the way we would like to do it in the United States.
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:24.960]   But we have an older infrastructure
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:26.000]   that was created by private.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000]   So the way it worked is that back in the days
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.920]   of Theodore Vale with the financial backing of JPMorgan.
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:33.200]   Now, this is a website called potaroo.net.
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:35.440]   This is one of the people who designs and builds in it.
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:37.920]   I would read your screen, but you have some sort
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:39.600]   of weird filter on it that prevents me
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:40.520]   from seeing what you're doing.
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:41.520]   You can see the link in the chat.
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:43.520]   OK, thank you.
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:46.160]   So the story goes-- a little over a century ago,
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:50.320]   Theodore Vale with the financial backing of JPMorgan
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:52.080]   went after the chairman of AT&T.
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:54.240]   Now, AT&T was built off the back of buying up
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:55.600]   all of the telephone providers.
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:57.600]   This is back in the days of the operators punching the cables
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:58.280]   across.
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:00.440]   And AT&T ended up with a monopoly
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:01.920]   of all the telephone operators.
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:03.480]   If you don't mind, I'm going to have a little Vegemite
[01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:04.760]   during this story, I guess.
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:05.280]   Sit back.
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:06.600]   I think that might everybody.
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:07.760]   Wow, that's a lot of Vegemite.
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:09.000]   You put it on thick.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:09.520]   That's--
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:11.280]   They told me to.
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:12.280]   You evil--
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:13.800]   Did you tell them about the drop pads and the hoop snakes
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:14.280]   as well?
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:15.280]   Respect.
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:16.360]   No, they said, don't know.
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:18.600]   You put it on like Nutella, and then it's Nutella.
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:19.040]   Yeah.
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:20.280]   Not that thick.
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:21.280]   I should scrape it then.
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:22.200]   No, no, no, no.
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:23.560]   All right, go back to potter root.
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:23.880]   Pottery.
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:24.360]   So you know--
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:25.800]   They tell me about drop bears as well.
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:26.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:28.280]   Yeah, they come out of the trees, right?
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:30.800]   So AT&T had a monopoly of all the telephone services.
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:32.800]   So what the government did was after there was a bunch
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:34.640]   of stuff going on.
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:36.760]   Vale had AT&T abandoned its commitment
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:38.680]   to the telegraph service and committed AT&T
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:40.440]   to the rather singular public mission
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:43.360]   for a private corporate entity to bring the wonder of the telephone
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:44.640]   to every American.
[01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:45.160]   Right on.
[01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:47.240]   Congress agreed and agreed are now
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:51.280]   a unique national experiment in public spirited monopoly.
[01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:51.960]   Don't you love that?
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:52.400]   Wait a minute.
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:54.560]   Public spirited monopoly.
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:55.000]   That's right.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.880]   AT&T was granted a monopoly to commercialize telephone
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:00.160]   to every single person.
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:01.040]   Was the rationale?
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:02.480]   Well, if we give them a monopoly, they'll
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:05.000]   invest and build this infrastructure
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.360]   because they can get a payback for it.
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:09.200]   They took away AT&T's monopoly in operating the telephone
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:10.640]   services and then gave them the ability
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:13.200]   to put the cable in the ground and exploit that for profit.
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:14.240]   So this--
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:15.440]   Seems like a good deal.
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:16.720]   So every other country in the world
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:18.200]   went for what's called a cop carriage.
[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:19.120]   Everybody had a shared.
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:20.800]   It was a national resource.
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:22.400]   Like the highway system.
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:23.960]   Yeah, and those things create money.
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:26.680]   So if you can communicate better, if you can transfer goods
[01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:29.400]   better, then your economy runs faster and runs harder.
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:32.360]   A government-run interstate highway system
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:34.440]   facilitates interstate commerce.
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:35.800]   There's trucks.
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:36.560]   There's cars.
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:36.880]   That's right.
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:38.720]   There'd be no Amazon if there wasn't--
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:39.600]   New estate commerce.
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:40.120]   Yeah.
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:41.720]   The Amazon didn't build the roads.
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:42.240]   The government did.
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:43.120]   Yes.
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:44.160]   So this is--
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:46.000]   For some reason, we decided a different plan for--
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.960]   Yeah, AT&T had built a monopoly in some other area.
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:50.480]   And they said, well, you can't have that monopoly.
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:51.440]   We're going to break that up.
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:53.440]   But we'll give you a prize if you'll go around.
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:53.960]   A little gift.
[01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:55.360]   So public spirited monopoly.
[01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:55.860]   Yeah.
[01:42:55.860 --> 01:42:57.200]   And so you have this unique situation.
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:00.520]   Now, AT&T then subsequently went on to be broken up
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:01.800]   into pieces.
[01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:02.320]   And--
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:03.360]   That's even a little thick for that.
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:05.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:06.080]   I wouldn't need that much for--
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:06.720]   Hang on, you're all.
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:07.640]   I love my mom, I--
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:09.360]   I'm glad you're here to protect me,
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:12.880]   because these kids told me to eat more.
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:16.640]   So it's an interesting situation where, in the US,
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:18.040]   the cables that are in the ground
[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:21.200]   belong to companies who were given government support
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:22.280]   to put them there.
[01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:24.360]   So they were given a government-granted monopoly
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:25.680]   as long as they were public spirited.
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:27.560]   Now, a lot of that-- so what you'll fundamentally
[01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:29.360]   see in over the years is the FCC, which
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:31.240]   was a custom regulatory body that
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:33.120]   was aware of these specific issues related
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:36.920]   to this technology-rich market, which is not something the FTC
[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:40.480]   or any other consumer commission is able to handle.
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:42.560]   And now that they've had all of the breaks,
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:45.640]   so there's no responsibility for them to give back.
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:47.880]   By the way, this move was kind of duplicated
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:50.200]   when the cable companies came along and said,
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:51.720]   we want to do the same thing.
[01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:51.720]   Yeah.
[01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:52.960]   There's 400 million things.
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:55.480]   And they gave them, essentially,
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:57.960]   franchises and monopolies in individual communities
[01:43:57.960 --> 01:43:59.120]   for the same reason, I think.
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:43:59.300]   Yeah.
[01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:00.880]   And they also had to do things like with cables.
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:02.720]   Public spirited monopoly.
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:04.000]   Everybody should have television.
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.960]   That's what makes America great.
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:08.680]   And if I'm AT&T or I'm Comcast, I make the argument--
[01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:09.880]   We're not getting a fair live on this.
[01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:11.560]   This is expensive.
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:13.880]   And if you want us to do this, you're
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:15.520]   going to have to give us a monopoly.
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:18.360]   What the question is, why didn't the municipal governments
[01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:20.800]   or the federal or the state government step in and say,
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:22.080]   well, no, wait a minute.
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:23.320]   We're going to do it.
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:24.760]   Well, they're trying to do it now.
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:27.080]   But then AT&T is saying, actually,
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:27.840]   we have a government--
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:29.800]   --the books in like 20, 25 states
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:31.640]   saying you can't have a municipal rule.
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:34.960]   AT&T and Verizon literally have mandated monopolies
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:35.680]   from the government.
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:37.320]   And wherever that's threatened, they've
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:39.120]   gone in by legislators.
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:39.480]   Yeah.
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:39.960]   Well--
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:40.480]   --and they're returning to those.
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:41.760]   And they're also able to take it to court
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:43.960]   and say, we have a right to this because in law,
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:45.240]   it's entirely law.
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:47.640]   So one of the interesting things about net neutrality now
[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:51.520]   is that they own the cabling infrastructure in this country
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:55.000]   and indeed have gone on to buy up the radio waves as well.
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.480]   So any chance of getting around it by, say, 5G
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:44:59.960]   means that they continue to own--
[01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:01.280]   You're still running on their back.
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:04.200]   So against that situation, the FCC scaling back
[01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:06.040]   is actually giving them back full rights
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:10.640]   to commercialize that system with no responsibility back
[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:11.280]   to society.
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:13.360]   So everything that you need to understand about net neutrality
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:14.280]   is in that frame.
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:17.040]   For no longer a public spirit monopoly, it's just a monopoly.
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:18.480]   It's a monopoly deal with it.
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:19.240]   Yeah.
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:22.240]   And a government mandated monopoly.
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:23.240]   Wow.
[01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:25.040]   But there is a precedent for it because it's
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:26.800]   how it was created in the early days.
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:28.440]   So I think you can make the argument,
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:31.120]   well, you guys have benefited from the monopoly.
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:33.760]   You've paid off the costs of doing this.
[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:39.400]   It's now time for us to use eminent domain or whatever.
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:41.480]   Now, isn't AT&T, though, essentially saying,
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:44.040]   well, let's have Congress do this.
[01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:45.800]   Well, just come to the local loop.
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:46.960]   I mean, that could solve all the things.
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:49.040]   We're never going to do that, though.
[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:51.080]   Did you see the Burger King net neutrality?
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:53.280]   Love the Whopper net neutrality.
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:56.720]   Exactly why AT&T wants to do this PR campaign
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:59.480]   because they understand that real people, normal people,
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:02.960]   not geeks like us, are understanding net neutrality.
[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:06.040]   Quite how badly they're about to get shafted, yes.
[01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:07.720]   But are they because this is one thing
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:11.360]   that a lot of people have said, including Adjut Pie, well, look,
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:14.040]   is there any violation of net neutrality?
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:14.960]   Well, it's Portugal.
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:16.280]   See how they do it there?
[01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:18.560]   They don't have net neutrality.
[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:20.360]   If you can see the Portuguese price sheet,
[01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:22.040]   it's like you want fast access to--
[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:23.160]   Yeah, that was a little bit--
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:25.200]   I think that's a bunch a little bit, though.
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:27.720]   That one was more-- it was a wireless carrier.
[01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:31.120]   And it was just saying, you're paying for data
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:32.040]   on a wireless carrier.
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:33.200]   There's caps.
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:35.800]   Well, uncap these music services if you do it.
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:36.800]   I don't think that's exactly--
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:37.320]   I think--
[01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:38.880]   I think stupid about it in the short term,
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:41.880]   but I think long term, it's just the way they will start
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:42.720]   to crack down.
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:43.880]   And it's easy for--
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:45.880]   Yes, they know that people are watching it right now.
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:48.680]   And it's also a victimless crime, in a sense,
[01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:51.040]   that if the carriers start charging more,
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:52.920]   then the consumer pays more.
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:53.960]   And that's it, right?
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:55.440]   It's not like--
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:56.040]   And the way they--
[01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:57.000]   They're already paying more.
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.440]   They very cleverly ratcheted up the costs of cable internet.
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:02.080]   I can't believe how expensive internet is in this over here.
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:02.680]   I just--
[01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:06.120]   Just the home, like, just outrageous.
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:09.840]   Pretty typically $65, $70 a month for high-speed internet
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:10.720]   through a cable system.
[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:12.960]   Yeah, and it's not the same.
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:14.960]   I think there's a couple of interesting things
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:18.440]   that I haven't seen talked about are the places.
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:21.720]   One of the things is, today, we have a lot of cloud computing
[01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:23.880]   based out of the US.
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:25.040]   It's convenient.
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:26.720]   The prices are generally cheaper here.
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:28.520]   If the bandwidth prices rack up,
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:30.920]   it's actually going to be cheaper to take business out of the US
[01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:31.920]   and put it offshore.
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:34.640]   Store your data, your Dropbox data in Ireland.
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:36.680]   Where the bandwidth is cheaper.
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:38.720]   But because there's no competition in the market here,
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:41.120]   there's no persuasion to innovate.
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:43.640]   That's why you've still got people running DSL services
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:48.040]   and why you've still got people running very slow stuff.
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:50.120]   Capitalism requires competition.
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:52.440]   Competition, frictionless and frictionless decisions.
[01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:55.000]   It's like we were talking about health care in the car.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.840]   When your leg is broken and your blood's pumping out onto the street,
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:47:59.240]   you don't actually sit there and go,
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:01.200]   "Which hospital am I going to go and visit?"
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:03.040]   I like the beds in that one.
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:05.200]   The bedpan's a global colour coordinate.
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:06.960]   They've got warmed bedpans over there.
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:08.240]   I like that one.
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:10.080]   That's not how it works.
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:13.960]   So I do think that there's possibly some serious negative impacts
[01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:16.960]   where you start moving your operations away from the US
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:17.960]   to get away from the bandwidth.
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:20.520]   And you can certainly do that on the internet
[01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:23.640]   and then still send it into the US from offshore.
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:24.920]   But it's bizarre.
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:28.200]   I mean, when time had the latest merger talks,
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:30.280]   they're saying, "Well, it's not going to harm competition
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:31.920]   because we only compete in three markets."
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:33.760]   And really, the number two and the number three,
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:35.600]   telco only compete in three markets.
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:37.440]   That doesn't look 3% in the market.
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:39.280]   That doesn't look a wee bit suspicious.
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:40.080]   Yes.
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:43.480]   It just seems to be so much leaned into what...
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:47.000]   I would expect these companies to reflect their interests
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.360]   in their statements, to slant them all.
[01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:53.080]   The problem really has been there's nobody looking out
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:56.440]   for the public's interest.
[01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:58.720]   So you're not hearing...
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:01.360]   Well, maybe here you are, but in general,
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:02.920]   you're not hearing the other side of it.
[01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:06.000]   So it's basically industry's point of view is accepted.
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.040]   These are complex issues.
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:09.560]   It's very difficult to explain the concept of,
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:12.200]   you know, multi-rate bandwidth and traffic shaping
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:14.760]   and how this is going to impact you.
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:16.960]   The Burger King actually is a good advocate.
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:17.800]   It's a good advocate.
[01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:18.920]   No, it's a really good...
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:20.880]   Yeah, everybody should watch it and it's good for Burger King,
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:22.160]   but it's also a great explanation.
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:26.440]   However, translating that into action and understanding
[01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:27.840]   is another matter entirely.
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:29.480]   And I think ultimately...
[01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:31.520]   I think the thing that this is what the telecoms are taking
[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:32.360]   advantage of.
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:33.720]   This is a highly technical topic
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:35.600]   and people really don't care that much.
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:36.440]   I think so.
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:38.000]   And the flip side of this is that the consumer interests
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.760]   are no longer represented by the FCC,
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:40.760]   the Communications Commission.
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:42.080]   They're not represented by Congress.
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:43.160]   And it's the FTC.
[01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:44.600]   It's now to the Federal Trade Commission.
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:46.240]   And the Federal Trade Commission has actually said,
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:48.480]   we just don't have the competency to understand
[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:49.800]   this technology.
[01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:52.280]   In fact, that's why we created the FCC.
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:53.880]   Because it's a specialist industry.
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:58.240]   If you want to be cynical, that's exactly why the FCC
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:00.000]   and Congress wanted the FTC to do it,
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.200]   because they couldn't.
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:02.880]   There would be no enforcement.
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:04.600]   It certainly seems to be a valid argument.
[01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:05.800]   I wouldn't say that cynical.
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:07.040]   I'd say that's exactly right.
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:09.240]   You know, it's just...
[01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:10.800]   It was a blatant power grab
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:13.000]   and it was just now,
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.520]   "Tough-flought consumers, you're on your own.
[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:16.560]   I'm just going to sit here and wait until my term ends
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:17.920]   and then go and be a lobbyist."
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:20.920]   So ultimately, this is something Congress could solve.
[01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:22.920]   Well, I think you're going to see people...
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:25.640]   Because FCC can only do what Congress mandates.
[01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:26.640]   One way or the other.
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:28.800]   In other words, Congress trumps the FCC, if you'll forgive them.
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:30.560]   I think the FCC has a certain amount of autonomy
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:31.920]   to decide what it wants to do.
[01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:33.400]   It doesn't need to refer to Congress.
[01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:35.920]   But ultimately, it's mandate comes from Congress.
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:38.280]   And Congress can instruct it...
[01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:39.280]   To act in a certain way.
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:40.720]   Or change its mandate, obviously.
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:41.720]   Or...
[01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:43.880]   And I think we might all agree that Title II
[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:46.960]   was an imperfect solution to this.
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:51.960]   If Congress were to create a sensible net neutrality plan...
[01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:54.600]   But I think ultimately...
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:56.600]   It would be considered radical, the plan that you're prescribing.
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:59.360]   No, I think ultimately, the only way you're going to solve this issue
[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:01.320]   is that the government would have to take control of the cadence...
[01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:02.320]   That's radical.
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:03.320]   Of the infrastructure.
[01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:04.320]   That's radical.
[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:06.920]   And then say, we own the physical infrastructure in the ground.
[01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:09.000]   Well, however they do that, obviously...
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.000]   That would be...
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.480]   That would be really controversial.
[01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:14.480]   I think it's an on-starter.
[01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:15.480]   I think it would be...
[01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:17.480]   I think it would go bananas.
[01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:20.480]   But then you can build a competitive capitalist market...
[01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:21.480]   Yes.
[01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:22.480]   ..or over the top where AT&T is...
[01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:23.480]   All the government just says...
[01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:24.480]   All the government just says...
[01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:27.480]   We're going to lay down fiberback burns that completely open.
[01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:29.480]   And this has also happened in Finland.
[01:51:29.480 --> 01:51:31.480]   This has also happened in North...
[01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:34.480]   Why do you have more fiber when plenty exists underground?
[01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:36.480]   It just happens to be on by sprint AT&T.
[01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:38.480]   Well, this is the problem you run into.
[01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:39.480]   But I mean...
[01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:40.480]   Just take it.
[01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:41.480]   If the government's...
[01:51:41.480 --> 01:51:42.480]   Which will never happen.
[01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:43.480]   I don't know if it's a government...
[01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:45.480]   It's not a Republican in office.
[01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:46.480]   And the thing is...
[01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:48.480]   And the thing is, if I'm AT&T in Verizon...
[01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:51.480]   And I've got all that cabling in the ground, what's my incentive to light it up?
[01:51:51.480 --> 01:51:52.480]   Right.
[01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:53.480]   Yeah.
[01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:54.480]   I have no incentive.
[01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:55.480]   Scarcity is good for them.
[01:51:55.480 --> 01:51:56.480]   Exactly.
[01:51:56.480 --> 01:51:57.480]   Because they can charge more for less.
[01:51:57.480 --> 01:51:58.480]   Yeah.
[01:51:58.480 --> 01:51:59.480]   Right?
[01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:00.480]   They don't even have to go...
[01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:01.480]   The thing that's happening...
[01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:03.480]   I think we can say, we know this is in society's best interest.
[01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:06.480]   A free and open internet promotes innovation, promotes commerce...
[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:09.480]   Much the same way an interstate highway system promotes...
[01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:12.480]   And if you keep the costs low, it allows the profits to be transferred into the companies...
[01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:14.480]   You have a better educated electorate.
[01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:15.480]   Yes.
[01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:16.480]   You have better...
[01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:19.480]   Now, if you are AT&T in Verizon, you're looking at Facebook and Google these...
[01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:21.480]   Trillion-dollar multi-billion-dollar...
[01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:22.480]   Very threat.
[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:26.480]   They feel that they should be getting money out of those businesses because they're using
[01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:28.480]   a product that they created, but they're not monetizing.
[01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:29.480]   Right.
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:34.480]   But the flip side of that is that when you get a toll road, you don't get to charge according to...
[01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:35.480]   You know...
[01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:36.480]   You don't get...
[01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:37.480]   You can charge by axles.
[01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:38.480]   You can charge by...
[01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:39.480]   Yeah.
[01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:41.480]   You can charge by size and make the case that you're doing some sort of...
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:42.480]   Right.
[01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:45.480]   But you're not giving a better quality of service to one over the other, except...
[01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:46.480]   Yeah.
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:50.480]   So I ultimately think that at some point there has to be a community interest here...
[01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:53.480]   And that seems to have been abrogated by the government generally.
[01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:54.480]   Completely.
[01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:57.480]   And it can be done because it's technical and the community hasn't really stood on...
[01:52:57.480 --> 01:53:03.480]   But the thing that really irks is the monopoly, the mandate, that is effectively a government-issued monopoly.
[01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:05.480]   Back in 1907 or whatever.
[01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:06.480]   Started back in...
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:07.480]   Yeah.
[01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:08.480]   And that sort of timeframe.
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:09.480]   But even today, that is a government-issued monopoly.
[01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:10.480]   Right.
[01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:11.480]   So we're screwed.
[01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:12.480]   Pretty much.
[01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:14.480]   Not much better in Australia, frankly.
[01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:21.480]   Well, no, in Australia, the cabling is owned by an entity, a Quango, semi-government entity,
[01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:23.480]   and then all the carriers get to rent that cable.
[01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:24.480]   Yeah.
[01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:26.480]   So you have multiple different types of providers.
[01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:29.480]   And with the costs are not particularly good in Australia.
[01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:30.480]   That's because of the size.
[01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:33.480]   You've got to remember that Australia physically is the same size.
[01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:34.480]   We have a similar problem.
[01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:36.480]   We have a very distributed population.
[01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:37.480]   Australia is...
[01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:38.480]   The same level is just...
[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:39.480]   Oh, I understand.
[01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:40.480]   In terms of square kilometers.
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:44.480]   You guys watch the railroad train video.
[01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:46.480]   What was that called?
[01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:48.480]   Where you go on the long train ride.
[01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:49.480]   Yeah.
[01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:50.480]   It was just like 18 hours of just your on that.
[01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:51.480]   You watch that?
[01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:52.480]   Was it cool?
[01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:54.480]   You'd have to speed it up a bit.
[01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:55.480]   I'm using this.
[01:53:55.480 --> 01:53:57.480]   I live there.
[01:53:57.480 --> 01:53:58.480]   Yeah.
[01:53:58.480 --> 01:53:59.480]   I live there.
[01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:00.480]   It's very soothing, I imagine.
[01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:03.480]   It's very hot and it's unpleasant.
[01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:04.480]   And it's like...
[01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:05.480]   Slow TV, they're calling it.
[01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:06.480]   Full of interest.
[01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:07.480]   There's lots of them, though.
[01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:08.480]   There's the cruise liner.
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:09.480]   There's Norwegian trains.
[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:13.480]   There's loads of people who rode through the snow and tried to go and they didn't want to.
[01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:14.480]   So forget that, Charlie, folks.
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:16.480]   We've got slow TV.
[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:17.480]   Excellent.
[01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:18.480]   Just smile as you go under.
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:19.480]   Smile.
[01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:22.480]   I honestly think this is an intractable problem.
[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:25.480]   I don't know how you solve this in the US.
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:26.480]   You know, I...
[01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:28.480]   It literally, but it dates back so far.
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:29.480]   And it's so entrenched.
[01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:33.480]   Legally, the position of these telcos is as a government mandated monopoly.
[01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:34.480]   They're locked in.
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:35.480]   And it's...
[01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:37.480]   They've been exploiting the monopoly position in parliament.
[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:41.480]   So they're actually short-circuiting your government, your democracy in a very real way.
[01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:42.480]   Clear way.
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:43.480]   Clear way.
[01:54:43.480 --> 01:54:44.480]   Yeah.
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:49.040]   For the billions we've given the telcos to develop fiber around the US, the US government
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:50.480]   could have said it's a bright, eminent debate.
[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:52.480]   We're winning large fiber line there.
[01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:53.480]   Offshoots, they're there.
[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:54.480]   Can't be done locally.
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:55.480]   Can't be done by states, though.
[01:54:55.480 --> 01:55:00.480]   It must be done by the federal government because it's a national network.
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:03.480]   Well, I guess you could do it in California alone.
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:06.480]   The challenge, I think the real problem here is that if you commercialise the internet,
[01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:08.480]   there's going to be a haves and haves not.
[01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:13.480]   And we're going to see people who live in rural areas where it's not cost-effective to build
[01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:16.480]   that internet suffer very badly.
[01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:18.480]   Or if you're in a poor area, you'll have worse bandwidth.
[01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:20.480]   And that actually doubles down on...
[01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:28.480]   But this is what's driving the spiritual networks because, you know, Tennessee had a lousy broadband infrastructure.
[01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:30.480]   And the telcos was faithful.
[01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:31.480]   We'll get round to it.
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:35.480]   The classic thing was people aren't demanding it.
[01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:39.480]   And then when the municipal said, "Right, okay, we're going to build, I think it's Chattanooga."
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:41.480]   Said, "We're going to build our own ISP."
[01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:46.480]   And it runs cheaper, it runs faster, and the telcos are deeply worried about that.
[01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:48.480]   Because if people start doing their...
[01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:51.480]   They don't have to ban the telcos or nationalise their stuff.
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:52.480]   You're just going to do it better.
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:55.480]   And once it becomes clear that governments are doing...
[01:55:55.480 --> 01:55:59.480]   Local governments are doing this better than telcos that are supposed to provide the industry,
[01:55:59.480 --> 01:56:04.480]   then that's kind of game over for the telcos argument that we are always the best at this.
[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:10.480]   Well, John Deere, interestingly, has popped up as an advocate for net neutrality because they need to see bandwidth on the farms
[01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:12.480]   so that they can automate the tractors.
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:13.480]   Right.
[01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:14.480]   We're talking about automated crops.
[01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:16.480]   That's the point, is this is good for business?
[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:17.480]   It's good for everyone.
[01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:19.480]   Everybody's business except the telcos.
[01:56:19.480 --> 01:56:23.480]   It's also good for consumers generally because we can start to look at health, telemedicine type.
[01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:25.480]   But the people it's bad for are the telcos.
[01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:26.480]   Right.
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:27.480]   And those controls us?
[01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:28.480]   The telcos.
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:29.480]   The telcos.
[01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:31.480]   Who has all the money?
[01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:34.480]   How could we change that?
[01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:35.480]   Yeah.
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:36.480]   What could we do?
[01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:41.480]   This might be one of the most important issues of our generation.
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:43.480]   What could we do to change that?
[01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:48.480]   So what you could do is transfer the cable ownership into the public domain to create a company like what...
[01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:49.480]   That's over-the-reach.
[01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:56.480]   No, it's still a private company, but it's owned 50% owned by the government, 50% owned by the public sort of thing.
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:56:57.480]   Right.
[01:56:57.480 --> 01:57:05.480]   The telcos has control by that sort of arm's length, but it's held in for the people, by the people sort of thing.
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:09.480]   And then what you do is you give AT&T and Verizon the right to use that for 50 years, say.
[01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:11.480]   Give them a 50-year license to use it for your charge.
[01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:13.480]   I'd love to see some sort of compromise work.
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:14.480]   Yeah.
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:19.480]   But the telcos would need to see that the alternative is death.
[01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:20.480]   Yes.
[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:24.480]   That you either accept this as your future or you will not be in business.
[01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:27.480]   I had hoped that 5G would give us a way out.
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:28.480]   Yeah.
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:29.480]   But it seems clearly not.
[01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:31.480]   They let that down really early on.
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:32.480]   Yeah.
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:33.480]   So 5G technology was headed in.
[01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:34.480]   I assume you were here.
[01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:35.480]   You were very bullish on 5G.
[01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:36.480]   Yes.
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:37.480]   It's going to take a while to get out there.
[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:43.480]   The telcos are literally sitting on it now to make sure it fits their model so that it doesn't get out of control from them.
[01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:48.480]   I posted a link into the chat room about this agricultural thing where different things are happening,
[01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:52.480]   but those people really, really need lots of access to data.
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:58:02.480]   Because if you're flying drones over the crops looking for the right place and then you're going to administer fertilizers and pesticides according to what, you know, they're talking per tree in a fruit tree.
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:08.480]   You're talking about specifically treating each tree as a unique element instead of by the acre.
[01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:10.480]   And you need data transfers.
[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:17.480]   And these people have mass cloud computing platforms with artificial intelligence and machine learning, blah, blah, blah, blah, cloud words, buzz words, all that sort of stuff.
[01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:18.480]   And they need bandwidth.
[01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:21.480]   And without that, farming isn't going to have a renaissance.
[01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:26.480]   And actually read Precision Ag advancing global digital agriculture.
[01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:27.480]   Okay.
[01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:28.480]   And agriculture.
[01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:30.480]   This article is in the general tone.
[01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:33.480]   There was an article specifically around John Deere.
[01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:34.480]   Interesting.
[01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:36.480]   And they made a representation to the FCC about they want to.
[01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:42.480]   Well, maybe there's hope if enough different stakeholders besides the telcos get involved and say, look, it's important to us too.
[01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:43.480]   It's important to us too.
[01:58:43.480 --> 01:58:47.480]   I think it's going to come down to when people realize it's bad for the country and bad for...
[01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:48.480]   It is.
[01:58:48.480 --> 01:58:51.480]   And even the use of the telcos bad for the country.
[01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:52.480]   But it will be slow.
[01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:55.480]   And it needs to be a wave of protest effect.
[01:58:55.480 --> 01:58:59.480]   I think you're going to see a lot more politicians running on a pro-Rantina neutrality stance.
[01:58:59.480 --> 01:59:01.480]   Well, that'd be very interesting.
[01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:07.480]   And I mean, it's not going to be the key part of that campaign, but it is going to be a part in the way that it wasn't ten years ago.
[01:59:07.480 --> 01:59:09.480]   Well, you are listening. Have a vote.
[01:59:09.480 --> 01:59:10.480]   Yep.
[01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:11.480]   Use it.
[01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:12.480]   For what it's worth to get in there and get involved.
[01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:13.480]   These guys can't vote.
[01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:15.480]   And it's only a US issue.
[01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:16.480]   Yeah.
[01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:18.480]   No one else knows the world has this.
[01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:19.480]   This is the only place who's got this problem.
[01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:20.480]   Yeah.
[01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:21.480]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:22.480]   Yes.
[01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:23.480]   It was a shock film.
[01:59:23.480 --> 01:59:24.480]   That's something a lot of people don't realize it's not a problem anymore.
[01:59:24.480 --> 01:59:25.480]   It is a US issue.
[01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:27.480]   I'll keep by fiber, says one reason.
[01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:28.480]   I'll keep by fiber.
[01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:29.480]   Right on.
[01:59:29.480 --> 01:59:30.480]   All right.
[01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:31.480]   Let's take a little break.
[01:59:31.480 --> 01:59:32.480]   Lots more to talk about.
[01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:34.480]   We haven't even gotten to Intel.
[01:59:34.480 --> 01:59:36.480]   Linus Torvalds.
[01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:38.480]   There's a battle brewing there.
[01:59:38.480 --> 01:59:39.480]   I don't...
[01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:40.480]   We could go for hours, but...
[01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:42.480]   We're going to take a break.
[01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:44.480]   I've got to take a break because...
[01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:45.480]   Well, we just have to.
[01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:48.480]   Our show today brought to you by 23andMe.
[01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:49.480]   I am a fan.
[01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:50.480]   So much so.
[01:59:50.480 --> 01:59:51.480]   I did 23andMe.
[01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:53.480]   It must have been when they first started.
[01:59:53.480 --> 01:59:55.480]   It was started by...
[01:59:55.480 --> 01:59:58.480]   I want to say Ann Wojcižski.
[01:59:58.480 --> 01:59:59.480]   Wojcižski or Ann?
[01:59:59.480 --> 02:00:00.480]   Was Ann?
[02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:05.480]   Her sister Susan runs YouTube and was married to Larry Page, right?
[02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:06.480]   Or Sergey Brin.
[02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:07.480]   It's all confusing.
[02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:14.480]   Her mom, Esther Wojcižski, rented the garage to Sergey and Larry to start Googling.
[02:00:14.480 --> 02:00:15.480]   Oh, sweet.
[02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:17.480]   And they all met there.
[02:00:17.480 --> 02:00:23.080]   Ann, who was brilliant and a microbiologist, is an entrepreneurial person.
[02:00:23.080 --> 02:00:25.480]   She started this company, 23andMe.
[02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:32.480]   The whole idea was inexpensive genetic testing.
[02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:34.480]   They figure out a way to...
[02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:36.480]   You don't have to drop blood.
[02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:37.480]   You don't have to go to a doctor.
[02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:39.480]   You literally spit into a little plastic vial.
[02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:40.480]   It's not very big.
[02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:41.480]   Take you a second.
[02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:43.480]   You send it into them.
[02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:49.480]   And based on your 23 unique pairs of chromosomes, they can tell you so much about yourself.
[02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:50.480]   It's really...
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:53.480]   You know, it's so great because it's really all about you.
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:57.480]   It's finally something all about you.
[02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:02.480]   Your genes, your genetics, your health and the ancestry survey, you'll find out where
[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:03.480]   your people came from.
[02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:05.480]   Find out how much neanderthal you have.
[02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:09.480]   You can find out who relatives online.
[02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:12.480]   You can find out if you're lactose intolerant or if your genes say you should be.
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:14.480]   Or your genetic weight.
[02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:18.480]   Oddly enough, according to 23andMe, I should be underweight.
[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:20.480]   I'm not living up to my potential here.
[02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:26.980]   But actually, what is really important is you can also read these genes and learn what
[02:01:26.980 --> 02:01:31.480]   you perhaps should do to make better lifestyle choices based on your wellness.
[02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:33.480]   I mean, this is great stuff.
[02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:37.480]   Fun, informative, and it's a great thing.
[02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:39.480]   I gave it for Christmas to my mom and my sister.
[02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:41.480]   I got to give it to my dad, my kids.
[02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:45.480]   Because when my sister texted me, she said, "I got my results back."
[02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:47.480]   And we shared our results back and forth.
[02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:49.480]   And it's fascinating.
[02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:50.480]   It is really, really great.
[02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:56.480]   23andMe's health plus ancestry kit tells you everything you need to know, more than 75
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:01:57.480]   online reports.
[02:01:57.480 --> 02:02:00.480]   And what I really like about it is they add more all the time.
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:07.480]   So in 2010, it was only in 2010 that a long brewing controversy in genetics was solved.
[02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:13.480]   Many, many scientists believed that homo sapiens never interbred with Neanderthals.
[02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:14.480]   Right?
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:16.480]   That we killed them off, but there were different species.
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:17.480]   There was no interbreeding.
[02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:22.480]   Then they found some Neanderthal genetic material, analyzed it, and whoa!
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:24.480]   They did interbreed.
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:29.480]   And as a result, a few years later, 23andMe started giving you a report on how much Neanderthal
[02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:30.480]   you have in you.
[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:31.480]   I have 4%.
[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:32.480]   I have 4%.
[02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:35.480]   10 years ago, no one even knew this.
[02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:38.480]   Like, this is amazing.
[02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:43.480]   And people who have done it in our office, the highest Neanderthal guy gets reminded about
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:45.480]   that very lot.
[02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:48.480]   I am actually lower than 68% of other 23andMe.
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:50.480]   Yeah, he's in the top 99%.
[02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:52.480]   Is he a little hairy?
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:53.480]   Is he a little bit beetle-brow?
[02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:56.480]   Is there something going on that looks a little strong?
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:02:57.480]   Is he handsome?
[02:02:57.480 --> 02:03:00.480]   Quite the opposite is what you would look at the experts in the Neanderthal.
[02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:05.080]   It's actually turning out that the Neanderthal genes that we carry were very important to
[02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:07.080]   survival of almost every instance.
[02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:09.280]   Thank goodness we interbred.
[02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:13.480]   There is more Neanderthal genetic material out there now than when the Neanderthals are
[02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:15.760]   still walking in the earth.
[02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:17.760]   Because there weren't that many Neanderthal.
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:19.760]   Yeah, there were a lot more people.
[02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:20.760]   A lot more people than there are.
[02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:22.400]   23, 23andMe.com/twit.
[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:27.120]   They've actually got a deal of $30 off each health plus ancestry kit, but it's only through
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:29.240]   the end of the month, January 31.
[02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:31.160]   So now is the time.
[02:03:31.160 --> 02:03:34.360]   23andMe.com/twit.
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:39.040]   Honestly, if you've had at all any interest in this, do it.
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:43.880]   And if your kids are studying genetics, what a great way to get them into it.
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:45.840]   They read the studies and they learn.
[02:03:45.840 --> 02:03:50.880]   You can even download the raw data and find out all sorts of stuff, search for other markers.
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:52.560]   It's I just love it.
[02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:54.040]   23andMe.com/twit.
[02:03:54.040 --> 02:04:00.440]   Wow, I don't know where to...
[02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:03.360]   Stripe is ending support for Bitcoin payments this spring.
[02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:04.360]   What a surprise.
[02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:07.080]   Have we found a use Bitcoin yet?
[02:04:07.080 --> 02:04:08.760]   Even so, I was trading a port.
[02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:10.800]   Even some drug dealers are now battling the use of it.
[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:11.800]   Oh man, I can't tell.
[02:04:11.800 --> 02:04:15.760]   It's the transaction times like two days or something and 20 bucks.
[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:17.880]   I had no way I'm going to take a Bitcoin.
[02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:19.160]   Even some drug dealers.
[02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:20.600]   That's the final indictment.
[02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:21.600]   Yeah.
[02:04:21.600 --> 02:04:22.600]   Even some drug dealers are not wanting.
[02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:27.880]   When the drug dealers are refusing your currency and now you're in...
[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:29.120]   Let's see, what else?
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:30.960]   Oh, the Intel.
[02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:32.800]   I'm sure you have something to say about this, Greg.
[02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:36.560]   What do you tell your clients about the Intel Spectre in Meltan issue?
[02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:43.240]   The most recent news is Intel saying, "Oh, whoops, our microcode fix which you'll be
[02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:48.920]   getting via a firmware update on many computers results in a quote, "higher than expected
[02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:53.480]   reboots and other unpredictable system behavior.
[02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:55.760]   They're pulling it back."
[02:04:55.760 --> 02:04:58.640]   There's no way out of this that looks good.
[02:04:58.640 --> 02:04:59.640]   It's terrible.
[02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:00.640]   It's terrible, right?
[02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:06.160]   Keep in mind here, the thing is that Intel and a group of people knew about this for more
[02:05:06.160 --> 02:05:07.680]   than a year before it went public.
[02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:08.680]   You know what?
[02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:11.360]   Steve Gibson found a paper in 1994.
[02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:12.360]   Yep.
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:13.360]   Oh, the NSA paper.
[02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:17.920]   That said, "Speculative execution, it could lead to leakage of information."
[02:05:17.920 --> 02:05:18.920]   Yep.
[02:05:18.920 --> 02:05:20.720]   This is last year.
[02:05:20.720 --> 02:05:21.720]   Yeah.
[02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:23.720]   They knew about it 23 years ago.
[02:05:23.720 --> 02:05:25.040]   Except nobody read the paper perhaps.
[02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:26.040]   Yeah.
[02:05:26.040 --> 02:05:28.880]   I mean, the thing is that the bug was actually disclosed to the Chinese government.
[02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:30.880]   Over a year ago.
[02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:31.880]   Over a year ago.
[02:05:31.880 --> 02:05:35.280]   And they still don't have a fix.
[02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:36.280]   No.
[02:05:36.280 --> 02:05:37.280]   So there's that.
[02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:38.280]   Well, there may not be a good fix.
[02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:40.560]   Is that conceivable that there's actually that no...
[02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:42.840]   Short of disabling speculative execution.
[02:05:42.840 --> 02:05:44.720]   Which would be a horrific slow.
[02:05:44.720 --> 02:05:47.200]   Well, basically all of the advances in...
[02:05:47.200 --> 02:05:48.200]   Ian knows more about this.
[02:05:48.200 --> 02:05:49.760]   You got back to 1995.
[02:05:49.760 --> 02:05:53.040]   Yeah, basically that's when you rip up Moore's law from there on.
[02:05:53.040 --> 02:05:54.040]   Oh, my God.
[02:05:54.040 --> 02:05:55.160]   So it is a huge problem.
[02:05:55.160 --> 02:05:58.680]   I think at a higher level, I think there's a few things going on.
[02:05:58.680 --> 02:06:01.440]   The one is they had over a year to find a fix for this.
[02:06:01.440 --> 02:06:02.440]   And nobody...
[02:06:02.440 --> 02:06:03.440]   Nothing.
[02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:04.440]   Somebody's fumbled.
[02:06:04.440 --> 02:06:06.440]   Like Intel obviously has fumbled the fix.
[02:06:06.440 --> 02:06:08.200]   It's conceivable that there isn't a fix.
[02:06:08.200 --> 02:06:09.480]   I think there's something they can do.
[02:06:09.480 --> 02:06:10.920]   I think some people have patched it.
[02:06:10.920 --> 02:06:13.680]   Like AWS seems to put down patches into its systems.
[02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:14.680]   Yeah.
[02:06:14.680 --> 02:06:16.720]   I mean, I think it's doable.
[02:06:16.720 --> 02:06:18.720]   I think what you got here was...
[02:06:18.720 --> 02:06:21.160]   You know, this is why Google's Project Zero was set up.
[02:06:21.160 --> 02:06:23.680]   You give companies a limited amount of time to sort this out.
[02:06:23.680 --> 02:06:25.320]   They sat on this for over a year.
[02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:28.200]   When we broke the story on the regs, then we'll people accusing us.
[02:06:28.200 --> 02:06:29.560]   "How dare you do this?"
[02:06:29.560 --> 02:06:31.240]   You know, there isn't a fix available.
[02:06:31.240 --> 02:06:32.440]   You're making everyone more unsafe.
[02:06:32.440 --> 02:06:35.840]   You want to know what unsafe is when no one knows there's a problem
[02:06:35.840 --> 02:06:37.280]   and they can just sit on it.
[02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:40.840]   And clearly it is unsafe because there was four separate research groups
[02:06:40.840 --> 02:06:42.880]   who discovered it, similar effectively,
[02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:43.880]   coherently...
[02:06:43.880 --> 02:06:45.320]   Pretty much within a couple of weeks or weeks ago.
[02:06:45.320 --> 02:06:48.400]   Now, so if there's not a hacker crew out there that's also found it,
[02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:49.720]   I'd be very, very surprised.
[02:06:49.720 --> 02:06:52.200]   I was always told the Chinese government is there.
[02:06:52.200 --> 02:06:54.600]   You might as well have just said, "Here's our backside.
[02:06:54.600 --> 02:06:56.080]   Please kick it very hard."
[02:06:56.080 --> 02:06:57.080]   You know.
[02:06:57.080 --> 02:06:59.320]   And then the exploits are out there.
[02:06:59.320 --> 02:07:00.320]   So there are...
[02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:01.320]   Well, there are.
[02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:02.320]   Now, this is news.
[02:07:02.320 --> 02:07:03.800]   So, no, it's been out ever since the day it was released.
[02:07:03.800 --> 02:07:06.240]   Well, the proof of concept.
[02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:08.320]   But there aren't any exploits in the wild.
[02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:09.320]   Yes.
[02:07:09.320 --> 02:07:10.320]   There are.
[02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:11.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:07:11.320 --> 02:07:12.320]   But we're not hearing about them.
[02:07:12.320 --> 02:07:13.320]   They're being suppressed.
[02:07:13.320 --> 02:07:16.760]   I think people are taking a line of keeping it quiet.
[02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:18.840]   Yeah, I mean, the tradition is news to me.
[02:07:18.840 --> 02:07:19.840]   We've been saying all along the way.
[02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:22.320]   At least there's no exploits out there.
[02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:23.320]   There are.
[02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:24.320]   Yeah.
[02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:26.240]   I mean, responsible disclosure generally means you don't tell anyone
[02:07:26.240 --> 02:07:31.480]   about the exploit until there's a patch available to fix it.
[02:07:31.480 --> 02:07:33.000]   And they still haven't got the patch.
[02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:37.520]   And you're right, that year-long delay, it's difficult to see how Intel could have sat
[02:07:37.520 --> 02:07:40.480]   in their hands for that long and not done a thing about it.
[02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:42.040]   I think you're right.
[02:07:42.040 --> 02:07:46.160]   They've been working at it, but they haven't found a way to patch it, which doesn't cause
[02:07:46.160 --> 02:07:47.800]   a significant process of hit.
[02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:48.800]   And I think we all said...
[02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:52.960]   Weirdly enough, the patch they apparently rushed out causes reboots.
[02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:53.960]   Yeah.
[02:07:53.960 --> 02:07:56.960]   I don't think they've been thinking about this for a year or they wouldn't know this.
[02:07:56.960 --> 02:08:00.840]   I think we're all saying the weakness in the supply chain here.
[02:08:00.840 --> 02:08:05.600]   So keep in mind, Intel makes CPUs and then reference architectures and then hands it
[02:08:05.600 --> 02:08:08.440]   over to companies to glue the boards together.
[02:08:08.440 --> 02:08:09.440]   And then they get bad.
[02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:12.600]   So HP, Andrell, there's too many people in the process.
[02:08:12.600 --> 02:08:15.600]   The supply chain's too long and unstable.
[02:08:15.600 --> 02:08:19.360]   So if Intel issues a patch today, then it has to go off to HP.
[02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:23.720]   HP has to bag it up and put it into and ship it for a desktop.
[02:08:23.720 --> 02:08:26.520]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:27.520]   And that's the weakness.
[02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:28.560]   The weakness is in this supply chain.
[02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:30.920]   So it's not only Intel, we should be blaming here at part.
[02:08:30.920 --> 02:08:34.800]   It should also be the Windows hardware makers who sort of shove the box out the door and
[02:08:34.800 --> 02:08:37.240]   say, I don't want to see you again because that costs me money.
[02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:39.080]   I want to point the finger at them.
[02:08:39.080 --> 02:08:40.080]   Intel should...
[02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:45.480]   Although if you're using a Lenovo or Dell or an HP, those companies, those big companies
[02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:46.480]   are pushing out patches.
[02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:48.240]   Apple's pushing out a patch.
[02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:49.240]   It doesn't seem to be causing...
[02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:51.080]   I haven't seen anybody complaining.
[02:08:51.080 --> 02:08:52.160]   The performance seems okay.
[02:08:52.160 --> 02:08:57.080]   Well, yes, it seems okay, but we haven't seen people saying OSX is now unstable.
[02:08:57.080 --> 02:08:58.480]   Nope, no reboots.
[02:08:58.480 --> 02:08:59.480]   No reboots.
[02:08:59.480 --> 02:09:03.600]   So it is possible to patch this or it would appear to be possible to patch this, but some
[02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:04.840]   people are fumbling the patches.
[02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:06.480]   Is it HPE and Dell and Cisco?
[02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:09.440]   But here it's Intel saying, well, we don't.
[02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:10.440]   It's our problem.
[02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:11.800]   Well, it is their problem.
[02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:13.880]   Everything's their problem for doing spec the execution.
[02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:16.680]   But the Intel has pulled back the patches that it was offering.
[02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:17.680]   Yeah.
[02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:21.080]   So I would like to know if Intel's just taking the blame for this because it's customers,
[02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:24.520]   the big makers, the big makers, they're saying, this is your fault.
[02:09:24.520 --> 02:09:26.360]   You've got to cop it.
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:27.360]   Interesting.
[02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:28.360]   And we won't see you.
[02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:30.000]   You're a big on conspiracy theories about this thing.
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:33.120]   No, I've just never heard anybody say that there are exploits in the wild.
[02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:34.120]   Yeah, no, definitely.
[02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:35.120]   There have to be.
[02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:36.120]   Have to be.
[02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:37.120]   Because the proof of concept...
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:38.120]   We just have a bit of air.
[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:40.400]   We've seen the proof of concept code and it's not...
[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:44.760]   Also, if there's acososimals about it, they'll keep it slowed out.
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:49.000]   And frankly, it's most likely that it's targeted attacks that these will be most useful for...
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:50.000]   Yeah, they'd be spearing.
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.680]   It would be spearfishing and it would be coming maybe from 3 level ACs.
[02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:56.400]   I would say hello to the DOD, GCHU, NSA.
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:09:58.280]   They would just be low.
[02:09:58.280 --> 02:10:00.720]   They probably had this for years, frankly.
[02:10:00.720 --> 02:10:03.800]   It's possible they have an exploit using this.
[02:10:03.800 --> 02:10:05.480]   It's almost certainly would have had it for...
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:07.200]   In fact, I've guaranteed it.
[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:08.200]   They've had it for a year.
[02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:10.960]   Yes, they would have known about it very early.
[02:10:10.960 --> 02:10:15.800]   If Intel comes to the government and says, look, we sold all these chips, one small problem
[02:10:15.800 --> 02:10:16.800]   with them.
[02:10:16.800 --> 02:10:20.880]   So, from a business point of view, though, there's a really interesting thing here.
[02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:26.600]   This time, Intel's had a couple of bad spells where it's fumbled badly in the past.
[02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:30.280]   But it's managed to get away with it because its competitors weren't very strong.
[02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:34.240]   And what's different this time is we've seen AMD come out with a quite a good processor,
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:37.080]   the Ryzen and the Threadripper and so forth.
[02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:39.160]   That's been very positively reviewed.
[02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:44.240]   Intel's been able to beat AMD by being a very aggressive, if somewhat unscrupulous,
[02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:47.400]   supplier of equipment, basically going to the makers and making it very difficult for
[02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:49.040]   them to buy AMD.
[02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:51.960]   But we are also seeing the arrival of ARM in the data center.
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:54.120]   That's a terrifying thought for Intel.
[02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:55.120]   Oh, yeah.
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:59.280]   Because that's the only part of their x86 business that's growing.
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:03.320]   Now, I would think it unusual if the cloud companies were to walk away from x86, they
[02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:06.560]   just have such a phenomenal commitment to that platform and that software.
[02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:10.080]   But if you're a cloud provider at this point, you're really wondering what have you done?
[02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:13.240]   You're really looking at the 64 cores or the 128 cores.
[02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:14.240]   Because now...
[02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:15.240]   It's a problem too.
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:20.360]   But you can terminate the speculative conditioning and just thread it out onto the cores.
[02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:25.520]   Because there's so many cores in there, you don't need speculative execution to get performance.
[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:32.720]   So if all of a sudden you're looking at a 6428, 256-core ARM that's clocking faster,
[02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:37.360]   like bigger, and the thing about Intel is that they clocked their processors at multiple
[02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:38.840]   high levels of gigahertz.
[02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:41.520]   So they get the straight line, the drag racing performance.
[02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:43.040]   And all of a sudden you can just start threading out.
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:44.360]   You don't need speculative execution.
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:45.440]   You just say, "This one good.
[02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:46.440]   This one."
[02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:47.440]   Does that make sense?
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:48.440]   Yep.
[02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:49.440]   So, ARM's well positioned.
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:50.440]   You have more headroom.
[02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:54.040]   And it can survive turning off speculative execution.
[02:11:54.040 --> 02:11:55.040]   It's complex.
[02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:56.040]   It's complex.
[02:11:56.040 --> 02:11:57.040]   Let's not oversimplify what is it?
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:11:58.040]   For cloud service, perhaps.
[02:11:58.040 --> 02:11:59.040]   Yeah.
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:02.400]   Let's not oversimplify what is a complex discussion.
[02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:05.600]   But we're also seeing things like ARM has SoftBank behind it.
[02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:09.320]   So it has money to throw at this problem that it never did before.
[02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:11.840]   So SoftBank bought ARM a few months ago.
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:14.880]   So they can now go out there and actually say, "Right, we're going to make a major push
[02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:16.680]   here and leverage off this."
[02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:19.360]   And AMD has a fire as a processor.
[02:12:19.360 --> 02:12:25.120]   So Intel actually needs to do something about this so that it gets in front of it.
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:29.680]   I've got a nasty feeling they're going to do exactly what they did when they got caught
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:30.680]   out by the Optron.
[02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:34.760]   And they're going to use their large war chest and their market position to say, "Fine.
[02:12:34.760 --> 02:12:36.360]   You want to go to use on their own factors?
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:37.960]   That's entirely your decision."
[02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:39.360]   Oh, those mocks in funds.
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:40.880]   Yeah, forget about those.
[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:43.360]   And the discounts you're getting on the next process, yeah, those are going on.
[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:45.280]   They have huge leverage with OEMs.
[02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:47.320]   And they've done it before and they'll do it again.
[02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:48.320]   But not with cloud companies.
[02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:49.320]   They've gotten in trouble with the EU.
[02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:50.320]   Oh, it's true.
[02:12:50.320 --> 02:12:51.320]   But not cloud companies.
[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:55.320]   Remember, the enterprise IT is no longer the dog that wags that tail.
[02:12:55.320 --> 02:13:00.280]   Is that because of things like Facebook's network solution where you build your own,
[02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:01.280]   essentially?
[02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:02.280]   You don't go to an OEM?
[02:13:02.280 --> 02:13:05.560]   Or why aren't they buying from OEMs?
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:09.920]   Yes, they're buying directly from the manufacturer in China who's typically manufacturing to their
[02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:10.920]   specific...
[02:13:10.920 --> 02:13:12.680]   But Intel's marketing money is no good to those people.
[02:13:12.680 --> 02:13:13.680]   No.
[02:13:13.680 --> 02:13:14.680]   So they don't care?
[02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:16.280]   So, well, no, they do use Intel.
[02:13:16.280 --> 02:13:17.600]   Intel spends a lot of money.
[02:13:17.600 --> 02:13:21.080]   Intel spends over a billion dollars a year contributing to the Linux kernel to make sure
[02:13:21.080 --> 02:13:24.160]   that it's optimized for the X86 CPU.
[02:13:24.160 --> 02:13:25.840]   So ARM needs to step up and start contributing.
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:28.280]   Should X86 die?
[02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:29.280]   Probably not.
[02:13:29.280 --> 02:13:30.280]   It just needs to work.
[02:13:30.280 --> 02:13:31.280]   Like I said, it works.
[02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:32.280]   Should X86 work?
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:33.280]   It's how did it...
[02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:34.280]   Great run.
[02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:36.400]   But whether or not there's something better or longer like...
[02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:40.320]   The problem is the install base is so huge that we actually going to shift into an entirely
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:43.520]   new technology is going to be a very long process.
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:45.680]   And the cloud companies are capable.
[02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:50.280]   So they can start to say over here is a group of server and run services on ARMs.
[02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:55.920]   So, for example, instead of saying up until now we've always had VMs running on X86 servers
[02:13:55.920 --> 02:14:00.760]   like the ESX hypervisor or KVM's, well, over here you might want to run a distributed
[02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:05.840]   database and there you are running the distributed database and that happens to be running on
[02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:07.600]   ARMs or your object storage.
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:13.280]   So there's no reason why the cloud companies can't actually take in the processes for specific
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:14.280]   functions.
[02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:15.280]   You just want to...
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:16.280]   You're secure for all this...
[02:14:16.280 --> 02:14:17.280]   Vegemite.
[02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:18.280]   Mommite.
[02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:19.280]   You're drinking mommite.
[02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:20.280]   I'm drinking mommite.
[02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:22.080]   Sorry, me saying mommite.
[02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:23.080]   I am drinking mommite.
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:24.720]   You were mainlining that stuff.
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:25.720]   I know.
[02:14:25.720 --> 02:14:28.480]   You're going to be like on fire for hours and hours.
[02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:29.480]   You watch it now.
[02:14:29.480 --> 02:14:31.000]   It does something to you.
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:34.120]   Before long, you'll be hanging outside supermarket.
[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:35.120]   Come on.
[02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:36.120]   Just a pop man.
[02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:37.120]   Rizzie.
[02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:38.120]   I'm hurting.
[02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:39.120]   I feel I'm in love with you.
[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:40.120]   I'm hooked.
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:41.120]   Wow.
[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:44.360]   So this has been such a great show.
[02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:49.000]   I just think we should just hire these guys and forget everybody else.
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:50.240]   This is so much fun.
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:52.760]   I'm so glad to get the brains of YouTube.
[02:14:52.760 --> 02:14:56.240]   Greg Farrow, PacketPushers, is his podcast network.
[02:14:56.240 --> 02:14:57.240]   You can catch it.
[02:14:57.240 --> 02:14:58.240]   Is it PacketPushers.net?
[02:14:58.240 --> 02:14:59.240]   PacketPushers.net.
[02:14:59.240 --> 02:15:01.240]   You can see he's got a lot to say.
[02:15:01.240 --> 02:15:02.240]   We're weird.
[02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:05.360]   We took about an enterprise IT technology on that in that channel.
[02:15:05.360 --> 02:15:06.360]   That's good stuff.
[02:15:06.360 --> 02:15:07.800]   Do you tweet on ethereal mind?
[02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:08.800]   Yes, I do.
[02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:12.200]   And maybe about stuff people would be interested in as opposed to enterprise?
[02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:18.680]   Well, I do have a lot of snark on my Twitter feed at my website that I do let my inner opinions
[02:15:18.680 --> 02:15:19.680]   run wild.
[02:15:19.680 --> 02:15:22.520]   The kings of snark in the room with me.
[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:24.240]   The snark brothers.
[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:27.080]   Because that's of course Ian Thompson's middle name.
[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:29.040]   He is at the register.co.uk.
[02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:31.840]   I forgot you guys broke the Intel story.
[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:32.840]   Yeah.
[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:37.200]   And you know, I got to give you credit because at the beginning we were saying, oh, surely
[02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:40.840]   the register is overstating the 5 to 30 percent performance hit.
[02:15:40.840 --> 02:15:42.520]   Surely it's not as bad as that.
[02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:45.800]   In every respect, your story was accurate.
[02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:51.440]   We got incredibly lucky in that when we broke it, first off we didn't hear from Intel
[02:15:51.440 --> 02:15:54.760]   for five days after first contest about this.
[02:15:54.760 --> 02:15:59.200]   We broke the story, still didn't hear from them, but then we heard from other journalists
[02:15:59.200 --> 02:16:04.280]   and financial analysts that Intel was briefing on background that this was just being made
[02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:06.320]   up by some batty British blog.
[02:16:06.320 --> 02:16:11.280]   And you know, there's going to be no performance hit.
[02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:14.120]   And they were then coming back to us like, well, listen, this is what they're saying.
[02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:15.120]   What's your evidence?
[02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:16.120]   I'm like, well, we've got this and this.
[02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:17.120]   We were absolutely right.
[02:16:17.120 --> 02:16:18.320]   It was all very complicated.
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:20.120]   And then Google God bless them.
[02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:21.560]   Came out with that report.
[02:16:21.560 --> 02:16:24.880]   Yeah, between about five and 30 percent.
[02:16:24.880 --> 02:16:28.840]   And it was an enormous, you know, some cases it's actually an understatement.
[02:16:28.840 --> 02:16:29.840]   Yeah.
[02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:35.280]   I mean, for some loads and some particular pieces of software, it's just, it's devastating.
[02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:36.280]   Yes.
[02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:44.120]   It was 250 percent on the Fortnite servers that some people cloud bills are up by 30 to
[02:16:44.120 --> 02:16:45.120]   50 percent.
[02:16:45.120 --> 02:16:46.760]   They're if you're Amazon's patch.
[02:16:46.760 --> 02:16:48.480]   Yeah, Amazon's patched.
[02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:51.680]   And they're now burning a lot more CPU and they're being charged for it.
[02:16:51.680 --> 02:16:53.520]   So customers are pretty peeved.
[02:16:53.520 --> 02:16:55.080]   I mean, I do want to call that out.
[02:16:55.080 --> 02:16:58.200]   I mean, the register is somebody who employs technically competent journals.
[02:16:58.200 --> 02:16:59.200]   Absolutely.
[02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:03.720]   And compared to other media outlets, which sort of employ people who can type.
[02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:05.360]   That's generous.
[02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:10.200]   I think I've seen the copy editing that some of them can't even type.
[02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:11.200]   Yeah.
[02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:14.240]   But I mean, this is where journalism by competent train.
[02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:15.240]   So important.
[02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:18.840]   So people, varies from what we call mainstream media.
[02:17:18.840 --> 02:17:20.800]   A big victory for the registrants.
[02:17:20.800 --> 02:17:24.080]   Why everybody should continually check out the registered.
[02:17:24.080 --> 02:17:25.560]   And the great titles.
[02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:26.560]   Oh, well, thank you.
[02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:27.560]   I mean, the great title.
[02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:28.920]   Well, we're recruiting in the US.
[02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:32.920]   So if anyone's got skills, yeah, we're looking for a software and a hardware.
[02:17:32.920 --> 02:17:35.160]   You're on the March.
[02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:36.160]   Yeah.
[02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:37.160]   Oh, yes.
[02:17:37.160 --> 02:17:38.160]   We're expanding the US office.
[02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:39.160]   This is fun.
[02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:40.160]   You know.
[02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:41.160]   That is fantastic.
[02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:44.160]   A lot of, you know, everyone in the industry is so highly pressed trained.
[02:17:44.160 --> 02:17:46.680]   They can't handle sarcasm and swearing.
[02:17:46.680 --> 02:17:47.680]   It's just.
[02:17:47.680 --> 02:17:53.000]   You need people who can say bye bye, Mr. Biker guy drove my Chevy to the lefty, but the
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:54.640]   Chevy was a rye.
[02:17:54.640 --> 02:17:55.640]   Allegedly.
[02:17:55.640 --> 02:17:56.640]   Allegedly.
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:17:58.440]   You mean somebody can write that?
[02:17:58.440 --> 02:17:59.440]   Yeah.
[02:17:59.440 --> 02:18:00.440]   Thank you both for being here.
[02:18:00.440 --> 02:18:01.440]   Thanks.
[02:18:01.440 --> 02:18:02.440]   Man, this was fun.
[02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:03.440]   I'm sincere.
[02:18:03.440 --> 02:18:04.720]   I just want to do this every week from now on.
[02:18:04.720 --> 02:18:07.920]   If we could only get you to come come into the States.
[02:18:07.920 --> 02:18:08.920]   Are you going back home?
[02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:09.920]   Here for another week.
[02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:12.280]   I've got a list of meetings all week.
[02:18:12.280 --> 02:18:14.920]   I'm reading with clients and an audience.
[02:18:14.920 --> 02:18:17.000]   So people who listen to the show.
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:18.000]   Great.

[02:18:21.560 --> 02:18:22.560]   Find those exploits.
[02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:23.560]   We want to hear about this.
[02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:24.560]   We want to hear about this.

[02:19:05.720 --> 02:19:06.720]   It's indoor.
[02:19:06.720 --> 02:19:10.520]   I've told to put it online in a cello, which I have said is very cruel.
