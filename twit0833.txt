[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   It's time for Twint this weekend tech. What a great panel. Ian Thompson, Georgia Dow.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Oh, Doctor. Lots to talk about. They're taking Jeff Bezos' wings away.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   For pretty good reason, I guess.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   The right to repair. The FTC says you've got it, but would you buy a repairable laptop?
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   And then we're going to talk about the NSO Group hacking
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   and what companies need to do to keep us safe. It's all coming up next.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   This is Twint.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   This is Twint.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   This is Twint.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   This is Twint.

[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   [Music]
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   It's time for Twint. This Week in Tech, the show where we cover the latest tech news.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And we have brought together, I think this is the all-star cast.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I think this is the Friends cast of Twitt.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Like, this is the Friends reunion of Twitt.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   We got you. Oh, and JJ Stone. Oh, Doctor of IQMZ fame. Good to see you.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I'm just here so I don't get fine. That's all.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   So you don't get fine? Fine. I'm contracting. I believe in you.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   We're not going to say anything. You just got to make sure who I said that.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I see a Super Bowl press conference. It was March on Lynch.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   March on the great March on Lynch. I'm just here so I don't get fined.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Beast Mode on Dr. Jones. There he is. Beast Mode.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Also with us speaking of Beast Mode, Georgia Dow.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   She is the therapist on the show. She's going to help us.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   She's going to make us feel better. She's on the YouTube.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I'm going to make a whole talk show now with Renee.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Is that YouTube.com/GeorgiaDow?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   You can find it on my channel, but I also do like therapist reacts videos.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Oh, nice. Psychology videos. Oh, nice. Yeah.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Therapist reacts. Yeah. They're super fun. Oh, cool.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I got something for you to react to, but first let me introduce the third member of the panel,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   all the way from Blighty, that Emerald Isle,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   the city of the big shoulders. Now I'm confusing. Ian Thompson from the register.com.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Hello, Ian.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Good afternoon to you.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Mustache list list.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   My name is Ian. My name is Luke.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   My name is Luke.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Gosh, you know, because I've been playing this new Amazon game called New World,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   and I thought, well, it's called New World.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   I should really have a character that looks like somebody from the New World in it.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   So I modeled my character after you, Ian.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   I don't...
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Derving?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   [laughter]
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Yes, I look exactly that nicely. Not a hint of a pop belly there at all.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   It's a young Ian. It's a young Ian.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Can you do your hair like that, though? Because I really liked the little things.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   A little quiff. If I could rotate, he does have a little braid behind.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Honestly, I'm getting to the point now where I'm keeping it long to avoid flash colored highlights.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Good thinking. Good thinking.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   The Comover always an option.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Actually got Amazon Game, which is in beta right now.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Comes out in August. Got a little bit of a furoy going this week because apparently...
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   It was so high quality. It was frying people's video cards.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   If you have... It's recommended, I think.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   If you have an NVIDIA GTX 3090 that you not play the game,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   hundreds of people reporting on Reddit that they're getting bricked.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   And I guess I gather the feeling is it's just overheating the cards because it's so damn good looking.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   I don't know how much Amazon paid for that.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Is it... I mean, I haven't played it, but is it that good looking to you?
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Like, does it look that great to you?
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   No. Okay. Does it?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   I almost feel like this is some kind of market.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   What is that? I mean, I've played a lot of games and I've pushed a lot of graphics and stuff on my computer.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   For you to be frying out video cards, there must be some kind of virus in this game.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   I don't know how that's...
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   I think it's just hype.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   It might just be hype. Amazon put out a statement saying,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   "There are hundreds of thousands of people who played this game and closed beta.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Millions of hours played. We've received a few reports of players using high performance graphics cards,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   experiencing hardware failure.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   We've seen no indication of widespread issues.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Well, it's only a thousand instead of a hundred thousand. I don't know.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   The new world closed beta is safe to play.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Darn it. In order to further reassure players, we will implement a patch today that caps frames per second on our menu screen.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   So you can't turn it up too high.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Usually they do have a quality thing that you can regulate, like how you want to play a game.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   You're going to play it full or 1080 or something like that.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   The fact that they don't have that's kind of weird.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   If you have a...
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Look, if you manage to score a 30-90, hard to get card because of all the Bitcoin miners and others,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   you're going to turn it all the way up, Owen.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   You're going to say, "I want the best."
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   I paid for it.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   And you shouldn't have a problem with that card, which is why it's so outlandish to me.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   I just can't even imagine that happening for...
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   But again, you know...
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   I'm going to guess...
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   ... on a Samsung phone's blown up on in your pocket all day long.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Everybody's phone was just exploding for some reason.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   I'm going to guess it seems to be with the EVA manufactured cards,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   and maybe they had a patch that didn't have...
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Maybe the heat sinks weren't attached properly or they didn't put too much thermal paste on them.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   That there was some manufacturing defect.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   That sounds better.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   The cards got overheated.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   It's a popular game and so forth.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   It looks to be.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   It's not out yet, but it looks to be a popular game.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   And as I said, I look exactly inadvertently like the only endops it in the game.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   So that's why I named the endops.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   The old endops, and there's a 90s clubbing t-shirt for us in jacket and pants.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   It seems about right.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Jeff Bezos, the former CEO of Amazon,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   launched himself into near space or space or maybe space, sort of space,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   depending on your point of view, this week in a strangely phallic rocket ship.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Wearing a cowboy hat.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Actually, I think he took the cow.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   He didn't wear a spacesuit though.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   He just wore like a blue cover all.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Well, this is it.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   I mean, now to become an astronaut, you need to be able to get into a blue cover all
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   and strap yourself into a chair, apparently.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Although, thankfully, the US has said you are not an astronaut unless you actually
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   do something useful.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   That's the funniest thing ever because it's great.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   There was, you know, Bezos, we talked about last week or maybe the week before I was.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   I hear last week, I don't think I was.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Was I here?
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   I can't remember.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   I wasn't.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   No, it was Jason Snell.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Two weeks ago, we talked about it because Blue Origin had subtweeted Richard Branson saying,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   "Well, he's not really going into space."
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   And, you know, we got bigger windows.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   And ironically, it turns out the FAA changed its definition of astronaut the day Bezos
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   went into space.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   So he's going to get honorary astronaut wings.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Which is ridiculous.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Look at any wings.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   You got to go into space.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Can you taxes?
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Yeah, pay your taxes.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   He had the bad taste.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Upper atmosphere.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   What do you think?
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Was this bad taste or not?
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Is this bad taste or not?
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   The end in the press conference he wants to, he thanked Amazon customers and employees
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   for making this possible.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   So let me answer that question first.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Let me answer that question.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Okay.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Is that tasteless?
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Is that tasteless?
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   First and foremost, you have a government contract to pay for most of your ship.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Secondly, you don't let your employees go to the bathroom.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.340]   Thirdly, half my stuff gets canceled and it doesn't come in two days, which I'm paying
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.000]   prime for anymore anyway.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Now I get stuff in a week, three weeks, four days.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   And you still charge from the same amount.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.080]   And thirdly, besides the fact you don't let people, you and your knives have a regular
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.280]   living wage.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.000]   You are one of the most worst people on the planet.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.400]   You are a cowboy hat.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.320]   You're a base of this space monkey.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.320]   You win the upper atmosphere.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.080]   You're not an astronaut.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.240]   You're not a pilot.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.160]   You are a loser that got shot in the space.
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.840]   And then you come back down here and say, I'm going to give $100 million to Van Jones
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.840]   to do whatever he wants.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.000]   How about you give all your employees a bonus?
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.960]   How about you left a bit of the bathroom with a 15 minute break that actually means
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.360]   when you go there, you get 15 minutes to go to the bathroom and come back.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.960]   How about you not fire people for sitting there being tired sitting on their feet for
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.640]   12 hours, great and have such a turnover rate so high?
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.080]   Hey, because you don't care about people.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.080]   He thinks that they're going into space.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.440]   He thanked them.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.640]   At least he thanked them.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.080]   He acknowledged that they worked hard for him.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.280]   But the real thank you is money, right?
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.280]   Yeah.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.440]   Like paying them a living wage would be a real thank you.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.160]   I don't know why did he give Van Jones $100 million.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.160]   What's up with that?
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.160]   That's charity.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.000]   He's doing fine for himself.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.840]   He gave Van Jones and Jose Andres $100 million.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.800]   Let me give him a black guy $100 million and making okay.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.920]   He gave $10 billion to the rainforest.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.360]   We don't even know what he's doing to the rainforest.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.520]   You're burning.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.320]   You want to take rich people.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:52.360]   You want to take rich people up into the upper atmosphere destroying war of the planet.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.960]   Does nothing have a catalytic converter?
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.440]   No, actually wait.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.520]   Wait, because that's one of the things the sub tweet said.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:05.160]   The blue origin spacecraft is environmentally better than the Branson because it doesn't
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.680]   pollute.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.440]   It's burning hydrogen or something.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:13.320]   The entire thing of making, like let's not pretend that going into space is a net zero.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.880]   That's not the environment.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.880]   Like they had to make it and all the technology.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.800]   That's why he doesn't get official wings.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.800]   That's not wings.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.080]   Because you can't just be a payload.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:30.120]   You have to actually do something to improve public safety, do some science, fly the thing.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.120]   You have to do something.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.480]   Maybe go through astronaut training.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:39.880]   Jim Pancy's did more for space than these rich billionaires have done.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:40.880]   I mean, this is it.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:45.840]   I mean, to become an astronaut, you've got a master two or three very highly skilled jobs,
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.960]   pilot engineer, medic, scientist, the rest of it.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.360]   You've probably got to learn two or three languages as well.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:58.040]   Just paying quarter of a million just to pop up into near space and then drop down.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.160]   That's not an astronaut anymore than if I buy time on a track.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.840]   I call myself a racing driver.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:07.360]   Well, actually, that's the more legitimate concern is that both of these guys, I think
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:15.520]   the point of this is really to create a commercial business, sending people up after the same
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.520]   way they did.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:21.680]   Yes, I think 250,000 dollars is the going price, at least on the Branson.
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.200]   It says a lot about the way that wealth is accumulated in society that people can just
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.760]   throw away quarter of a million.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.960]   It's close to burning money.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.960]   It's a burning money.
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:30.960]   Right.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:31.960]   Right.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.960]   It's literally hurting money.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.840]   It's literally burning hydrogen, but almost right close.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:42.880]   And you, Uncle Leo, as a world traveler, you've worked really hard and you are getting old,
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.280]   so you're traveling more.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:49.200]   But I remember five or six years ago, it was a great article that just blew up like wildfire.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.640]   The new wealth showing is traveling and experiences.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:53.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.000]   And going to get a restaurant.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Not things.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   It's all bay.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   But experiences.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.640]   Mount Pichu with a flower that was 18,000 years old by this village people.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.680]   Like so now they're like, shoot, we done went everywhere on the planet.
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.680]   I got a mega yacht.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:10.400]   Oh, let's shoot people into the upper atmosphere and charging a quarter billion dollars to go
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.720]   float around, which technically you can get on a plane.
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.720]   They do that stuff.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.440]   We float around the plane for a little bit.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.440]   Go do that.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.440]   Stop trying to get in space.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.440]   That's an astronaut.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.960]   Are you mad that he is building a half billion dollar boat as well?
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:24.960]   A yacht?
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.720]   I hadn't heard about the boat.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.720]   What's this?
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.720]   Well, I mean, it's got the money.
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:34.760]   It's a 417 foot super yacht worth an estimated half billion.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:38.040]   It's so big it has its own support yacht.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.960]   Half a billion dollars?
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:44.920]   It's like it's just, it just seems like, like we have people that are starving to death.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.080]   It just seems so tone death.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:52.240]   Like, we really have to start to rethink the way that we think about our society, that
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.960]   it really like, yes, we're hardwired to just want more because it used to be that there
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.520]   wasn't enough and we weren't going to be able to gather everything.
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.040]   But now it just seems like some people want to take everything.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:06.080]   And I'm happy that people are angry about billionaires existing.
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.600]   I'm done with it.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.560]   Like if you're not going to be actually trying to make the world a better place, what kind
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.360]   of mark are you really leaving on it?
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.360]   Like it shouldn't be a joke.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.880]   Should we not allow billionaires?
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:16.880]   We should tax them.
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:17.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.640]   Like you should at least be paying the taxes.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.400]   We should get rid of the loopholes and then see what the hell happens when they're actually
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.960]   paying for what they should be their fair share.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.520]   And the debt in the notion of tax in place.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.360]   It's not contributing to society.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:33.880]   It's not like there's no incentive to succeed if you could just be a hundred millionaire.
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.760]   There's still that's, you know, that's a good goal.
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:36.760]   But it's more money than you know.
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:37.760]   No.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.880]   What do you need a thousand million dollars for?
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.600]   You deserve to make as much money as you make.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.320]   As long as you're paying your employees a livable wage.
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.040]   As long as you're paying taxes to actually get back to society.
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:51.440]   Again, you give fake 10 billion dollars to the Amazon.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:55.480]   Zuckerberg gave a hundred million dollars to Newark, New Jersey.
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.280]   Basically just a little campaign fund for Cory Booker, which did absolutely nothing for
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.280]   Newark.
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.720]   So many kids got some new books.
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:02.720]   It was in stock.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.840]   So the value went down after the promotion.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.400]   So these are all the scams that they do.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.880]   I don't don't give anyone anything.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:09.880]   Pay your taxes.
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.280]   Then we can put pressure on the government to actually pay for the things that society
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.120]   needs and so to say, oh, we can't afford social services.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:21.040]   We can't afford helping people out with more housing because people are skirting the money
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.200]   and you're doing what with it.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.520]   You're shooting yourself in the atmosphere and you're about a half a billion dollar boat,
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.040]   which I say, Bezos, you could do better because I just googled it.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.160]   There's a lot of boats bigger and better than your half a billion dollar boat.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.600]   You'd be doing something nicer with your money.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:39.720]   There was a good piece by Abigail Disney, who is very, very wealthy.
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.360]   The daughter of Roy Disney, Walt Disney's brother.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.600]   She's a very interesting character, yes.
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:53.160]   She is because she says, I was taught from a young age to protect my dynastic wealth.
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:58.400]   What she says in it is that the very wealthy, and maybe it is even almost the religion of
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:03.960]   the United States, have this notion that it's better to keep our money to then give it to
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.960]   the government.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.880]   We'll do better with our money than the government would do with it.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:15.360]   That's the justification for completely legally paying as little tax as possible because we
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.720]   want to keep us, protect your dynastic wealth.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.920]   She says that the lawyers call it the corpus.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:28.480]   You always want to protect the corpus because, again, it's better in your hands than it would
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.480]   be in the government.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.200]   I bet you there's a lot of people listening who think that's a good thing, but I have
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.760]   to say, no matter how much philanthropy very rich people do, it is dwarfed by the amount
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:42.960]   of money government spends to feed kids, to house the homeless, to do all the things
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:43.960]   government does.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:50.240]   It spends a lot more money on those good works than any philanthropist or all philanthropists.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:55.200]   I have to say, as the token Brit here, aristocracy really doesn't work.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.960]   America should know this.
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.680]   There's a reason why America won.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.440]   Just having dynastic wealth, it's not good for competition.
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.240]   It's not good for innovation.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:11.480]   You need a fairer spread and raise everyone up.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.200]   This is actually a great confession.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.840]   She says, "There's another reason for my inaction.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.400]   I'm deeply ashamed to say what it was, but here goes.
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.480]   Having money, a lot of money, is very, very nice.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:27.840]   It's damn hard to resist the seductions of what money buys you."
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:32.280]   She says, "Once you fly in a private, once you fly first class, you never want to fly
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.280]   economy.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.200]   Again, once you fly in a private jet, you never want to fly commercial again."
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:40.480]   She says, "The dynamics of wealth are similar to the dynamics of addiction.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.120]   The more you have, the more you need."
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.920]   I can understand it.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.920]   My flu first class and going back to hard-tack and swell class afterwards was tricky.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:55.280]   They don't even give you a hard-tack and swell anymore, thanks to COVID.
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.360]   I mean, the American Airlines know, but at least the UK has some standards.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:04.480]   Yeah, I mean, I got upgraded to first on a flight back from New York and you get the
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.640]   mattress on the full-light down bed and a pair of pajamas and a fried breakfast when
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:13.640]   you wake up and 18-year-old single-mott scotch to go to bed with.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.320]   I can understand it.
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.840]   I know someone who's flown on one of the Google corporate jets and it's fantastic.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.400]   You fly into Paris.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.240]   You don't have to go through the terminal.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.800]   The customs officer comes to you.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.720]   You get into a car and you go away.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:30.840]   I'm sure it's tremendously seductive, but it means that in Bezos' case, people are having
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.680]   to pee in bottles just to keep their jobs.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.280]   Here's her final paragraph.
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:41.400]   If your comfort requires the society be structured so that a decent percentage of your fellow
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:46.040]   citizens live in a constant state of terror about whether they'll get health care in an
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:50.280]   emergency or whether they can keep a roof over their family's heads or whether they will
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:55.160]   simply have enough to eat, perhaps the problem does not rest with those people, but with
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:59.440]   you and what you think of as necessary, proper and accessible.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.400]   I think it's a cultural problem, right?
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:06.720]   I think that our culture needs to change what we idolize, what we put into the media.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:11.840]   It shouldn't be Jeff Bezos flying in a rocket doing absolutely nothing but wasting money,
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.120]   but the people that are actually trying to change the world.
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:20.520]   If we, when he should be ashamed, that should be a shameful thing that he spent that much
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:26.760]   money to do that little for that much press versus people that are actually trying to save
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.640]   people's lives and feed the hungry, they're not the ones that we idolize.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:35.200]   They're not the ones that children do their, you know, their presentation on who's the
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.920]   person that you look up to.
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.200]   And I think that our culture has done that through the media, through the shows that
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:46.120]   we watch through everyone trying to gather as much crap as they can and that that means
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:49.680]   that you've won in this, like you don't get to take it with you, but you could make a
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.800]   mark in the world to actually make a better place for it.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:57.840]   And I think that we need to fully re-look at what we teach our children as what is important.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.840]   - Agreed.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:05.840]   Yeah, I think capitalism is the religion of not only this country, but in a way the Western
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.680]   world and it's, you know, you see it even in China.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.680]   - I love capitalism.
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:09.680]   Pay your taxes.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.680]   I don't care what you said.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.680]   - It's agreed.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.120]   No, it's not capitalism that's the problem.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.120]   It's what it stands for.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.120]   If you were using your money to be able to make this world a better place and you actually
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:24.880]   were conscious of your effect upon it and didn't act like you're greater than thou because
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.280]   of it, it might be a different situation.
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:32.080]   - But is this related to the conversation which has also been going on and is about to come
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:37.080]   to a head because the White House has now appointed a significant number of antitrust
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.640]   regulators who are against big tech?
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:45.040]   Is this related to the issues we have with big tech and the calls to break up big tech?
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.080]   Is it similar or is it a different issue entirely?
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:54.440]   - I've got to say, as the foreigner over here, it is astonishing to me that America
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:58.360]   has basically legalized bribery and called it lobbying.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.960]   So what we're going to see over the next couple of years is yes, there are a bunch of antitrust
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:07.600]   people being appointed by the government and big tech is massively ramping up its lobbying
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.640]   spending as well.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.520]   So we're going to see a lot of money going to politicians' pockets and I suspect not
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.800]   much action, but we shall see.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:24.400]   - Amazing article in motherboard on a report that finds big telecom spins $320,000 in
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.840]   Congress every day.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:40.440]   The last Congress, telecom companies, AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, spent $234 million lobbying
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.800]   the 116th Congress.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.760]   That's almost $320,000 today.
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:51.040]   Comcast, the biggest spender, $43 million, AT&T, $36 million.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.880]   Common cause and communication workers of America issued a joint study.
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:59.400]   They said the powerful ISP lobby will seemingly spend whatever it takes to keep politicians
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:03.600]   beholden to them and maintain a status quo that leaves too many Americans on the wrong
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.400]   side of the digital divide.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:10.480]   - Well, I mean, I'm sorry, the situation is ridiculous with broadband in this country.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:16.200]   You've got a couple, two or three companies running very highly defined networks and screwing
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.360]   people, pardon my French.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:21.400]   But I mean, they get paid for broadband and speech.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:25.000]   - And they're all monopolies.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.160]   There's no competition at all.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.960]   And anytime any competition rears its ugly head, they go back to Congress and say, "Could
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.200]   you squash that?"
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:38.880]   The top targets last Congress saved the Internet Act, which would have restored net neutrality.
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:43.480]   The FCC Consumer Protection Authority stripped away during the Trump administration, telecom
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.560]   lobbyists fought against the accessible affordable Internet for all acts.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:53.000]   They derailed the Resilient Networks Act, which was an attempt to shore up Puerto Rico's
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.320]   network after the outages from Irma and Maria.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:02.520]   83 million Americans live under a broadband monopoly.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:06.640]   One company provides broadband in your region.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.240]   Millions more live under a duopoly.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.680]   And the result is obvious.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:16.920]   Free access rates, car, booty, slow speeds, high prices and generally terrible customer
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:17.920]   service.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:23.000]   - There was an article I'm damned if I can remember where it was, but they looked at
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.680]   one city where there was competition on one street and no competition on the next street.
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.680]   - Yeah.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.640]   - And with no competition, they were paying 40% more.
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.640]   - It's amazing.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.720]   It's day like robbery.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.720]   - Yeah.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:36.720]   - Okay.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.000]   - You need competition in this sector.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.320]   - And unfortunately, across all sectors, the biggest thing is you fix it by giving politicians
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.760]   a certain amount of funding.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:47.760]   You don't raise money.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.120]   You don't take lobbying money.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.520]   But that's never going to happen because the people who write the rules are the ones
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.920]   getting the money.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.760]   So I mean, across every industry tech, everything.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.080]   And it's like, now I don't know who's going to stop a monopoly.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:04.160]   Like, before everyone was against Microsoft, because Microsoft literally was running the
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.240]   world.
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.760]   So that was kind of a thing where they want it.
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.120]   We got to do something here.
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:13.440]   But now when you have something like Facebook, they're just going out, oh, this is good.
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.440]   All right.
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:18.600]   If I can't buy you, I'm just going to simulate everything you do and throw it into the projects
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.040]   that we own and destroy you.
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.440]   One of the others is going to happen.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.360]   And it's just the way that it is.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.360]   - Right now.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:28.480]   - But, and somebody in the chat, I'm saying this, and I also agree.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.840]   It's not like we stopped using Facebook or stopped shopping at Amazon.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:35.080]   We also love the benefits we get from Amazon.
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:40.320]   I mean, it's not just Congress unwilling to change things.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.200]   I shop Amazon.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.440]   I mean, I could act with my dollars.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.440]   Why don't we do that?
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.520]   - No, I mean, I shop at Amazon as well, and it's a guilty purchase, but I just can't
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.840]   get British Chris anywhere else.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:57.240]   But the, yes, we bear a certain measure of responsibility, but capitalism works when
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.920]   it's regulated.
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:04.240]   When it's unregulated, capitalism naturally moves towards monopoly or an oligopoly.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:09.440]   So regulate it, make people pay their taxes, make people pay their proper way.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:14.960]   And yeah, let's take the benefits and the innovation that it spurs.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:15.960]   - All right.
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:16.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:20.280]   I mean, to bring your blood pressure up through the roof, I apologize.
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:24.880]   We can all take a deep breath.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.440]   This was supposed to be, I figured, I got Owen.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.160]   I got Georgia.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.160]   I got Ian.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.600]   This show is going to be a laugh riot.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:38.880]   So far, we don't climate change and international capitalistic demise.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:39.880]   - Oh my God.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.080]   - Now let's talk about COVID.
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:46.880]   - Now we're going to talk about helping build up our individual wealth.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.040]   - I agree with you.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:54.240]   You know that, don't you, Owen, JJ, Stono, Doctor, always good about making sure I do
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.240]   my job.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.680]   - That I got to do it.
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:01.240]   - This is a sponsor we've had for a very, very long time.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.160]   I've really been a fan of theirs.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:11.320]   You hear all the news about diamond hands and stonks and holding your AMC or buying
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.320]   game stop.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.960]   And I have to say, I know that's fun.
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.800]   It's exciting.
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.400]   But the day traders I know, a lot of them will say, I made a lot of money and then they
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:25.600]   shut up because then the next day they lost a lot of money.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:30.520]   And then that is, it ain't all going that well.
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:34.160]   But it is kind of incumbent on any of us to take care of ourselves in our old age, to
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.240]   save up.
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:39.200]   Maybe you want to buy a house, get married, send your kids to college.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:45.960]   And I would strongly suggest you not get seduced by the dreams of great riches with
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:52.040]   your diamond hands, but instead growing your long term wealth with a wealth front investment
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.040]   account.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:59.440]   Decades of data show investors that trade individual stocks, any individual stock, not
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:03.320]   just any individual stock, underperform the market every year.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.640]   In fact, only the real fact is 1% of day traders beat the market.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:11.080]   I know and everybody says, well, I'm going to be in that 1% you're not.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.520]   The odds are not in your favor, especially if you're doing it alone.
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.280]   Team up with wealth front.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.840]   Wealth front makes it easy.
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:23.760]   You don't have to spend every waking hour checking the indexes.
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.160]   Investing with wealth front is easy.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:29.080]   Whether you're a beginner or if you invested for years, wealth front makes it easy.
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:33.400]   They have the right tools for every need, every portfolio.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:40.160]   Wealth front can create a portfolio of globally diversified low cost index funds personalized
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.000]   for you in minutes.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.280]   You don't have to worry about manual trades.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.760]   You don't pick stocks.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.080]   You don't watch the market.
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.840]   They handle all the investing.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:52.800]   They can even do stuff that is hard to do on your own, like something called tax loss
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.440]   harvesting.
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:59.960]   This will help you lower the taxes you pay as you invest and it will probably cover your
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:03.960]   low annual 0.25% advisory fee.
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:08.280]   That's all wealth front costs, 0.25%.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.400]   That's why wealth front now is $20 billion of assets.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.920]   People really trust wealth front.

[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.360]   I got it all figured out.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.360]   Look at this graph.
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:45.360]   Look at this chart.
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.320]   I got 30 monitors, 20 programs.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:52.440]   I got to do the right thing.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.360]   Wealthfront.com/twit.

[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.800]   Wealthfront.com/twit.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:08.320]   We thank you so much for your support.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.760]   Be the tortoise.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:10.760]   Be the tortoise.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.760]   That's right.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:12.760]   Be the tortoise.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:13.760]   The tortoise.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.240]   The one that wears the hair looks good, but the tortoise wins.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.240]   Be the tortoise.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.240]   Play it slow.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.240]   I was so disappointed.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.800]   I read this article in the Wired.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:24.280]   The FTC votes unanimously to enforce right to repair.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.200]   I started celebrating.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:29.720]   Wuhu, yaha.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:34.160]   The move follows an executive order issued last week by the White House, urging the
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:37.480]   agency to secure consumers' rights to fix their own gadgets.
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:42.360]   But then, as I continue to read, I found out, the FTC really doesn't have a lot to do with
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.720]   any of this.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.440]   It's nice.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.600]   It's good.
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:53.640]   It's great that the government is behind this, even though Apple, John Deere, and others have
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:56.720]   been fighting it state by state.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:02.920]   The FTC issued a lengthy report last May that blasted manufacturers for restricting repairs.
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:10.720]   They voted five to nothing to enforce the Magnus and Moss Warranty Act.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:15.040]   Of course, the new chair at the FCC is one of those people, President Biden, appointed
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:21.280]   that is really anxious to prosecute big tech.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:25.800]   They did point out in the statement that they've only taken one action on this in the last
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:31.240]   decade, and that was someone who was auto-enrolling people for extended warranties.
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:40.040]   There's a big hill to climb between that and Apple suing third-party repair shops and the
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.040]   rest of it.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:45.720]   But repair absolutely needs to be done.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.680]   But the FTC statement was a bit weak source, I thought.
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.680]   Yes.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:54.200]   This is what happens when you have lobbyists that lobby for your right, because Apple puts
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.400]   on this huge front about we care about, the economy.
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.000]   That's why we're not giving you headphones anymore.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.080]   The package is slimmer, wasted less cardboard.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:07.040]   But you won't allow people, one, to make a living in a business, two, to recycle your
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:10.240]   phones and keep them alive longer, still keeping it in an ecosystem.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.480]   It's not like they take iPhones and turn them into androids.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:18.640]   They're prolonging your product, but Apple's real device thing is dropping on the ground,
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.280]   breaking with micro-real glass, go buy a new one tomorrow.
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.880]   And only we can refurbish it, and we really don't even sell the refers to people.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.760]   We pack them up and send them overseas when we get bundles of them.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:33.920]   So it's such a scam because that company specifically acts like they care about renewing
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.920]   and renewal and the environment and all that stuff, but they don't.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:38.920]   They just don't.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:43.560]   And companies, Apple invented in time new screw heads just to--
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:47.520]   Yeah, Steve Jobs didn't want anybody to get into the original Mac, so he created the
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.760]   Torx screw, thinking nobody would be able to get into it.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:54.560]   Of course, he underestimated the hacker mentality.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.560]   It's really, yeah.
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:59.560]   And you can get it-- it's easy to get a Torx screwdriver these days or a panel over whatever they're
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:00.560]   using.
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:06.880]   Kyle Wien's testifying in front of the Productivity Commission this week brought up some really
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:07.880]   strong examples.
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:13.240]   He says, "We've seen manufacturers restrict--" Kyle Wien's is the CEO of IFixit.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:17.640]   I should mention, one-time sponsor, actually off time sponsor on our shows.
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:18.640]   But I love IFixit.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.160]   I've actually purchased their Fixit kits.
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:27.080]   I bought a battery kit for my Pixel X4 XL, which was battery swollen.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.240]   39 bucks, had a replacement battery.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.000]   All the tools took it apart, put a new battery.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   It worked.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.800]   I'm like, wow, I'm pretty handy.
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:41.120]   But, I mean, you gave me an IFixit toolkit for Christmas.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.840]   Yes, a couple of years ago we gave all the hopes that.
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:44.840]   Exactly.
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.320]   That saved my bacon a couple of months ago.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.320]   He says--
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:51.600]   My think pad was showing up a non-detective battery.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:55.000]   And it was like, do I send my main computer into IBM for two weeks?
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.600]   Or do I take the back of it, reset the battery, and see how that works?
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.240]   So of course, we need to repair this stuff.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.320]   And I think Kyle's even fairly conservative.
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:10.920]   He's not even saying-- because his company sells-- basically sells parts, manuals, and
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:11.920]   tools.
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.360]   They're business so that you can fix your own stuff.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.040]   He says, look, if something's gone out of warranty, we should be at least be able to
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:21.000]   buy the parts to fix that, right?
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.640]   He says, we've seen manufacturers-- this is a quote-- restrict our ability to buy parts.
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:29.600]   There's a German manufacturer of batteries called Varda.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.720]   They sell batteries to a wide variety of companies.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.320]   Samsung happens to use these batteries in their Galaxy Earbuds.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:39.600]   But when we go to Varda and say, we want to buy that battery as a repair part, they
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:44.920]   say, no, our contract with Samsung will not allow us to sell that.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:49.240]   He says, Apple is notorious for doing this with chips in their computers.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:52.760]   There's a particular charging chip on the MacBook Pro.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.440]   There's a standard version of the part.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:34:00.160]   And then there's the quote, Apple version of the part that sits very slightly tweaked.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.800]   And it's tweaked enough that it's only required to work in this computer.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:08.440]   And that company is, again, under contractual requirement with Apple.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.680]   It gets even worse.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:17.040]   There was a company in California, a California-based recycler, that Apple required to recycle
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:20.440]   spare parts that were still in new condition.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:24.680]   This is the quote, California Apple stops providing service after seven years.
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:25.680]   So this was at seven years.
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:31.400]   And Apple has warehouses full of spare parts, never used brand new rather than selling them
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.960]   out on the marketplace.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:36.720]   So like someone like me says, Kyle, who equally would have bought them, they were paying the
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.560]   recycler to destroy them.
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:43.000]   Now, Apple can say, oh, it's for safety, it's for quality.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.800]   But if something's out of warranty because it's seven years old and you have lots of
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:54.560]   old parts that you're never going to use, why wouldn't you sell them to iFix?
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.600]   So they can sell them on to customers to fix their stuff.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.600]   I don't understand it.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.160]   Well, you're going to have to buy more stuff.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.240]   It really just fits to their bottom line, right?
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:05.240]   Because you need to buy a new phone.
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.240]   You've got this phone for seven years.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.240]   What are you nuts?
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.240]   Get a new phone.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.240]   Exactly.
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.240]   Exactly.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.240]   You hate America.
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:16.080]   What I love, though, is that the way that things change is that if the culture starts
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:22.200]   to shift towards that we believe we have the right to fix things, then the government will
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:26.960]   slowly shift because they want to be able to be reelected to we're going to make sure
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:27.960]   that people can fix things.
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:32.320]   Again, if they can make money and they can do this as slowly as possible through lobbying,
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.960]   they completely will.
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:37.120]   And that's why lobbying really should not be allowed, especially with the amounts of
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:39.240]   money that they're able to donate.
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:42.200]   But we are starting to say, you know what, this is mine.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.200]   I own it.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:47.280]   Why would you stop me from being able to open it up and not be able to repair it?
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.560]   It's ridiculous.
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:53.400]   And that wastefulness, we're also starting to become distasteful before it was just
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.880]   throw everything out and get something new.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:58.640]   And now we're like, oh, wait, it doesn't just disappear into nowhere.
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:02.080]   It actually ends up somewhere that we're going to have to deal with it again.
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:03.080]   Like we're all on.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:06.360]   We're stuck on this lump of rock floating through space.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.200]   It's the only lump of rock that we know of that we can take care of.
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.160]   Maybe we should take better care of it.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.000]   Also I got a flat tire.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.680]   Yeah, I'm just going to throw this away.
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:16.680]   Can I get a new car?
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:22.360]   I'm sure somebody can fix it, but there's apparently there's a wheel lock on it.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.000]   I don't have the key for the wheel lock.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   Oh, sorry.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   I'm on a show.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   Hey, guys.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.520]   So, yeah, I mean, fix this.
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.080]   And also, by the way, I got popcorn for the holidays.
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.280]   I did not get a tool kit.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.280]   I mean, what?
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.480]   That was a couple of years ago.
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.480]   We said you popcorn.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.080]   Did we really say you popcorn?
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.840]   Yeah, I got like a it was good popcorn too.
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.000]   It was like one of those assorted with all fancy stuff.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.040]   I got assorted chocolates one year.
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:46.200]   I get all you guys always hook me up with something nice.
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.200]   And that's Lisa.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.200]   That's Lisa.
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.200]   That's Lisa.
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.200]   Is that what it is?
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.200]   It's not really a sweet treat.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:55.640]   Lisa will come and say, just so you know when Owen's on, we bought a popcorn, just so you
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:56.640]   know.
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.640]   Oh, thanks.
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:58.640]   It was good stuff.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:59.640]   Good.
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:00.640]   Good.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:06.280]   Thank her for buying fancy popcorn.
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.520]   Next time I'll send you a tool kit.
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.280]   That was like four or five years ago, I think Ian, right?
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.280]   The tool.
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:14.840]   It was a wild bank, but I got to say it's proved itself many times.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:15.840]   Oh, I love that.
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:20.400]   And education, because you know, you know what it's like when you know a bit about technology,
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.640]   your tech support for all your friends.
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.280]   We bought like five down on the table and open it up.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:26.840]   It's just like, yeah, it's just got serious.
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.960]   We bought like five or six for the house because they keep going missing.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.600]   And actually now I have a pair.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:32.600]   It's hidden.
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:36.400]   I have a set hidden because I know that somebody will come and get it and use it and not put
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.400]   it back.
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:40.720]   So it's actually, don't tell anybody, but if you're ever at our house, there's an I fix
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:45.720]   a tool kit slid behind my printer in my office.
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:47.840]   If you ever, you know, it's funny.
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.800]   I keep an Allen set key set hidden like that because, you know, when you're working on
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.320]   some of some of these, I'll say, Oh, can I use that?
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.120]   And then I have like, I never see it again.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:56.120]   There are missing.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:59.520]   I have an Allen key set that is hidden away, but I don't.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.120]   If somebody needs it, I bring it to you.
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:02.760]   I stand there and watch you do it.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:07.600]   I take it back because otherwise it'll be lumped up with the other ones that are missing.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.840]   I actually had a theory that I care.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:14.800]   The IKEA is behind that because they've given up going a Viking these days and burning down
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:19.600]   your settlement, but they'll still ruin your weekend with a missing Allen key.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:26.600]   So before I got my fountain pen finish, which I now is in full blown and it's depressing,
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:30.400]   but I was big on the pilot G2 rolling writers.
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.400]   You ever try those?
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.400]   No.
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.400]   And they're really nice.
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.120]   They're really nice.
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:38.600]   If you're better than a ball, it's like a ball, but it's smooth.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:40.600]   But they would disappear.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.280]   Yo, this highlight of my life, Uncle Lee, I got one right on deck.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.280]   Look at that.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.280]   He's got one.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.280]   I'm buying you that nice grip.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.280]   See that nice grip.
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.280]   Amazon.
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.840]   But I got all the colors, everything.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.320]   But they kept disappearing.
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.040]   So I got a new theory.
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:59.560]   If you supersaturate the house with something that keeps disappearing eventually, like readers,
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:05.080]   like those little glasses, if you get enough of them and eventually everywhere you look,
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:08.160]   it'll be a G2 pen or a pair of reading glasses.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.000]   And so you'll never have to worry about it again.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   So now that's what I do.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.640]   I saturate the house with I fix it toolkits G2 pens, that kind of thing.
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.640]   Uncle Leo, just a quick.
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.640]   I've already put it in my Amazon.
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.640]   You already bought it.
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:20.640]   It's in there.
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:25.640]   Uncle Leo, this is exactly this is I go I call you uncle because we are family.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.240]   I have three boxes.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:31.800]   I have 300 of these pens and black and I have 48 rainbow.
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.520]   You're saturating the house.
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.560]   I got the rainbow colors everywhere.
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:36.560]   I got the whole rainbow.
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:37.560]   I'm not going to get a picture.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.400]   How many rainbow colors the 20 the eight different ones?
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.640]   No, I have a bigger pack than that.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.640]   There was a bigger pack.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:44.960]   My mind is like 12 deep.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:49.200]   I have three different colors, but I'm just saying like that's what you do uncle Leo because
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.200]   you need it.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.760]   Like I can't use another pen now.
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.840]   So these are in these are I got one of these in the bathroom right now.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:55.840]   Everywhere.
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.280]   You never know what you need.
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.280]   The environment.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.280]   That's my key.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.280]   That's that.
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:01.280]   We want to come up at early age.
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:04.360]   I don't want to come across as a lad.
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:07.760]   I hear but I mean because I've just written a couple of birthday cards to send back to
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:12.960]   the UK but it occurred to me that this is probably the thing I the first things I've
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:15.640]   written in a month with a pen.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.840]   You know the rest of it's all keyboard these days.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:23.760]   I know I you know I have this fantasy that I'm going to develop really good penmanship
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.680]   and use my beautiful fountain pens.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:30.600]   I even buy letterpress card stock with my name on it my address.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:40.000]   Having this fantasy that someday I am going to write cards and I never I still have everything
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   that I bought.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   I went out and bought.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.800]   I bet there's still on Amazon you can still buy it.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.920]   I wanted a better penmanship.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:56.040]   So Amazon had reproductions of these penmanship books from the turn of the last century.
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.160]   Oh they still sell them.
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.120]   It's called Spenserian.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:04.720]   You know Spenserian did you what did you learn in school you went to in the UK they
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:07.320]   must have taught you good penmanship right.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.120]   Oh he's muted.
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:12.120]   So you're sitting on the mute button sir.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:15.360]   Yeah no we look cursive at school.
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.360]   Cursive.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.920]   This is a quite literally beaten if you didn't get it right.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:23.560]   But but remember the cursive that that we were all taught I don't think they teach it
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.440]   and I hope they don't teach it anymore.
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:30.800]   But when I was taught was a modified Spencer the Spencer hand is what like Abraham Lincoln
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.320]   would have written it.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.320]   It's very florid.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.800]   Let me see if I can find this it was.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:39.360]   I mean honestly my handwriting these days is worse than a doctor's.
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.800]   I mean it's like yeah.
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:45.440]   Yeah that moment my I'm it's like a gorilla wrote it.
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:49.360]   I still like writing notes I have notes everywhere and I find them random I have notebooks.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:50.360]   I still like writing.
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.160]   But I'm really like to be able to write.
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:53.160]   Look at this.
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:56.000]   Wouldn't you like to be able to write like that?
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.560]   That was the penmanship that I would love to but the amount of time that it would take
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:00.560]   to spot these books.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.840]   I started like are you going to spend the time.
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:09.040]   I you know I read after about the thing I would love to be as well trained in martial
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:12.400]   arts as Jackie Chan but I don't feel like spending eight hours a day for the next five
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.760]   years to be able to train it right.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:16.520]   Like I just want to be able to do but I'm still not going to I'm still not going to
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:20.840]   talk you because I'm waiting for the computer ship that allows you to do it right.
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:28.080]   Like Coca-Cola is in Spencerian for the Ford logo that's in Spencerian and I bought this
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:32.640]   these reproduction on Amazon of these books with all the workbooks and I started but yeah
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.320]   I never you don't even sign checks anymore.
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:36.560]   I don't know why you got there.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.440]   I know this is what replaced at the Palmer method.
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:43.800]   This is what you were taught in school the Palmer method right.
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:44.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:49.480]   Yeah it's ugly anyway just another fantasy another thing I'll never do.
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:55.720]   I can say after 40 years of pounding a keyboard then my handwriting has gone awful very badly.
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:43:02.880]   But that's why I wanted you know that's that's why I wanted to like do it right learn it.
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:08.560]   Anyway Leo right in the great novel a shopping list for apples and oranges at the grocery
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:09.560]   store.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:18.680]   I'm writing for score and seven years ago we ran out of potato chips today I shall
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:21.360]   say a full off.
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:26.520]   We all talk about DIY and like oh we really wish Apple wouldn't make these phones with
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:29.080]   everything glued in and disposable.
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:36.520]   But the question is will you buy a product that has screws in it is thicker is repairable.
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:39.920]   I miss the days when you get a phone that you could replace the battery for instance.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.080]   That's what I want.
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:43.680]   So I can have a backup battery in that place where I don't have to.
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:44.680]   Yeah.
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:45.680]   I got to carry a battery brick.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:47.200]   I have to carry a battery bank with me.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:50.800]   I wish I could swap out batteries or do a hard reset.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:57.000]   When your iPhone freaks out on you you got to let it die wait nine days pray to four
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.560]   people and then put it in a steam room for to come back on.
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.080]   He's been hard reset it.
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:05.920]   These wouldn't be as beautiful and thin and light and.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:10.400]   Couldn't they be it could be stuck on but not stuck on with something that you're never
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.840]   going to be able to get off without like some sort of heat gun like they could stick it
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:17.720]   on so that it was still you know you could you know take it apart.
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:20.360]   This is not like they're doing it because that's the easiest way to do it.
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:23.720]   I did foolishly buy the Apple MagSafe battery.
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:25.800]   That was what do you think of it Leo?
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:29.000]   Oh it's so little tiny koala backpack sticky.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.600]   It's got a magnet in it and it goes right away.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:34.600]   I should have brought it.
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.160]   I have it at home.
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:40.240]   And but it's ninety nine dollars and here's the present thing.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:44.880]   It's made to fit on all iPhone 12 so the mini all the way up to the pro max and it's just
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.320]   a little wart on the pro max.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:52.080]   It fills up the size of the mini but it doesn't have much juice in it so it only charges the
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.960]   pro max up like halfway.
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:57.680]   So like you get 50% more battery life with you.
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:02.240]   It's not that sticky on like I shook the phone and it should go flying.
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.720]   No I can shake it off.
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:05.880]   I'm not even that's to work hard on it though.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:06.880]   It's pretty cool.
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:07.880]   No.
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:08.880]   You know what the only justification.
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.280]   You put it on really nicely.
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:15.120]   If you were going to buy the puck you know the Mags F charger which is like 30 bucks.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:19.640]   This could also work as a puck so you plug it in and it's a puck as well as a battery.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.040]   So maybe and it's cheaper.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.320]   There's third party options that are cheap.
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:24.040]   Oh anchor makes one it's a little thicker.
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.360]   Yeah there is there are other companies to do the same thing.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:29.360]   But being able to take physically take the battery out of your phone.
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:31.000]   That would be the right answer.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.600]   That's you know but that's where we were five years ago.
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:38.840]   Samsung made phones that you could pull the battery out and it was still waterproof.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:42.240]   You had the rubber seal lining in there and as long as you snapped it back in.
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:46.000]   Your phone was still waterproof so even that excuse they give is pointless.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.400]   And why do I keep yelling today because we were stuck in a time loop and it doesn't matter
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.400]   people.
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.800]   Here's something to make you happy.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:57.040]   I suspect no one's going to buy it but this is an attempt it's called framework the framework
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.040]   laptop.
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.840]   Framed out work.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:04.920]   So this the whole idea is this is a laptop that is modular.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:09.680]   It's really parts replaceable from the keyboard to the to everything.
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:11.560]   It's all accessible.
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:14.160]   It comes with a kit of modules you can customize.
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:20.400]   Now I have to say some of these modules are probably proprietary like that keyboard.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:25.080]   So you know that's not as good as like if we're a generic keyboard.
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:28.040]   It looks like a pretty nice thin and light laptop.
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:32.880]   See notice on the ports the the outlines show you can take them out.
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:36.520]   And so you can build it any all way you want it.
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:37.920]   And yet I'm not tempted.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:39.400]   I don't know.
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:40.400]   Should I get it?
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.000]   Should I run out and get this?
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.080]   It's kind of like the Google phone that they were going to do where you could get into
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:48.240]   get changeable modules and that sort of thing.
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:53.480]   It's one of those things that sounds great but in practice it doesn't quite work for
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:54.480]   some reason.
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:55.480]   I'm not quite sure why.
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:58.520]   I always initially I used to buy things you could upgrade and then I realized I never
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:00.320]   upgrade them.
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.320]   Maybe that's just what.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:07.280]   In the case to why would you upgrade the thing is about upgrading is once it fails it be like
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:13.400]   how many people have had yeah people had laptops where your HDMI goes out now you can't swap
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:14.400]   that out.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:15.840]   This is where that would come into play.
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:17.680]   Yeah your headphone jack doesn't work.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:18.680]   That's where this comes to play.
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:22.880]   You don't swap things that are upgraded because the product works until it dies completely
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:28.240]   but everybody's been in a situation where the the J key does not work and I'm like it's
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.240]   on a laptop.
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:30.240]   How do I fix it?
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:31.240]   I try to play the laptop.
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:34.960]   That's where that comes into having a great value and yes you should buy it and review
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:38.840]   it for the show and do your job because that's part of your job.
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:39.840]   Do your job.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:40.840]   That's what you're here for.
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:44.160]   I used to only buy Lenovo ThinkPets because you could do that with them back in the day
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.760]   but now everything's glued in just like everybody else.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:49.520]   I don't think that was well.
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.480]   Not much of that.
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:54.720]   We like to be able to just go to the Apple store and then it comes back and you just don't
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:55.720]   have to do anything.
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:48:02.680]   There's less and less people wanting to be able to repair things and upgrade and tinker
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:06.240]   and be able to even have the skills to know how to do it.
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:09.240]   We've become complacent.
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:10.400]   Alas I feared.
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:11.400]   It is a pity.
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:17.920]   Having the static strap was a key thing when you had a PC case where you do want to fry
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:22.760]   the ram when you're upgrading it or the graphics card had to be strapped in and get it done.
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:26.680]   I do think it's kind of a pity that we're not repairing this stuff more.
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:28.280]   I built my computer.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.480]   I built both my daughter's computers.
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:34.920]   I got this Mac Mini sitting over here and one looking really fine and sexy and I barely
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:38.520]   use it so I'm just saying there's still builders out here in America.
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:39.520]   Good.
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.520]   We're still building.
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:41.520]   Good.
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:42.520]   Still building.
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:43.520]   There's still hope.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.960]   And it was cheaper and more powerful.
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:46.960]   You know what I mean?
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:47.960]   Yeah.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:49.720]   128 gigs of ram I got bumped up over here.
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:54.440]   Would have put me in prison and jail or broke and dead and homeless if I'd have put that
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:55.440]   with Apple.
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:57.200]   I'd have 128 gigs of ram for Apple.
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.200]   I'd be homeless.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.200]   Oh God yeah.
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.200]   Yeah.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:04.240]   And it used to be, you know, it's interesting because it used to be that you could buy a
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:09.080]   MacBook or an Apple device with the minimum amount of ram and add your own.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:11.080]   But of late Apple has been building the ram in.
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:12.080]   They shut that down.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:13.080]   So you can't.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:14.720]   There's nothing you can do.
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:16.480]   It is the way it is.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.480]   My Mac Mini before this I took it apart.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:19.560]   I put it in a new hard drive.
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:20.560]   I put a new ram.
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:23.600]   It service me as a server for double the lifetime.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:26.360]   I had to think for eight years because I could upgrade it.
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:31.240]   This thing I'm just looking at it like, okay, you're fast and cute and all.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:34.680]   But in like three years I'm going to be mad at myself for owning it.
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:38.120]   Have you have you changed your voice?
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.680]   Do you does anybody have an echo?
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.760]   You have an echo, Georgia.
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:41.760]   You must.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:42.760]   Nope.
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:45.080]   I do not have an echo.
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:46.080]   Nobody here.
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:47.080]   Nope.
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:48.080]   What?
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:49.080]   Weird.
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:52.120]   I've got things called fingers that really use.
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:54.240]   Oh, man, I like talking to my hardware.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:56.440]   Well, if you had an echo, you'd be.
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:57.440]   I have an echo.
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:58.440]   I have an echo.
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:49:59.440]   Do you?
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:00.440]   Have you?
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:01.440]   You know it has a male voice now?
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:03.840]   We're Samuel Jackson in this household, but continue.
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:06.280]   I don't think the echo can do Samuel Jackson.
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:08.080]   Is that?
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:09.080]   No.
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:12.120]   Say, say, say a word.
[00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:13.360]   Change your voice.
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:14.360]   Is it near?
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:15.760]   Is it near your mic so we can hear it?
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:16.760]   No.
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:18.360]   I don't keep it in my office.
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:22.920]   I do a lot of damage in here, but it's all for my press, asking my TV.
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:24.960]   Even my hallways are equipped.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:25.960]   Even my bathroom is equipped.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:27.880]   I have those little plug-and-wall things.
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:31.640]   My house is totally, they're just spying on me everywhere, but it's up in here.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.640]   And here is the news.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:34.640]   Here's the news.
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:35.640]   You have your phone.
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:36.640]   Here's the new voice.
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:37.640]   Yes.
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:38.640]   See, Apple really has this down.
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:42.520]   They have really a broad variety of voices, but until now, the echo had one female voice.
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:43.520]   Now it has this voice.
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:45.760]   Traffic on your commute looks pretty clear.
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:50.600]   The fastest route takes about 16 minutes via South Jackson Street and Borne Avenue South.
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:51.600]   It's a little...
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:53.560]   Still creepy.
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:57.000]   Small market news and out-sury.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   And here's the best...
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.920]   There's a huge market for celebrities to actually go out and do this stuff.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:08.200]   I would give a lot of money to have John Cleese do my traffic descriptions.
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:13.080]   Right now it's only Shaq and Melissa McCarthy.
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:17.240]   The most important thing to me that you can now change the wake word.
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:23.080]   For a long time it was ALEXA, computer, Amazon, computer's terrible, by the way.
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:25.000]   I have computer in my office.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.600]   I'm talking about computers all the time.
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:27.600]   All that does is wake up.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:29.160]   So computer's out.
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:30.160]   Echo's not so bad.
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.720]   Amazon's boring.
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:34.440]   Now you can call it Ziggy.
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:43.040]   And I immediately change the voice to a male voice and I call them Ziggy, which I like.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:46.120]   I don't know if the celebrity voices are active yet.
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:47.120]   Those are coming.
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:49.160]   Samuel Jackson works.
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:51.160]   He cusses me out occasionally.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:52.960]   I asked him to tell me a joke or what's going on.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:53.960]   I don't know.
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:54.960]   I paid $1.99.
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:55.960]   Samuel Jackson's on there.
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:56.960]   Is that still there?
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:58.360]   I thought that was still there.
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:51:59.960]   Is that a Google thing?
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:00.960]   No.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:01.960]   Oh yeah.
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:04.760]   You say Echo introduced me to Samuel L. Jackson.
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:06.120]   Yeah, I got him.
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:07.360]   And then you pay $5.
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:08.360]   Yeah.
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:10.000]   I got him on sale for $2.99.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   But I got him.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.120]   It's one of my party tricks.
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:16.280]   I got him on air cussling talking trash.
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:17.280]   It's fun.
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:20.960]   Does he say anything about ever M.F.
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:21.960]   Inc.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:22.960]   Snakes on the M.F.
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:23.960]   Inc.
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:25.960]   No, no, he told me to get the F up.
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:27.960]   Yeah, I mean, my mommy on the main.
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:28.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:29.960]   He be cussing.
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:30.960]   He's the worst part about us.
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:31.960]   He doesn't.
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:32.960]   It's so weird.
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:35.600]   Like the first time I try to get him to cuss, I know I could get him to cuss.
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:38.240]   When someone's there, the first time he won't say it, I've got to like do it.
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:40.320]   When I'm home alone with him, he be cussing up a storm.
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:42.320]   I'm like, why are you?
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.320]   It's like he knows.
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:45.320]   They know what's going on.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:50.680]   Apple doesn't have celebrity voices yet, but they do have.
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:51.680]   I think they're trying.
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:57.920]   Honestly, I think they're trying to make it more like Scarlett Johansson and her, you
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:04.480]   know, kind of like it's a robot, but it's a, it's a real like it's, you could almost
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:06.920]   feel like it's a human in your machine.
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:07.920]   Let me play.
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.720]   She never understands what you're saying.
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:10.720]   She's dumb.
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.720]   She's a dumb.
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:13.440]   Scarlett Johansson was pretty smart.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:16.920]   She was too smart because in the end she goes off to be with the other.
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:17.920]   Right.
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:18.920]   And also doesn't give you.
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:20.800]   Choose the voice you'd like me to use.
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.440]   This is American choices.
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:23.440]   That's voice one.
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.200]   Hi, I'm Siri.
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.440]   Choose the voice you'd like me to use.
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:27.440]   Isn't that peppy?
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:28.440]   Isn't she peppy?
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:29.440]   You peppy.
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:31.440]   What I'm in the morning, I'm a bit too peppy.
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:32.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:33.440]   What?
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:34.440]   Hi, I'm Siri.
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:35.440]   Choose the voice you'd like me to use.
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:36.440]   This is the voice I use.
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:37.440]   Hi, I'm Siri.
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:39.440]   Choose the voice you'd like me to use.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:40.440]   That's annoying.
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:41.440]   It's a little urban.
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:43.440]   It's a little like.
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:45.000]   Hi, I'm Siri.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.440]   Choose the voice you'd like me to use.
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:49.840]   Seems like, you know, a skateboarder or something.
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:51.480]   Hi, I'm Siri.
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:53.320]   Choose the voice you'd like me to use.
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:54.320]   Yeah, I like it.
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:55.320]   So I use voice three.
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:56.320]   Hi, I'm Siri.
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:57.320]   Choose the voice you'd like me to use.
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:58.320]   It scared the hell out of my daughter.
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:53:59.320]   She said, "Who's that?"
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:00.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:01.320]   Who's in house?
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:07.600]   Yeah, I'm O.G. on that because especially because it's only useful for three things.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:14.800]   Doing someone, doing my calendar and timers.
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:16.800]   Other than that, kitchen timers.
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:17.800]   I use a lot of timers.
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:19.800]   You ask me to do anything.
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:21.920]   It is useful for that.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:24.320]   My favorite thing to hear is I found this on the web.
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:27.320]   I have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:28.320]   I wanted to look on the web.
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:30.320]   You don't know how to write a web about that.
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:31.320]   You ask a random question.
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:32.320]   It'll be like, I found this on the web.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:34.680]   It brings me all these wolf media things.
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:36.680]   Wikipedia things like 92 things.
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:37.680]   No, it's useful.
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.680]   It doesn't help me at all.
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:40.000]   No, this isn't my problem with Google.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.240]   I love the Pixel phone.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:42.760]   I've been using one for years.
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:45.680]   But my goodness, the assistant is annoying as all hell.
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:48.240]   It's just like, "Is something I found on the web?
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:49.240]   Show me the news."
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:50.240]   No, no, no.
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:52.440]   You've got to scroll through very auditions to get through that.
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:56.240]   You would have thought that they would have gone a lot further with virtual assistants.
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:57.240]   It hasn't really.
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:58.240]   They are right.
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:54:59.240]   Yeah, we're stalled.
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:00.240]   They really have not evolved.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:03.640]   I still feel that Siri has a head injury.
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:06.640]   She's having a lot of fun.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:12.840]   At any point in time and asks me random questions, I've had been in session and suddenly she's
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:13.840]   leading up.
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:14.840]   Oh, that's got...
[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:15.840]   That's not...
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:16.840]   So you have one...
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:17.840]   Oh, it's your phone.
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:18.840]   So you can't...
[00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:23.240]   I don't usually have it on, but other people will bring their phone in and it will talk
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:25.320]   to us while we're doing a session.
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:29.520]   It's quite inappropriate and she'll say stuff that she shouldn't be saying in the middle
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:32.720]   of a session, but no, mine has turned completely off.
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:36.120]   But you can't help it with compliance, 7 on.
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.120]   Exactly.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:40.000]   You can be using that nice pilot G2 to write notes now as...
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.440]   I have ordered the pilot G2.
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:43.760]   I write notes by hand.
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:44.760]   I need nice...
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:45.760]   It's very quiet.
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:46.760]   You don't want a squeaky pen.
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:49.560]   No, I like the ink has to be smooth.
[00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:51.040]   It has to be a nice feeling.
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:52.040]   You'll love it.
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:53.040]   Right, Owen?
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:54.040]   She'll love it.
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:55.040]   Welcome to the dark side.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:56.040]   Oh, I can't wait.
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:57.040]   No way.
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:59.600]   Alright, let's take a little break.
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:02.240]   Let's take a little break now that we've equipped you with pens.
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:07.040]   Oh, and JJ Stone, oh, doctor, IQMZ.com.
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:13.520]   George Dow, anxiety-videos.com, those great videos, not just for anxiety, but sleeping,
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:15.640]   parenting, everything.
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:17.360]   Everything you need to get good at.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:20.920]   And Ian Thompson, news editor.
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:23.520]   Still are you still the news editor at the register.com?
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:27.960]   Well, I mean, US editor, but to be honest, we're very flat-fledged.
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:29.840]   Everyone still calls me...
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:32.080]   I'm not going to say that word.
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:34.080]   We don't stand on so many.
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:36.720]   Is that proofstone in charge of news?
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:39.120]   Now, I'm thinking about the W word.
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:40.120]   Oh, never mind.
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:41.120]   You can say it.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:42.120]   It's okay.
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:43.120]   We allow.
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:44.120]   Oh, okay.
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:46.120]   Yeah, no one knows what we're talking about.
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:47.120]   Are you?
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:49.120]   Are you sure today?
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:51.520]   Actually, here's the technology I really love.
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:57.000]   In fact, I used it for a long time when it was pill pack, Amazon bought pill pack, and
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.800]   now they have created Amazon pharmacy.
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:03.600]   This is the best pharmacy ever.
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:07.760]   I mean, first of all, I think we all learned thanks to COVID.
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:09.760]   It's better to have it mailed to you.
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:14.640]   It's better not to go somewhere and wait in line for something.
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:18.360]   When you can get it in a day or two, in fact, if your Amazon Prime can get it in second
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:20.240]   day, like that.
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.240]   It's just easier.
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:23.200]   Amazon pharmacy saves you time.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:27.280]   They easily work with your doctor and then the liver, medication, and always, by the way,
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:29.600]   the right medication to your door.
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:30.600]   You can get the meds you need.
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:33.320]   You don't have to leave the house, one less errand.
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:36.880]   And by the way, more safety, more accuracy for you.
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:39.320]   Amazon pharmacy is freaking amazing.
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:42.840]   It'll save you time delivering to your door.
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:44.520]   No more waiting in line at the pharmacy.
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:47.400]   You can choose between 30 and 90 day supplies.
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:48.920]   I love that.
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:51.480]   I hate it when they send me five pills.
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:53.680]   No, give me a month's worth.
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:57.840]   If you're a Prime member, you can get six months worth of prescription medication.
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:57:59.240]   How about that?
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:00.240]   It's also easy.
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:03.720]   You can have your doctor's office send your next prescription right to Amazon pharmacy.
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:06.640]   And then they coordinate with your doctor.
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:09.280]   And I think this is a good thing to ensure that everything's accurate and you're getting
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:10.280]   what you need.
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:14.560]   Because in the old days with the doctor's handwriting on the script, you wouldn't know
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:17.640]   what the hell you were getting.
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:19.240]   So Amazon makes sure you're getting the right thing.
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:22.080]   And that's one of the things that pill-pack technology does, which is really great.
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:26.760]   They have very smart technology that identifies every pill as they put it in the package.
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:30.480]   Make sure you've got exactly the right dose, the right pill, everything.
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:32.400]   You can use your insurance.
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:35.520]   Amazon pharmacy works with almost every insurance plan nationwide.
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:39.160]   Plus, if you're an Amazon Prime member, and I love this.
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:41.240]   Most pharmacies do not do this.
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:42.600]   They'll give you up-p-p-p-pricing.
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:49.860]   They'll show you what it would cost with your insurance copay or your price without insurance.
[00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:55.080]   And if you're an Amazon Prime member, you get discounts when you're buying without insurance
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:57.320]   and free two-day delivery.
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:59:01.280]   So Prime members often get meds for as low as a dollar a month, even if you're paying
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:02.720]   without insurance.
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:04.920]   So that's really nice.
[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:06.760]   That's really cool.
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:08.880]   Your medical information is always, of course, protected.
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:10.680]   You don't have to worry about privacy.
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:12.360]   They keep it inside the pharmacy.
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:17.440]   They never share your personal health data outside of their pharmacy to anywhere, including
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:19.000]   within Amazon.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.320]   You can always speak with a pharmacist.
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:24.720]   They have pharmacists on staff 24/7.
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:29.640]   So if you've got questions or need advice, that's a pharmacy that's there, whatever you
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:31.480]   need it.
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:33.040]   And the pricing is so clear.
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:38.200]   I think it's great that you know upfront before you pay a penny what it'll cost and
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:40.920]   you can even do the comparison.
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:45.520]   Amazon Prime members can save on prescription medication when not using insurance with medication
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:49.120]   as low as a dollar a month plus free two-day delivery.
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:58.560]   You want to know more Amazon.com/twitRxAmazon.com/twitRx.
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:02.240]   This is really the easy way to get the medications you need.
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:05.280]   I always say pills, but it could be other things as well.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:06.440]   Obviously Amazon.com/twitRx.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:14.480]   Thank you Amazon for your support of this week in tech.
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:19.560]   All right, this is personal.
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.680]   I'm going to say it's just me.
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.680]   No one else will care about this.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:28.240]   Maybe Georgia, you listen, do you listen to a podcast called Call Her Daddy?
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:29.240]   Nope.
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.200]   You ever hear that?
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.440]   No, I haven't.
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.920]   Alex Cross, you ever hear of her?
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.080]   Big news.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:42.320]   She was at Barstool, started the podcast in 2018.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.320]   That was what?
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.720]   30 years ago, right?
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:51.040]   Pretty much I haven't moved from this chair since 2005, but she's three years she's been
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.200]   doing this.
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:56.440]   She's a big influencer on Instagram, 2.2 million followers, very well known.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:01.360]   I asked you Georgia because I think it's a female slanted podcast, but I think it's also
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:03.520]   for 18 to 25 year old women.
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.200]   It's not for older women.
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:07.760]   I listened to it.
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.600]   She just got a deal with Amazon.
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.480]   They stole her away from Barstool Sports.
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:16.760]   One podcast a week, $20 million a year for three years.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:21.880]   $20 million a year for three years.
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:22.880]   Wow.
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.080]   It's so good.
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:30.200]   Now it is a Spotify exclusive and I guess it makes sense for Spotify because you have
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.920]   to use the app.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:36.040]   If they're selling ads, they're going to be able to give the advertiser a lot more information.
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:38.600]   If you're a subscriber, they make money from you that way.
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.480]   So maybe they think they're going to make that much.
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:43.080]   I actually thought, wow, this must be an amazing podcast.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.440]   So I listened to it.
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:50.240]   It's very much like the old days of podcasts where it's a guy just talking or gal just
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:57.960]   talking and she swears every third word worse than wanker.
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.280]   She's funny.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.920]   She's got a great personality.
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:06.160]   What I think in a way, at first I was like, how come I didn't get that?
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:08.560]   But then I realized first of all, for a lot of reasons.
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:14.240]   But what she's done that I think is really great is not only good for podcasting, it's
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:21.640]   good for just the notion of a person, a normal person talking into a microphone and connecting
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:22.640]   with the audience.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:23.640]   She really does.
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:24.840]   It's really connects with the audience.
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.840]   It's very clear.
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:30.920]   But it is a big news story because according to the Wall Street Journal, she signed a deal
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:38.520]   that's bigger than pretty much any baseball player, basketball player, Formula One driver.
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:44.320]   I'm a huge Formula One nut, but let's face it, most drivers really aren't worth listening
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.320]   to.
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.200]   It's just we had a great race.
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.760]   We'd like to work on the car, the hotel, the packaging.
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:50.920]   You don't get paid for talking.
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:53.000]   They get paid for driving, right?
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:57.600]   And Spotify spent a half billion dollars.
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:02.040]   They've got $100 million to Joe Rogan, now $60 million to her.
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:04.960]   So she, again, great for her.
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.240]   I never regretted anybody making a bunch of money.
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:10.360]   But she also had bar stools to amplify her voice.
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.640]   Like my daughter's listening to that podcast.
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:15.160]   And the one time I heard it, I was like, what is that?
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.160]   Because she listens to the podcast, go to sleep.
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.320]   I asked her about the show.
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:19.320]   She's like, I don't even know.
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:20.320]   I just like listening to people talk.
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:22.240]   And she usually listens to female podcasts.
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:25.800]   So they're just getting free views off of her because she passes out after 15 minutes
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:26.960]   listening to it.
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:31.800]   But she had a baked in ramp up help audience and not to say she's not good or great or
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:32.800]   whatever.
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:38.680]   Barstools is pretty large and that voice that she's got, hopefully it's worth the money
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.400]   they paid her because that's a lot of money.
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.520]   And either way, good for her.
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:42.520]   Get that check.
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:43.520]   CTC, cut the check.
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:44.520]   Yeah.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:48.840]   And by the way, I think the problem was that bar stool did not, I think I remember that
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:52.400]   bar stool offered her a half million a year and she said no.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:57.840]   And she worked out her one year contract and then shopped herself and she's got a big
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:58.840]   Hollywood agent.
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:01.040]   I think I see or something like that.
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.760]   Obviously it worked.
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.960]   Spotify is really trying to own the podcast market.
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:06.960]   Yes.
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:07.960]   Yeah.
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.360]   Spotify needs something to have value to give to people.
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:13.400]   So hopefully this is one more thing that is just like Disney Plus.
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:16.520]   People keep saying, oh, why they because they have to put out new content.
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:21.600]   I'm not going to sit here and watch 101 Dalmatians from 1984 42 times a week.
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:22.600]   Okay.
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:27.600]   You've got to give me Loki and the bad batch something every week or every series to keep
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:28.600]   it going.
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:29.600]   So I have something new to go back to.
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:33.280]   Because after you go watch the initial things that are in the statute to you, unless you
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:37.120]   have a kid watching frozen 92 times a day, there's no value unless you're putting new
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:38.120]   things on there.
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:39.360]   So that's what Spotify is trying to do.
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:43.240]   They're trying to catch lightning in a bottle and put more shows and products on there to
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:45.960]   keep people coming in and wanting to pay that subscription.
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:46.960]   Yeah.
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:50.440]   The only thing, and I say good for podcasting is good for podcasting in the sense that it
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:55.240]   really shows it's a, it's a real business, but it's bad in a way for podcasting.
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:05:01.920]   It makes it harder for non-aligned podcast, podcasters like me because it's hard to sell
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:05.600]   it to advertisers who say, yeah, but with Spotify, we get all the information.
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.560]   They don't know that your daughter's asleep.
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:08.560]   So I can tell them that.
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:09.560]   Yeah.
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:10.560]   Yeah.
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:11.560]   They may be sleeping.
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:12.560]   Yeah.
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:15.280]   But they do know that when your daughter is listening, they know who is listening.
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:16.280]   It's her.
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:17.280]   Yeah.
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.280]   Yeah.
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:19.280]   And it's, it's one of those things too.
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:23.520]   You know, you just walk by your kids room and I specifically know that show because she
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.520]   does cuss a lot.
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:27.240]   And I was like, man, cause she usually has her headphones on.
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:29.040]   So like who, who isn't here cussing like that?
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.040]   Are you on a phone?
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:31.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:32.040]   She cusses every third word.
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:33.040]   Yeah.
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.040]   And she was like, she's like, no, I, I listen to podcasts.
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:36.040]   This is one of the things I listen to to go to sleep.
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:38.640]   She's like, I just don't listen to her because she cusses a lot, but I was just trying to
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:39.640]   put it on.
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:40.640]   I was like, okay.
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:41.640]   I think young women love her.
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:45.480]   And you know, I, we was talking with, with Stacy Higginbotham about this.
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:47.280]   She said, you know, it's empowering women.
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:48.280]   It's good.
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:52.280]   Women should be able to get these big deals, you know, it's not, not just the boy, the bro.
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:53.280]   Exactly.
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.280]   Yeah.
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.280]   So, and I don't want to.
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:59.000]   It's interesting how podcasting has moved though in that, you know, it was a big thing
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.720]   in the early norties and then just died.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:09.320]   Now you kept up with it, Leo, but a lot of people travel the market there and now it's
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:10.320]   coming back in.
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:11.360]   Yeah, but it's changed.
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:17.920]   So, you know, I, I don't know, I, you know, of course, after I heard this, I started to
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.640]   question my choices.
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:26.160]   But I, I think that I was so influenced by old media that I basically made Twit kind of
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:32.360]   a old media style TV slash radio network, right?
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:36.800]   And, and the shows are focused on content and, you know, the hosts are X have expertise
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:38.360]   and that kind of thing.
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:43.040]   And there was at the same time we started in 2004, there were plenty of podcasts that
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:45.520]   were just people talking and you're right.
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:47.240]   A lot of those went by the wayside.
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:52.600]   But what was happening, I, I think what has happened is that it's the rise of celebrity
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:55.120]   podcasting and the rise of big companies.
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:58.560]   And I think soon podcasting will be dominated by three companies.
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:06.000]   I Heart Media, the big radio broadcaster, which is big in a podcasting, Spotify and Apple,
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.680]   which is already starting to make a play.
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.400]   They launched a podcast subscription spot.
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:11.680]   Did I say spot cast?
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:14.040]   A podcast subscription feature.
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:17.560]   And I think ultimately they're going to start producing podcasts and they will even sign
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:20.040]   podcasters because it's a kind of content.
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:22.240]   Just, you know, why not?
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:25.120]   It's like Apple TV plus Apple podcast plus.
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:33.320]   So I feel like that's it's, it's almost the professionalizing of podcasting in a way.
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:35.200]   It's the commercializing of podcasting.
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:39.880]   Well, tell Lisa, I'm still waiting on a Twit after dark with a doctor.
[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:40.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:42.120]   I mean, just I could talk for days.
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:48.680]   I'm now thinking maybe we should have gone more toward personal less towards content
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:50.160]   and more towards personality.
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.160]   Right.
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:54.880]   Well, look, look, okay, keep keep the Hawaii trip money going.
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:58.600]   Keep the gravy train going and just start sprinkling in some other things to see how
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:00.440]   it helps float your boat.
[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:02.960]   Rising tide lives off shifts on the wheel.
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.120]   That's not good to offhand.
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:05.120]   Right.
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.120]   Let's keep doing what we're doing.
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:12.520]   But I think it also shows how, you know, after the pandemic, a lot of people wanted to have
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:13.520]   that company.
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:14.520]   They were alone.
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.520]   They were stuck and tried.
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:19.200]   And so a podcast was that company while you did other things to keep your mind busy so
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:23.600]   that you wouldn't over spin on stuff that's going to make you feel really stressed out.
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:28.440]   And so I think that a lot of podcasts got some really big push during that period of
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:29.440]   time.
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:31.400]   I have a lot of people that listen to podcasts before they go to sleep.
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:35.000]   But also when they're doing everything else, they're doing their taxes and stressing out,
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.040]   they want to listen to something, not watch something where they have to pay attention.
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.040]   Exactly.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:44.480]   But just to kind of have that company through the day of some warm, happy, fuzzy or entertaining
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:50.120]   voice to be able to take their mind off of that the sky is literally falling.
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:51.120]   Right.
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:54.400]   Oh, maybe there's a future in that.
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:59.920]   You see, I'm all for people getting paid for their content.
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:06.960]   There was a very worrying sortie in the Guardian this week where a marketing agency approached
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:15.080]   YouTube people to push anti-COVID stuff against the Pfizer vaccine and the AstraZeneca vaccine.
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:20.600]   And they were offered 2000 euros a month just to read out these stats.
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:21.840]   And they called them out on it.
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:26.040]   But unfortunately, some people actually did spread this stuff around.
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:32.640]   At least, Leo, you have some editorial control and quality checking.
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:36.520]   Well, and the other, actually, I like podcasts.
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:42.240]   There's a whole separate kind of almost parallel track with YouTube videos and YouTube video
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:43.240]   stars.
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:46.080]   I mean, look at Georgia now, right?
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:48.040]   That's what you're doing.
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:49.480]   It's different in some ways though.
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:53.640]   The coverage, the tech reporting, the reviews, they're very much more, they're very much
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:58.200]   more personality driven, maybe because it's video.
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:00.160]   I don't know.
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:05.160]   Is that podcasting or something separate?
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:08.640]   So to me, it's the same thing.
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:14.600]   If I'm watching this show per se, I'm wearing video right now.
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:16.080]   Most people listen to it.
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:20.800]   When I'm on YouTube, I watched recently five or six of Georgia shows.
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:24.600]   I know what she looks like, I know what the content is, and she's, I can just walk away
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:25.800]   from it and not have to look at it.
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:27.600]   I can listen to it and get the information.
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.280]   Now, am I podcasting?
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:32.600]   I mean, I don't really, I'll tell you right now, I make podcasts.
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.480]   I don't listen to podcasts at all.
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.480]   If it's on video though, I like checking in, seeing what's going on.
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:38.680]   And then I listen to it.
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:40.560]   So I'm more of a visual person.
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:41.560]   So it's kind of the same thing.
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:43.120]   They're talking in their running their mouth.
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:47.720]   And more so now people are doing podcasts on YouTube because they know that there's an
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:51.680]   audience for that that only want audio, but they're doing the docu-serious thing where
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:55.520]   you record it on video anyway, and you get two pieces of a pie.
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:58.560]   So, you know, it all depends on where people want.
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:00.120]   You got to give it to them everywhere, Gileo.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.080]   You got to be out here twitching and tick-tock.
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:03.080]   That was always my-
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:05.320]   That was when I would tell people.
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:07.800]   You've been, and it was always my philosophy.
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:09.120]   And it's why we do video.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:13.000]   People thought I was crazy because it's a lot more complicated and expensive and difficult.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.080]   But I thought, well, you should give it to them in any format.
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:20.680]   Wherever they are, you should give it to them wherever they are and however they want.
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:25.600]   Okay, the value of an ampersand.
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:29.000]   Google, yes.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000]   Google.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.560]   So actually this happened to Jeff Jarvis.
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:37.040]   Last week, Google pushed out an update to Chrome OS.
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:39.480]   It hit Jeff Jarvis's Chromebook.
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:40.480]   He couldn't log in.
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:41.840]   He thought, did I do something stupid?
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:42.840]   Did I forget my password?
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:45.880]   I don't understand what happened.
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:48.920]   It turned out Google pushed out a bad update.
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:54.800]   91.0.4472.165.
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:57.960]   And it had typo.
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:01.080]   Now the Google has never revealed this.
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:07.400]   But thanks to some sleuthwork by Android police and a Redditor named elitist ferret, I think
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:08.960]   we found out what happened.
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:14.680]   They put out a new build, version 1.167, which fixes the issue.
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:19.040]   But until they fixed it, people either couldn't get into their Chromebook or would have to
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:21.480]   power wash it and start all over.
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:24.320]   And if you had something on the hard drive, that would be bad news or you'd done a lot
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:27.680]   of setup with Linux or something, that would be bad news.
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:30.120]   So here's the bug.
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:31.880]   Wow.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:35.120]   And this will make sense to you if you have done any programming.
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:40.920]   In most programming languages, including C++, which is what Chrome OS has written in,
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:47.320]   the AND statement, the logical AND is written with two ampersands, ampersand ampersand.
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:13:00.080]   So if you want to say, if the password is in the password database and the user is logged
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:06.680]   in or not logged in, then log him in, something like that, they left out one of the ampersands.
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:16.560]   So instead of two, it was just one, which is not a legal C++ statement, but C++ is unfortunately
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.560]   not exactly the safest language in the world.
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:22.760]   And it compiled just fine and it ran just fine, but it had the upshot that you never got to
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.120]   the second statement.
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:25.680]   It was always the first statement.
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:26.680]   There it is.
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:30.720]   It's hard to read this little blurry because of that one missing ampersand.
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:37.280]   So if key data has value and the key data label is empty, then return key data label,
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:40.160]   you never got to that second part.
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:41.760]   So it never executed.
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:45.000]   So you were never able to log in.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.520]   Now the real question is how the hell did this get through three testing channels?
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:51.520]   Can I read the other data?
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:52.840]   That's the question.
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:55.520]   The whole time you've been talking about how does this happen?
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:57.040]   How does that happen?
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:00.920]   There's checks on top of checks on top of checks and you push that how.
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:02.560]   Someone changed at the last second.
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:03.560]   It could be.
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:04.560]   I don't know.
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:05.560]   It could be somebody.
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.920]   The last minute I'm just going to fix this and hit it.
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:11.600]   Or they had it open and they accidentally hit backspace or something.
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:13.760]   And nothing should ever be auto update.
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:14.760]   No.
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:15.760]   Ever.
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:16.760]   Ever.
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:18.320]   Because at least you get to catch this and some kind of wave.
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:22.360]   When you just have everybody do it, you're just something like this happens as opposed
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:23.680]   to, hey, we got an update.
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:24.680]   Go do it if you want.
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:25.680]   Oh shoot.
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:27.560]   2000 people just got screwed over.
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:29.600]   At least it wasn't 32 million.
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.200]   You know, that's bad.
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.200]   It's kind of wild.
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:33.200]   Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:37.440]   I guess it's the same sort of thing you see though with Microsoft patches in that they
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:43.680]   will push out patches to consumers first and then to offices later commercial licensees
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:48.840]   later because we are their test bed.
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:53.840]   And yeah, in Google's case, it was a bit unfortunate, but unless you turned your Chromebook off
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:58.080]   and turned it back on again, it wasn't a massive issue at first.
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:04.800]   I think that's maybe why it went undetected because the testers maybe were all logging
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:07.720]   in some other way or never turned their Chromebook off or.
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:08.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:10.760]   I think it must have gone in at the last minute.
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:17.840]   And as a Reddit comment suggested, any if you read it through a linter, which is kind
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:23.800]   of a standard process with programs to check for typos, it would have found it immediately.
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:24.800]   I don't.
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:27.400]   It's amazing that this got through.
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:30.000]   It's amazing that this got through.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000]   And I don't know.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.200]   I just want to make a stop test through it.
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:35.200]   Sorry.
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:36.200]   After you go.
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:40.800]   Well, you know, it shows how just a little tiny thing can kind of stand still all the
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:41.800]   time.
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:47.800]   Well, it's that we use and how like one little tiny mistake someone sneezes and then hits
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:52.960]   enter and they don't go through another testing can really just stop your car, your phone,
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:59.400]   your computer, your work, everything.
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:00.400]   And then there's a camera.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:01.400]   Which is down.
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:02.800]   Actually, this was good for Akama.
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:09.680]   We should mention Akama is a sponsor, but they went down a couple of days ago and their
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:14.640]   DNS edge DNS product went down again, you know, little mistake somewhere.
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:18.440]   They fixed it within I think 45 minutes or half an hour.
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:22.720]   But it just shows how many people use Akama.
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:25.400]   Because I mean, everybody lost their stuff.
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:30.240]   I mean, I'm on the house is email list and that blew up like Hiroshima.
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:32.680]   I mean, it was just like, what the hell's going on?
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:34.320]   Where are we?
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:35.680]   Last pass was down.
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:37.760]   Twitter was down.
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:41.400]   Even some Amazon stuff was down.
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:49.680]   Yeah, just, you know, probably they said that we were we we we uploaded an update and it
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:54.440]   failed and we whoops fixed it.
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:17:00.680]   Do is this a bad thing or is I mean, this is it's this kind of thing that people who
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:02.560]   say we shouldn't be doing all this cloud stuff.
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:04.040]   We shouldn't be moving to the cloud.
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:05.600]   This is a perfect example.
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:10.120]   Why it's a terrible idea is that is that the takeaway from this is that it's a terrible
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:11.120]   idea.
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:13.160]   The takeaway is don't force updates.
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:14.160]   That's the takeaway.
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:18.320]   That's, you know, because people want to make mistakes, whether it's a cloud or Microsoft
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:21.560]   or even Apple, they could potentially make a mistake.
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:24.840]   So the real thing is don't force updates on people.
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:28.040]   This is just rely on the cloud.
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:30.760]   You should have your stuff and rely on the cloud.
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:33.080]   There should probably be a fall back DNS service.
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:34.080]   I think you're right.
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:38.080]   That should be there's everything that you have should be saved somewhere where you have
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.080]   control over it.
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.080]   And you should probably have it on the cloud.
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:45.200]   Because we were just we're just so behooved to all the technology that we use.
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:49.560]   If I lost everything on my computer, really, I don't even know how I would contact all
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:53.120]   of my people to be able to let them know that I can't contact all of my people.
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:18:02.160]   Delta Airlines, British Airways, Capital One GoDaddy, Vanguard, UPS, LastPass, AT&T, and
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:03.160]   Costco.
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:07.960]   There's a subset, small subset of all the companies whose websites were either down
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:14.280]   or completely down or slow because of this error.
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:17.800]   I you know, it's not going to be perfect.
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:23.120]   I don't think this is a case of updates not being or being automatic or not because the
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:27.240]   update was merely to optimize stuff.
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:32.080]   I think maybe better QC better quality control in general, right?
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:33.840]   Yes, sir.
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:40.880]   And whatever you do, can we can we talk about another story that things that shouldn't happen?
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:43.760]   Yeah, I think I know where you're going with this one.
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:46.400]   Yeah, go ahead and go where I'm going.
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:51.560]   Are you going to the defunct video hosting site flooding the Washington Post with hardcore
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:52.560]   porn?
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:56.800]   Hey, you see what I'm saying.
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.560]   I feel it happened.
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:00.240]   I had a feeling it shouldn't happen.
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:02.040]   But this is great market.
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:04.160]   This is great business.
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:06.960]   This is how you get things done in America.
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:08.720]   This is capitalism right here.
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:13.840]   You find a defunct property and you redirected to get this go up a layer and you disturb
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:15.840]   the entire internet in the process.
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:17.000]   So carry on.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.960]   At one point, there were competitors to YouTube.
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:25.120]   They've all given up by now, but there was a company called Vidme founded in 2014.
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:26.280]   It only lasted a few years.
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:28.560]   It was shuttered in 2017.
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:37.320]   But a number of big sites used Vidme for embedded video on their site.
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:40.920]   Vidme when it went out of business, lost the domain.
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:51.280]   The domain was purchased by five star porn HD and they started putting porn on the Huffington
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:54.600]   Post, New York Magazine, the Washington Post.
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:55.680]   These are old articles.
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:58.680]   I doubt a lot of people saw them.
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:01.640]   You'd have to be looking for pretty old stuff.
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:05.240]   Articles that were from 2014 to 2017.
[01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:06.240]   I like this though.
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:11.080]   Vice found a New York Magazine article about House Majority Leader John Boehner's creepy
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:17.160]   kissy face instead of a video of the creepy kissy face.
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:21.760]   There's five star HD porn video.
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:23.480]   Here's one on the huff post.
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:25.880]   From a bro, Martin Screlle, you remember him?
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:28.720]   Says he's been permanently banned from Twitter.
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:29.720]   There you go.
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:32.640]   I don't know why he was banned.
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:33.640]   There you go.
[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:35.640]   I think he's in jail now.
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:37.480]   I'm not sure.
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:40.840]   I hope so.
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:45.040]   These things happen.
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:48.080]   The problem is, it's the kind of thing you wouldn't notice necessarily right away unless
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:50.640]   you're looking at old news stories.
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:55.840]   One goodness for Twitter though because I'm sure somebody tweeted it and brought it to
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:00.920]   the attention of the respective parties.
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:07.240]   Let's take a little break here and we have lots more still to come with our guests.
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:08.240]   We had a fun week.
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:10.080]   I didn't see it, but I hear it was a good week.
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:11.080]   No.
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:12.080]   Was I here for this week?
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:13.080]   I can't even remember.
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:14.080]   Was I on the...
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:16.800]   Oh no, I was here this week.
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:17.800]   We've got a little...
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:18.800]   You know what?
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:21.520]   A little mini documentary about this week's shows.
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:23.840]   Earlier today I saw from Sean.
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:24.840]   I'm Sean.
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:26.480]   Oh, that's me.
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:31.480]   Who else do Leo LaPorte was in the hall of presidents at Disney World?
[01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:34.160]   That does look like me.
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:38.240]   Previously on Twitter, iOS today.
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:39.240]   I have the MacSafe battery.
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:43.920]   I've actually had it for a couple of days, but I have a Mac's iPhone here as well and
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:45.760]   so people can see the difference.
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:50.920]   You know, if it's really nicely on this device, it works really well.
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:51.920]   Smart tech today.
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:58.240]   It's time for ALEXA, the Google Assistant and Siri, to f***ing swear.
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:03.160]   So this is a wired article that says that, you know what?
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:07.400]   I think it's okay if voice assistants swear.
[01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:08.880]   Windows Weekly.
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:13.320]   Microsoft finally admits it's killing the stores for Biz and EDU.
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:17.600]   And because it's a ZVN story, I'm thinking it's a Mary Jo Foley story.
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:18.600]   You called me.
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.360]   Everyone, I called this a year ago.
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:21.360]   I wrote this.
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:23.800]   Everybody on Twitter said, "I didn't know what I was talking about.
[01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:24.800]   I was crazy.
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:26.120]   Where was I getting my information?"
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:27.640]   It was obviously wrong.
[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:30.040]   And today it has been announced.
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:32.040]   I mean, that's me on Discord.
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:34.840]   Whoever just put that up, Beyonce doing a little hair flip.
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:35.840]   That's me right now.
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:36.840]   Oh, tweet.
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:37.840]   I had hair.
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:39.840]   I would be flipping it right now.
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:41.640]   You'd be flipping.
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:45.520]   Yes, I was here for that week.
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:47.520]   I remember that now.
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:49.160]   It's all coming back to me.
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:51.360]   That's why we make these little videos.
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:54.240]   Leo, here's what it was this week.
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:56.400]   Oh, I remember that.
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:57.400]   Yeah.
[01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:59.440]   When did I get back from Hawaii?
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:00.440]   Tuesday.
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:01.440]   Okay.
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:06.440]   Oh, it was all because did I see the shows?
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:07.840]   Was I here for the show?
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:09.840]   I can't remember what it was like.
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:14.520]   When you get back from vacation a few days later, do you remember if you were here like
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:15.520]   few...
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:16.520]   No?
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:17.520]   No?
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:18.520]   Those bassos?
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:22.080]   Those bassos problems you have in ugolietos.
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:23.080]   Bassos problems.
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:24.080]   It was a lot.
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:27.160]   I get a lot of heat for taking a vacation.
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:28.720]   Hey, little, little, little.
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:30.440]   Don't people take vacations?
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:33.000]   I'm not a billionaire for crying out.
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.320]   I wouldn't tell about them pictures on Gileo.
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:36.320]   I'm just saying.
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:38.320]   I don't see you from home.
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:41.960]   I'm saying, "Lusha, Istanbul, I saw you in a volcano one time.
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:43.840]   I don't know if this photo happened out.
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:46.440]   I've seen you coast to coast, you've seen carpet."
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:48.440]   Okay, I'll be fine.
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:49.440]   I'm stopping.
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:51.440]   You know what it is?
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:54.280]   I'm not even a $20 million error.
[01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:56.120]   Hey, I don't regret you.
[01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:59.360]   You don't yell at Alex Cooper for getting $60 million.
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:00.360]   Hey, hey.
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:03.600]   Aren't you having that steak that was covered in gold leaf?
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:06.000]   Did I know you were with this gold leaf steak?
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000]   Oh, yes, but it's edible.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.320]   Hey, when you get as old as you, Uncle Leo, you deserve it.
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:11.800]   Okay, I know Lisa deserves it.
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:14.920]   But when you get to your age, Uncle Leo, go and enjoy the side of parts of the world.
[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:17.440]   I am going to point this out.
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:18.640]   This one was on Lisa.
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:19.800]   She paid for it.
[01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:22.360]   It was to celebrate her son's graduation from high school.
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:23.360]   She said, "What do you want to do?"
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:24.960]   She said, "He said I want to go to Hawaii."
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:26.520]   So she paid for the whole thing.
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:28.040]   So don't congratulations.
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:29.040]   Don't yell at me.
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:31.640]   Yeah, tell Lisa she shouldn't be taking expensive.
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:34.920]   Oh, we kind of have the same idea, Uncle Leo.
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:37.480]   My daughter just graduated the eighth grade.
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:39.240]   And I said, "What do you want to do?"
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:42.760]   And she said, "Well, before the pandemic, we were supposed to go down to Miami for a
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:44.880]   weekend and then we'll shut down."
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:46.280]   So you know what I'm doing, Uncle Leo?
[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:48.120]   Yeah, in Vanito, I mean, yeah.
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:49.720]   No, no, but you want it.
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:51.720]   No, no, but you win that, Uncle Leo, better than that.
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:52.720]   Better than mine.
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:53.920]   I'm taking her on her first flight.
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.960]   You know, we're going to San Diego.
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:57.960]   Then we're going to drive to LA.
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:58.960]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:03.160]   Then we're going to fly up to San Francisco, see a guy at Petaluma, maybe, on a Sunday.
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:04.160]   Oh.
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:07.320]   Then we're going to fly out to Austin, Texas, get us some good old barbecue.
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:09.320]   And then we're going to go home after attending.
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:10.320]   Holy cow.
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:12.680]   I'm just saying, Lisa had a good idea.
[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:14.880]   I told you, we want to say my father.
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:15.880]   Holy cow.
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:17.040]   That's phenomenal.
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:18.960]   So just save me a seat there.
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:19.960]   Don't put the table up high.
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:20.960]   I like the table low.
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:23.320]   And make sure you have a good drink for me.
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:25.720]   And make the guest room available.
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:26.880]   And I'll be out there.
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:27.880]   All right.
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:28.880]   It's all.
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:32.280]   I'm getting excited just thinking about it.
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:34.960]   It was too much ugly.
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:38.320]   I'm going to get this guy.
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:40.320]   Are you coming out for VidCon?
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:43.040]   No, I'm just for the kid.
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:44.040]   I'm not going to.
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:48.320]   You're the only stop that's going to be non having fun seeing people doing things.
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:50.840]   I mean, I hear your fun at all, but I mean, you know what I'm saying.
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:53.840]   I would love to see you and I would love to see your daughter.
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:54.840]   I know.
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:55.840]   I know.
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:56.840]   She's for the soap.
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:57.840]   I told her.
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:58.840]   She's like, Oh, we could go.
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:25:59.840]   I could go in the show.
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:00.840]   I was like, you're not going to be on the show.
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:01.840]   But you could sit in there.
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:02.840]   I loved it.
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:05.320]   I love Brit box, by the way.
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:06.320]   I just want to say.
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:07.320]   Oh, I'm a subscriber.
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:08.320]   Yes.
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:09.320]   Wonderful.
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:10.320]   You get to see all these.
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:11.320]   What was the show?
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:14.880]   You I got to write this down because you recommended a show on Brit box many times.
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:16.800]   Oh, was it spaced?
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:17.800]   Is that all?
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:18.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:19.800]   I think spaced.
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:21.280]   Yeah, some space is well worth a look at British.
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:23.000]   Yes, minister and yes, prime minister.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000]   Yes.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000]   Haven't seen those.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000]   Yes, those are good.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000]   Very much worth this.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000]   Yes.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.000]   Yes.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000]   Yes.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.680]   So if you are a Brit box subscriber, you might want to check your bill.
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:32.680]   Yes.
[01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:41.800]   Because it's $6.99 a month, but apparently a large number of people were charged $757
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:42.800]   for the month of July.
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:43.800]   What the hell?
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:44.800]   I need to check my bank account.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.600]   I didn't heard of this.
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:51.760]   They say, we are aware of this small percentage.
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:52.760]   Oh, sorry.
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:54.840]   You don't get cold British ads.
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:55.840]   I'm sorry.
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:56.840]   I'm sorry.
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:04.120]   I didn't say it's in Australia.
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:08.560]   Experience an overcharge by our billing vendor yesterday.
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:14.640]   We took immediate action to correct the mistake by contacting all affected Brit box subscribers
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:16.600]   and issuing them refunds.
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:23.560]   Although a number of people whose bank balance went below zero and couldn't pay their bills
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:26.160]   and so forth, we're a little more upset than that.
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:30.560]   I'll tell you, there's nothing worse than that price change.
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:36.640]   So I had Hootsuite for instance, and since inception, I know the owner, I met him.
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:37.880]   He's like, here, take this.
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:42.240]   I have full power and I've only been paying $5 a month for the life of the church.
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:43.880]   Oh, you are lucky.
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:49.880]   And I am lucky until last month when my $5.99 went to $95.
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:50.880]   Yeah.
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:52.680]   Who's charged me $95?
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:53.680]   That's the normal price.
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:56.480]   I was like, I'm not regular people.
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:58.920]   You had the early adopter price.
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:02.080]   And the worst part about it is like I do a lot of stuff for the company.
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:04.080]   So I make money off of it.
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:07.480]   It pays for itself, but I felt so bad.
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:12.360]   I literally was like, I must, I must text and message the owner and ask him, why am I
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:13.920]   paying the regular?
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:15.920]   Do you not love me anymore?
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:16.920]   What did I do?
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:23.640]   I'm sorry that our new CFO said we have to take all the influencers off.
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:29.000]   Somebody came in there and kicked me and I was like, I've lived so long for so cheap.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.000]   I can't even.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.200]   I'm not the type of person to complain because I know I've been living off the cow.
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:36.000]   But I was like, what?
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.360]   Who did that?
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:38.360]   Why?
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:39.360]   That was only $90.
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:40.360]   It's me.
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:41.360]   I'll be punching screens.
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:45.640]   I mean, father brown.
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:46.640]   That's a good one.
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:47.640]   Yes.
[01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:48.640]   Oh, definitely.
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:50.200]   And the father Ted, you mean?
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:51.200]   Father Ted.
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:52.200]   Sorry.
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:54.520]   That is an absolute classic.
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:55.520]   Yeah.
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:56.520]   Yeah.
[01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:58.360]   Our show today, I just thought I'd mention that.
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:28:59.760]   So check your bill.
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:00.760]   Our show.
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:03.520]   It's a public service announcement.
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:05.680]   I have to check mine too because I am.
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:09.440]   I've just checked and they haven't actually taken the money out, but that would have been
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:11.080]   a good story if they had.
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:12.080]   Wow.
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:13.400]   Oh my God.
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:20.000]   Our show today brought to you by worldwide technology and HPE Hewlett Packard in a price.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:25.200]   WWT is at the forefront of innovation working with clients all over the world to transform
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:26.560]   their businesses.
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:33.200]   At the heart of WWT lies the ATC, the Advanced Technology Center.
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:35.360]   Lisa and I visited that last March.
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:38.480]   It was the last thing we did before COVID and it is amazing.
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:39.920]   It's there in St. Louis.
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:46.400]   So WWT is a partner to businesses who want to use technology to improve their business.
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:49.360]   And man, what a great partner.
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:51.360]   They use this Advanced Technology Center.
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:58.600]   It's a research and testing lab with has technologies from all the big OEMs, all the disruptors,
[01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:01.280]   more than half a billion dollars in equipment.
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:05.840]   And their engineers use this to spin up proofs of concept, to test things, to learn about
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:12.640]   things, to see how these solutions work before they bring them to you.
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:15.360]   And they are amazing, but here's the best thing.
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:16.840]   You can use it too.
[01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:18.200]   That is amazing.
[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:25.280]   The Advanced Technology Center offers hundreds of hours of on-demand and schedulable labs,
[01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:29.120]   like for instance, HPE's Primera Storage Lab.
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:33.160]   Labs representing the newest advances in multi-cloud architect.
[01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:39.120]   Everything you need to know, security, networking, primary and secondary storage, data, analytics,
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:42.680]   AI, DevOps, and so much more.
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:46.880]   So their engineers use these labs, but so can you.
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:49.240]   You can try things, you can learn about things.
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:56.080]   It'll help you choose the best solution and help you work with WWT.
[01:30:56.080 --> 01:31:02.680]   So you know what I love about WWT is they are, they work with you from beginning to end.
[01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:06.320]   They start with strategy, they understand business, they start with your goals, your
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:07.800]   business strategies.
[01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:10.000]   They help you find the right technology.
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:13.080]   They help you integrate it, get it into your system.
[01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:18.480]   And then they stay there to help you to support and training throughout the entire process.
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:23.600]   With ATC, you can start that process by testing out products and solutions before you go to
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:24.840]   market.
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:26.520]   And it's not just the hands-on labs, by the way.
[01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:31.080]   There's technical articles, there's expert insights, there's demonstration videos, there's
[01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:36.400]   white papers, all the tools you need to stay up to date with the latest technology.
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:38.880]   And it's great because they virtualize it.
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:44.160]   They did this last year and it's amazing, members of the ATC platform can access these
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:48.600]   resources anywhere in the world, anytime of the day or night.
[01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:51.840]   And while you're there, by the way, you should also check out events and communities.
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:56.160]   We did an event there when we were out there with so much fun, more opportunities to learn
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:32:00.680]   about technology trends, to hear about the latest research and insights from their experts.
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:03.240]   They've got an amazing streaming facility there in an auditorium.
[01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:05.600]   It's incredible.
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:12.400]   Whatever your business needs, WWT can deliver scalable, tried, and tested tailored solutions
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:18.760]   for UW-W-T, bringing strategy and execution together to make this brave new world happen.
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:25.680]   Learn more about WWT, the ATC, and again access to all their free resources, www.wt.com/twit.
[01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:28.320]   Create a free account on their ATC platform.
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:31.600]   They're one of the best, they're one of the biggest, www.wt.com/twit.
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:38.600]   Did you get the sweet deal back or did you have to start paying more money for it?
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:49.960]   Again, I felt bad re-asking for my deal back, so I'm just paying for it.
[01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:53.760]   As I say it out loud, I at least you make the attempt to be like, "Hey, brother, I
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:58.160]   know you're tired of being a CEO, maybe you could tell somebody you still love me and
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:01.040]   put me back on the pay."
[01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:04.280]   If you're less than in Hootsuite, come on, man.
[01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:06.680]   I think we use Hootsuite.
[01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:10.120]   It's a social media tool, right?
[01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:11.120]   Yes, yes.
[01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:15.280]   So you can just cross platform everything from one hub.
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:21.040]   One of the few remaining options you have that are Uber, Uber, Uber expensive because
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:22.360]   it's big business.
[01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:23.840]   It is.
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:25.440]   Lots of changes going on on Twitter.
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:29.920]   I wonder if fact of Twitter is going to start offering these kinds of solutions they ought
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:30.920]   to.
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:35.200]   They're letting that go.
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:36.200]   We've discussed this before.
[01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:40.720]   There's so many things that Twitter could be doing that they're almost like Google anymore.
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:44.440]   They keep dabbling and doing things and then taking it away.
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:47.680]   They have the tip service where people could instead of using Patreon or something like
[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:49.480]   that, you could use it through Twitter.
[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:52.760]   Only certain people got it, then nobody has it, then they took it away.
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:55.640]   Now they're not going to be doing fleets anymore, which I never did.
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:56.800]   Yeah, they killed fleets.
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:58.400]   It was around for a minute.
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:33:59.400]   Hot minute.
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:00.400]   Yeah.
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:02.000]   I mean, I guess they're like Google right now.
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.400]   They're just throwing things at the wall.
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:06.040]   And if it doesn't do really well, they take it down quickly.
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:07.360]   They won't just let it stay.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:08.600]   We played on Thursday.
[01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:13.000]   We played with the new tweet deck, which frankly, I don't like very much.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:17.760]   Fortunately, I don't think I have it still, but there is a way to turn it on manually.
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:18.920]   I really like to.
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:20.280]   Do you use tweet deck?
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:23.080]   Because that does have a minimal scheduling features.
[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:26.320]   Oh, I think I do have the new tweet deck preview.
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:27.320]   Oh boy.
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:28.320]   I used to use tweet deck.
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:29.720]   I used to love a tweet deck.
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:31.600]   But I used to be great.
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:32.600]   I was crippled.
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:33.600]   Yeah.
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:37.680]   Well, we just allows me to do Facebook and all that kind of stuff and other applications
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:38.680]   as well.
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:44.880]   I'm hoping that this is a sign that they're going to kind of start putting money back
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:46.120]   into tweet deck.
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:49.360]   This is the new tweet deck.
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:53.760]   It's a preview and you can actually exit it, but you have now a lot more capability to
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:55.680]   change the width of the columns.
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:35:01.840]   There's a new explore column, which is actually recommending a good recommendation for me.
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:03.440]   There you go.
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:04.440]   Yeah.
[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:06.800]   Here's a bunch of Linux stuff that's just recommending.
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:08.880]   I guess it knows me.
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:10.960]   Twitter, you know me.
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:12.040]   Open source.
[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:14.240]   So this is just interesting.
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:18.040]   These are columns you can add.
[01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:19.040]   See scheduled tweets.
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:20.560]   This is what you use.
[01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:22.920]   But you want to do it on all the social platforms.
[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:23.920]   Yeah.
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:27.800]   Yes, it's just because again, I do stuff for other brands and companies like that.
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:30.480]   So Facebook pages and websites.
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:32.560]   It's just everything on one.
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:33.840]   And they have the same.
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:34.840]   It's like that.
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:35.840]   Yes.
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:36.840]   Yes.
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:38.680]   And I can see it all in place and it works well in my phone.
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:39.680]   I'm not going to give them a commercial.
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:40.680]   They charge me more money.
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:41.680]   Why my left promotion?
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:42.680]   Well, no, no, no, no.
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:44.680]   I don't even know if it works anymore.
[01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:45.680]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:46.680]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:47.680]   Yeah.
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:48.680]   The service used to be amazing.
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:49.680]   Now they're charging people money.
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:50.680]   Who doesn't?
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:55.680]   How do you survive?
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:57.560]   Capitalism is evil.
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:04.200]   Unless I'm getting a discount, in which case, Viva like capitalism.
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:09.480]   Twitter says, and this is kind of disappointing, that they have a kind of surprisingly low
[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:12.080]   two factor authentication adoption.
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:14.680]   Oh, this is really gussing.
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:15.680]   What would you say?
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:16.680]   Okay.
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:17.680]   I won't show the number.
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:22.160]   And they're saying basically that the number of people in the last six months who are using
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:25.200]   two-fought factor authentication has grown 9.1%.
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:26.600]   Oh, that's good.
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:27.600]   Right.
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:32.400]   But the total number of people using it is 2.3% of users.
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:34.760]   Google's got the same problem.
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:37.920]   I was down at an enigma conference a couple of years ago and they were saying they've
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:40.720]   had two factor authentication for years.
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:43.120]   Only 10% of people are using it.
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:47.120]   And even then when people are using it, they're using it with SMS, which is the worst possible
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:48.120]   way.
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:54.840]   Well, that's another thing Twitter said of the 2.3% of all users who use two factor, 80%
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:55.840]   used SMS.
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:37:02.000]   Yeah, 30% used an authenticator app and only 0.5%.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:05.600]   So that's 0.5% of 2.3%.
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:07.080]   So it's like me.
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:10.080]   So use a couple of mates.
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:16.080]   Use a Yubike or some sort of security key, which is clearly the best way to do it.
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:21.320]   Do you know why, Uncle Leo, I'll tell you the general regular human being reason of why.
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:23.200]   Why?
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:29.600]   I have 232 Twitter accounts and every other week when I try to log into something, they
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:32.240]   tell me, oh, you've got to update your email.
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:33.280]   You've got to check your thing.
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:36.640]   I don't have time to too authenticate my thing.
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:39.760]   OK, I've got a Russian troll factory.
[01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:41.600]   Are you fancy bear?
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:43.400]   Is that you?
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:45.160]   I'm I-heart moms on there.
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:47.640]   I'm knee-grow-dom is like, don't ask me what I am doing.
[01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:48.920]   I hear a minute about this.
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:51.480]   I'm just saying that I have too many.
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:52.480]   I don't have time.
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:53.640]   And same thing with Gmail.
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:56.240]   People open up 14 gmails just to get free stuff.
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:58.320]   I don't have time to second authenticate.
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:00.920]   And sometimes I forget what number or other emails to back up.
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:03.080]   But I think you're unusual, aren't you?
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:04.240]   I mean, I am.
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:05.800]   But we're just lazy Americans.
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:09.280]   Twitter pushes people out all the time when they have one account.
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:10.440]   It's just too much.
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:12.600]   I don't have who am I?
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:13.600]   You know what?
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:14.600]   Come and get me.
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:16.880]   I'm not an astronaut in the upper atmosphere.
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:20.960]   So I need to lock up my life, OK, from the people on Twitter.
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:21.480]   All right?
[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:23.520]   I just need my stuff to work when I'm there.
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:24.640]   I don't have time for this.
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:27.000]   I'm, yo, no time.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.520]   Well, I think that you're right.
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:30.400]   We are kind of lazy to be able to do it.
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:31.600]   A lot of people don't even understand what
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:33.200]   two-fatter authentication is.
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:35.120]   They think that now they're going to have to sign in twice
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:36.600]   or it's going to become more work.
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:37.840]   But for me, I've already signed in.
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:40.480]   I'm like, I'm not going back to reduce something,
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:41.960]   even though it could be more secure.
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:43.880]   I don't really worry that they're going to be saying,
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:44.880]   you know what?
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:47.760]   I'm going to double your Bitcoins if you give me Bitcoin coins.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:49.280]   I don't think they're using my account for that.
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:51.920]   And I'm like, so I don't do it.
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:52.920]   I don't think that I have it on.
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:54.200]   I don't even know if I have it on.
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:55.240]   I could check.
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:56.240]   Oh, I do.
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:57.640]   But I don't--
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:38:58.880]   I don't want anybody stealing it.
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:38:59.880]   I know.
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:02.560]   I got a very concrete demonstration
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:04.680]   of why you should have it on.
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:11.000]   There was a Proud Boy rally in San Francisco about three years
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:11.760]   ago.
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:13.360]   And I made some comments on Twitter,
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:16.840]   basically pointing out these people were--
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:20.000]   I want to be polite, but basically--
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000]   Git.
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.640]   Git.
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:27.240]   And then within an hour of posting that,
[01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:29.480]   somebody had tried to use an old password
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:31.440]   to get into my Facebook account
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:33.840]   and to a factual authentication to block it.
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:37.560]   We need to have multi-factor authentication,
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:39.120]   possibly not SMS.
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:40.480]   And I agree with you, Leo.
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:42.160]   The key works.
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:45.080]   And it's a pain of the ass to carry around, but so's a house
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:45.880]   key.
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:46.240]   Yeah.
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:48.040]   I carried on my house keys.
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:50.000]   So I mean, I always have it with me.
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000]   I don't know.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.600]   I just-- I mean, I hear from too many people
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:57.480]   who've lost their accounts.
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:01.640]   Well, here's an example of why you maybe don't want it
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:02.840]   to be too secure.
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:05.800]   Maybe you want the bad guys to steal your account.
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:08.840]   Because otherwise, they might go to greater lengths.
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:11.440]   Shane Sanderman.
[01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:12.520]   That's a bust.
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:13.440]   Oh, man.
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:13.920]   All right.
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:15.360]   Well, there's a guy named Sparky.
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:16.920]   Sparky Herring.
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:18.440]   This guy's a hero.
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:20.600]   You know, if you ever knew Fido Net,
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:22.360]   this guy was an absolute hero.
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:24.600]   He invented the format that made it possible.
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:25.440]   QWK.
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:27.560]   And to die in this way is shameful.
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:28.960]   Yeah.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:30.120]   I didn't realize that.
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:32.680]   So yes, he is absolutely--
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:34.600]   I was a fight on a sysop.
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:37.000]   He's absolutely-- it's a shameful thing.
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:42.160]   He had the Twitter handle @tenacy, which is it turns out
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:43.400]   a hot handle.
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:46.280]   Short handles are hot.
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:48.480]   And I guess things like @tenacy.
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:55.720]   His kid, Shane Sanderman, wanted the username,
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:58.800]   contacted Sparky.
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:00.400]   He said, no.
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:02.000]   You can't have my name.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:05.520]   So the kid hired or recruited a group of friends
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:07.960]   to harass him.
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:11.760]   They sent him a bunch of unwanted pizzas.
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:16.920]   And then things got deadly on April 27th last year,
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:19.280]   a minor in Britain who was not identified because he's
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:23.520]   a minor called law enforcement in Bethpage, Tennessee,
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:26.320]   claimed that Herring had killed a woman and set up
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:27.880]   booby trap bombs at his home.
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:29.320]   So he was being swatted.
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:34.200]   So cops rushed to his door.
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:37.000]   Sparky grabbed a firearm because he
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.800]   thought there were trespassers.
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:41.400]   When he realized there were three police officers
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:44.080]   and his homie dropped it, he went out of the house
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:46.000]   with a gun, his daughter said, because he
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.320]   heard someone was on his property.
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:49.000]   He sees all these cops around him.
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.440]   They asked, are you Mark Herring?
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:51.480]   Put your hands up.
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:53.640]   He tosses the gun away from him to show he's not a threat,
[01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:57.920]   puts his hands up, and suffers a massive heart attack
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:00.600]   and dies.
[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:01.240]   They killed him.
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:02.240]   They killed me.
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:03.720]   I'm sorry.
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:07.400]   And I was glad that he got the sentence that he did,
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:08.880]   because this is just--
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:12.000]   Well, Sonormen, who was a minor since turned 18,
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.280]   was arrested immediately next month,
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:17.680]   pled guilty in March to a federal charge of conspiracy
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:22.440]   five years in federal prison.
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:22.960]   As--
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:23.560]   I think if federal--
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:23.920]   I think if federal--
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:25.080]   --is family are going to have to deal with this
[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:26.120]   for the rest of their lives.
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:27.120]   Yeah.
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:27.640]   You know--
[01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:28.480]   I'm going to give federal prison--
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:29.480]   Well, I'm going to give federal prison--
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:30.480]   joke.
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:31.040]   We've had deaths like this before.
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:31.560]   Well, maybe it's not federal.
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:32.240]   I'm just saying--
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:33.040]   OK.
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:33.540]   Good.
[01:42:33.540 --> 01:42:34.540]   Well, let me see.
[01:42:34.540 --> 01:42:35.860]   I don't want to go into the nice prison.
[01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:37.400]   I want to go on regular prison.
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:38.260]   Jail, man.
[01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:39.960]   They want county jail.
[01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:41.620]   I'm thinking it's a federal offense,
[01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:44.800]   but I don't-- actually, I don't see that.
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:45.400]   So--
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:47.000]   Yeah.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.300]   Unfortunately, the kid who made the call
[01:42:49.300 --> 01:42:51.180]   will never-- probably never be known,
[01:42:51.180 --> 01:42:54.340]   because he is a minor.
[01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:56.540]   It's not the first time somebody has died from a swatting
[01:42:56.540 --> 01:42:57.540]   attack.
[01:42:57.540 --> 01:42:59.180]   It's a terrible thing to do.
[01:42:59.180 --> 01:42:59.880]   It uses--
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:02.700]   You know, 2017, and some guy--
[01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:05.540]   and that was even worse, because they've
[01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:07.380]   swatted the wrong address.
[01:43:07.380 --> 01:43:13.140]   And some guy who comes out having no idea what's going on
[01:43:13.140 --> 01:43:16.860]   and got shot straight through the chest.
[01:43:16.860 --> 01:43:20.180]   Swatting is serious business, and this
[01:43:20.180 --> 01:43:22.380]   is getting people killed.
[01:43:22.380 --> 01:43:24.660]   Don't get me started on American police procedures,
[01:43:24.660 --> 01:43:26.980]   but in this case, it wasn't a shooting case.
[01:43:26.980 --> 01:43:27.940]   It was a heart attack.
[01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:29.980]   But even so, it was just heart-rending.
[01:43:29.980 --> 01:43:30.660]   When we got to--
[01:43:30.660 --> 01:43:31.180]   You're so--
[01:43:31.180 --> 01:43:31.540]   --why did some music--
[01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:32.540]   You're so reactive.
[01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:33.380]   When we got started--
[01:43:33.380 --> 01:43:34.060]   Or become, right?
[01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:36.180]   Some years ago, the Petaluma police
[01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:39.100]   took it very-- did not take it very seriously.
[01:43:39.100 --> 01:43:41.100]   A couple of guys came over.
[01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:41.660]   They said--
[01:43:41.660 --> 01:43:43.420]   Hang on, you got swatted in Petaluma.
[01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:44.380]   Yeah, in our studio.
[01:43:44.380 --> 01:43:45.140]   Yeah.
[01:43:45.140 --> 01:43:46.060]   Oh, good grip.
[01:43:46.060 --> 01:43:47.580]   Hang on, everyone knows you there.
[01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:48.820]   It's just like, really?
[01:43:48.820 --> 01:43:51.300]   Maybe that's why Leo's gone nuts with a gun.
[01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:52.100]   Yeah, right.
[01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:53.580]   How much you got to drink back there?
[01:43:53.580 --> 01:43:54.300]   The guy didn't say it was me.
[01:43:54.300 --> 01:43:56.540]   The guy said, I have shot everybody in the studio
[01:43:56.540 --> 01:43:59.740]   and planted bombs in the studio.
[01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:02.380]   I've heard the recording of the kid.
[01:44:02.380 --> 01:44:05.980]   And the police-- a couple of guys came over, said,
[01:44:05.980 --> 01:44:06.660]   we got this thing.
[01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:07.940]   Is everything OK here?
[01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:10.420]   And we said, yeah.
[01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:11.060]   But you know what?
[01:44:11.060 --> 01:44:12.580]   We evacuated the building.
[01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:15.980]   They got dogs and sniffed the whole place.
[01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:17.380]   They took it seriously enough.
[01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:18.860]   But they didn't threaten our lives.
[01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:19.740]   Thank goodness.
[01:44:19.740 --> 01:44:21.780]   The problem is, in a lot of jurisdictions,
[01:44:21.780 --> 01:44:24.460]   the police are highly militarized.
[01:44:24.460 --> 01:44:27.340]   They've got military weapons, military gear.
[01:44:27.340 --> 01:44:31.380]   And sometimes they can be very aggressive in these--
[01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:33.580]   trying to save lives, obviously.
[01:44:33.580 --> 01:44:34.900]   In this case, they cost a life.
[01:44:34.900 --> 01:44:38.180]   In a life of somebody who was pretty important to us.
[01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:40.700]   I just have to say, my interactions
[01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:43.780]   with the police in this country leave me a bit--
[01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:48.340]   you don't have great police here.
[01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:51.300]   You don't have really good professional police.
[01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:53.420]   I mean, I never thought I'd miss British police.
[01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:55.820]   But my goodness, they're at least a bit more professional
[01:44:55.820 --> 01:44:57.100]   about this.
[01:44:57.100 --> 01:44:59.300]   Ask Owen about that one.
[01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:00.020]   You know.
[01:45:00.020 --> 01:45:01.060]   Yeah.
[01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:02.540]   No important getting me ramped up.
[01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:04.140]   I mean, there's--
[01:45:04.140 --> 01:45:05.700]   it's just like everything else.
[01:45:05.700 --> 01:45:07.820]   The world is a beautiful, crappy place.
[01:45:07.820 --> 01:45:10.300]   I've met cops that I would invite over for dinner.
[01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:13.100]   And I've had other cops put guns in my face over some chips.
[01:45:13.100 --> 01:45:14.580]   And I'm like, wait, what are we doing?
[01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:15.260]   What is going on?
[01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:16.940]   So it's a mixed bag.
[01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:20.300]   But the bag is too mixed in a bad direction right now.
[01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:22.140]   So it is what it is.
[01:45:22.140 --> 01:45:24.100]   That's why I live in a bat cave.
[01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:25.700]   And no one can find me.
[01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:28.700]   And I use all my tax loopholes up there.
[01:45:28.700 --> 01:45:30.140]   You got to get on board.
[01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:31.740]   You got to start hiding out.
[01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:33.460]   You know, incorporate everything.
[01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:36.300]   You own too much stuff with your name on it, Uncle Leo.
[01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:38.380]   Your socks should be bought by Twitter.
[01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:38.900]   OK?
[01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:42.700]   This is actually a problem, because at least in the US,
[01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:45.580]   buying anything-- buying a house is a public record.
[01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:48.740]   And people can easily find that information online.
[01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:50.140]   My homes aren't in my name.
[01:45:50.140 --> 01:45:51.740]   My car is not in my name.
[01:45:51.740 --> 01:45:53.580]   I don't own anything.
[01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:55.500]   My phone's not in my name.
[01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:56.780]   You got to look for me.
[01:45:56.780 --> 01:45:58.940]   My driver's license isn't into my address.
[01:45:58.940 --> 01:46:01.340]   Like, when the car show is looking for me, they're like,
[01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:02.100]   where is this man?
[01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:03.420]   I'm like, call him on the phone.
[01:46:03.420 --> 01:46:04.500]   I'll come to you.
[01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:05.660]   That's how I live my life.
[01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:06.220]   We should maybe--
[01:46:06.220 --> 01:46:07.620]   Send it a message.
[01:46:07.620 --> 01:46:12.260]   Maybe we should mention that Sparky hearing
[01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:17.380]   was creator of Sparkware and Quickmail, QWIK mail.
[01:46:17.380 --> 01:46:19.980]   And as a final net system, I was well aware of that,
[01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:22.580]   because it was really-- it was, in a way, the first news
[01:46:22.580 --> 01:46:23.300]   reader.
[01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:25.740]   It let you log on to a billboard, download everything,
[01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:27.100]   then log off.
[01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:30.780]   And in my day, I had one line, and then I felt great.
[01:46:30.780 --> 01:46:32.620]   I got two lines on my billboard.
[01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:33.420]   On my bulletin board.
[01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:34.620]   But it was pretty hard to get in.
[01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:36.620]   So if you got in, you want to get everything and get off
[01:46:36.620 --> 01:46:38.060]   as quickly as you could.
[01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:42.340]   And that's basically why he created it.
[01:46:42.340 --> 01:46:45.380]   I haven't even gone into all the things that they did to him.
[01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:46.300]   He was harassed.
[01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:48.700]   No, I mean, he was a really good bloke.
[01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:50.860]   He was a great coder.
[01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:54.500]   And to end like this, it's just heartbreaker.
[01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:56.140]   Yeah.
[01:46:56.140 --> 01:46:57.660]   Sorry, Sparky.
[01:46:57.660 --> 01:46:59.820]   But we won't forget.
[01:46:59.820 --> 01:47:02.460]   And I'm glad this son of a bitch is in jail.
[01:47:02.460 --> 01:47:09.340]   Elon Musk has confirmed with a simple one-word tweet.
[01:47:09.340 --> 01:47:13.860]   He's learning his lesson a couple of days ago.
[01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:16.660]   The word is no.
[01:47:16.660 --> 01:47:21.660]   Fred asked him, any chance of a normal steering wheel?
[01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:24.100]   Future Model S and Model X Teslas.
[01:47:24.100 --> 01:47:27.740]   And Elon's response is no.
[01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:28.980]   What is he talking about?
[01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:33.580]   Well, when the Model S plaid came out,
[01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:37.500]   it came out with an option for a yoke steering wheel.
[01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:40.580]   Now, there's a reason why there's a round steering wheel
[01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:45.620]   on your car because cars have a 14 to 1 steering ratio.
[01:47:45.620 --> 01:47:48.100]   You turn it a lot to get a little turn in the wheel.
[01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:49.780]   And that's sensible.
[01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:50.660]   That's how we like it.
[01:47:50.660 --> 01:47:52.740]   That's why you learned when you learned how to drive
[01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:54.540]   the hand over hand turn.
[01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:58.620]   And fighter jets and Formula One racing cars
[01:47:58.620 --> 01:48:04.340]   have yokes because their turning ratio is considerably--
[01:48:04.340 --> 01:48:06.780]   is it lower, lower, I guess, right?
[01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:09.420]   So you turn the steering wheel a little--
[01:48:09.420 --> 01:48:11.300]   Yeah, if you're going around to happen in a Formula One,
[01:48:11.300 --> 01:48:13.060]   you've got a right handle.
[01:48:13.060 --> 01:48:14.500]   You don't want to do that.
[01:48:14.500 --> 01:48:17.940]   You don't have the time to be able to turn it 16 times.
[01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:20.540]   And in modern airplanes, it's fly by wire.
[01:48:20.540 --> 01:48:25.060]   So this is a signal, not an actual physical thing.
[01:48:25.060 --> 01:48:28.140]   I don't know how Elon got approval for this,
[01:48:28.140 --> 01:48:31.580]   but they have now said that the yoke butterfly steering wheel
[01:48:31.580 --> 01:48:33.140]   will be standard equipment.
[01:48:33.140 --> 01:48:37.300]   And there will not be an alternative on future Model S
[01:48:37.300 --> 01:48:39.700]   and Model X vehicles.
[01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:42.580]   That seems like a nightmare to me.
[01:48:42.580 --> 01:48:45.340]   I live my life in a certain way.
[01:48:45.340 --> 01:48:47.420]   And when I go overseas and I have to drive
[01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:49.940]   on the other side of the road, it hurts my heart
[01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:52.660]   and my brain to focus, to try to do it.
[01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:55.500]   I don't want to get in a car where I can't just roll back
[01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:58.340]   and put my fingers on the top and just be swooping.
[01:48:58.340 --> 01:49:00.020]   This is not what I want to be doing.
[01:49:00.020 --> 01:49:02.660]   I don't need shake weights while I'm driving a car.
[01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:07.100]   I want to be able to roll my hand and feel the wheel.
[01:49:07.100 --> 01:49:10.460]   Side note too, did you see the autopilot guy with the moon
[01:49:10.460 --> 01:49:11.860]   who's a blood-arged moon?
[01:49:11.860 --> 01:49:14.540]   And the car kept slowing down thinking that the moon was
[01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:15.340]   a stoplight?
[01:49:15.340 --> 01:49:16.820]   Yes.
[01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:18.460]   Oh, technology.
[01:49:18.460 --> 01:49:20.260]   We live it in the future.
[01:49:20.260 --> 01:49:21.900]   So tell me how you signed that again.
[01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:23.060]   The moon was full.
[01:49:23.060 --> 01:49:24.260]   It was a Tuesday.
[01:49:24.260 --> 01:49:28.900]   Actually, Consumer Reports kind of wrote a scathing article
[01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:32.180]   about exactly that saying Tesla's full drive,
[01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:35.420]   self-driving beta software, which is now available for a mirror.
[01:49:35.420 --> 01:49:36.220]   What did they charge?
[01:49:36.220 --> 01:49:37.180]   $500 a month?
[01:49:37.180 --> 01:49:38.020]   I can't remember.
[01:49:38.020 --> 01:49:41.420]   They charge you a lot for it if you have a Tesla.
[01:49:41.420 --> 01:49:46.220]   It's basically testing software on public roads
[01:49:46.220 --> 01:49:48.100]   without safeguards.
[01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:49.460]   And it's dangerous.
[01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:51.420]   It's not full self-driving.
[01:49:51.420 --> 01:49:53.020]   It's on city streets.
[01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:56.100]   It's supposed to recognize stoplights, stop signs.
[01:49:56.100 --> 01:50:00.820]   As you mentioned, Owen, it isn't perfect at that.
[01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:02.980]   They sold this with a Tesla beheading.
[01:50:02.980 --> 01:50:07.580]   I mean, then it's supposed to monitor the road.
[01:50:07.580 --> 01:50:09.780]   But in that case, a white trailer truck
[01:50:09.780 --> 01:50:12.740]   was going across the road and mistook that for the sky.
[01:50:12.740 --> 01:50:14.980]   And some guy got his head taken off.
[01:50:14.980 --> 01:50:18.660]   Consumer-- And Tesla are selling this as an autopilot option.
[01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:21.340]   I don't call it that anymore.
[01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:24.740]   But they are saying, basically, you can self-drive.
[01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:27.420]   And people are taking them up on that.
[01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:31.900]   It's willful danger, I think, for drivers.
[01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:34.380]   Consumer Reports got a quote from Brian Rimer.
[01:50:34.380 --> 01:50:36.060]   He's a professor at MIT, the founder
[01:50:36.060 --> 01:50:39.020]   of their Advanced Vehicle Technology Consortium.
[01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:41.220]   He told Consumer Reports, while drivers
[01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:45.020]   may have some awareness of the increased risk they're assuming
[01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:46.780]   when they use FSD.
[01:50:46.780 --> 01:50:49.900]   Other road users, drivers, pedestrians, cyclists, et cetera,
[01:50:49.900 --> 01:50:53.260]   are unaware that they are in the presence of a test vehicle.
[01:50:53.260 --> 01:50:55.780]   And they have not consented to take on this risk.
[01:50:55.780 --> 01:51:00.300]   It's a little scary.
[01:51:00.300 --> 01:51:03.500]   Tesla just asking to pay attention.
[01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:04.780]   People to pay attention isn't enough.
[01:51:04.780 --> 01:51:06.220]   The system needs to make sure people
[01:51:06.220 --> 01:51:09.940]   are engaged when the system is operational.
[01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:12.340]   It's the same kind of thinking, though, that the NSO group
[01:51:12.340 --> 01:51:15.140]   is shown with their government-sponsored malware.
[01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:16.820]   We just sell the tools.
[01:51:16.820 --> 01:51:19.220]   We're not responsible for how people use it.
[01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:23.260]   So Tesla says, oh, it's technically not an autopilot,
[01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:25.180]   but you can use it that way.
[01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:28.660]   And then people get snuffed.
[01:51:28.660 --> 01:51:30.980]   Professor at the American University School of Public Affairs
[01:51:30.980 --> 01:51:34.060]   who studies autonomous vehicles said
[01:51:34.060 --> 01:51:36.700]   that the full self-driving beta-9 equipped Tesla's
[01:51:36.700 --> 01:51:39.900]   in a vehicle she has seen act almost like a drunk driver
[01:51:39.900 --> 01:51:41.980]   struggling to stay between lines.
[01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:43.420]   It's meandering to the left.
[01:51:43.420 --> 01:51:45.460]   It's meandering to the right, she says.
[01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:47.860]   While its right hand turns appear to be fairly solid,
[01:51:47.860 --> 01:51:50.020]   the left hand turns are almost wild.
[01:51:50.020 --> 01:51:54.700]   I can fix this easily.
[01:51:54.700 --> 01:51:58.220]   Tesla should be mandated to put a neon light strip
[01:51:58.220 --> 01:52:00.460]   under the front bumper and rear bumper.
[01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:03.500]   And when you're in this autopilot, not autopilot,
[01:52:03.500 --> 01:52:05.700]   it shows a green light on the ground
[01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:07.660]   so that we know that you're not really driving
[01:52:07.660 --> 01:52:08.700]   your car right now.
[01:52:08.700 --> 01:52:09.900]   So if I want to avoid your bad--
[01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:11.900]   There's so much cognitive love though.
[01:52:11.900 --> 01:52:12.900]   Yeah.
[01:52:12.900 --> 01:52:13.900]   Right?
[01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:15.460]   Like, now I have to pay attention
[01:52:15.460 --> 01:52:17.540]   that you're not paying attention to your car.
[01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:19.860]   Oh, I'm just saying it gives me a fighting chance
[01:52:19.860 --> 01:52:21.180]   because otherwise I wouldn't know.
[01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:23.500]   I'm just saying it's the same fighting chance.
[01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:24.860]   It's the top roll of it with lights.
[01:52:24.860 --> 01:52:25.660]   It's like the--
[01:52:25.660 --> 01:52:27.140]   The street driver is what you're saying.
[01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:28.780]   Like you have those two driver things.
[01:52:28.780 --> 01:52:29.780]   Yeah.
[01:52:29.780 --> 01:52:32.140]   I just want to know that when you see a street
[01:52:32.140 --> 01:52:33.580]   in the driver, what do you do?
[01:52:33.580 --> 01:52:35.820]   You pass them, you get ahead of where you're going.
[01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:37.180]   Hey, go ahead and learn all your own.
[01:52:37.180 --> 01:52:38.500]   Right, Gary. But I'm not here for it.
[01:52:38.500 --> 01:52:40.660]   So, Shana, green light on the ground
[01:52:40.660 --> 01:52:42.300]   so I know that you have rookie mode
[01:52:42.300 --> 01:52:44.900]   so I can go on and go do what I got to do.
[01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:47.420]   You know, it's always been the case
[01:52:47.420 --> 01:52:49.340]   that Tesla acts more like a software company
[01:52:49.340 --> 01:52:50.540]   than a car company.
[01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:53.100]   And of course, this is traditional in software companies.
[01:52:53.100 --> 01:52:56.340]   You release betas, even some that are not fully cooked,
[01:52:56.340 --> 01:52:57.980]   as we know.
[01:52:57.980 --> 01:53:00.140]   But this is a little different.
[01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:02.900]   You're taking people's safety in your hands here.
[01:53:02.900 --> 01:53:05.300]   Plus, we're already such bad drivers as it is.
[01:53:05.300 --> 01:53:08.380]   We're doing 100,000 other things that we're not supposed to be doing
[01:53:08.380 --> 01:53:09.260]   while we're driving.
[01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:10.900]   We're too tired while we drive.
[01:53:10.900 --> 01:53:12.820]   We do it so often that we don't understand
[01:53:12.820 --> 01:53:15.540]   that the driving is a huge risk to us
[01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:18.540]   and to especially in Quebec pedestrians.
[01:53:18.540 --> 01:53:19.700]   So, you know.
[01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:24.620]   Well, that's the argument, though, is we're terrible drivers.
[01:53:24.620 --> 01:53:27.900]   So anything, even not the perfect thing,
[01:53:27.900 --> 01:53:29.700]   would be better than us.
[01:53:29.700 --> 01:53:31.420]   No, I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:53:31.420 --> 01:53:34.580]   You're piloting a ton or a ton and a half
[01:53:34.580 --> 01:53:36.820]   considering American cars,
[01:53:36.820 --> 01:53:40.820]   a ton and a half metal down a freeway at 70 miles an hour.
[01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:45.060]   No one over here has any idea about safe stopping distances.
[01:53:45.060 --> 01:53:47.540]   So you're all crammed in there like the rest of it.
[01:53:47.540 --> 01:53:50.060]   And now we're going to put buggy software in there and say,
[01:53:50.060 --> 01:53:51.620]   "Yeah, that'll handle it."
[01:53:51.620 --> 01:53:53.060]   It's a recipe for disaster.
[01:53:53.060 --> 01:53:54.060]   Yeah.
[01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:57.260]   This is a YouTube video
[01:53:59.620 --> 01:54:03.900]   where a guy's testing the FSD beta-9 and it runs into bushes.
[01:54:03.900 --> 01:54:04.780]   It does.
[01:54:04.780 --> 01:54:07.260]   It's dirty Tesla on YouTube.
[01:54:07.260 --> 01:54:09.820]   It's actually kind of a terrifying video.
[01:54:09.820 --> 01:54:11.100]   And if I were up in the street--
[01:54:11.100 --> 01:54:12.580]   And the least he keeps his hands near the wheel.
[01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:13.700]   At least he's worried about it.
[01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:14.780]   Well, and that's a good point.
[01:54:14.780 --> 01:54:17.220]   And I think Tesla really does do a lot
[01:54:17.220 --> 01:54:19.620]   to try to encourage you to pay attention.
[01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:21.980]   They do warn you if your hands aren't on the wheel
[01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:23.700]   and they say, "Put your hands on the wheel
[01:54:23.700 --> 01:54:25.820]   "and they'll turn it off if they're not on the wheel."
[01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:26.740]   I have to point out, though,
[01:54:26.740 --> 01:54:29.380]   that other companies like GM and Ford
[01:54:29.380 --> 01:54:31.900]   are putting cameras in the car to watch
[01:54:31.900 --> 01:54:33.940]   to make sure that you are paying attention.
[01:54:33.940 --> 01:54:35.420]   Your eyes are on the road
[01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:38.380]   and they have capacitive sensors in their steering wheels.
[01:54:38.380 --> 01:54:42.180]   So they're a little bit more aware of your interaction with this.
[01:54:42.180 --> 01:54:43.740]   The Tesla's fairly easy to,
[01:54:43.740 --> 01:54:46.820]   you know, once a while it reaches over and jerks the steering wheel.
[01:54:46.820 --> 01:54:49.460]   Yeah, somebody actually, a game do a Tesla
[01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:52.500]   by hanging a weight off one side of the steering wheel
[01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:53.860]   and one side of the other.
[01:54:53.860 --> 01:54:55.980]   Just to keep it going.
[01:54:55.980 --> 01:55:00.060]   We did a story about a year ago of somebody
[01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:04.060]   recording a not-safe-for-work video in a Tesla
[01:55:04.060 --> 01:55:07.700]   with a couple of them making the beast
[01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:09.900]   with two backs in the car while on the road.
[01:55:09.900 --> 01:55:11.420]   Oh, more to do that.
[01:55:11.420 --> 01:55:12.900]   A Darwinism?
[01:55:12.900 --> 01:55:15.940]   You know, maybe this is a good time to stop this stuff.
[01:55:15.940 --> 01:55:18.380]   Do not reproduce if you are that person.
[01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:19.780]   (laughing)
[01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:22.780]   Like, I don't want my car staring at me creepily either
[01:55:22.780 --> 01:55:24.740]   and having people watch me while I drive either.
[01:55:24.740 --> 01:55:25.740]   Like, the thing in the back there is--
[01:55:25.740 --> 01:55:26.580]   Well, no person is watching you.
[01:55:26.580 --> 01:55:28.620]   The car is looking for your eyes.
[01:55:28.620 --> 01:55:29.740]   It's not that person.
[01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:31.180]   Yeah, we'll see.
[01:55:31.180 --> 01:55:32.020]   I'm gonna have--
[01:55:32.020 --> 01:55:34.020]   I'm gonna have it in your car, George.
[01:55:34.020 --> 01:55:35.460]   I'm definitely gonna be watching you guys.
[01:55:35.460 --> 01:55:36.780]   I was like, how did that--
[01:55:36.780 --> 01:55:38.420]   It was from John.
[01:55:38.420 --> 01:55:39.420]   Make a left, George.
[01:55:39.420 --> 01:55:41.820]   Make a left, you missed the left, George.
[01:55:41.820 --> 01:55:44.220]   Oh, that's my voice on my phone.
[01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:45.060]   It's Owen.
[01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:46.420]   It's like, George, what are you doing?
[01:55:46.420 --> 01:55:47.820]   What are you doing, George?
[01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:49.460]   I see you putting on makeup.
[01:55:49.460 --> 01:55:50.540]   I'm here for you.
[01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:53.660]   If anybody's gonna spy on you, it's gonna be me, okay?
[01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:54.500]   Okay?
[01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:55.500]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:56.740]   No, swipe.
[01:55:56.740 --> 01:55:59.340]   I might show up at the house, see the husband,
[01:55:59.340 --> 01:56:01.580]   hug the kids, you know what I'm saying?
[01:56:01.580 --> 01:56:02.980]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:56:02.980 --> 01:56:04.860]   But if it doesn't really--
[01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:06.660]   If I have to be watching and my hands
[01:56:06.660 --> 01:56:08.060]   have to be on the steering wheel,
[01:56:08.060 --> 01:56:10.660]   it's not really any use to be self-driving anyways.
[01:56:10.660 --> 01:56:12.580]   So really just put it out when it's actually
[01:56:12.580 --> 01:56:14.180]   able to do the things that we want it to do.
[01:56:14.180 --> 01:56:15.620]   Because if not, what are you doing anyways?
[01:56:15.620 --> 01:56:17.980]   If I have to pay attention, then I don't need it to self-drive.
[01:56:17.980 --> 01:56:20.780]   I'm already holding on to it and having to do other things.
[01:56:20.780 --> 01:56:24.420]   So I find it frustrating just all the way around.
[01:56:24.420 --> 01:56:25.420]   Yeah.
[01:56:25.420 --> 01:56:26.420]   My car has--
[01:56:26.420 --> 01:56:27.420]   It's a tech control--
[01:56:27.420 --> 01:56:28.420]   --and lane assist.
[01:56:28.420 --> 01:56:29.540]   My car has a crucial control lane assist,
[01:56:29.540 --> 01:56:32.100]   and I use that on the highway.
[01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:33.580]   And it's like, okay.
[01:56:33.580 --> 01:56:37.140]   But I never take my hands off the wheel or the eyes
[01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:39.860]   off the road, because I don't trust it.
[01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:41.420]   Yeah, it's a scary thing.
[01:56:41.420 --> 01:56:44.540]   You know that people will slowly become complacent
[01:56:44.540 --> 01:56:45.660]   and start to trust it.
[01:56:45.660 --> 01:56:47.980]   That's the problem, is that we're so lazy.
[01:56:47.980 --> 01:56:48.500]   Exactly.
[01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:52.220]   There's so many Tesla people on car on video asleep at the wheel.
[01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:53.940]   That's like a viral thing that happens all the time.
[01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:59.100]   Like, you're sleeping in your car and it's driving you an highway.
[01:56:59.100 --> 01:57:00.100]   It's like--
[01:57:00.100 --> 01:57:02.060]   It's bonkers.
[01:57:02.060 --> 01:57:04.140]   I mean, when you look at--
[01:57:04.140 --> 01:57:04.540]   yeah, OK.
[01:57:04.540 --> 01:57:07.340]   The technology is there to do certain things.
[01:57:07.340 --> 01:57:09.540]   But people are overreacting to it.
[01:57:09.540 --> 01:57:12.980]   And it's like, yeah, I can watch a DVD,
[01:57:12.980 --> 01:57:15.820]   or I can read a book, or the rest of it.
[01:57:15.820 --> 01:57:19.900]   You know, it's just like driving a heavy piece of metal
[01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:22.860]   at high speed within feet of other people.
[01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:24.940]   Show some responsibility.
[01:57:24.940 --> 01:57:25.900]   Ian, I'll tell you this.
[01:57:25.900 --> 01:57:27.300]   God bless those people.
[01:57:27.300 --> 01:57:29.020]   I've never had a relationship that I trust
[01:57:29.020 --> 01:57:31.060]   as much as these people trust, they test us, OK?
[01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:33.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:57:33.700 --> 01:57:35.700]   I don't know how they do it, sir.
[01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:37.700]   I'm envious of that kind of trust level.
[01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:39.660]   I'm trying to get there one day, you know?
[01:57:39.660 --> 01:57:41.100]   It's crazy.
[01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:46.620]   Would you ever let your wife or girlfriend drive?
[01:57:46.620 --> 01:57:49.340]   Oh, I really don't let anyone drive me anywhere.
[01:57:49.340 --> 01:57:52.260]   I always prefer to drive when it all possible.
[01:57:52.260 --> 01:57:53.500]   Same thing with cook-off.
[01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:55.820]   I don't let people cook for me unless I'm paying for a meal
[01:57:55.820 --> 01:57:57.340]   somewhere, or I have to show up to myself.
[01:57:57.340 --> 01:57:59.340]   But usually I prefer to cook.
[01:57:59.340 --> 01:58:01.700]   If we're going to die, we're going to die by my seasonings.
[01:58:01.700 --> 01:58:04.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:58:04.460 --> 01:58:04.940]   You know?
[01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:07.300]   You see, I prefer to drive because I'm married to a Jersey
[01:58:07.300 --> 01:58:08.700]   girl.
[01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:10.700]   When she gets angry on the road, she
[01:58:10.700 --> 01:58:13.020]   gets really angry.
[01:58:13.020 --> 01:58:17.420]   So, you know, she's like, nice British calm driving
[01:58:17.420 --> 01:58:18.620]   rather than Jersey.
[01:58:18.620 --> 01:58:19.620]   Yeah!
[01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:20.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:58:20.580 --> 01:58:23.660]   I am curious, though, about this death by seasonings thing.
[01:58:23.660 --> 01:58:25.580]   Do you actually--
[01:58:25.580 --> 01:58:26.940]   what are you using?
[01:58:26.940 --> 01:58:27.740]   You're cooking.
[01:58:27.740 --> 01:58:30.660]   I mean, maybe I'll come out and make something for you.
[01:58:30.660 --> 01:58:31.980]   And I'll have to go like that.
[01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:32.980]   You can guess from right now.
[01:58:32.980 --> 01:58:35.100]   Make your breakfast after the Sunday twin.
[01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:36.300]   I'll hook you up a little bit.
[01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:37.300]   All right, deal.
[01:58:37.300 --> 01:58:40.220]   And so much not a joke that my daughter goes
[01:58:40.220 --> 01:58:42.660]   on vacation with her mother and her family.
[01:58:42.660 --> 01:58:45.900]   And she brings her own seasonings because they don't see the food.
[01:58:45.900 --> 01:58:46.900]   Wow.
[01:58:46.900 --> 01:58:48.500]   Last year, she made her own food.
[01:58:48.500 --> 01:58:50.740]   And this year, people are trying to use her season.
[01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:52.220]   She's like, get off my seasonings.
[01:58:52.220 --> 01:58:53.660]   She's like, oh, that's good stuff.
[01:58:53.660 --> 01:58:54.460]   Go buy yourself.
[01:58:54.460 --> 01:58:55.660]   Share the secret.
[01:58:55.660 --> 01:58:56.180]   Take my season.
[01:58:56.180 --> 01:58:56.980]   What is in this?
[01:58:56.980 --> 01:58:57.980]   What other season?
[01:58:57.980 --> 01:58:59.420]   There's going to be something good in this.
[01:58:59.420 --> 01:59:02.820]   Look, I'm going to--
[01:59:02.820 --> 01:59:05.580]   Everyone's going to be sending you a message now.
[01:59:05.580 --> 01:59:06.340]   Well, go ahead.
[01:59:06.340 --> 01:59:06.860]   Go ahead.
[01:59:06.860 --> 01:59:07.860]   You go ahead.
[01:59:07.860 --> 01:59:08.860]   Text me on my number if you want to find out.
[01:59:08.860 --> 01:59:11.620]   One secret of life, if you just want to have some flavor
[01:59:11.620 --> 01:59:15.340]   explode in your face, it is called herbs of providence.
[01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:16.140]   A providence?
[01:59:16.140 --> 01:59:17.140]   Not providence.
[01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:18.340]   I grew up with providence.
[01:59:18.340 --> 01:59:20.660]   I call it providence because I can't read.
[01:59:20.660 --> 01:59:21.620]   And I'm from Jersey.
[01:59:21.620 --> 01:59:23.980]   So that's the herbs of providence.
[01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:25.740]   You don't want the herbs of providence.
[01:59:25.740 --> 01:59:28.420]   And the blame, by the way.
[01:59:28.420 --> 01:59:29.140]   How do you say it?
[01:59:29.140 --> 01:59:30.700]   How do you spell it?
[01:59:30.700 --> 01:59:33.220]   If you don't know how to cook anything, throw that stuff
[01:59:33.220 --> 01:59:34.420]   on your chicken.
[01:59:34.420 --> 01:59:35.980]   You're going to feel like you're--
[01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:36.820]   That you buy--
[01:59:36.820 --> 01:59:37.620]   You're using it in the garden.
[01:59:37.620 --> 01:59:38.820]   You're using it in the garden.
[01:59:38.820 --> 01:59:39.820]   You buy bottled?
[01:59:39.820 --> 01:59:40.340]   You're buying that.
[01:59:40.340 --> 01:59:41.140]   Yeah, that's what I want to know.
[01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:43.500]   You buy bottle herbs of providence, or--
[01:59:43.500 --> 01:59:44.500]   Sometimes--
[01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:44.980]   Bring me in.
[01:59:44.980 --> 01:59:46.460]   I've made it myself twice.
[01:59:46.460 --> 01:59:47.180]   But guess what?
[01:59:47.180 --> 01:59:48.340]   I don't have the time.
[01:59:48.340 --> 01:59:49.900]   I told you people I'm busy.
[01:59:49.900 --> 01:59:53.100]   But get yourself some lavender on your chicken.
[01:59:53.100 --> 01:59:53.860]   That's the key to me.
[01:59:53.860 --> 01:59:54.380]   Oh, yeah, baby.
[01:59:54.380 --> 01:59:55.740]   Time and the lavender.
[01:59:55.740 --> 01:59:57.420]   Your whole life will change.
[01:59:57.420 --> 01:59:58.940]   See, people can ask me for a cookbook.
[01:59:58.940 --> 02:00:01.140]   I'm going to get on it because the people need me.
[02:00:01.140 --> 02:00:01.780]   The spices go out.
[02:00:01.780 --> 02:00:03.140]   Here's what's in herbs of providence.
[02:00:03.140 --> 02:00:03.660]   It's a ton of the book.
[02:00:03.660 --> 02:00:04.140]   Here's a--
[02:00:04.140 --> 02:00:04.940]   Dye by seasoning.
[02:00:04.940 --> 02:00:06.740]   Here's when I die by seasoning.
[02:00:06.740 --> 02:00:08.580]   That's by seasoning.
[02:00:08.580 --> 02:00:09.420]   I'm sorry, man.
[02:00:09.420 --> 02:00:11.060]   I was like an Agatha Christie novel.
[02:00:11.060 --> 02:00:12.780]   But I'm just like my granny.
[02:00:12.780 --> 02:00:14.180]   And I can never have an old chicken.
[02:00:14.180 --> 02:00:14.180]   Oh, no, no.
[02:00:14.180 --> 02:00:14.620]   But--
[02:00:14.620 --> 02:00:16.260]   Oh, that's horrible.
[02:00:16.260 --> 02:00:21.260]   It's rosemary, fennel seed, dried savory, time, basil,
[02:00:21.260 --> 02:00:24.780]   margarum, lavender flowers, Italian parsley,
[02:00:24.780 --> 02:00:27.660]   oregano, tarragon, and bay powder.
[02:00:27.660 --> 02:00:30.380]   If you don't know how to cook, just throw that on some chicken.
[02:00:30.380 --> 02:00:32.260]   And when you taste it, again, you're
[02:00:32.260 --> 02:00:34.700]   going to feel like an elegant individual born
[02:00:34.700 --> 02:00:35.820]   in the garden of Eden.
[02:00:35.820 --> 02:00:37.700]   I'm telling you, put it on some chicken,
[02:00:37.700 --> 02:00:41.180]   fry it up in a pan, go live your life, come back and see me next.
[02:00:41.180 --> 02:00:48.820]   The herbs of providence, however, are a slightly different flavor.
[02:00:48.820 --> 02:00:50.220]   There might be some rocks in there,
[02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:52.660]   some rocks, some cigarette balls.
[02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:54.180]   Yeah, lobster shells.
[02:00:54.180 --> 02:00:56.380]   OK, I'm sticking in my Amazon as well.
[02:00:56.380 --> 02:00:56.900]   Here we go.
[02:00:56.900 --> 02:00:58.580]   Herb de Povalls.
[02:00:58.580 --> 02:01:01.220]   Oh, and Montreal, you probably have a lot of good choices,
[02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:02.860]   actually.
[02:01:02.860 --> 02:01:03.300]   We might.
[02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:05.020]   I'm on Amazon again, though.
[02:01:05.020 --> 02:01:05.580]   Yeah.
[02:01:05.580 --> 02:01:07.980]   You know what my favorite seasoning is?
[02:01:07.980 --> 02:01:10.100]   You can buy it at Trader Joe's.
[02:01:10.100 --> 02:01:12.780]   It's everything bagel seasoning.
[02:01:12.780 --> 02:01:14.100]   Comes in a char.
[02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:15.740]   You know, it's the stuff on everything bagel.
[02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:20.020]   It's poppy seeds and sesame seeds and salt and garlic pattern,
[02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:20.820]   onions.
[02:01:20.820 --> 02:01:22.860]   But it's in a bottle, and you can sprinkle on anything.
[02:01:22.860 --> 02:01:25.980]   Makes everything taste like an everything bagel.
[02:01:25.980 --> 02:01:26.380]   It's pretty good.
[02:01:26.380 --> 02:01:28.620]   That's not probably nice.
[02:01:28.620 --> 02:01:30.220]   I'm with Marmite on this one.
[02:01:30.220 --> 02:01:31.780]   You can do Marmite roast potato.
[02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:32.940]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:01:32.940 --> 02:01:35.140]   I have never had Marmite.
[02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:36.140]   Ever.
[02:01:36.140 --> 02:01:36.660]   OK.
[02:01:36.660 --> 02:01:38.140]   Well, I mean, do you apparently have some more?
[02:01:38.140 --> 02:01:40.020]   I have never tasted it.
[02:01:40.020 --> 02:01:40.580]   Both.
[02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:41.940]   Oh, I've tasted it many times.
[02:01:41.940 --> 02:01:42.580]   Oh, you have?
[02:01:42.580 --> 02:01:43.420]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[02:01:43.420 --> 02:01:45.660]   I have both Vegemite and Marmite.
[02:01:45.660 --> 02:01:48.860]   The Australian version of Marmite is Vegemite.
[02:01:48.860 --> 02:01:49.060]   The--
[02:01:49.060 --> 02:01:50.020]   The Zevush.
[02:01:50.020 --> 02:01:50.700]   Yes.
[02:01:50.700 --> 02:01:55.940]   Both are created from a byproduct of beer making,
[02:01:55.940 --> 02:01:57.620]   brewers yeast.
[02:01:57.620 --> 02:02:02.140]   And they have a kind of yeasty, salty flavor.
[02:02:02.140 --> 02:02:06.620]   I understand the key is a very thin layer on toast.
[02:02:06.620 --> 02:02:07.580]   Maybe with some scrambled eggs.
[02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:09.460]   Yeah, you don't go too thick.
[02:02:09.460 --> 02:02:12.300]   And it has to be said also that COVID better
[02:02:12.300 --> 02:02:13.860]   makers had a real problem because people
[02:02:13.860 --> 02:02:14.780]   stopped drinking beer.
[02:02:14.780 --> 02:02:17.500]   So there was a Marmite shortage.
[02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:19.860]   And I had to go without for like two months
[02:02:19.860 --> 02:02:21.700]   until I'd found the stuff.
[02:02:21.700 --> 02:02:23.300]   But yeah, it's brewed yeast.
[02:02:23.300 --> 02:02:25.220]   It's vegetarian.
[02:02:25.220 --> 02:02:27.460]   It tastes incredibly meaty.
[02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:28.220]   And it's--
[02:02:28.220 --> 02:02:29.780]   Do it with scrambled eggs.
[02:02:29.780 --> 02:02:30.780]   Yeah, black it is.
[02:02:30.780 --> 02:02:34.020]   It's like putting tar on your bread.
[02:02:34.020 --> 02:02:34.860]   Wow.
[02:02:34.860 --> 02:02:36.860]   Georgia, Georgia, can you hear me?
[02:02:36.860 --> 02:02:37.940]   Yeah.
[02:02:37.940 --> 02:02:40.700]   Don't eat or buy anything that ends in Marmite.
[02:02:40.700 --> 02:02:42.740]   We don't do turmites, Vegemite.
[02:02:42.740 --> 02:02:43.860]   No, Marmite.
[02:02:43.860 --> 02:02:44.300]   I don't--
[02:02:44.300 --> 02:02:46.420]   Georgia, I don't put that in your cart.
[02:02:46.420 --> 02:02:48.380]   Let these old folks do--
[02:02:48.380 --> 02:02:49.780]   this probably won't even live in solo.
[02:02:49.780 --> 02:02:52.100]   You let them do it on their side, Georgia.
[02:02:52.100 --> 02:02:53.220]   Stay focused with me.
[02:02:53.220 --> 02:02:55.140]   Don't know, don't imagine you might dynamite.
[02:02:55.140 --> 02:02:56.460]   And we don't want none of them mites.
[02:02:56.460 --> 02:02:57.220]   OK, OK.
[02:02:57.220 --> 02:02:59.940]   Here's what it says on the Wikipedia.
[02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:04.060]   Marmite is a sticky, dark brown paste
[02:03:04.060 --> 02:03:07.580]   with a distinctive, salty, powerful flavor.
[02:03:07.580 --> 02:03:10.060]   This distinctive taste is represented by the marketing
[02:03:10.060 --> 02:03:14.140]   slogan, love it or hate it.
[02:03:14.140 --> 02:03:15.580]   Yeah, pretty much.
[02:03:15.580 --> 02:03:17.420]   I mean, to my wife's people--
[02:03:17.420 --> 02:03:17.980]   I've had it.
[02:03:17.980 --> 02:03:21.780]   She ate it twice just to see if she liked it
[02:03:21.780 --> 02:03:24.700]   and she really, really didn't.
[02:03:24.700 --> 02:03:27.460]   I think it's one of those things that you have to be brought up
[02:03:27.460 --> 02:03:30.900]   with, but once you get the taste for it,
[02:03:30.900 --> 02:03:32.700]   there's nothing better.
[02:03:32.700 --> 02:03:35.820]   By the way, I think it's one of those tastes--
[02:03:35.820 --> 02:03:37.540]   and you know there are some of these--
[02:03:37.540 --> 02:03:39.020]   and I'm sure you know this, Georgia--
[02:03:39.020 --> 02:03:40.820]   that are--
[02:03:40.820 --> 02:03:45.500]   cilantro is a good example, that are very strong.
[02:03:45.500 --> 02:03:48.660]   But once you acquire them--
[02:03:48.660 --> 02:03:52.980]   so if you grew up with Marmite, you would go, oh, I have to have it.
[02:03:52.980 --> 02:03:59.300]   It's like-- it is very potent, right?
[02:03:59.300 --> 02:04:00.740]   And cilantro is kind of like that.
[02:04:00.740 --> 02:04:03.020]   There's anchovies are like that.
[02:04:03.020 --> 02:04:06.460]   Yeah, and some people-- some people for cilantro,
[02:04:06.460 --> 02:04:09.180]   it's some people have the taste buds that will make it
[02:04:09.180 --> 02:04:10.780]   taste like soap for them.
[02:04:10.780 --> 02:04:12.820]   And some people do not.
[02:04:12.820 --> 02:04:13.540]   I don't think so.
[02:04:13.540 --> 02:04:16.020]   You could ever get Marmite to taste like soap.
[02:04:16.020 --> 02:04:18.140]   So I got my pen.
[02:04:18.140 --> 02:04:22.300]   No, Kryptonite, Dolomite, Vegemite.
[02:04:22.300 --> 02:04:24.100]   Dolomite.
[02:04:24.100 --> 02:04:25.900]   Turmites, none of these mites.
[02:04:25.900 --> 02:04:28.180]   There's a big X on this mite list right here.
[02:04:28.180 --> 02:04:29.100]   I got going to work.
[02:04:29.100 --> 02:04:30.740]   We're not messing with any of that.
[02:04:30.740 --> 02:04:31.420]   No.
[02:04:31.420 --> 02:04:32.380]   I want you to--
[02:04:32.380 --> 02:04:34.020]   I want you to come up.
[02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:34.620]   I know.
[02:04:34.620 --> 02:04:35.740]   It doesn't sound--
[02:04:35.740 --> 02:04:37.780]   a bottle of black tar.
[02:04:37.780 --> 02:04:39.300]   You want me to spread that on something?
[02:04:39.300 --> 02:04:40.820]   Oh, but it's-- no, thank you.
[02:04:40.820 --> 02:04:44.900]   It's one of those things where you go, oh, it's strong.
[02:04:44.900 --> 02:04:46.500]   It's strong.
[02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:47.900]   Like licorice would be another one,
[02:04:47.900 --> 02:04:50.860]   where people-- black licorice, or good black licorice,
[02:04:50.860 --> 02:04:52.460]   where it's strong.
[02:04:52.460 --> 02:04:55.460]   And at first, especially if you've never experienced it,
[02:04:55.460 --> 02:04:59.020]   you might go, wow, that's a little-- it's much.
[02:04:59.020 --> 02:05:01.060]   But then after a while, it really gets
[02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:02.580]   into your skin, I think.
[02:05:02.580 --> 02:05:06.700]   It is amazing when you actually introduce people to it.
[02:05:06.700 --> 02:05:09.860]   Nine out of 10 people are just like, oh my god,
[02:05:09.860 --> 02:05:11.300]   what have you just done with my mouth?
[02:05:11.300 --> 02:05:14.340]   But that one in 10 person is just like,
[02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:16.380]   this Unagi taste is fun.
[02:05:16.380 --> 02:05:17.460]   Yeah, it's a good mommy.
[02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:19.620]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:05:19.620 --> 02:05:23.860]   And then, you know, this might get me thrown out of the country,
[02:05:23.860 --> 02:05:27.580]   but I think peanut and jelly sandwiches are possibly
[02:05:27.580 --> 02:05:29.820]   the most disgusting thing in the world.
[02:05:29.820 --> 02:05:32.940]   Oh, so it's feet each to their own.
[02:05:32.940 --> 02:05:36.020]   Yeah, you just-- you just ruined VeggieMite
[02:05:36.020 --> 02:05:37.300]   for any human being listening to you,
[02:05:37.300 --> 02:05:39.340]   because that is a stable class 'cause of the universe
[02:05:39.340 --> 02:05:39.820]   in the world.
[02:05:39.820 --> 02:05:40.820]   And you can't be trusted.
[02:05:40.820 --> 02:05:44.140]   I will also say to you, Uncle Leo, this is Twit.
[02:05:44.140 --> 02:05:46.380]   Get back to my tech and do this re--
[02:05:46.380 --> 02:05:48.140]   OK, OK, OK, I'm going to start with--
[02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:48.500]   I'm going to--
[02:05:48.500 --> 02:05:49.500]   for you, get me in trouble.
[02:05:49.500 --> 02:05:51.500]   They always blame me for this stuff, Uncle Leo.
[02:05:51.500 --> 02:05:54.780]   No, you're keeping me on track.
[02:05:54.780 --> 02:05:56.980]   Every-- I just-- I say, I'm like, I get--
[02:05:56.980 --> 02:05:57.980]   emails and deals.
[02:05:57.980 --> 02:05:58.980]   What we're doing?
[02:05:58.980 --> 02:06:00.540]   That's some tech today if it wasn't for you.
[02:06:00.540 --> 02:06:02.980]   I'm like, I'm the one doing his job!
[02:06:02.980 --> 02:06:06.580]   No, Uncle Leo, let's go.
[02:06:06.580 --> 02:06:07.180]   Our show today.
[02:06:07.180 --> 02:06:07.660]   Thank you.
[02:06:07.660 --> 02:06:08.620]   Oh, and JJ Stone.
[02:06:08.620 --> 02:06:10.180]   Oh, doc to everybody, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:10.180 --> 02:06:11.740]   Our show today--
[02:06:11.740 --> 02:06:13.060]   herbs of Providence.
[02:06:13.060 --> 02:06:14.420]   Our show today brought to you by--
[02:06:14.420 --> 02:06:15.380]   I want to make those.
[02:06:15.380 --> 02:06:17.740]   I got to-- it's a marketing opportunity here.
[02:06:17.740 --> 02:06:20.740]   I don't know-- brought to you by ESET.
[02:06:20.740 --> 02:06:25.140]   Oh, man, for over 30 years, ESET has been a global leader
[02:06:25.140 --> 02:06:26.740]   in cybersecurity.
[02:06:26.740 --> 02:06:30.220]   I've been doing ads for ESET for probably about 20 years.
[02:06:30.220 --> 02:06:32.460]   And I was shocked, because I hadn't talked about it
[02:06:32.460 --> 02:06:33.700]   in a long time.
[02:06:33.700 --> 02:06:37.700]   When I asked Russell-- and I ask him every time I see him,
[02:06:37.700 --> 02:06:39.980]   our IT guy-- are we safe?
[02:06:39.980 --> 02:06:40.940]   Are we safe?
[02:06:40.940 --> 02:06:43.580]   Because I'm so worried about stuff coming in over
[02:06:43.580 --> 02:06:46.420]   the ransomware employees, and, you know,
[02:06:46.420 --> 02:06:49.140]   innocently opening an email and bringing the whole network
[02:06:49.140 --> 02:06:50.820]   down or getting ransomware.
[02:06:50.820 --> 02:06:53.140]   I'm so nervous about all that all the time.
[02:06:53.140 --> 02:06:56.180]   And finally, he said, Leo, we use ESET.
[02:06:56.180 --> 02:06:57.620]   We're safe.
[02:06:57.620 --> 02:06:59.820]   I said, oh, I know ESET.
[02:06:59.820 --> 02:07:01.340]   It turns out we use ESET.
[02:07:01.340 --> 02:07:02.660]   I'll give you a good example.
[02:07:02.660 --> 02:07:04.460]   ESET is a very lightweight.
[02:07:04.460 --> 02:07:06.060]   Does not use a lot of resources,
[02:07:06.060 --> 02:07:08.540]   but it's also the best antivirus protection you can get.
[02:07:08.540 --> 02:07:12.140]   It is more than antivirus, security protection.
[02:07:12.140 --> 02:07:14.900]   Bransonware is clearly the number one issue people
[02:07:14.900 --> 02:07:16.260]   are facing right now.
[02:07:16.260 --> 02:07:20.620]   We keep ESET around to keep us from becoming a statistic.
[02:07:20.620 --> 02:07:23.260]   ESET solutions block advanced threats.
[02:07:23.260 --> 02:07:26.380]   They do multiple of different things.
[02:07:26.380 --> 02:07:28.980]   Without slowing you down, I'll give you an example.
[02:07:28.980 --> 02:07:30.300]   ESET protect advanced.
[02:07:30.300 --> 02:07:32.140]   They just announced this.
[02:07:32.140 --> 02:07:33.540]   And this is why I think Russell likes it.
[02:07:33.540 --> 02:07:36.100]   It's a security management console.
[02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:38.860]   So he can, even if he's not on site,
[02:07:38.860 --> 02:07:42.060]   get real-time visibility of all our endpoints.
[02:07:42.060 --> 02:07:43.940]   You could protect and detect ransomware.
[02:07:43.940 --> 02:07:46.860]   You can use it on-prem or via the cloud.
[02:07:46.860 --> 02:07:49.340]   It's got service security, mail security,
[02:07:49.340 --> 02:07:51.460]   all the advanced features you'd expect.
[02:07:51.460 --> 02:07:53.180]   They help you sleep a little more soundly at night,
[02:07:53.180 --> 02:07:53.980]   I can tell you.
[02:07:53.980 --> 02:07:57.700]   And it's not just ESET protect advanced.
[02:07:57.700 --> 02:08:00.740]   They have other resources designed to help your employees
[02:08:00.740 --> 02:08:02.220]   do the right thing, to protect themselves
[02:08:02.220 --> 02:08:05.620]   and your company against ransomware and phishing attempts.
[02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:07.420]   We were talking about MFA.
[02:08:07.420 --> 02:08:09.900]   If MFA is not already in place at your company,
[02:08:09.900 --> 02:08:13.660]   you definitely want to take a look at ESET secure authentication.
[02:08:13.660 --> 02:08:16.700]   It's easy to use, user-friendly for your employees,
[02:08:16.700 --> 02:08:18.220]   easy to deploy for you.
[02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:21.660]   You can use it with Office 365, Google Apps, Dropbox.
[02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:25.020]   It's essential for preventing these phishing attacks.
[02:08:25.020 --> 02:08:27.900]   Now once your employees logins and endpoints are secured
[02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:32.380]   with ESET's MFA, then you can train them for battle
[02:08:32.380 --> 02:08:33.860]   against online scams.
[02:08:33.860 --> 02:08:37.380]   That's because 95% of all breaches are caused by human error.
[02:08:37.380 --> 02:08:39.700]   Your first line of defense, it's your employees.
[02:08:39.700 --> 02:08:45.140]   So ESET has a fun, engaging, but effective cybersecurity
[02:08:45.140 --> 02:08:46.380]   awareness training.
[02:08:46.380 --> 02:08:48.340]   They also have interactive, gamified training
[02:08:48.340 --> 02:08:51.740]   that teaches employees how to recognize phishing,
[02:08:51.740 --> 02:08:53.940]   how to create strong passwords, how
[02:08:53.940 --> 02:08:55.620]   to follow best practices on the internet.
[02:08:55.620 --> 02:08:58.220]   You'll be glad to know, and it only takes 90 minutes.
[02:08:58.220 --> 02:09:01.300]   But it's the best 90 minutes you could ever
[02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:04.060]   imagine for your employees, highly recommend it.
[02:09:04.060 --> 02:09:05.860]   We have been using, even without my knowledge
[02:09:05.860 --> 02:09:09.460]   ESET for years, they continue to innovate.
[02:09:09.460 --> 02:09:12.420]   That's key because these guys aren't sitting still.
[02:09:12.420 --> 02:09:13.780]   The bad guys aren't sitting still.
[02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:16.140]   You need security software that keeps up to date.
[02:09:16.140 --> 02:09:17.820]   And these educational tools, I really
[02:09:17.820 --> 02:09:19.780]   like these a very important additional layer
[02:09:19.780 --> 02:09:21.460]   of protection for your business.
[02:09:21.460 --> 02:09:24.260]   Successful ransomware attacks are in the news every day.
[02:09:24.260 --> 02:09:27.900]   Trust ESET to keep you from becoming a statistic.

[02:09:42.300 --> 02:09:46.300]   And it's really was scary when we had employees at home.
[02:09:46.300 --> 02:09:48.100]   And now they're going to bring in those laptops.
[02:09:48.100 --> 02:09:51.140]   I don't know what's been going on.
[02:09:51.140 --> 02:09:52.980]   I don't know what they're influence doing over there.
[02:09:52.980 --> 02:09:54.380]   He's always on my--
[02:09:54.380 --> 02:09:55.380]   I trust him.
[02:09:55.380 --> 02:09:56.940]   I wouldn't have scanned that thing.
[02:09:56.940 --> 02:09:58.740]   I trust him.
[02:09:58.740 --> 02:09:59.860]   I think we're safe.
[02:09:59.860 --> 02:10:01.260]   I think it's going to be--
[02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:02.180]   I'm not worried about it.
[02:10:02.180 --> 02:10:02.860]   But you know what?
[02:10:02.860 --> 02:10:06.580]   We have a lot of non-technical employees as well, right?
[02:10:06.580 --> 02:10:11.780]   And speaking of Spyware, that NSO story, the top story we have.
[02:10:11.780 --> 02:10:13.700]   Haven't talked about it yet today.
[02:10:13.700 --> 02:10:14.500]   No, we have not.
[02:10:14.500 --> 02:10:15.460]   We should talk about it.
[02:10:15.460 --> 02:10:16.180]   That's scary.
[02:10:16.180 --> 02:10:17.420]   I've been talking about it all week.
[02:10:17.420 --> 02:10:21.820]   We talked about it on security now on Twig.
[02:10:21.820 --> 02:10:23.620]   I think we even might have talked about it.
[02:10:23.620 --> 02:10:25.460]   Did Jason talk about it on Twit last week?
[02:10:25.460 --> 02:10:26.380]   Maybe not.
[02:10:26.380 --> 02:10:27.460]   What are that story breaks?
[02:10:27.460 --> 02:10:30.980]   50,000 phone numbers.
[02:10:30.980 --> 02:10:33.020]   We're not sure where they came from,
[02:10:33.020 --> 02:10:40.460]   handed to Amnesty International and a British security
[02:10:40.460 --> 02:10:46.020]   group called-- what was the name I forgot--
[02:10:46.020 --> 02:10:47.700]   something stories.
[02:10:47.700 --> 02:10:48.740]   I always forget their name.
[02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:49.940]   Why don't I remember it?
[02:10:49.940 --> 02:10:53.100]   Anyway, they found when they looked through these--
[02:10:53.100 --> 02:10:54.820]   go ahead, do you know?
[02:10:54.820 --> 02:10:55.260]   Well, no.
[02:10:55.260 --> 02:10:59.340]   I mean, there's been a lot of work over this,
[02:10:59.340 --> 02:11:02.980]   two journalists in particular, Tom Fox Brewster--
[02:11:02.980 --> 02:11:07.020]   sorry, Tom Brewster and Kim Zetter.
[02:11:07.020 --> 02:11:10.220]   It's-- what it's looking like at the moment is this.
[02:11:10.220 --> 02:11:14.980]   Pegasus is saying, we can give you malware to get onto any phone.
[02:11:14.980 --> 02:11:17.940]   And they had a list of 50,000 people,
[02:11:17.940 --> 02:11:21.220]   but it doesn't appear that Pegasus generated themselves.
[02:11:21.220 --> 02:11:22.900]   That came from a third party.
[02:11:22.900 --> 02:11:26.020]   So it's now trying to find who the third party is.
[02:11:26.020 --> 02:11:30.860]   But when you look at these 50,000 phone numbers--
[02:11:30.860 --> 02:11:33.940]   it's very interesting-- the dates of those phone numbers
[02:11:33.940 --> 02:11:36.460]   being put on that list correspond sometimes even
[02:11:36.460 --> 02:11:39.780]   within seconds to the dates of malware
[02:11:39.780 --> 02:11:42.540]   infestations on the phone that were analyzed
[02:11:42.540 --> 02:11:44.460]   by Amnesty International.
[02:11:44.460 --> 02:11:51.420]   So the list seems to be very closely related to maybe even
[02:11:51.420 --> 02:11:55.540]   a subset or a superset of NSO group customers.
[02:11:55.540 --> 02:11:59.980]   NSO group is an Israeli company that sells hacking tools.
[02:11:59.980 --> 02:12:08.580]   They say only to nice guys, only to governments that are good.
[02:12:08.580 --> 02:12:09.660]   And right, yeah.
[02:12:09.660 --> 02:12:11.900]   We sell names from people as well.
[02:12:11.900 --> 02:12:12.420]   Yeah.
[02:12:12.420 --> 02:12:12.940]   Right.
[02:12:12.940 --> 02:12:13.980]   Or specific to the point that they
[02:12:13.980 --> 02:12:15.060]   could just send you a text message.
[02:12:15.060 --> 02:12:18.060]   You don't have to opt in, click anything, do anything.
[02:12:18.060 --> 02:12:19.900]   So I'm going to put it on your phone.
[02:12:19.900 --> 02:12:23.180]   One of these exploits is a zero-click exploit.
[02:12:23.180 --> 02:12:24.340]   You don't have to do anything.
[02:12:24.340 --> 02:12:26.820]   You may not even know that you've been exploited.
[02:12:26.820 --> 02:12:33.340]   So they analyzed-- this group analyzed 37 phones.
[02:12:33.340 --> 02:12:36.340]   Many with a tight correlation between timestamps associated
[02:12:36.340 --> 02:12:38.620]   with a number on the list and the initiation
[02:12:38.620 --> 02:12:40.900]   of surveillance attempts, in some places,
[02:12:40.900 --> 02:12:42.020]   as short as a few seconds.
[02:12:42.020 --> 02:12:44.740]   That seems to me to show that the providence of the list
[02:12:44.740 --> 02:12:48.380]   is something closely related to NSO group.
[02:12:48.380 --> 02:12:52.180]   They found, though, what's scary and what's actually depressing.
[02:12:52.180 --> 02:12:55.540]   NSO group says, it's not true.
[02:12:55.540 --> 02:12:55.980]   I'm sorry.
[02:12:55.980 --> 02:12:57.940]   Did I say bull-- I mean, piffle.
[02:12:57.940 --> 02:12:59.180]   This is piffle.
[02:12:59.180 --> 02:13:00.100]   It's not true.
[02:13:00.100 --> 02:13:01.900]   That's the new word I'm going to use all the time.
[02:13:01.900 --> 02:13:03.580]   Is that OK with you Ian?
[02:13:03.580 --> 02:13:07.220]   No, honestly, I would be harsher than that.
[02:13:07.220 --> 02:13:07.700]   I'm sorry.
[02:13:07.700 --> 02:13:09.820]   These people are selling malware.
[02:13:09.820 --> 02:13:11.020]   And they're selling it.
[02:13:11.020 --> 02:13:11.820]   And they're selling it.
[02:13:11.820 --> 02:13:12.380]   They're selling it to you.
[02:13:12.380 --> 02:13:14.780]   Journalists, human rights, people, the rest of it.
[02:13:14.780 --> 02:13:16.540]   I'd like to show you got--
[02:13:16.540 --> 02:13:17.820]   sorry, no, I'd like to show you a bit.
[02:13:17.820 --> 02:13:18.740]   His girlfriend is fiance.
[02:13:18.740 --> 02:13:20.340]   People are getting killed over there.
[02:13:20.340 --> 02:13:20.740]   Yes.
[02:13:20.740 --> 02:13:21.500]   He got killed.
[02:13:21.500 --> 02:13:25.260]   And as Viancé had it on her phone,
[02:13:25.260 --> 02:13:27.660]   reporters are able to identify more than 1,000 people
[02:13:27.660 --> 02:13:30.180]   spending more than 50 countries.
[02:13:30.180 --> 02:13:33.620]   Several Arab royal family members, 65 business executives,
[02:13:33.620 --> 02:13:37.380]   85 human rights activists, 189 journalists,
[02:13:37.380 --> 02:13:39.820]   600 politicians and government officials,
[02:13:39.820 --> 02:13:43.660]   including the president of France, Emmanuel Macron,
[02:13:43.660 --> 02:13:48.100]   10 prime ministers, three presidents, and one king.
[02:13:48.100 --> 02:13:51.460]   And again, for listeners and viewers,
[02:13:51.460 --> 02:13:56.820]   this specifically gets you text messages, emails, social media
[02:13:56.820 --> 02:14:00.540]   posts, your location, your speed and direction,
[02:14:00.540 --> 02:14:03.380]   all without any kind of contact.
[02:14:03.380 --> 02:14:06.100]   And this is why I look at Ian in the face over the seeds
[02:14:06.100 --> 02:14:06.900]   of the internet.
[02:14:06.900 --> 02:14:10.420]   And I say to you, how are you going to too authenticate that?
[02:14:10.420 --> 02:14:11.580]   How are you going to help me there?
[02:14:11.580 --> 02:14:14.220]   Brother, where is the text too authentication?
[02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:16.420]   Save me from this NSO.
[02:14:16.420 --> 02:14:16.980]   No.
[02:14:16.980 --> 02:14:17.980]   But this is important.
[02:14:17.980 --> 02:14:22.020]   Then they have this horrible thing of saying,
[02:14:22.020 --> 02:14:23.540]   well, if you're not doing anything illegal,
[02:14:23.540 --> 02:14:24.500]   you really don't have to worry.
[02:14:24.500 --> 02:14:25.740]   Can you believe they said that?
[02:14:25.740 --> 02:14:26.580]   Ha.
[02:14:26.580 --> 02:14:27.580]   Right.
[02:14:27.580 --> 02:14:29.380]   Inseculous.
[02:14:29.380 --> 02:14:30.340]   No, I'm sorry.
[02:14:30.340 --> 02:14:33.260]   Anyone who says you're not doing anything illegal
[02:14:33.260 --> 02:14:36.180]   and so you don't have anything to worry about,
[02:14:36.180 --> 02:14:38.700]   my response is, do you have curtains?
[02:14:38.700 --> 02:14:39.140]   Really?
[02:14:39.140 --> 02:14:41.980]   Because if you're happy everyone looking in on your life
[02:14:41.980 --> 02:14:44.740]   like that, you're fine.
[02:14:44.740 --> 02:14:45.940]   But this is more than privacy.
[02:14:45.940 --> 02:14:46.740]   I mean, these people--
[02:14:46.740 --> 02:14:47.140]   Yes.
[02:14:47.140 --> 02:14:48.500]   --really their lives are at risk.
[02:14:48.500 --> 02:14:50.260]   Because these country--
[02:14:50.260 --> 02:14:52.100]   clearly a country that is looking
[02:14:52.100 --> 02:14:54.540]   at human rights activists or journalists
[02:14:54.540 --> 02:14:56.660]   is not a benign nation.
[02:14:56.660 --> 02:14:57.180]   No, again--
[02:14:57.180 --> 02:14:58.580]   But there is no benign, right?
[02:14:58.580 --> 02:15:00.420]   Like, everything is about power and control.
[02:15:00.420 --> 02:15:01.500]   There is no benign.
[02:15:01.500 --> 02:15:04.140]   There is no good people.
[02:15:04.140 --> 02:15:06.900]   If our-- like, my phone knows more about me
[02:15:06.900 --> 02:15:08.980]   than I know about me.
[02:15:08.980 --> 02:15:09.980]   Right?
[02:15:09.980 --> 02:15:10.420]   So--
[02:15:10.420 --> 02:15:10.980]   Exactly.
[02:15:10.980 --> 02:15:13.860]   --and all of us could have something used against us
[02:15:13.860 --> 02:15:15.380]   in a way that would become malicious.
[02:15:15.380 --> 02:15:17.220]   It's a way of being able to control people,
[02:15:17.220 --> 02:15:18.820]   being able to track people.
[02:15:18.820 --> 02:15:20.500]   And we need to have laws in place
[02:15:20.500 --> 02:15:23.460]   that that should be just as illegal as if you go into my house
[02:15:23.460 --> 02:15:25.980]   and snoop through all my papers and I catch you there.
[02:15:25.980 --> 02:15:29.300]   Like, that is as creepy as it is because they can find out
[02:15:29.300 --> 02:15:31.460]   everything about you from your phone.
[02:15:31.460 --> 02:15:36.420]   I think there's two things.
[02:15:36.420 --> 02:15:40.140]   I guess on the one hand, you're absolutely right.
[02:15:40.140 --> 02:15:44.180]   People who are not worried about privacy
[02:15:44.180 --> 02:15:46.660]   use that argument to, well, if you've got nothing to hide,
[02:15:46.660 --> 02:15:48.140]   why would you worry about that?
[02:15:48.140 --> 02:15:49.340]   If you've got nothing to hide, why
[02:15:49.340 --> 02:15:51.220]   are you worried about government surveillance?
[02:15:51.220 --> 02:15:52.940]   That's one species argument.
[02:15:52.940 --> 02:15:54.420]   But there's another one on the other side
[02:15:54.420 --> 02:15:58.380]   that I hear from a lot of tech people and security experts
[02:15:58.380 --> 02:16:02.300]   that you don't have to worry about this because this is--
[02:16:02.300 --> 02:16:03.900]   these are so expensive.
[02:16:03.900 --> 02:16:05.580]   These are-- you have to be a nation state
[02:16:05.580 --> 02:16:06.700]   to take advantage of them.
[02:16:06.700 --> 02:16:08.260]   And they're not general hacks.
[02:16:08.260 --> 02:16:09.780]   They're targeted.
[02:16:09.780 --> 02:16:13.820]   So you and I have nothing to worry about from the NSO group,
[02:16:13.820 --> 02:16:15.780]   not because we haven't done anything wrong,
[02:16:15.780 --> 02:16:18.940]   but because we're just not going to be the subjects
[02:16:18.940 --> 02:16:19.820]   of this kind of attack.
[02:16:19.820 --> 02:16:22.580]   I think that's also wrong.
[02:16:22.580 --> 02:16:23.100]   OK.
[02:16:23.100 --> 02:16:26.620]   I think you look at the contract that was put out.
[02:16:26.620 --> 02:16:30.620]   They were saying they were charging a couple of, you know,
[02:16:30.620 --> 02:16:35.380]   six figure sums just for targeting 10 people.
[02:16:35.380 --> 02:16:37.540]   Now, yes, you might say, well, OK.
[02:16:37.540 --> 02:16:38.460]   I'm not worth that.
[02:16:38.460 --> 02:16:42.220]   I'm not really going to be the person that's targeted by this.
[02:16:42.220 --> 02:16:45.780]   But the fact that this can be done and all you need
[02:16:45.780 --> 02:16:46.740]   is a phone number.
[02:16:46.740 --> 02:16:49.300]   I mean, let's not forget Donald Trump
[02:16:49.300 --> 02:16:51.460]   was giving out his personal phone number
[02:16:51.460 --> 02:16:52.700]   to European leaders.
[02:16:52.700 --> 02:16:54.780]   And this is out there.
[02:16:54.780 --> 02:16:57.980]   You know, the idea that you can sell malware legally
[02:16:57.980 --> 02:17:02.740]   as long as it's done to governments is just an anathema.
[02:17:02.740 --> 02:17:04.420]   Especially in the case--
[02:17:04.420 --> 02:17:06.020]   Thanks for using an anathema.
[02:17:06.020 --> 02:17:08.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:17:08.780 --> 02:17:11.020]   I mean, I'm googling it as we speak.
[02:17:11.020 --> 02:17:13.180]   So I figure out what it means.
[02:17:13.180 --> 02:17:14.260]   I congratulate them too.
[02:17:14.260 --> 02:17:16.940]   But I'm doing the show.
[02:17:16.940 --> 02:17:17.940]   I'm in two chat rooms.
[02:17:17.940 --> 02:17:20.020]   Like, I can't do three things at one time.
[02:17:20.020 --> 02:17:21.740]   Oh.
[02:17:21.740 --> 02:17:24.500]   The power of things like this, even again, where it's like,
[02:17:24.500 --> 02:17:25.900]   oh, it's only these people.
[02:17:25.900 --> 02:17:27.540]   Those people could be blackmailed with things
[02:17:27.540 --> 02:17:28.660]   that are on their phones.
[02:17:28.660 --> 02:17:30.460]   You know, we have the article in here we didn't talk about
[02:17:30.460 --> 02:17:33.380]   with the Catholic priests who got out it because he was
[02:17:33.380 --> 02:17:34.820]   on Grindr and his occasion.
[02:17:34.820 --> 02:17:35.580]   And where was that?
[02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:36.940]   Oh, that hit the crate.
[02:17:36.940 --> 02:17:37.940]   Yes.
[02:17:37.940 --> 02:17:40.980]   And so again, when you were in these kind of power structures,
[02:17:40.980 --> 02:17:44.940]   imagine what you could do to cripple a nation, cripple a business,
[02:17:44.940 --> 02:17:47.900]   if you just had this on the right person's phone.
[02:17:47.900 --> 02:17:50.060]   So it might not affect me on my day to day,
[02:17:50.060 --> 02:17:54.740]   but it affects important people, journalists, lobbyists,
[02:17:54.740 --> 02:17:56.540]   presidents, anybody.
[02:17:56.540 --> 02:17:58.180]   So it's a problem.
[02:17:58.180 --> 02:17:59.180]   It's a huge problem.
[02:17:59.180 --> 02:17:59.540]   Yeah.
[02:17:59.540 --> 02:18:02.460]   And I think we should be outraged because if you're not outraged,
[02:18:02.460 --> 02:18:04.380]   then they're like, oh, it's not that big of a deal.
[02:18:04.380 --> 02:18:06.300]   Like, that is not that big of a deal.
[02:18:06.300 --> 02:18:09.820]   Then slowly, this is going to become more and more out there
[02:18:09.820 --> 02:18:11.580]   for everyone to be able to use.
[02:18:11.580 --> 02:18:13.820]   And like, even just someone saying, listen,
[02:18:13.820 --> 02:18:16.580]   I'm going to be able to snoop onto your phone and take a look.
[02:18:16.580 --> 02:18:18.940]   You better be careful which way you're voting.
[02:18:18.940 --> 02:18:21.780]   Like, even if you're not sure if they're doing it or not,
[02:18:21.780 --> 02:18:24.300]   I think a lot of people will be worried about something
[02:18:24.300 --> 02:18:24.900]   that they're doing.
[02:18:24.900 --> 02:18:25.500]   Chilling effect.
[02:18:25.500 --> 02:18:28.580]   And the panoptic conflict.
[02:18:28.580 --> 02:18:29.340]   Yes.
[02:18:29.340 --> 02:18:32.300]   Back to blackberries and flip phones.
[02:18:32.300 --> 02:18:36.660]   So there is something to say about an analog world.
[02:18:36.660 --> 02:18:39.420]   Matthew Green, who's a cryptographer,
[02:18:39.420 --> 02:18:42.860]   highly respected guy at Johns Hopkins University,
[02:18:42.860 --> 02:18:45.260]   wrote, I thought, a very good blog piece about it
[02:18:45.260 --> 02:18:49.180]   on his cryptographyengineering.com blog,
[02:18:49.180 --> 02:18:52.260]   where he argues against security nihilism.
[02:18:52.260 --> 02:18:53.660]   He says, a perverse reaction I've
[02:18:53.660 --> 02:18:56.900]   seen from some security experts is to shrug and say, well,
[02:18:56.900 --> 02:18:59.860]   there's no such thing as perfect security.
[02:18:59.860 --> 02:19:02.620]   The people we need to yell at, obviously, is the NSO group.
[02:19:02.620 --> 02:19:06.900]   But even more so, Apple and Google.
[02:19:06.900 --> 02:19:08.940]   Now, most of these phones were Apple phones.
[02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:10.860]   So that was one of the things that scared people.
[02:19:10.860 --> 02:19:11.300]   Wait a minute.
[02:19:11.300 --> 02:19:13.740]   I used an Apple phone because Shogi's fiance said,
[02:19:13.740 --> 02:19:16.660]   well, I used an Apple phone because I was told it was secure.
[02:19:16.660 --> 02:19:19.500]   But the Pegasus software was on her phone.
[02:19:19.500 --> 02:19:22.220]   It should be really important to note.
[02:19:22.220 --> 02:19:26.940]   There's both Android and Apple phones were hacked.
[02:19:26.940 --> 02:19:28.460]   There were only three Android phones,
[02:19:28.460 --> 02:19:31.980]   but that's more because I think the logs are deleted automatically
[02:19:31.980 --> 02:19:32.580]   by Android.
[02:19:32.580 --> 02:19:36.300]   So it was easier to find it on Apple phones.
[02:19:36.300 --> 02:19:40.740]   But he says, really, what we need to do is demand of Apple
[02:19:40.740 --> 02:19:44.340]   and Google to do more to protect their users.
[02:19:44.340 --> 02:19:46.140]   And I think that that's fair.
[02:19:46.140 --> 02:19:49.860]   I think Apple and Google are absolutely care about this.
[02:19:49.860 --> 02:19:52.580]   But they are also economic entities.
[02:19:52.580 --> 02:20:00.180]   And they're perhaps doing the easy thing instead of the right thing.
[02:20:00.180 --> 02:20:02.140]   I think it's fair.
[02:20:02.140 --> 02:20:08.900]   But at the same time, if a nation state targets an individual,
[02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:10.180]   you are screwed.
[02:20:10.180 --> 02:20:13.860]   There is no way to get around it.
[02:20:13.860 --> 02:20:17.140]   You have endless vulnerabilities.
[02:20:17.140 --> 02:20:19.900]   A vulnerability on the computer system.
[02:20:19.900 --> 02:20:21.620]   As we've seen with the Snowden leaks,
[02:20:21.620 --> 02:20:24.620]   if you buy a new computer and you're on a watch list,
[02:20:24.620 --> 02:20:29.260]   stuff can be loaded on there before you get it.
[02:20:29.260 --> 02:20:32.100]   But these are a very small number of people.
[02:20:32.100 --> 02:20:34.820]   But Scott Manili was right.
[02:20:34.820 --> 02:20:36.620]   Privacy is dead.
[02:20:36.620 --> 02:20:38.380]   And when Snowden came out,
[02:20:38.380 --> 02:20:40.420]   Manili actually said, my goodness,
[02:20:40.420 --> 02:20:44.660]   I didn't realize quite how right I was.
[02:20:44.660 --> 02:20:48.580]   For those in the chat, Swamp Rat asked one of my flip phones.
[02:20:48.580 --> 02:20:51.140]   I keep my blackberry and my burner on me at all times, baby.
[02:20:51.140 --> 02:20:51.900]   You need me.
[02:20:51.900 --> 02:20:53.060]   I've been in these streets.
[02:20:53.060 --> 02:20:53.540]   Oh, nice.
[02:20:53.540 --> 02:20:54.460]   Are you going to find me?
[02:20:54.460 --> 02:20:55.340]   Now, find me.
[02:20:55.340 --> 02:21:00.300]   If I call 844-986, show that number again.
[02:21:00.300 --> 02:21:05.740]   844-9864-563, which phone is that going to ring?
[02:21:05.740 --> 02:21:06.820]   Oh, don't call me.
[02:21:06.820 --> 02:21:07.740]   It's a text number.
[02:21:07.740 --> 02:21:08.740]   It's a bat phone.
[02:21:08.740 --> 02:21:12.340]   And if you really are angry, leave them a voice message.
[02:21:12.340 --> 02:21:14.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:21:14.740 --> 02:21:15.660]   I'll never hear it.
[02:21:15.660 --> 02:21:16.220]   I'll never hear it.
[02:21:16.220 --> 02:21:18.420]   So feel free to yell at me.
[02:21:18.420 --> 02:21:19.980]   So you do one right now.
[02:21:19.980 --> 02:21:21.620]   I'll leave you one right now.
[02:21:21.620 --> 02:21:22.660]   I'll tell you what.
[02:21:22.660 --> 02:21:25.620]   I'm going to pressure Georgia into doing this show with me.
[02:21:25.620 --> 02:21:26.580]   So don't mess with me, Georgia.
[02:21:26.580 --> 02:21:29.300]   I have them text you when I get that stuff together.
[02:21:29.300 --> 02:21:30.700]   But anyway, it's for text line.
[02:21:30.700 --> 02:21:31.460]   Shoot me a text.
[02:21:31.460 --> 02:21:32.460]   I'm out here in these streets.
[02:21:32.460 --> 02:21:33.660]   The phone, which phone does it ring?
[02:21:33.660 --> 02:21:34.660]   It rings all the phones.
[02:21:34.660 --> 02:21:35.460]   I can get all of them.
[02:21:35.460 --> 02:21:37.140]   Get the buzz in the computer.
[02:21:37.140 --> 02:21:38.140]   Be buzzing at everything.
[02:21:38.140 --> 02:21:39.820]   The laptop, the iPad is.
[02:21:39.820 --> 02:21:40.660]   We're all connected.
[02:21:40.660 --> 02:21:40.860]   You know what I mean?
[02:21:40.860 --> 02:21:41.660]   This is the internet.
[02:21:41.660 --> 02:21:42.740]   Yeah, I mean, they tracking me out here.
[02:21:42.740 --> 02:21:43.780]   I guess they're going to fly me.
[02:21:43.780 --> 02:21:49.420]   Are those burner phones?
[02:21:49.420 --> 02:21:50.380]   Huh?
[02:21:50.380 --> 02:21:51.380]   Hey, look.
[02:21:51.380 --> 02:21:52.940]   I got to go back, Uncle Leo.
[02:21:52.940 --> 02:21:55.180]   In case something goes wrong.
[02:21:55.180 --> 02:21:57.180]   In case something goes wrong, this thing will last forever.
[02:21:57.180 --> 02:21:59.820]   On one chart, I can live four months with this bad boy.
[02:21:59.820 --> 02:22:01.420]   OK, the whole world shut down.
[02:22:01.420 --> 02:22:03.060]   I got no power about here in these streets.
[02:22:03.060 --> 02:22:04.060]   I will be out of the way.
[02:22:04.060 --> 02:22:07.740]   In case of the zombie apocalypse, you can actually just go.
[02:22:07.740 --> 02:22:10.260]   I should point out I can still track you on that phone.
[02:22:10.260 --> 02:22:11.780]   You know that.
[02:22:11.780 --> 02:22:14.780]   Look, you're going to track whoever's name.
[02:22:14.780 --> 02:22:16.980]   I'm not going to get the person to enter all my phones.
[02:22:16.980 --> 02:22:18.420]   Because that was the agreement.
[02:22:18.420 --> 02:22:20.140]   You have the same name for all the phones?
[02:22:20.140 --> 02:22:20.580]   No, no, no.
[02:22:20.580 --> 02:22:21.580]   I'm going to tell them.
[02:22:21.580 --> 02:22:22.580]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[02:22:22.580 --> 02:22:23.580]   We're finding out that.
[02:22:23.580 --> 02:22:24.580]   Oh, no, no, no.
[02:22:24.580 --> 02:22:25.580]   No, no, no, no.
[02:22:25.580 --> 02:22:27.860]   This phone, yeah, yeah, different names.
[02:22:27.860 --> 02:22:31.580]   But I wouldn't know what the most important thing in my go bag is that most important
[02:22:31.580 --> 02:22:32.580]   is not even technology.
[02:22:32.580 --> 02:22:34.580]   The most important thing I have.
[02:22:34.580 --> 02:22:35.580]   Love.
[02:22:35.580 --> 02:22:36.580]   That you sealed.
[02:22:36.580 --> 02:22:39.580]   That you're going to be the money of the future.
[02:22:39.580 --> 02:22:41.580]   No, it's not for him.
[02:22:41.580 --> 02:22:42.580]   It's not for me.
[02:22:42.580 --> 02:22:47.220]   I don't smoke, but you know what somebody is willing to do for a pack of cigarettes.
[02:22:47.220 --> 02:22:48.620]   That's called prison economics.
[02:22:48.620 --> 02:22:49.620]   Exactly.
[02:22:49.620 --> 02:22:50.620]   Exactly.
[02:22:50.620 --> 02:22:56.580]   When you are here in the world in the dystopia and you ain't been had a smoke in two months
[02:22:56.580 --> 02:22:57.580]   and I pull out that pack.
[02:22:57.580 --> 02:22:58.580]   Oh, man.
[02:22:58.580 --> 02:22:59.580]   Give me a kid to card again.
[02:22:59.580 --> 02:23:00.580]   It's illegal heroin.
[02:23:00.580 --> 02:23:01.580]   And you only have this.
[02:23:01.580 --> 02:23:03.500]   This is true, isn't it?
[02:23:03.500 --> 02:23:05.740]   You really do have it, don't you?
[02:23:05.740 --> 02:23:11.180]   Vacuum sealed, but fresh every six months and then sold and then repeating the process.
[02:23:11.180 --> 02:23:12.180]   Smart.
[02:23:12.180 --> 02:23:13.180]   Because they don't go back.
[02:23:13.180 --> 02:23:16.140]   The second best thing I have is condoms because in the future I'm not trying to make
[02:23:16.140 --> 02:23:19.140]   no extra babies and they're also used as balloons.
[02:23:19.140 --> 02:23:21.140]   You can whip people with it.
[02:23:21.140 --> 02:23:22.140]   I'm telling you.
[02:23:22.140 --> 02:23:23.340]   You gave me a great idea.
[02:23:23.340 --> 02:23:26.060]   You know what else people are going to really need in the future?
[02:23:26.060 --> 02:23:27.060]   Ice cubes.
[02:23:27.060 --> 02:23:31.900]   I am going to put ice cubes in my go bag because I know that's going to be worth big money.
[02:23:31.900 --> 02:23:32.900]   Hey, hey.
[02:23:32.900 --> 02:23:34.380]   You know what?
[02:23:34.380 --> 02:23:37.980]   Your ice cubes idea is just as good as you not incorporating everything you own under
[02:23:37.980 --> 02:23:38.980]   the twin empire.
[02:23:38.980 --> 02:23:39.980]   Okay.
[02:23:39.980 --> 02:23:40.980]   I got to talk to your account.
[02:23:40.980 --> 02:23:43.020]   I got to get you straight out of your streets on Bolivia.
[02:23:43.020 --> 02:23:44.780]   What kind of cigarettes you recommend men?
[02:23:44.780 --> 02:23:45.780]   Oh, Newport.
[02:23:45.780 --> 02:23:50.780]   That's the classic crack cocaine across all barriers.
[02:23:50.780 --> 02:23:52.780]   That's what every kid started out on.
[02:23:52.780 --> 02:23:53.780]   You know what I'm saying?
[02:23:53.780 --> 02:23:56.820]   They might have migrated to left home, but they always going to come back to their favorite
[02:23:56.820 --> 02:23:58.820]   when they needed it in the time of desperation.
[02:23:58.820 --> 02:24:01.060]   I mean, you can't have enough cigarettes or ammo.
[02:24:01.060 --> 02:24:02.060]   You know what I'm saying?
[02:24:02.060 --> 02:24:03.620]   So I'm ready to go.
[02:24:03.620 --> 02:24:05.100]   Go bag is ready and rocking.
[02:24:05.100 --> 02:24:06.100]   All right.
[02:24:06.100 --> 02:24:09.100]   I got a book called, is it looser for rising?
[02:24:09.100 --> 02:24:11.300]   I think where a meteor hits the air.
[02:24:11.300 --> 02:24:12.300]   Yeah.
[02:24:12.300 --> 02:24:13.300]   Jerry Pournell.
[02:24:13.300 --> 02:24:15.700]   The miniatures are like gold.
[02:24:15.700 --> 02:24:18.060]   It's Lucifer's hammer.
[02:24:18.060 --> 02:24:20.060]   That's the one.
[02:24:20.060 --> 02:24:22.460]   I'm sure Jerry loved his liquor miniatures.
[02:24:22.460 --> 02:24:24.700]   So that's probably why that's in there.
[02:24:24.700 --> 02:24:27.380]   I'm going to guess Jerry used to be on this show regularly.
[02:24:27.380 --> 02:24:28.380]   Did you know that?
[02:24:28.380 --> 02:24:29.580]   And we had Larry Niven on.
[02:24:29.580 --> 02:24:31.220]   No, excellent.
[02:24:31.220 --> 02:24:32.220]   Big fan.
[02:24:32.220 --> 02:24:33.220]   All right.
[02:24:33.220 --> 02:24:41.100]   There's some great writing from last night's turning point action rally in Phoenix, Arizona,
[02:24:41.100 --> 02:24:46.380]   the former president of the United States, calling for routers.
[02:24:46.380 --> 02:24:51.460]   The county has for whatever reason also refused to produce the network routers.
[02:24:51.460 --> 02:24:53.340]   We want the routers, Sonny.
[02:24:53.340 --> 02:24:56.300]   When do we got to get those routers, please?
[02:24:56.300 --> 02:24:57.300]   The routers.
[02:24:57.300 --> 02:24:59.420]   Come on, Kelly.
[02:24:59.420 --> 02:25:00.820]   We can get those routers.
[02:25:00.820 --> 02:25:02.980]   Those routers, you know what?
[02:25:02.980 --> 02:25:04.380]   We're so beyond the routers.
[02:25:04.380 --> 02:25:06.380]   There's so many fraudulent votes without the rep.
[02:25:06.380 --> 02:25:10.980]   But if you got those routers, what that will show, and they don't want to give up the
[02:25:10.980 --> 02:25:12.980]   routers, they don't want to give them.
[02:25:12.980 --> 02:25:14.980]   They are fighting like hell.
[02:25:14.980 --> 02:25:18.980]   Why are these commissioners fighting not to give me the routers?
[02:25:18.980 --> 02:25:20.740]   Because they wouldn't have any internet if they give you the routers.
[02:25:20.740 --> 02:25:22.300]   They will tell the truth.
[02:25:22.300 --> 02:25:24.500]   I'm fighting my tongue with them.
[02:25:24.500 --> 02:25:25.660]   The routers.
[02:25:25.660 --> 02:25:33.340]   He says routers in the 36 second clip 11 times.
[02:25:33.340 --> 02:25:35.500]   Who wants to be the first to tell them?
[02:25:35.500 --> 02:25:37.100]   There's no day dollars for routers.
[02:25:37.100 --> 02:25:38.100]   Oh, shit.
[02:25:38.100 --> 02:25:39.100]   Is he no one?
[02:25:39.100 --> 02:25:43.740]   He's a no one a router.
[02:25:43.740 --> 02:25:50.340]   I'm more angry at whatever person said this to this man to allow him to say this.
[02:25:50.340 --> 02:25:52.180]   I know he says dumb so all the time.
[02:25:52.180 --> 02:25:54.900]   But someone had to tell him that this is the thing.
[02:25:54.900 --> 02:25:57.740]   Sir, ask for the routers, sir.
[02:25:57.740 --> 02:26:00.260]   That's what we're looking for.
[02:26:00.260 --> 02:26:01.580]   Someone said this to him.
[02:26:01.580 --> 02:26:03.180]   He has no idea what he's talking about.
[02:26:03.180 --> 02:26:04.180]   So what moron?
[02:26:04.180 --> 02:26:05.180]   It must fit in that.
[02:26:05.180 --> 02:26:08.220]   As a matter of fact, whoever said that, I love you as a human being.
[02:26:08.220 --> 02:26:09.220]   You are the same in the universe.
[02:26:09.220 --> 02:26:12.700]   Because I know you said this to him and his work dummy mind.
[02:26:12.700 --> 02:26:16.060]   And you sent him out there to get stabbed repeatedly in the chest for something like
[02:26:16.060 --> 02:26:17.060]   a doofus, but doofus.
[02:26:17.060 --> 02:26:18.060]   So where are you?
[02:26:18.060 --> 02:26:20.140]   I love you because he didn't come up with this on his own.
[02:26:20.140 --> 02:26:21.140]   Okay.
[02:26:21.140 --> 02:26:22.140]   He's never touched a router in his lifetime.
[02:26:22.140 --> 02:26:24.140]   No, it's not a router.
[02:26:24.140 --> 02:26:25.140]   Oh, routers.
[02:26:25.140 --> 02:26:27.540]   Are you meant to say something else?
[02:26:27.540 --> 02:26:28.540]   No.
[02:26:28.540 --> 02:26:29.540]   Okay.
[02:26:29.540 --> 02:26:30.540]   You know what it is.
[02:26:30.540 --> 02:26:35.380]   It's kind of like he's been taught a word and said, said again, said again.
[02:26:35.380 --> 02:26:36.980]   All you need is the logs.
[02:26:36.980 --> 02:26:39.340]   You don't need actual hard way to state the logs.
[02:26:39.340 --> 02:26:40.340]   Yeah, but simple as I.
[02:26:40.340 --> 02:26:42.500]   And if it was hardware, you say servers.
[02:26:42.500 --> 02:26:43.500]   We need to serve.
[02:26:43.500 --> 02:26:44.500]   We got to collect.
[02:26:44.500 --> 02:26:45.580]   And that's what it is.
[02:26:45.580 --> 02:26:47.340]   Servers worked really well in 2016.
[02:26:47.340 --> 02:26:48.580]   Remember, lock her up.
[02:26:48.580 --> 02:26:49.780]   Server, server, server.
[02:26:49.780 --> 02:26:54.580]   So he's just, it's a, you know, and I will say routers, routers, router, routers.
[02:26:54.580 --> 02:26:57.980]   And now for nothing along the Bible button in certain places, Kentucky, the router is
[02:26:57.980 --> 02:26:58.980]   the internet.
[02:26:58.980 --> 02:27:01.380]   Girl, the router ain't routing my next in the internet.
[02:27:01.380 --> 02:27:04.260]   I don't know what's going on with the routers, but we got to get it.
[02:27:04.260 --> 02:27:06.660]   The president said we need routers.
[02:27:06.660 --> 02:27:09.260]   They call them routers in the UK, right?
[02:27:09.260 --> 02:27:10.420]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:27:10.420 --> 02:27:14.180]   I'm listening to this guy say it eight or nine times.
[02:27:14.180 --> 02:27:15.500]   You're sorry, but God's sake.
[02:27:15.500 --> 02:27:16.500]   It's called routers.
[02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:17.500]   It's a router.
[02:27:17.500 --> 02:27:22.140]   And of course, in Australia, router means something completely different.
[02:27:22.140 --> 02:27:23.140]   So.
[02:27:23.140 --> 02:27:24.780]   Oh, well, yes, but that's Australia.
[02:27:24.780 --> 02:27:29.020]   You know, they have dropped, drop bears and weird things.
[02:27:29.020 --> 02:27:30.100]   Yeah.
[02:27:30.100 --> 02:27:31.580]   Yeah.
[02:27:31.580 --> 02:27:34.300]   I think that would be a fitting note to end this.
[02:27:34.300 --> 02:27:39.300]   I'm going to go out and check our routers and see if we have anything on them.
[02:27:39.300 --> 02:27:43.820]   Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you have enjoyed this thrilling gripping edition.
[02:27:43.820 --> 02:27:46.340]   I thought it would be more lighthearted.
[02:27:46.340 --> 02:27:49.020]   It turned out we covered some pretty serious stuff.
[02:27:49.020 --> 02:27:50.860]   I blame you serious time.
[02:27:50.860 --> 02:27:52.500]   Well, maybe that's it.
[02:27:52.500 --> 02:27:54.380]   Maybe it's the times Ian Thompson.
[02:27:54.380 --> 02:28:00.380]   He covers serious news in a very funny way at the register.com.
[02:28:00.380 --> 02:28:01.380]   Always love.
[02:28:01.380 --> 02:28:02.380]   We try.
[02:28:02.380 --> 02:28:03.380]   I love you take on everything.
[02:28:03.380 --> 02:28:08.220]   Anything you want to plug anything you're up to these days?
[02:28:08.220 --> 02:28:16.780]   Actually, I'm we've had a situation where a woman in my wife's office has tested positive
[02:28:16.780 --> 02:28:19.100]   COVID after getting the vaccinations.
[02:28:19.100 --> 02:28:22.700]   So I'm in lockdown, which is why I'm not up at battle.
[02:28:22.700 --> 02:28:24.700]   Oh, my goodness.
[02:28:24.700 --> 02:28:31.500]   So, yeah, we're keeping quiet until we know what the results are.
[02:28:31.500 --> 02:28:36.700]   There was an excellent article I think today in Salon about these they so-called breakthrough
[02:28:36.700 --> 02:28:40.980]   infections that the vaccine isn't going to protect you necessarily, especially from this
[02:28:40.980 --> 02:28:44.380]   new Delta violent by a variant.
[02:28:44.380 --> 02:28:48.340]   It's going to protect you from death and hospitalization.
[02:28:48.340 --> 02:28:53.780]   So yes, you probably should still be cautious indoors in public.
[02:28:53.780 --> 02:28:54.780]   Maybe we're mask.
[02:28:54.780 --> 02:28:57.980]   Well, I mean, we dropped the ball on this one.
[02:28:57.980 --> 02:29:05.060]   I mean, we had Sars and Murs, which would as infectious, but they were locked down.
[02:29:05.060 --> 02:29:08.740]   And now we've got four billion people who are unvaccinated.
[02:29:08.740 --> 02:29:12.340]   And that's going to breed a whole lot new of new infections.
[02:29:12.340 --> 02:29:14.220]   I had a call.
[02:29:14.220 --> 02:29:16.820]   From Montreal, you might be interested in Georgia.
[02:29:16.820 --> 02:29:21.660]   I asked him because I knew that I was talking to Renee and of course, George is up in Montreal
[02:29:21.660 --> 02:29:25.780]   too, having talked to Renee that things were a little tough in Montreal.
[02:29:25.780 --> 02:29:30.940]   There was a shortage of vaccines that were for a while giving only one vaccine to hoping
[02:29:30.940 --> 02:29:33.740]   to spread them out a little bit and deferring the second vaccine.
[02:29:33.740 --> 02:29:35.860]   Are things improved there?
[02:29:35.860 --> 02:29:37.220]   Things are great now, actually.
[02:29:37.220 --> 02:29:41.660]   I think that we have we now are giving away a lottery for people that are vaccinated.
[02:29:41.660 --> 02:29:42.660]   You're double vaccinated.
[02:29:42.660 --> 02:29:43.660]   You're getting a lottery.
[02:29:43.660 --> 02:29:44.660]   I think they're at 62 percent.
[02:29:44.660 --> 02:29:45.660]   Nice.
[02:29:45.660 --> 02:29:46.660]   That's fantastic.
[02:29:46.660 --> 02:29:47.940]   We're trying to hit 75.
[02:29:47.940 --> 02:29:51.460]   This guy told me he said, I'm not doing a vaccine.
[02:29:51.460 --> 02:29:53.620]   I got lots of natural protection.
[02:29:53.620 --> 02:29:56.620]   I said, no.
[02:29:56.620 --> 02:29:58.660]   We don't have natural protection.
[02:29:58.660 --> 02:30:01.060]   We might just go out and get that vaccine maybe.
[02:30:01.060 --> 02:30:02.060]   Yeah.
[02:30:02.060 --> 02:30:03.060]   What the heck?
[02:30:03.060 --> 02:30:04.060]   Yeah.
[02:30:04.060 --> 02:30:05.060]   Yeah.
[02:30:05.060 --> 02:30:06.060]   What the heck?
[02:30:06.060 --> 02:30:07.060]   Who set your immune system?
[02:30:07.060 --> 02:30:10.060]   Georgia Dows anxiety videos at anxiety-videos.com.
[02:30:10.060 --> 02:30:12.860]   A great place to get help with a whole lot of different.
[02:30:12.860 --> 02:30:14.500]   She's a professional therapist.
[02:30:14.500 --> 02:30:16.740]   We don't mention that, but she is.
[02:30:16.740 --> 02:30:23.060]   You can master life sleeping children and more.
[02:30:23.060 --> 02:30:24.660]   I have mall.
[02:30:24.660 --> 02:30:27.100]   Collect all 10.
[02:30:27.100 --> 02:30:31.260]   And also, let's not forget your new YouTube show where Georgia-
[02:30:31.260 --> 02:30:32.260]   Yeah, I knew YouTube channel.
[02:30:32.260 --> 02:30:33.260]   Georgia Rants.
[02:30:33.260 --> 02:30:34.260]   What do you react?
[02:30:34.260 --> 02:30:36.260]   I'm sorry.
[02:30:36.260 --> 02:30:41.220]   I might rant and react to just different things that are in pop culture.
[02:30:41.220 --> 02:30:46.980]   So like Marvel and Loki and the Invincible cartoon-
[02:30:46.980 --> 02:30:48.340]   Oh, I like this.
[02:30:48.340 --> 02:30:49.340]   Here's one.
[02:30:49.340 --> 02:30:50.340]   Most recent.
[02:30:50.340 --> 02:30:51.340]   No, this was in March.
[02:30:51.340 --> 02:30:54.980]   In the WandaVision, you're talking about the stages of grief because Wanda goes through
[02:30:54.980 --> 02:30:56.140]   grief, right?
[02:30:56.140 --> 02:30:59.340]   That's really, was that a fairly realistic depiction?
[02:30:59.340 --> 02:31:00.340]   Yeah, it was.
[02:31:00.340 --> 02:31:05.060]   They did actually quite a good job at being able to go through, like they're faster, right?
[02:31:05.060 --> 02:31:07.180]   And not everyone goes through all of the stages.
[02:31:07.180 --> 02:31:10.380]   But I think that they did a great job of going through what it's like to lose someone
[02:31:10.380 --> 02:31:13.700]   and how we can sometimes get lost within ourselves.
[02:31:13.700 --> 02:31:16.540]   And then what happens if you have superpowers on top of that?
[02:31:16.540 --> 02:31:19.460]   So I get to react to some of the most fun videos.
[02:31:19.460 --> 02:31:22.020]   And then I do basic psychology videos as well.
[02:31:22.020 --> 02:31:26.500]   What is anxiety and how to survive opening up from the pandemic?
[02:31:26.500 --> 02:31:28.500]   So I know all of these discussions.
[02:31:28.500 --> 02:31:32.660]   They were they teach you how to do all those reactions.
[02:31:32.660 --> 02:31:33.660]   Yes.
[02:31:33.660 --> 02:31:34.660]   Yes.
[02:31:34.660 --> 02:31:35.660]   I have all of the-
[02:31:35.660 --> 02:31:37.660]   Apparently that really works on YouTube.
[02:31:37.660 --> 02:31:40.380]   It's so horrible and I have to pose for all.
[02:31:40.380 --> 02:31:45.180]   I have to look stupid is pretty much you have to look stupid with thumbnail and then more
[02:31:45.180 --> 02:31:47.380]   people will click on it because you look stupid.
[02:31:47.380 --> 02:31:53.180]   More people click if you're making a face on a YouTube video.
[02:31:53.180 --> 02:31:56.020]   See your early ones, see look she looks nice.
[02:31:56.020 --> 02:31:58.020]   She's just sweet looking.
[02:31:58.020 --> 02:31:59.020]   No, no.
[02:31:59.020 --> 02:32:02.740]   You need to be what the heck is going on?
[02:32:02.740 --> 02:32:04.740]   Yeah, like my hair.
[02:32:04.740 --> 02:32:05.740]   Yeah, crazy.
[02:32:05.740 --> 02:32:06.740]   Crazy Georgia.
[02:32:06.740 --> 02:32:09.500]   I apologize to everyone that hates the thumbnail.
[02:32:09.500 --> 02:32:10.500]   They work better.
[02:32:10.500 --> 02:32:12.900]   So I'm trying to build the channel.
[02:32:12.900 --> 02:32:13.900]   Whatever works.
[02:32:13.900 --> 02:32:14.900]   Whatever works.
[02:32:14.900 --> 02:32:18.700]   YouTube.com/GeorgiaDow.
[02:32:18.700 --> 02:32:19.700]   It's so great.
[02:32:19.700 --> 02:32:23.700]   It's always great to see you and come visit us whenever you're in town next.
[02:32:23.700 --> 02:32:24.700]   I hope you will.
[02:32:24.700 --> 02:32:26.020]   When the world opens up, I'll be there.
[02:32:26.020 --> 02:32:28.140]   We can go to Canada pretty soon.
[02:32:28.140 --> 02:32:29.140]   That's the good news.
[02:32:29.140 --> 02:32:30.660]   Yes, you can come here but I can't go there.
[02:32:30.660 --> 02:32:31.660]   Oh, we won't let you in?
[02:32:31.660 --> 02:32:36.100]   On his 9th we're opening up and I think that it's not opening up until like at least until
[02:32:36.100 --> 02:32:39.500]   the 22nd it's not open to go into the States.
[02:32:39.500 --> 02:32:40.500]   Oh man.
[02:32:40.500 --> 02:32:41.500]   I don't know.
[02:32:41.500 --> 02:32:42.500]   You don't like the mediums.
[02:32:42.500 --> 02:32:43.500]   I'm sorry.
[02:32:43.500 --> 02:32:44.500]   We're friendly.
[02:32:44.500 --> 02:32:48.900]   We mention we do Twitch every Sunday afternoon at about 230 Pacific 530 Eastern.
[02:32:48.900 --> 02:32:53.020]   That's 2130 UTC and I give you those times because you can't watch us make the show
[02:32:53.020 --> 02:32:54.020]   live.
[02:32:54.020 --> 02:32:55.900]   There was a really good conversation before the show started.
[02:32:55.900 --> 02:32:59.060]   You would see that if you tuned in.
[02:32:59.060 --> 02:33:03.180]   The live video and audio streams are at twit.tv/live.
[02:33:03.180 --> 02:33:07.780]   People who watch live or listen live often like to chat live with us at our chatroom
[02:33:07.780 --> 02:33:09.980]   IRC.twit.tv.
[02:33:09.980 --> 02:33:13.420]   Of course, on demand versions of all of our shows are also available.
[02:33:13.420 --> 02:33:15.900]   All you have to do is go to the web.twit.tv.
[02:33:15.900 --> 02:33:18.380]   There's a YouTube channel.
[02:33:18.380 --> 02:33:20.500]   Let's see what else can you do.
[02:33:20.500 --> 02:33:23.540]   You can subscribe actually in your favorite podcast client.
[02:33:23.540 --> 02:33:26.140]   You get it automatically that way.
[02:33:26.140 --> 02:33:32.340]   And if by the way they let you leave reviews please give us a 5 star review let the world
[02:33:32.340 --> 02:33:34.580]   know that you're a twit.
[02:33:34.580 --> 02:33:36.180]   My man doesn't come out right.
[02:33:36.180 --> 02:33:39.380]   I do want to mention club twit because there's another way you could chat with us in our
[02:33:39.380 --> 02:33:44.140]   Discord which is always a lot of fun.
[02:33:44.140 --> 02:33:46.740]   Though getting the Discord you have to be a member of club twit.
[02:33:46.740 --> 02:33:50.940]   It's a way to support the network and get some benefits for yourself.
[02:33:50.940 --> 02:33:54.940]   Seven dollars a month gives you ad free versions of all the shows because we're monetizing
[02:33:54.940 --> 02:33:59.220]   you so we don't need to play ads for you, read ads to you.
[02:33:59.220 --> 02:34:02.460]   You also and that's audio or video, all of the shows.
[02:34:02.460 --> 02:34:05.580]   There's also a twit plus feed with additional content.
[02:34:05.580 --> 02:34:07.780]   Things like the pre-show chatter that we add.
[02:34:07.780 --> 02:34:10.380]   I think that'll probably make it into the twit plus feed.
[02:34:10.380 --> 02:34:15.660]   And access to our club twit discord which is a great place to hang with people like
[02:34:15.660 --> 02:34:18.180]   minded people and discuss not only the shows.
[02:34:18.180 --> 02:34:24.500]   We have sections for all of the shows but frankly a lot of great kind of geeky subjects
[02:34:24.500 --> 02:34:29.180]   from anime to travel to photography to philosophy.
[02:34:29.180 --> 02:34:35.140]   And I think we're going to have to have a seasonings channel for Owen J.J.
[02:34:35.140 --> 02:34:37.660]   Stone.
[02:34:37.660 --> 02:34:46.460]   Speaking of Owen J.J. Stone as is our tradition we let him conclude the show IQMZ.com.
[02:34:46.460 --> 02:34:48.660]   Ladies and gentlemen I give you.
[02:34:48.660 --> 02:34:50.140]   Oh doctor.
[02:34:50.140 --> 02:34:52.940]   So I was taking notes during your speech there.
[02:34:52.940 --> 02:34:59.540]   And speak to your recovery to your wife first and foremost hopefully as well and it should.
[02:34:59.540 --> 02:35:02.980]   Georgia, Georgia has got to do a show with me.
[02:35:02.980 --> 02:35:04.420]   People pressure her on the internet to make her do it.
[02:35:04.420 --> 02:35:05.420]   I know she's busy.
[02:35:05.420 --> 02:35:06.420]   I know she has better things to do.
[02:35:06.420 --> 02:35:10.100]   The last time she did a show with you she revealed her real name.
[02:35:10.100 --> 02:35:11.100]   I know.
[02:35:11.100 --> 02:35:13.300]   And so we're out here in these streets and we're doing those things.
[02:35:13.300 --> 02:35:18.060]   And I just want to remind everybody not that we're always opening up trust but verify.
[02:35:18.060 --> 02:35:22.140]   Okay so when you're going out to go see people and visit if you know you're around people
[02:35:22.140 --> 02:35:26.660]   that aren't vaccinated don't pressure them into it but tell them about your positive experience
[02:35:26.660 --> 02:35:31.220]   about how you didn't die and it's okay for you but don't pressure them but just bring
[02:35:31.220 --> 02:35:34.980]   it up occasionally in a nice fashion no need for us to argue.
[02:35:34.980 --> 02:35:38.100]   But if you're around people that aren't getting vaccinated make sure you're wearing your mask
[02:35:38.100 --> 02:35:41.100]   especially when you go on a grocery store and go inside and go shopping.
[02:35:41.100 --> 02:35:42.740]   It's just better to save inside for you.
[02:35:42.740 --> 02:35:45.900]   If you're inside with three or four people not a big deal if you know everybody's vaccinated
[02:35:45.900 --> 02:35:49.060]   when you go into the grocery store just put the mask on for right now.
[02:35:49.060 --> 02:35:50.060]   Not a big deal.
[02:35:50.060 --> 02:35:51.060]   It's not a political thing.
[02:35:51.060 --> 02:35:54.700]   It's a safety and health issue and anybody listening to this shit have enough common sense
[02:35:54.700 --> 02:35:57.820]   to do but I'm still saying out loud just in case you want to cut this clip and send it
[02:35:57.820 --> 02:35:59.740]   to somebody who is semi rational.
[02:35:59.740 --> 02:36:02.820]   I believe that the world is going to get back to be in a positive awesome place.
[02:36:02.820 --> 02:36:06.340]   I know we're destroying the planet Uncle Leo but why we're here.
[02:36:06.340 --> 02:36:07.540]   Love you children.
[02:36:07.540 --> 02:36:08.540]   Love your husband.
[02:36:08.540 --> 02:36:09.540]   Love your wife.
[02:36:09.540 --> 02:36:10.540]   Talk to your grandparents.
[02:36:10.540 --> 02:36:11.540]   Call them.
[02:36:11.540 --> 02:36:13.580]   You know they've been sat alone inside the house.
[02:36:13.580 --> 02:36:17.980]   Check on your family members and friends and another twit is in the can.
[02:36:17.980 --> 02:36:18.980]   Oh yeah, text me.
[02:36:18.980 --> 02:36:19.980]   I reply to people I talk to you.
[02:36:19.980 --> 02:36:20.980]   I'm here for you.
[02:36:20.980 --> 02:36:21.980]   I love you all in these streets.
[02:36:21.980 --> 02:36:22.980]   I'll talk to you later.
[02:36:22.980 --> 02:36:32.980]   [MUSIC]
[02:36:32.980 --> 02:36:35.580]   Alright, doin' the twin, baby.
[02:36:35.580 --> 02:36:37.580]   Do it.
