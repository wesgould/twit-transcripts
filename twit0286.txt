[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.400]   Mr. John C. de Vorac, good to see you.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.400]   Look at all the light.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.400]   I'm glad you came because you know it's not going to be many more shows out of the-

[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.400]   Oh, thank you, Leo.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.400]   Thanks for joining us.

[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.400]   Here in Larry.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.400]   Good to talk to you.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.400]   Good to talk to you guys.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.400]   The big story, and we'll start with the big story this week, unlike most weeks.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.400]   The big story this week is for the first time in living memory.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.400]   And since the internet's fairly new, I think this probably covers the whole gamut.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.400]   The internet was dis- a country disconnected itself from the global net.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.400]   Egypt on Thursday basically turned off the internet by rerouting its routers.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.400]   It's changed the border gateway protocol so that no traffic could come or go into Egypt.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:29.400]   This in the wake of widespread protests on the streets of Cairo, as Suez and Alexandria.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.400]   On the line with us to talk a little bit about it, a Syrian who is helping cover the story for
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.400]   a citizen's website called globalvoices.org.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.400]   Anas Katesh.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.400]   Anas, thank you for joining us.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.400]   On this one.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.400]   So, Anas is in Boston, by the way, not in Cairo.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.400]   But let's talk specifically about, and there's been a lot of coverage.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.400]   We actually asked Jenny Jardin to come on the show.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.400]   She couldn't, but she suggested you because Boeing's been covering this heavily.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.400]   Is this the first time the country has disconnected itself from the internet?
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.400]   Actually, this is the second time, I believe, but it's a while back.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.400]   How long did Burma stay offline?
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.400]   I intended to leave you on the details of Burma, but I, like, in the first Egypt, disconnected
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.400]   itself from the internet.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   There were people who said that actually Burma was the first country, but I don't know
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.400]   the exact details about Burma.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.400]   It's pretty dramatic if you look at the graph from Arbor Networks of Internet traffic to
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.400]   and from Egypt.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.400]   This is January 27th.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:48.160]   You're going along in the morning at a terabyte, two terabytes by 6 a.m.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.720]   by 2 p.m.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:56.160]   Nearly three terabytes of traffic into and out of Egypt at 5.20 p.m.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.320]   It's like a cliff.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.320]   It drops to...
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.320]   Can I comment on this?
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.320]   Nothing.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.320]   Everybody brings this chart up.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.800]   I've seen it on CNN, Fox News and everyplace else.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.360]   And it's a chart that everyone says, "Oh, it drops off the cliff."
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.440]   Yes, because they turned off the internet.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.600]   What is the shock to anybody?
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.680]   It's dramatic to see the sudden drop of internet traffic.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.680]   It's like my faucet.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.680]   It's turned off the water.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.680]   It's not realizing it.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.680]   Yeah, I think it makes it more of a more just- bit like it's a little bit too red to
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.680]   head around it.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.560]   By the way, it's gigabytes, not terabytes.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.200]   I've got the scale wrong again.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.360]   So it goes from one to three gigabits and then drops off to zero.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.640]   That's a lot of internet traffic.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.800]   First let's start on us by asking how was the internet being used by protesters?
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.840]   Well, Egypt had a very active internet community, activists and bloggers.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.600]   So people were live-treating.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:06:00.400]   The protests, they were live-streaming the protest video from their phones via different
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.200]   services, photos of being produced, blog posts.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.800]   So everything was just out for any social media platform.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.400]   There is Facebook groups.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.840]   So it was- the 18th-foot start to try to stop it.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.880]   On the 25th to the first day of protest, they blocked Twitter.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.240]   On the 26th they blocked Facebook.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.840]   But people were getting proxies as their conventions elsewhere.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.560]   So even that did not work.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:39.680]   So by the 28th they just took in country after grid and even they disabled texting from cell
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.480]   phones just to go one extra step.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.480]   Yes.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.480]   Can I make a comment?
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.480]   And using the left-way messenger services.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.480]   Sure.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.480]   Larry Magga, go ahead.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.360]   Well, it's true that they essentially cut off the internet.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.840]   But sort of like cracks in a sidewalk where a little bit of grass goes through, we still
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.280]   haven't seen a hundred percent block out.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.280]   People were getting through.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.280]   They were dialing into modems, using analog modems to dial into other countries.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.760]   They've been using satellite phones.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.360]   They've been using ham radio connection to the internet.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.640]   So even though they tried, they never a hundred percent stop traffic.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.280]   And if you talk to the folks at Facebook or other services, they will say there was some,
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.240]   though not much traffic coming from Egypt in a time.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.240]   That's correct.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.760]   And actually there have been reports that actually one ISP left in Egypt doesn't have
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.760]   a working line.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.400]   It's called what I believe.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:38.040]   And it serves around 8 percent or less of the entire user base in Egypt.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.000]   So there are some users who are still having their connection.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.800]   There are people who are still delivering the news to us, uploading video.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:53.520]   But as you said, it's just a time interaction of the average user base.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.800]   So, Nase, was the internet, was Twitter, were text messaging being used to organize protests
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.800]   as well?
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:06.800]   What I've seen social networking was a big part of it.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.320]   Before the protest, there was a group on Facebook calling for the protest on the 25th.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.160]   And it got around 90,000 participants.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.640]   So Facebook was a huge part of it.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:22.600]   Twitter comes in hand because it's just an instant way into exchanging news where the
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:29.560]   police are, what's going on, where the locations of dangers, where there's losing going on,
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.560]   etc.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.280]   So I think Facebook was a better platform to organize.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:39.680]   But in terms of sharing news instantly and to an international crowd or just a lot of
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:46.160]   crowds, Twitter was the champion, I would say.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.400]   What, you know, this is one thing I haven't heard a lot talked about.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.840]   Who are these protesters and what exactly do they want?
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:04.920]   Basically, the protesters will represent the entire Egyptian population.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.000]   They come from different political religious backgrounds.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:15.520]   And their full demand currently is for more products to step down, the president to step
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:22.040]   down and for the whole regime to be taken down and replaced with a democratic government.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.960]   So it is not a fundamentalist revolution?
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.360]   No, no, no, not at all.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.400]   It is a pro-democracy revolution.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.400]   Absolutely.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.400]   Yet.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.400]   Yet.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.400]   Well, that's a question.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.800]   I mean, the Muslim Brotherhood has not been heard from.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.800]   Is that right?
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:38.800]   No, they've been heard from.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.800]   They have?
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.800]   They join in.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:49.160]   Judging by the, the rise of the people participating, when one person starts to tear the chance
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:55.360]   toward something religious other people usually just tell him that this is a political protest
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.160]   and those are demand just don't divert.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.960]   You know, they were demand.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:06.000]   So until they lost their press credentials earlier this morning, I've been watching Al Jazeera
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   English.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Oh, they're not.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.680]   They're no longer broadcasting because that was really the only good source.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.680]   Yeah.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.680]   They're not going to have underground.
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.960]   They've actually been, their license has been taken away.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.600]   They were kicked off and you know, they're not supposed to be broadcasting, but they
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.840]   are and that's another point as well.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:21.840]   They're doing it by phone.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.160]   I don't think they have as much live coverage in the streets, but I've been watching that
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.680]   and I've been very impressed with a lot of the folks that they've interviewed.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.880]   Young women that are extremely articulate talking about this movement.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.680]   I'm not saying, I'm not saying there isn't, aren't fundamentalists that may be part of
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:41.160]   it, but I'm not seeing them represented certainly in the coverage from Al Jazeera.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:46.200]   And we should give a plug to your publication too and us, which is of course the global
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:52.640]   voices, global voices online.com, which is kind of a citizens journalistic enterprise
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.920]   blogs and citizen media from around the world.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.080]   And there's quite a bit of Egyptian coverage there as well.
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.080]   Yes.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:09.800]   Egypt is exploding and we've been receiving a huge traffic over the Egypt coverage.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:15.120]   And global voices online.org just to quickly cook the...
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.320]   I'm sorry, yeah.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.440]   GlobalVoicesOnline.org, thank you.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:23.160]   And the way we have it that we provide the content translated into around 15 languages,
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:27.120]   so that also gives us an international exposure.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:33.320]   And actually it's a good thing that we can see some translations from the Arabic of what's
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.000]   being said in Egypt as well, I think.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Absolutely.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.680]   Very valuable to get the actual discussion.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.320]   I wondered, you know, I was in Cairo two years ago and I learned that the population
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.240]   explosion going on in Egypt, I think I remember it was something like a million new people
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.240]   in Cairo ever.
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.320]   What were you doing there then?
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.160]   I was not helping the population explosion.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.160]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.080]   I was visiting the pyramids.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:59.640]   But I wonder, I mean, how much of this is just pure population, pressure and economic unrest
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.640]   as well?
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.640]   I mean, I know of course Mubarak's been in power for 30 years and has promised democratic
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.720]   elections and not delivered.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.560]   But you have to think that at some point just the pure population pressure alone must
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.400]   be a real problem.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.400]   Absolutely.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:18.880]   The economic sector is a big part of what's going on currently in Egypt.
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:25.240]   When you have an authoritarian regime like Mubarak, definitely nepotism and corruption
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:32.440]   is in play and that just really cuts into the livelihood of the average citizen.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:39.080]   I think maybe 40% of Egypt's population is below poverty line.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:43.560]   If I remember correctly, but I'll have to double check that number.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:52.240]   Also, I was very impressed by a country like ours when you might argue this where the rule
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.840]   of law is what really applies.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.720]   It's so different in a country like Egypt, where it's who you know, it's what Bakshi
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.360]   Shukhenpay, as you said, nepotism.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.080]   And really that's demoralizing in an interesting way.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.440]   If there's at least a sense that there's a rule of law and there's some sense of fairness,
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.440]   that's one thing.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.080]   But if there's no sense of fairness, it's extremely difficult.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:17.840]   And I really felt that when I was there.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.720]   Anasah, go ahead.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.440]   No, no, go ahead.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.640]   What do you think is going to happen?
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:29.720]   We saw the green revolt in Iran, basically, you know, we saw it on the internet, we saw
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.680]   it on Twitter, but nothing really came of it.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:37.600]   Will something happen here?
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.600]   I think so.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.600]   The Beijing is currently starting.
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:48.760]   They try and just to basically call up and looking in the Egypt, just so people would
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.280]   eventually give up and go home.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.280]   But I don't see that happening.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:58.960]   The difference between Egypt and Iran is that in Egypt for the past few days, the police
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.040]   have disappeared for a couple of days.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.840]   And now they're starting to come back by police law control.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.560]   And now the army is running the nation in total to speak.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:14.320]   They're stationed in Cairo and other major cities, and they're making sure that looting
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.240]   and crime does not set.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.840]   So I think the average citizen in Egypt, highly respects the army, and they trust them
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.680]   much more than police forces that used to be, that are known to be like the right arm
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:27.680]   of the regime.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.160]   I have a question for Anas if you don't mind.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.160]   What do you think of these stories we're hearing that the police are actually out there looting
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.480]   themselves and some rumors that the police may have been the ones to open the doors at
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.000]   the prisoner at the prison?
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.320]   You know, there's apparently thousands of prisoners that escaped.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:50.640]   I think that's very likely because they want to set that care up.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.640]   They want to set that care.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:59.880]   They want citizens to want to end these protests so peace would be reinstated.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:04.760]   So at 30 plays it's an old tactic and now it's being used in Egypt and I bet it's been
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.320]   used countless times before.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:14.720]   I think a few fathers were over looting and attacking people.
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.720]   They were caught and they found police IDs with them.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:23.120]   So Anas, good to see you.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.280]   Thank you for joining us and giving us your perspective on a global voices online.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.280]   Thank you.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.240]   Excellent source for citizen journalism.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.440]   Thank you Anas.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:37.200]   I think you know there's some, you know, this is important from a technical point of
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.200]   view because of the cutting off of the Internet.
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.400]   Of course it's a big political story but I think from a technical point of view it's
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:49.800]   interesting especially since Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Susan Collins from I think
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.120]   from Florida proposed as...
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.440]   Collins is from the New England I believe.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.680]   Yeah, proposed this, yeah you might be right, proposed this Internet kill switch.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.120]   Yeah, S3480.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.680]   Now it was last Congress but they said they're going to bring it back in this Congress, is
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.680]   it?
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:04.680]   Yeah.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.960]   And it really, she's from Maine, that's right.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:12.560]   And it really does, this is a very dramatic example of why such legislation might be a
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.560]   really bad idea.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.520]   Well, it's a bad idea from the get go but it's funny to watch the chat room go on and
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.800]   on about ah it's not possible.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:23.640]   The fact of the matter is with this government and the kind of rules they've gotten play
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.640]   when it comes to...
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.400]   It's a lot easier if it's a totalitarian.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.120]   Well, yeah but at the same time let's put it this way.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.760]   They put out the word, and by the way there's a lot of black boxes on a lot of these major
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:38.720]   ISPs nowadays, especially like AT&T's got one over in San Francisco at that CIA headquarters
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:42.320]   and that crazy building on 2nd Street.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:48.000]   Anyway, say you're a CEO of one of the big companies and you have like a, you know, somebody
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.480]   calls you from Homeland Security and says shut down the...
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.480]   What are you going to do?
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.480]   What are you going to do?
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.480]   No.
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.720]   And then end up in Gitmo, I mean they throw you in jail.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:01.520]   But this Internet kill switch would, I presume effectively put a kill switch in each of these
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.160]   places and you wouldn't have to ask, you just say, you had the president, it would be the
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.080]   president without the court order or Congress.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:10.320]   There would be a box on the network and they just pushed the button.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.720]   And they would go to these boxes and it was essentially just shut down the machine.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.120]   A pretty hard press to think of a compelling security reason why you would want to do that.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.800]   Well, there are a lot of talking about that.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.840]   It's interesting that they bring it up right now, of course, like with horrible timing.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:24.840]   Why would they bring this up?
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.240]   It's such a bad, it's like the worst possible time.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.760]   You and Mubarak together at last, yeah.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.680]   But I mean, they're talking about how the details of this that they would use it for,
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.520]   things like if there was some kind of terrorist incident and they needed to shut down, like
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:45.160]   people were attacking the thing that keeps the Hoover Dam up and running and stuff.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.400]   They would need to shut down the network.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.880]   Well, yeah, I mean, definitely don't want Leo LePort on Comcast if somebody's attacking
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.400]   the Hoover Dam because boy, that could be trouble.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:57.480]   Well, there's, I agree with that theory, by the way, there could be some massive worm
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:02.360]   coming in, a stuck-snit kind of a something ruining the country and they had to reboot
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.360]   everything.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.160]   Well, it's, I think our internet reboot switch is a great idea.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.640]   This is the oldest excuse in the world, you know, that there's going to be some terrorist
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:15.560]   attacks that we have to shut down this, shut down that, you know, break into people's homes
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.640]   to steal information.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.480]   This has been going on since the beginning of time.
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:25.680]   And as much as I am concerned about terrorism, I would rather we put our energy into a shoring
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:29.120]   up the Hoover Dam so it's extremely difficult to make it happen.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.120]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.280]   Then shutting down the entire net and, you know, you know, better to be safe than sorry,
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.400]   Larry, better to be safe than sorry.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.800]   Gee, we're trying to disrupt American business.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.560]   Let's just shut down the internet.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.080]   Who's going to win that battle?
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.320]   The artist technical article on this was pretty good though.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:53.080]   You know, all the technical details of how potentially they actually did this in Egypt,
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.800]   you know, going into all the nuts and bolts of it.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.120]   But you know, they bring up the point at the end that how much more difficult it would
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:03.800]   be actually to do this in the United States simply because it's such a bigger country,
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:04.960]   you know, space wise.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.520]   We're not as centralized.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.520]   Right.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.520]   Right.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.160]   Everything in like European countries and in Egypt too is run through the capital city
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.360]   for the for the internet.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.920]   It sounds like whereas in the United States, it's, you know, all the different wires coming
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.440]   in from overseas that they have a bunch of different hubs that would have to basically
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.760]   do this all to it once.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:21.960]   It would take a lot more.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:26.360]   I remember when I was in Egypt, I believe that they said that there is basically one under
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:31.440]   sea cable going from the Mediterranean to Alexandria that connects the entire country.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.440]   So it isn't so difficult and it's nowhere near the complexity would be in the US.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.720]   You know, the interesting thing is when the internet was first created, the reason they
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.680]   did this distributed processing route around was to avoid.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.240]   We were worried about the Soviets, right?
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.960]   Cutting out our communication.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.840]   The whole concept of the internet is to avoid the ability for one country to basically cut
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.840]   it.
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.040]   Obviously, it can be done within that country.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.120]   We saw that this week.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.680]   That architecture is long gone.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.880]   It's a lot more centralized than it used to be.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.200]   There are only a few backbones.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.600]   There's a few interconnects.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.600]   I don't know.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.600]   I mean, this is a great article.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:10.920]   You're right, MG, a really good article in the Law and Disorder column of ours, Technica,
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:11.960]   speaking about how they do this.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:15.440]   I don't think it's, I don't think it's quite as easy here.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:20.320]   However, you know, doesn't mean people aren't going to debate the need for a kill switch.
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.520]   It just seems like a terrible idea.
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.280]   Larry, you said that people are finding ways to get online.
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.320]   You actually have an article on Larry's World about this.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.320]   Yeah, sure.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.160]   I mean, first of all, I don't even know if I own a dial-up modem.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.520]   I'm off to go look at my closet.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.680]   I know John has one, but I have a box.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.680]   A boxed one.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.240]   I think that Dennis Hayes autograph.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.240]   Yeah, he's autographed modem.
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.000]   I think I'm going to dust it off if I can find it because that's certainly one way they
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.600]   dialed into overseas ISPs.
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:53.000]   It's one way, Larry, but to be honest about it, I wonder if I could hook the thing up and
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.480]   actually remember how to use it.
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.640]   You know, it's hard to...
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.640]   I just remember...
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.640]   I'm not going to...
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.640]   I'm not going to...
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.400]   Well, part of it is you can use...
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.160]   You're able to use a cell phone too to be able to do it, right?
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.160]   There's a way that you put it.
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.160]   Well, the cell phone networks work.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.160]   You could, yeah.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.320]   And they do, of course, now.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:15.000]   And where I'm seeing tweets as we speak from people on the ground in Egypt that are out
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.800]   there again, tweeting through their cell phones.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.400]   By the way, why Edward Armoreau would never have succeeded in journalism today because
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:25.920]   I can't see him saying, "I'm seeing tweets as we speak coming in from all over the world."
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.720]   So what they're doing on these networks is CNN and all the rest of them just show tweets.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:33.160]   I can go to the computer and look at tweets on my own time.
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:37.320]   CBS this morning, they had a big tweet deck and they showed all the different feeds coming
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.320]   in.
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.480]   It was very impressive, of course.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:43.200]   But you know, if people are tweeting up from the ground, this one blogger, let me see
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.200]   if I can get his name.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:49.200]   Whale Abbas, he's a W-A-E-L-A-B-B-A-S.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.320]   And he's blogging from the ground, sending pictures.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.320]   And he was dark for a while, but he's back up.
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.680]   So there are people doing it.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:01.240]   And even during the time when it was supposedly banned, completely people were doing it.
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.440]   So as I said, you somehow get through.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.920]   Also, ham radio connections.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.360]   Yes, ham radio is going to be the saving grace of the whole thing.
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.360]   G-P-R-S, baby.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.360]   Yep.
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.520]   Point to point.
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.520]   No central server.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.920]   I just think it's really interesting that information has become like water.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.920]   It just will flow.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.680]   It will find the cracks and it will come out.
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.480]   You know, the thing that has to be done, by the way, and there's a bunch of hams that
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.920]   apparently listen to this podcast.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:25.920]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:33.120]   Is that there are basically throttle internet connectivity through the ham frequencies.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.920]   And I think that needs to change.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.880]   I mean, they should have faster bandwidth.
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:38.880]   It's very slow, right?
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:39.880]   It's like ridiculous.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.320]   But it's better than not.
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.400]   I mean, look, we're spoiled.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:48.120]   If there's a revolution, we won't be trying to watch Netflix.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.200]   That's not really the issue here.
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.560]   It's probably sufficient to send email.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.560]   And hams have been great in every disaster.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.240]   And it's clear because you can't create a barrier to a ham operator.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.320]   It's where they can try to jam their frequencies.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.320]   But it's point to point.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.520]   It's not going through a server.
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.280]   Kids learn Morse code.
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.280]   That's all I can say.
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:07.800]   We need that anymore for a life.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:08.800]   I know.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:09.800]   No, you don't.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.800]   But it's still handy.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.800]   It's still handy.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.000]   Thank you for directing me because, frankly, I was going to get the email.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:21.320]   So you never want to mess with a ham.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.080]   So anything else to talk about with this Egyptian story?
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.160]   Should we move on?
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.000]   I think it's a fascinating story.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   I think it's over-covered.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.840]   I think we should let us shake out a week.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:36.200]   And when you get back from Antarctica, we can talk about it more.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.600]   You love this and I'm going to Antarctica, don't you?
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.700]   Yeah, I like it.
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.000]   I think it's fascinating that this is on our beat.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.200]   I mean, those of us who are tech journalists--
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.200]   Finally.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.200]   --it was--
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.200]   Yeah, I mean, finally, we get to say--
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.520]   Finally, something to talk about other than Zuckerberg's sweatshirt.
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.160]   Although I have to say the president's state of the union was also on our beat.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.200]   He actually gave a talk down to technology issues.
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:59.440]   Yeah, and he YouTubed is-- I thought that was really interesting for the second year
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.440]   of Rome.
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:04.640]   He did a shout out to Facebook and Google, and he talked a lot about his fantasy that
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:09.540]   we're going to get 98% to high speed wireless internet access within five years.
[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:10.540]   Good luck.
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:11.540]   Fantastic.
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:14.940]   But he certainly painted a very optimistic picture of technology.
[00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:18.660]   And ironically, it was just right on the verge of what's happening in Egypt.
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:21.740]   Have you, by the way, John, are you going to Madrid for the Ford thing?
[00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:22.740]   I intend to get--
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:23.740]   Is that arranged?
[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:24.740]   I have a figure finish, the arrangements.
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:27.660]   OK, we're going to send a producer with you and a camera guy, if you don't mind.
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:28.660]   A camera guy?
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:31.100]   Well, you need a camera guy if you've got a camera.
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:32.100]   We could just send the camera.
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.900]   Oh, he said a producer and a camera guy?
[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:34.900]   Sure.
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:35.900]   We're going to send a producer and a camera guy.
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:36.900]   Hi, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.240]   I'm here, John Z to forward back to you, Leo.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.240]   Exactly.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.640]   Well, those of you that you want to throw back?
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.480]   I want you to go, this is Madrid.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.680]   I'm seeing tweets from all over talking about the new Ford focus.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.840]   What do you think of the new Ford?
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.840]   It's a Ford.
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:52.840]   It's Madrid.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.160]   And you know what?
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.160]   You don't get to see too many of those in Spain.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.160]   Oh, no, that's not--
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.160]   Oh, that's right.
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.160]   This is the international car.
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.160]   Ford is huge all over the world.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.160]   Yeah.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.160]   Is this your segue?
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.720]   No, I don't have a Ford to add today.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.720]   I'm actually--
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.720]   You know what I have today?
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.720]   You know what's coming up?
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:07.720]   I was going to play it up if it was your segue.
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.720]   You know what's coming up?
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:09.720]   Valentine's Day.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.720]   Mm.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.720]   Mm.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:12.720]   Oh, really?
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.460]   I wonder-- you know, there's funny thing about Valentine's Day.
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:19.180]   I'm always trying to figure out what to get.
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:22.020]   I've got somewhere for you to go, John.
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:27.620]   Somewhere that will help you and all the people listening today buy their sweethearts
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:30.300]   something very nice for Valentine's Day.
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:36.300]   I'm talking about ice.com, this portion of the tech guy, this portion of Twit.
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.300]   Whoo!
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.380]   It's brought to you by ice.com.
[00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:41.940]   Come in here, Eileen.
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:42.940]   Look at this.
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:47.620]   Eileen has brought with us, with her, some lovely jewelry from ice.com.
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:52.820]   How many guys listening or watching right now have ever messed up Valentine's Day?
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:53.820]   Come on, John.
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:54.820]   No, I never--
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:55.820]   I never--
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:56.820]   Larry, you have MG.
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:57.820]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:58.820]   You better not.
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:25:59.820]   Not me.
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:00.820]   I never liked it.
[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:01.820]   I've been watching that.
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:02.820]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.580]   The funny thing is, it's easy to get it right.
[00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:08.820]   Just give her a little ice.
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:09.820]   Jewelry is always welcome.
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.500]   Oh, I thought you meant ice.
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:12.500]   No.
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.500]   No actual jewelry.
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.500]   Oh, okay.
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:15.500]   It's always welcome.
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:19.180]   And at ice.com, you can get fine jewelry at very affordable prices.
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.100]   Diamondiering sapphire-- you want to see the sapphire bracelet?
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.100]   This is gorgeous.
[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.100]   You know, that's Larry--
[00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.100]   That's Larry.
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:25.100]   Yeah, I don't like looking to be.
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.100]   I mean, I think--
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.100]   That's gorgeous.
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:28.100]   Gorgeous.
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.100]   No sapphire bracelet.
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.100]   Larry, I'm a good--
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.100]   Oh, there we go.
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.100]   No, wait a minute.
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.100]   This is it.
[00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:34.100]   Here we go.
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.100]   Here's a sapphire bracelet.
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.100]   Look at this.
[00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.100]   Look at how hot it is.
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:38.100]   I want you to give me a MacBook Air for Valentine's.
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.100]   You're going to just shoot it.
[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.100]   No, because I got a camera.
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.100]   See, look at that.
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.100]   Look at that.
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.100]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:44.100]   That's pretty good.
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.100]   Let's see.
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.100]   This is the-- oh, I'm sorry.
[00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.100]   That's rubies.
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.100]   That's the rubies.
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:49.100]   That's the rubies.
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.100]   Could be red sapphire.
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.100]   Yep.
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.100]   They can trust you with that.
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.100]   They can fit Xs to you.
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.100]   Actually, we had to sign some sort of thing.
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.100]   Which is that one worth?
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:59.180]   It's going to be more affordable at Ice.com, as to be a trusted jewelry source online since
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.180]   1999.
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.900]   You're going to-- John, take it out of your pocket.
[00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:03.900]   Where'd it go?
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:07.460]   See, now John's got his Valentine's Day shopping all done, thanks to Ice.com.
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.260]   It was not paying for it.
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.740]   Yeah, it doesn't count if you don't pay for it.
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:16.940]   You know what John, I bet you, Mimi would love these beautiful diamond earrings.
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:17.940]   She'd actually like this.
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:18.940]   But she liked the rubies.
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:19.940]   It's pretty, isn't it?
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:20.940]   Isn't that gorgeous?
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.660]   I love rubies.
[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:25.020]   I gave my wife rubies after she had her first baby.
[00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.620]   It was to signify the blood that had been spilled.
[00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:30.620]   It was more like sapphire.
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:31.620]   It was sapphire.
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:32.620]   It was sapphire.
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.740]   Yeah, you should see what's behind you in the expression.
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.740]   I can see.
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.740]   Yeah, it was pretty bad.
[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:40.340]   Yeah, it went-- that's about how well it went over, too.
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:42.140]   Let me tell you.
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.900]   So now I think that's rubies.
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:44.900]   Here's a ruby pendant.
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:45.900]   Look at this.
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.740]   This is just gorgeous.
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:49.380]   Eileen wanted to model all these.
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:50.380]   What do you have?
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:51.380]   What are you wearing, Eileen?
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:52.380]   Okay, let me see the ring.
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:56.860]   This is a beautiful-- oh, black and white diamond ring.
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:57.860]   You don't see that.
[00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:00.500]   That's the diamond and the onyx.
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.540]   Ice.com, you can avoid them all.
[00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.340]   Get better value truthfully.
[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:08.740]   Better value, better quality jewelry purchases since 1999.
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:13.020]   And here's a special opportunity for Twitter listeners only, or viewers.
[00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:15.540]   They're giving you $25 to spend.
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.780]   No minimum purchase required.
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:20.580]   Anywhere across the site, $25.
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:23.820]   Go to ice.com/twit.
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:25.820]   Ice.com/twit.
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.420]   They told me that they did this.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.740]   They advertised on Twitter a while ago.
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:35.780]   And they said that Twitter listeners spent more than anybody they ever advertised with
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:36.780]   before.
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:39.620]   That's because none of us actually shop in real stores.
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:40.620]   It's exactly right.
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:41.620]   Yeah, right.
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:42.620]   Exactly.
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:45.260]   This is what geeks need.
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.700]   Get that Valentine's shop and done.
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:47.860]   I'll tell you what, don't wait.
[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:50.020]   Because I wait until February 13th.
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:51.020]   Thank you, Eileen.
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:54.420]   Eileen Rivera, my producer and our jewelry model.
[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:55.860]   You know, John's disappeared.
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:58.940]   And I don't know what-- do you know?
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:02.380]   Did he take one?
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:05.220]   Oh, man.
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.220]   Ice.
[00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:09.220]   I-C-E.com.
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:15.460]   We thank him for their support of this week in tech.
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.060]   John has actually wandered off.
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:19.060]   No, maybe we bored him.
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.780]   I don't know.
[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.780]   He's back.
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:23.780]   Moving on.
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.980]   I had to talk to the guy back there, your friend who is doing--
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:27.980]   Who are you talking to?
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.140]   Doing the new Quit Cottage.
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.700]   You should talk about it on the air a little bit.
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:31.700]   Oh, you're talking to Roger Ambrose.
[00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:32.700]   Well, you see in the video.
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:33.700]   He's in the video.
[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:35.540]   He's like a genius, isn't he?
[00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:36.540]   Yeah.
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:39.620]   No, he's a guy who did-- you're looking at me funny like you're making that up.
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:40.620]   No, he is a genius.
[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:41.860]   He's fantastic.
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.260]   He's the guy who did the screensaver sit.
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:44.260]   Remember that beautiful screensaver sit?
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:45.260]   That's the one they gouged him.
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:46.260]   With the arches?
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:47.260]   They gouged him?
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.260]   No, they gouged him.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:51.260]   No, he didn't gouge anybody that.
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.580]   Okay, tech live set.
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:54.580]   Remember that?
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:55.580]   Oh, that's the one they got.
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:56.580]   $1 million.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:57.580]   Yeah.
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:58.580]   Screensaver sit.
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:29:59.580]   Niceer set.
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:00.580]   Better set.
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:01.580]   Work better.
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:02.580]   $50,000.
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:03.580]   You're kidding.
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:04.580]   No, that's why Roger--
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:05.580]   It was the other guy that was the gouge.
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:06.580]   Yeah, oh yeah.
[00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.060]   We were the gouge, but it was tech live.
[00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:12.460]   So, you're telling me, Roger did that other set for $50,000?
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:13.460]   He did the beauty.
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:14.460]   Yes.
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:15.460]   Do you think I would hire--
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.460]   I'm charging it up.
[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:19.500]   You think I would hire the expensive guy?
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:20.500]   I'm not nuts.
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.660]   No, I mean, it was the best set ever.
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.300]   So, you saw the video.
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.300]   Yeah.
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.620]   It's on YouTube.
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:27.620]   You did?
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:28.620]   Did you really see it?
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:29.620]   Yeah.
[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:30.620]   The first walkthrough and stuff.
[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:31.620]   They've already done the demolition.
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:32.620]   Hey, you outside.
[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:33.620]   Hi, I'm Leo LaPorche.
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:34.620]   Come on.
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:35.620]   Let's go in, kids.
[00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:36.620]   Let's go in.
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:39.540]   I was doing my Bob Vila impression.
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:40.540]   And so, that was pre-demolition.
[00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:41.540]   We've already done the demolition.
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:42.540]   Where is this building?
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:43.540]   Two blocks down.
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:44.540]   You won't have any trouble.
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:46.780]   I'm going to be parking.
[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:52.740]   Netflix passes 20 million subscribers and reveals all.
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:54.380]   That was a great story, MG.
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:58.940]   We now finally know not only how much bandwidth Netflix uses, but which cable company is the
[00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.940]   best to use with Netflix?
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.440]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:08.100]   I love the way Netflix, you know, read Hastings has pretty good philosophy for putting information
[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:09.100]   out there.
[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:11.780]   You know, they put a lot of their internal slide decks out on the web and now they're
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:16.300]   doing things like this where they're calling out the best service providers.
[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:20.260]   You've got to figure this pissed the hell out of some of these service providers.
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:23.660]   Well, it definitely pissed the hell out of Clearwire because they were last there.
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:26.940]   But they do bring up the point that, of course, they're wireless only where they're compared
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.420]   to their wired counterparts.
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:29.420]   Yeah.
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:32.940]   I mean, to say a 4G network doesn't do as well as Comcast isn't telling me much.
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:38.500]   Number one was Charter Communications, Speaking of Tech TV, Paul Allen's old cable company.
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.500]   Yeah.
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:45.260]   Number two was, I can't quite read it, but it looks like Cox did pretty well.
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:46.260]   Everybody likes Cox.
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:50.780]   The cable monos showed that they had the, what?
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:51.780]   Nothing.
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:55.580]   The cable monos show that they had the chops.
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:57.580]   I just like saying that.
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:58.580]   It's an app here.
[00:31:58.580 --> 00:31:59.580]   Yeah.
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.900]   In fact, I upgraded to cable when I got Netflix.
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:08.180]   I got the Roku because they give you enough headroom to watch Netflix and, you know, twitting
[00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:11.700]   about 90 other things that seem, in fact, what's on the Roku as well?
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:12.700]   Yes.
[00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:13.700]   Absolutely.
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:14.700]   What you, my big television set.
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:15.700]   We're right next to it.
[00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:16.700]   You look good at 55 inches, Leo.
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:17.700]   Yeah.
[00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:18.700]   Well, John, not so much.
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:19.700]   You look great in the future.
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:21.980]   John, you look good.
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.540]   We're designed for the big screen.
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:25.540]   That's right.
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:30.780]   I think this was probably a little bit having to do with the net neutrality debate, right?
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:36.740]   I mean, that what was interesting is the best, this kind of blew me away.
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:40.100]   The best two were Canadian cable companies, Rogers.
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.900]   They've always had high speeds.
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.660]   Everybody in Canada complains bitterly about them.
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:45.660]   Yeah.
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:46.660]   Well, and they did--
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:47.660]   It's just life medicine.
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.820]   It works on broadband as well.
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:52.300]   It may, in fact, you know, they do bandwidth shaping.
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.300]   They admit it.
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:54.300]   They don't hide it.
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:59.820]   And it may, in fact, be that ironically why they did so well because they were doing bandwidth
[00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:03.460]   shaping and making sure Netflix got enough bandwidth to do the job.
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.740]   Rogers peaked out at three megabits pretty consistently.
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:10.980]   And so that was part of the test was you have to deliver the-- this surprised me.
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:16.140]   The highest quality Netflix stream was almost five megabits for HD.
[00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:17.140]   Wasn't it?
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:18.140]   Was something like that.
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.140]   Yeah.
[00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:23.940]   And three megabits was the best sustained throughput anybody did, and that was Rogers.
[00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:27.740]   Well, actually, we probably have speeds that beat that up at the house in Port Angeles.
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:28.740]   Of course, the--
[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:29.740]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:30.740]   You have something weird, though.
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:31.740]   You have some sort of strange connection.
[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:38.940]   The county's fiber, we have legally tapped into it.
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:44.780]   And as of with the new router, we're getting 180 megabits per second with just straight
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:45.780]   up.
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:46.780]   Wow.
[00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:47.780]   I'm sorry.
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.780]   I swear to god.
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:50.780]   I'm sorry.
[00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:51.780]   I swear to god.
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:52.780]   Geez.
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:53.780]   My mind froze.
[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:54.780]   That's the word.
[00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:56.780]   Now we know it's, you say 180, and then next thing you know is the O3.
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:57.780]   Oh, I know.
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:01.580]   Well, no, the issue I was trying to remember what the bandwidth caps are on Rogers.
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:04.620]   Because I think you can get three megabits sustained, but you can only watch for two
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:05.620]   hours.
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:08.380]   No, I'm sure it's-- but I think it's like 25 gigabytes.
[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:09.380]   A chat room.
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:12.820]   Is there a bandwidth cap on Rogers?
[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:14.820]   60 gigabytes.
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.380]   Yeah, a lot.
[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:17.380]   So--
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:18.660]   But that's the issue, right?
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:21.780]   You can get 250 on Comcast.
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.620]   It wouldn't be too hard to go blow through.
[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:31.300]   If you watched a movie a night at three megabits, it would be too hard to blow through 60 gigabytes.
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.220]   And then they throttle you.
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:37.460]   Rocklaw says he's got 125 gigs a month, but I think there's-- so there's different plans,
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:38.460]   I guess.
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:39.460]   Mm.
[00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:41.380]   60 gigs is two gigs a night.
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:44.140]   That's about one movie.
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:45.140]   Something like that.
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:46.340]   Shaw, the cap, is 135.
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:51.340]   So they have more caps there.
[00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:52.340]   Anything else to say about that?
[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:53.340]   Yeah, I think there's pop pictures dropping.
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:56.340]   Any other conclusions with that?
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:57.340]   With my brain freeze?
[00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:58.340]   Yeah, that brain freeze.
[00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:01.780]   It was kind of interesting while looking at you.
[00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:02.780]   Stroke.
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:08.180]   One of the posts they talk about during the live call, I think Netflix didn't dispute
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:12.060]   the fact that at peak hours, they can take up as much as 20%.
[00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:13.580]   Yeah, that's amazing, isn't it?
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:14.580]   Total internet traffic.
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:15.580]   I thought it was more than that.
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.780]   It's probably is more than that.
[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:23.740]   If they keep doing that, obviously the ISPs are going to get involved and try and try
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:28.220]   and do something to make them pay or to make us pay more for that.
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:32.700]   And that's already been an issue, of course, with them being indirectly asked to pay.
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:33.700]   Yeah, right.
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:34.700]   A conquest.
[00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:37.980]   And that came up conveniently during the middle of the net neutrality debate.
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.580]   Since we have all these people here who are into this, what does everybody out there
[00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.620]   see as the best box?
[00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:49.820]   A Roku box or an Apple TV box or a boxy?
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:50.820]   Google TV.
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:52.780]   Or the Google TV, which is dead, I believe.
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:53.780]   He's a crap.
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:54.780]   And the other computer.
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:58.700]   You can also do this through an Xbox 360.
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:04.780]   You know, Veronica Belmont did a table on Tekzilla, a kind of user created a table,
[00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:11.700]   not a coffee table, a spreadsheet, of all the different boxes and their capabilities.
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:15.860]   And there's only one thing that does everything that's a computer.
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:19.180]   Everything else, there's holes somewhere.
[00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:22.460]   So you kind of have to say, there's no answer, in other words, John, you have to ask, what
[00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:23.820]   do you want to watch?
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:27.140]   If you want to watch iTunes, you have to have Apple TV.
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:32.540]   If you want to watch, to me, if you watch Netflix and you watch Amazon and you want to
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:34.820]   watch Twit, I think the Roku is nothing better than the Roku.
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:35.980]   I agree with you, Leo.
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:36.980]   I have a Roku.
[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:37.980]   In fact, I've got two of them.
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:38.980]   Especially the price.
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:39.980]   And they're inexpensive.
[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:43.180]   I've got one in my bedroom, one in my living room.
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:45.660]   For a while there, I had a Windows PC hooked up to the TV.
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:46.660]   And it's true.
[00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:50.260]   I could watch a lot more, but the aspect ratio was never right.
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:51.260]   The hassle.
[00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:52.260]   Too complicated.
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:55.660]   Google TV, again, it's not quite ready for prime time.
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:58.340]   I've got the review box from Logitech.
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:02.900]   I think that the Roku for right now is a good solution.
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:08.620]   The interesting one will be, I think when Xbox 360 is getting ready to add ESPN content,
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:13.740]   so it'll be the first one with that right out of the box, that could be huge for millions
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:16.540]   of people who are going to want that content, of course.
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:20.620]   And if you have a console, you already have the ability to watch.
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.860]   In most cases, Netflix and Amazon.
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:26.740]   So don't go out and buy anything if it's already got an Xbox or a PlayStation 3.
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.820]   I think even the Wii supports video streaming.
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:34.580]   If you want to see the Veronica's table, it's bit.ly/settop.
[00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:37.020]   S-E-T-T-O-P.
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:41.540]   And you just get some idea of how crazy it is.
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:44.380]   Google TV is the first column, Roku is the second column.
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:50.260]   And just the capabilities, the things it can do and can't do, the gaps.
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:51.540]   What kind of video codecs?
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:54.460]   I can't imagine a consumer ever.
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:59.900]   If they do look at this just being frozen, oh my god, what should I do?
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.020]   It's just not clear.
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:06.420]   But I have to say, the easiest thing to do is just say, get a Roku box.
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:10.620]   If you want to watch Apple TV, get an Apple TV.
[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:14.060]   That was actually in the same Netflix earnings call.
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:17.660]   They did actually talk about how there was so much hype that Netflix was going to be
[00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:21.460]   on the iPad when it came out with an app or whatever.
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:25.740]   But they said the new Apple TV with Netflix built in has already blown past what the iPad
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:27.740]   was saying in terms of streaming.
[00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:29.780]   It's easy to see the iPad.
[00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:32.940]   Up until last week, I used to watch movies a lot on my iPad.
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:34.580]   You were the only one.
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:38.740]   Then I got my 11-inch Mac Air and I actually prefer watching them on the Mac Air.
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:39.740]   Then I do the iPad.
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:40.740]   Is there anybody else who...
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:41.740]   It stands up naturally?
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:42.740]   It stands up.
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:43.740]   It's like got the right key.
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:45.420]   It's a good app that creates you.
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:46.780]   I just actually just like it better.
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.900]   I haven't actually used the iPad since I got the Air.
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:51.060]   I'm watching a movie.
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.700]   My arms are killing me.
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:53.700]   Right.
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:54.700]   See here...
[00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:56.380]   I like the MacBook Air a lot.
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:59.300]   I think it's kind of to me that's the best computer really.
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.300]   It's just fantastic.
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:01.300]   I'm watching one now.
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:02.300]   Are you watching one now?
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:03.300]   Do you have the 11-inch?
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.300]   Yeah, I like the 11-inch.
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:06.300]   Yeah, I got both.
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:07.300]   This is the 11.
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:08.300]   Shut up.
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:09.300]   I'm going to buy the...
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:10.300]   No, it's a longer Apple.
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:11.300]   Let me borrow it.
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:12.300]   They did?
[00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:13.300]   Compare the two.
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:14.300]   Yeah.
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.300]   Apple let you borrow it.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:16.300]   John, maybe a few, they would let you borrow.
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:17.300]   Let's try it.
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:18.820]   See here's the 13, if you've got a shot of that.
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:19.820]   All right, well, why is there?
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:20.820]   You've got two of them.
[00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:22.220]   You have two MacBook Airs?
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:23.660]   Well, yeah, but they're going back.
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:24.660]   They're on loan.
[00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:25.660]   That's what you say.
[00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:27.420]   Unless Leo gives me one.
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:28.420]   Oh, that'll be the day.
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:30.300]   I'm not giving away heirs to anybody.
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:31.300]   Stop it.
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:32.300]   That's right.
[00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:33.500]   I got to buy one.
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.500]   You can afford it, Larry, with your salary.
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:36.500]   What are you doing?
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:39.140]   You don't use a Hillsborough or something in a big mansion.
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:40.140]   Palo Alto, come on, come on.
[00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:41.580]   Palo Alto, holy crap.
[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:44.340]   That's pretty expensive.
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.620]   I don't live in Steve Jobs's neighborhood.
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:49.220]   A little further south of that.
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:52.580]   I still use a Zenith Super Sport.
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:53.860]   Oh, shut up.
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:54.860]   Is it really?
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:56.300]   Here's the Netflix graph.
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:57.740]   It's kind of hard to--
[00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:58.260]   Extract.
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.260]   No, always steal material.
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:00.620]   That's what the chat room's for.
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:02.980]   It's kind of hard to extract this information.
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:04.620]   That's pretty different.
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:06.500]   But Clear Wire is that red line at the bottom,
[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:10.500]   able to sustain about 1.4 megabits.
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:11.500]   You know what?
[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:12.740]   For 3G or 4G, that ain't bad.
[00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:13.740]   I'll take it.
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:17.980]   Interestingly enough, Netflix admitted to using about a gigabyte
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:19.140]   an hour.
[00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:21.540]   What speed do you absolutely have to have minimum
[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:23.380]   to make the Netflix work?
[00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:24.940]   Well, what is smart?
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:27.460]   It has steps down.
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:28.900]   Yeah, it's no sense.
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:31.460]   Your quality will go down, but I think a megabit and a half
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:33.460]   should be more than enough to watch HD material.
[00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:35.380]   You know, I have more than 20 megabits through Comcast,
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:37.180]   and it still steps down sometimes.
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.180]   I'm not quite sure why.
[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:41.180]   Well, that's the point they're making is that, you know,
[00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:44.940]   when they say 20 megabits, it's not sustained.
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:46.140]   This has to be sustained.
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.140]   Right.
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:48.140]   Right.
[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:49.140]   And so that's what you're really looking at.
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:50.940]   And you see some of these, like Clear Wire, up and down,
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:52.140]   and up and down, and up and down.
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:53.540]   They can't sustain it.
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:55.220]   So what you're looking for is something that's got it
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:56.380]   fairly consistent.
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:59.180]   I'd say if you had two megabytes consistently,
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:00.980]   as this is Verizon in the middle there,
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:03.180]   that would be more than adequate, I think,
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:05.340]   for high-def content.
[00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.380]   What I also was an interesting revelation is that
[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:09.940]   Netflix will use quite a bit more if it's available,
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:11.940]   just that nobody makes it available.
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:14.740]   No, that's a good thing about having your own fiber.
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:17.940]   So do you watch, do you stream Netflix movies?
[00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:21.020]   Every, we've opened the house in the Port Angeles.
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:22.860]   We've dropped cable completely.
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:24.140]   You shouldn't need it.
[00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:26.340]   And they use, they've just watched stuff on Netflix,
[00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:28.500]   and then they also buy programming,
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:31.340]   occasionally for some shows that they want to watch.
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:34.580]   Wall Street Journal says Hulu has decided,
[00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:37.540]   or is at least thinking of,
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:39.540]   changing what they do.
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:43.300]   Do you, I'm sure MG, you seem like a Hulu user.
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:45.740]   You know, I do every once in a while,
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:47.660]   but not that often, mostly because it hasn't been
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.580]   really available on any of the set-top boxes.
[00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:51.580]   Of course, it's coming out now with the Hulu Plus stuff,
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:53.660]   but it sounds like from that article that they're
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:55.660]   totally trying to pivot what they're doing,
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:59.220]   when they're going to become a cable provider,
[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:01.620]   but just online version, and you'll pay a monthly fee.
[00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:04.540]   It's really interesting that when Hulu first launched,
[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:05.940]   everyone was talking about how it was either going to be
[00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:07.940]   an iTunes killer or a YouTube killer,
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:09.540]   but now it's something totally different
[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:11.580]   that Netflix is their main competition.
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:13.940]   And at the time, Netflix was just doing DVDs by mail,
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:15.060]   so no one saw that.
[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:16.700]   But now that's their main competition,
[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.140]   so they totally have to change their structure,
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:20.540]   and they're getting so much pushback from the networks
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:22.140]   who own big chunks of the thing,
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:25.540]   and they're still giving their content to iTunes and to Netflix.
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:27.820]   So it's like, there's really a lot going on there.
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:32.180]   - Now remember, Hulu is first a company,
[00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:36.060]   and then they use content from NBC,
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:40.460]   I mean, I'm sorry, cable, cable co with a K.
[00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:41.300]   - Cable town.
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:42.260]   - Cable town with a K.
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:44.820]   Walt Disney News Corp,
[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:47.100]   but Walt Disney and NBC and News Corp
[00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:48.820]   seemed to wanna do something different
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:51.700]   than the owners of Hulu wanna do.
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:53.500]   - And of course, I think Disney,
[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.340]   like so Disney, which owns ABC,
[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:56.620]   is even they were talking about,
[00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:57.900]   they've developed their own thing,
[00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:00.540]   and then of course Disney's largest shareholders,
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:04.100]   Steve Jobs, of course they wanna work with iTunes on that stuff.
[00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.980]   But yeah, the only one not doing anything with them
[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.620]   has been CBS, and they've stood on the sidelines,
[00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:11.740]   and it seems like maybe that was the right play now,
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:13.420]   considering how tumultuous.
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:14.380]   - It just seems like-- - It's just NBC
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:16.660]   on a chunk of Hulu, I thought they owned like--
[00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:19.380]   - They all are partnering in order to get the content,
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:21.380]   guys, they're partners, but that's the problem,
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:22.980]   is that there's no controlling partner,
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:24.660]   and so there's this battle going on.
[00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:26.500]   But if Hulu turns into a cable channel,
[00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:27.700]   that's they've lost me.
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.060]   I pay for Hulu Plus right now,
[00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:30.900]   and it's really marginal.
[00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:31.900]   - What do you think?
[00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:33.780]   - I think it was $10 a month,
[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:34.780]   and I think it's now eight bucks.
[00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:37.100]   - Yeah, I tried it out for a couple of weeks,
[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:38.500]   and I just wasn't that impressed,
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:40.900]   and I'm paying for Netflix happily,
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:42.580]   I have the $8 program,
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:45.140]   I just don't even bother with DVDs anymore.
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:46.740]   - By the way, that's another thing Roku does,
[00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:48.500]   it does Hulu Plus as well.
[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:50.460]   - Oh, it does. - Yeah, so that's a pretty--
[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:53.340]   I think that's a pretty compelling combination, actually.
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:56.180]   You get Amazon so I can buy and rent movies,
[00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:59.420]   everything that's on iTunes is on Amazon, pretty much.
[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:01.220]   - And it stays in your locker, you can access it.
[00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:02.420]   - It's key forever, yeah.
[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:03.260]   - Which I really don't--
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:05.060]   I mean, it's in the cloud,
[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:06.220]   if you can't watch it on airplanes,
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:07.700]   but if you get to a hotel room,
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.340]   you can watch it or wherever you happen to be.
[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:10.180]   - Right.
[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:12.380]   - Hmm.
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:14.620]   - If they do, who wants Hulu?
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:16.100]   Who wants another cable channel?
[00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:18.340]   - Who are the Roku guys show up?
[00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:20.660]   I mean, they show it up and took over the place.
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:21.940]   There's been a bunch of other guys
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:22.940]   that have tried to do this,
[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:24.540]   they do it all wrong, they make a mistake.
[00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:26.300]   - I'll tell you what they did right.
[00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:29.860]   These guys, Roku originally made a slim,
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:31.300]   it was called a slim player, right?
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:33.940]   Something like that, it was a streaming music box.
[00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:35.020]   That was actually very cool,
[00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:36.580]   but only geeks would really care about it.
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:38.420]   You'd have, it was a way of getting the music
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:42.700]   on your computer over to your stereo system via wifi.
[00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.660]   And I think the thing they did right is they said,
[00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:46.740]   we need to make a simple box,
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:49.580]   here's the premise, I gotta connect my TV to the internet.
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:51.100]   Everybody's doing complicated stuff,
[00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:52.580]   we need to make a simple box,
[00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:54.860]   it's gotta be under a hundred bucks,
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:56.420]   99.99 as a turn down.
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:58.220]   - That's for the high end one though, they haven't 50 bucks.
[00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:00.500]   - But initially, it was $99.
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:02.700]   They only had one, now they've branched down.
[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.620]   It's gotta be able to get, hook up to the TV,
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:05.420]   hook up to the internet,
[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:06.940]   it's gotta be dead simple to use.
[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:09.460]   - I think it is idiot proof, it takes seconds to hook up.
[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:12.380]   I mean, you put the HDMI cable in there,
[00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:16.060]   you tell it your wifi security code and you're done.
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:17.620]   - No, essentially all there is to it.
[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:18.700]   - Okay, well compare that.
[00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:20.780]   - And they got Netflix.
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:22.140]   - Right, and Netflix, you're not.
[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:22.980]   - You're not gonna do Netflix.
[00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:23.820]   - Right, that was the suit.
[00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:26.380]   - Compare that to the boxy box, piece of crap.
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:27.580]   - Well, what did boxy do wrong?
[00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:29.380]   - Actually, I was early on in the game.
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:30.780]   I love the boxy software,
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.500]   I think the boxy software on a PC is better
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:34.580]   than the boxy box, but boxes haven't,
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:36.380]   all of these boxes are like the Google box,
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:38.300]   the reason they're having trouble is the networks
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.380]   are blocking them.
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:42.140]   What good is it if you can't watch TV on it?
[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:42.980]   You know, the idea.
[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:44.340]   - You could surf the web on a Google TV
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:45.340]   if you really want to.
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:47.540]   - But as soon as you get to ABC.com.
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:48.620]   - Right, you can't get there.
[00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:49.940]   - You can't get there.
[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:52.900]   As soon as you go to NBC.com, the content's gone.
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:54.660]   - That's why I keep a laptop in my living room.
[00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:58.020]   If I really wanna go online while I'm watching TV,
[00:45:58.020 --> 00:45:59.340]   I usually have a laptop handy.
[00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:01.700]   - So do you feel, have we answered your question, John?
[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:02.540]   Do you feel?
[00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:05.100]   - I just want people out there to know what to buy.
[00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:06.500]   - Sucks right now, basically.
[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:09.220]   But whatever you do, I bought, I have them all.
[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:12.100]   My poor wife, I'm leaving, I had to write her a manual.
[00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:13.740]   - Where are you going?
[00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:16.100]   - Oh, you keep wanting me to talk about this.
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:16.940]   - Just ask it.
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:17.940]   - I'll tell you, I'll tell you a second,
[00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:19.060]   but let me finish this thought.
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:20.820]   So I'm leaving, I'm going to be going for three weeks,
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:22.020]   which is ridiculous. - Wow.
[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:23.020]   - Yeah.
[00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:25.340]   And well, thank God for people like Tom Maris.
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:26.620]   - Oh, Maris, Gary and everybody.
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:27.940]   Well, because we got good people in here,
[00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:30.380]   we can do a great job, he'll be doing a tweet next week.
[00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:33.300]   But I had it, my wife said,
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:35.860]   don't leave without telling me how to use a TV.
[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:37.300]   - 'Cause you can't watch TV.
[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:38.140]   - Well, you're so excited.
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:39.660]   - So you had a right of husband. - So manual.
[00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:41.580]   - You've actually had to write a manual
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:43.340]   how to, for your own house.
[00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:44.700]   - You know why I have one on you?
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:46.540]   - Yeah, of course you do, Larry, 'cause there's seven--
[00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:48.780]   - I have stickers, I have stickers on the different boxes.
[00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:50.660]   For example, if you wanna watch a DVD,
[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:52.420]   you've gotta watch it through the PlayStation.
[00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:55.340]   But you have to turn on the audio system and set that.
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:56.980]   And my daughter came in one time a couple years ago,
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:47:00.100]   says, "Daddy, all I wanna do is watch television."
[00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:01.900]   Oh no, funny, you've gotta take this course first.
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:03.980]   - No, you can't just watch television.
[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:05.220]   That's the problem.
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:08.460]   So yeah, there's seven HDMI inputs on this TV
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.220]   and they're all occupied.
[00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:15.220]   Boxybox, Google TV, Apple TV, Roku box, Xbox 360,
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:19.220]   DVD player, and cable box.
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:21.620]   - I think an HDMI switcher would probably be what you needed.
[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:23.420]   - Well no, no, no, that's the worst.
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:25.020]   There's another button you have to push.
[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:27.260]   At least all seven are connected.
[00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:29.220]   - How often do you watch DVD, Leo?
[00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:30.740]   - I watched one last night.
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:32.300]   - I hardly ever watched them anymore.
[00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:34.780]   - Well I watched a lot more Netflix streaming.
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:36.060]   - I watch a lot more Netflix streaming,
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:37.460]   but everyone's well in Netflix has a movie
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.380]   that I really wanna watch that you can't,
[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:41.300]   well I watched "Nowhere Boy" yesterday,
[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:42.420]   but it was in a piece of crap.
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:43.340]   - Why did you watch it then?
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:44.180]   - If it's a piece of crap.
[00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:45.740]   - Well I didn't know, it seemed like a good idea.
[00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:46.820]   The idea-- - Can't you figure it out
[00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:48.380]   within the first five minutes of the movies?
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:49.660]   - No, I did, and that's the problem.
[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:51.220]   I thought maybe it'll get better.
[00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:52.380]   The premise was it's John--
[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:53.220]   - Never get better.
[00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:54.500]   - Listen to this.
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:55.340]   - Well the trailer was good.
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:58.220]   John Lennon's growing up, the youth,
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:01.380]   his John, the youth of John Lennon as he's growing up
[00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:03.420]   and he meets Paul McCar--
[00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:04.940]   I mean that's a great premise for a movie.
[00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:05.780]   - Is it?
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:06.980]   - Yeah, it was a terrible movie.
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:07.820]   You know what's gonna--
[00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:09.140]   - My favorite thing on the Netflix people
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:09.980]   with television shows.
[00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:11.300]   - You know how it's an old movie,
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:14.100]   a bad movie, when it comes on it says
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:17.900]   funded by the UK Council,
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:19.340]   and then underneath it says
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:23.420]   distributing lottery funds for television production.
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:26.260]   - And that's when I knew this isn't gonna be good.
[00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:27.500]   I'm sorry, go ahead Larry.
[00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:29.740]   - No, I'm watching a lot of old television shows.
[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:31.300]   We're gonna debunk every watch--
[00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:32.180]   - Monk's a great show.
[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:33.020]   - Yeah.
[00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:33.860]   - It's great enough.
[00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:34.500]   - And so on there, I'm gonna see
[00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:35.980]   'cause they're all wearing a season two right now.
[00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:37.220]   And I never would have discovered that.
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:40.700]   I mean if it hadn't been free on Netflix with by Roku,
[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:42.540]   I never would have thought you'd have existed.
[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:44.020]   - I'm watching a-- - Trying to keep up.
[00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:46.460]   - I'm watching a crappy British show called Doc Martin.
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:47.860]   - Oh Doc Martin's not crappy.
[00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:49.260]   It's one of those shows on television.
[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:50.420]   - It never would have heard of it.
[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:51.260]   - It's a terrific show.
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:52.740]   - But it's on, it's streaming on Netflix.
[00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:53.580]   - It's great.
[00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:55.020]   - I think the new season starts in a few weeks.
[00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:56.060]   - So you're a Doc Martin fan.
[00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:56.900]   - Yeah.
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:57.900]   - It's not about shoes by the way.
[00:48:57.900 --> 00:48:58.740]   - No.
[00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:00.180]   - It's about a misogynist, not misogynist,
[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:01.020]   a misanthropic.
[00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:02.180]   - It's a grouchy, all-ropic.
[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:03.340]   - He's perfect for me to watch.
[00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:05.340]   - I get a lot of material from the show.
[00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:06.380]   - He's a doctor.
[00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:07.220]   But this is it.
[00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:08.860]   He's like a really good doctor.
[00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:09.860]   He's like house.
[00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:10.700]   He's like-- - Just like me, yeah.
[00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:12.500]   - He's a brilliant diagnostician.
[00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:14.180]   But he has the worst bedside manner.
[00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:16.100]   He's so mean and rude.
[00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:17.300]   And it's a great premise for a movie.
[00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:18.140]   And he's up in--
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:19.180]   - That's well written.
[00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:22.260]   Actually, you know what, the King's Speech was funded by the UK Film Council.
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:23.620]   - Now you're going lottery weddings.
[00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:24.460]   - It's not a re-wedge out.
[00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:25.460]   - Yeah, so I take it back.
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:26.460]   Then that's a good movie.
[00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:28.300]   - That's considered really best by all the excellent movie.
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:30.220]   - Brilliant movie.
[00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:31.060]   - Okay.
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:32.140]   - If you want to watch something good, by the way,
[00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:33.780]   talking about television, try to catch up.
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:34.820]   And they just ran, unfortunately,
[00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:38.660]   they just ran their retrospective on the first three episodes.
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:41.740]   It's a show on Showtime called episodes.
[00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:42.580]   - Yes.
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:43.420]   Is that good?
[00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:44.260]   I've seen it. - It's hilarious.
[00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:45.100]   - It confuses the hell out of me
[00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:46.940]   'cause I'll go to my cable box
[00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:48.860]   and I'll say episodes, episode one.
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:49.700]   And I think, what is it?
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:50.540]   What?
[00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:52.340]   Is that a typo? - It's impossible to find it
[00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:55.900]   because of the name, Google episodes, you're never finding it.
[00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:56.740]   - That's a terrible thing.
[00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:57.700]   What's it about?
[00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:59.700]   - It's actually about these two British writers
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:01.180]   who have this hot show. - Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:04.980]   - They go to Hollywood and they run into the bunch of lying,
[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:06.260]   typical Hollywood--
[00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:07.100]   - Sleeze bags.
[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:08.940]   - Sleeze balls and douche bags.
[00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:09.900]   And it's hilarious.
[00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:10.740]   - How am I going to watch that?
[00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:12.060]   - I saw the first episode.
[00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:12.900]   - Episode one.
[00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:14.580]   - Episode one is available online.
[00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:15.420]   - Yeah.
[00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:16.900]   - Three and four tonight, so you might want to--
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:18.620]   - Oh, it just started.
[00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:19.660]   - Very exciting.
[00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:23.660]   - So you interrupted me interrupting you,
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:25.740]   which was you were talking about some place you're going
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:27.500]   to be three weeks.
[00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:29.340]   - It's funny 'cause I'm not supposed to talk about this,
[00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:30.180]   by the way.
[00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:31.020]   - What?
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:32.300]   - 'Cause they think it scares the advertisers
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:34.300]   if I say I'm gonna be gone for three weeks.
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:35.140]   - Why?
[00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:37.460]   The advertisers are probably do well with you gone
[00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:39.580]   for three weeks because you got--
[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:40.420]   (laughing)
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:41.820]   No, I'll tell you why.
[00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:43.260]   - You better, you better with the best.
[00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:44.420]   - I'm gonna save it, I'm gonna save it.
[00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:45.300]   - I think fast, John C.
[00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:48.860]   - It's because Merit and everybody else who works here
[00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:51.540]   knows how great you are at selling stuff
[00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:52.740]   that they will overdo it
[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:54.620]   and they're gonna actually bonus the advertisers.
[00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:56.700]   - Actually, it's actually true.
[00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:58.300]   They do, you know what we've looked at,
[00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:00.420]   well, it's not that they're concerned the ads will be bad.
[00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:02.420]   They're concerned that the audience won't listen,
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:05.340]   but we've looked at downloads and Tom, people love Tom.
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:06.180]   - Tom is great.
[00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:09.020]   - The ratings go up when he's on, so it's absolutely not.
[00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:10.820]   - Probably not on this show so much, but maybe.
[00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:12.020]   - Well, it's hard for this show
[00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:13.620]   to have better ratings than it already has.
[00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:15.340]   - Yeah, Tom is, we actually,
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:17.220]   everybody in the world already listens to this show.
[00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:20.620]   - I'm actually surprised that Tom works as hard as he does.
[00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:22.940]   - Okay, let me think about that.
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:23.780]   Why are you surprised?
[00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:26.740]   - Why is every question I have, some sort of a,
[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:27.940]   a John Nundrum dude.
[00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:28.980]   - It's giving me a stroke.
[00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:31.220]   I don't know what's going on, I can't actually,
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:32.420]   I can't actually think with you in the room.
[00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:33.740]   - If you don't want to talk about where you're going.
[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:38.620]   - I am going on a three week trip to Patagonia.
[00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:39.460]   - What?
[00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:40.620]   - Patagonia.
[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:42.620]   - Isn't that a bar in the South Florida, Sam, and says,
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:44.340]   "I think it's a catalog."
[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:45.740]   That's what they call this region.
[00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:48.980]   So I'm flying to, Tuesday, I'm flying to Buenos Aires.
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:49.820]   - Oh.
[00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:51.020]   - I'm gonna eat steak galore.
[00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:52.300]   - Oh, they have great meat now.
[00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:53.300]   - Great meat, great meat.
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:54.140]   - Great meat.
[00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:57.540]   And I've heard excellent dulce de leche ice cream.
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:51:58.580]   - That wouldn't surprise me.
[00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:00.820]   - In fact, there apparently is some sort of competition
[00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:03.220]   in Buenos Aires for the best dulce de leche.
[00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:05.700]   And I would like to be a judge.
[00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:08.060]   I'm going down there, I'll tell you.
[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:10.020]   And then, so, and then I get on a couple of days
[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:12.140]   in Buenos Aires, because I just wanted to wander around a little.
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:13.300]   - Everybody loves Buenos Aires.
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:15.620]   - Supposed to be the Paris of the '50s.
[00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:17.140]   - Right, right.
[00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:19.700]   - And by the way, apparently a lot of Italian speakers,
[00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:20.900]   as well as Spanish speakers.
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:23.740]   - Oh, there's Italians in Brazil and Argentina,
[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:24.580]   tons of them.
[00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:27.460]   In fact, some of the best for your foodies out there,
[00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:30.300]   some of the best faux parmesan cheese
[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:32.380]   is actually made in Argentina.
[00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:34.420]   - I'm gonna ask for some faux parmesan.
[00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:36.540]   - Well, they call it parmesan, so.
[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:38.460]   - Fáramre de la Argentina.
[00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:40.380]   And then I'm gonna get on a boat.
[00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:43.020]   And that boat is gonna go down to the Falkland Islands,
[00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:45.620]   where I am going to declare the sovereignty
[00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:48.980]   of the Argentinian people and start another war.
[00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:51.860]   And no, actually I'm gonna go see the Penguin Rookeries,
[00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:52.860]   which I'm very excited about.
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:53.700]   - In the Falklands?
[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:54.540]   - The Falklands.
[00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:55.380]   - Okay.
[00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:56.220]   - I might buy some wool.
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:57.060]   - Take pictures.
[00:52:57.060 --> 00:52:57.980]   - Of course I'm gonna take pictures.
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:01.100]   And then we sail through the tiara del Fuego
[00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:03.860]   to a Shaya, Ushaya, Argentina,
[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:06.220]   and then the fjords and the Beagle Channel.
[00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:07.820]   - Yeah, okay, where we just get to the arena.
[00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:10.420]   And then at Punta Arenas, I'm gonna take a plane
[00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:11.380]   to Antarctica.
[00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:12.220]   - Why?
[00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:13.380]   - Walk around.
[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:14.220]   See if there's anything there.
[00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:15.500]   - They just drop you off in a parachute
[00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:16.900]   and means you're placed a land there?
[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:18.460]   - Yeah, we're going to Fry Base,
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:21.940]   which is the Chilean Air Force's base in Antarctica.
[00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:23.180]   And we'll wander around, take more pictures.
[00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:24.780]   - Do you need a special visa to go there?
[00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:28.060]   - I think so, there's all sorts of stuff.
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:29.940]   I'm gonna declare it Leo land.
[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:31.700]   - So you're gonna go to Antarctica.
[00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:32.540]   - Yeah.
[00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:33.380]   - Okay.
[00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:34.220]   - That's my seventh continent, by the way.
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:35.220]   Have you been to all seven continents?
[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:36.060]   - No.
[00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:37.380]   I have not been to Antarctica.
[00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:38.780]   I mean either, that's why.
[00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:40.820]   It was my goal to hit seven before 70.
[00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:43.700]   - Mm-hmm, well, you made it.
[00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:45.220]   - I made it, barely.
[00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:47.660]   And then from there we go through Cape Horn, by the way.
[00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:50.020]   Well, I know you're wearing your Cape Horn jacket.
[00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:50.860]   - Yes.
[00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:52.140]   - There's very rough seas there.
[00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:52.980]   - I heard that.
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:53.820]   - Yes.
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:55.180]   - I've seen Cape Horn or I just Cape a good hope,
[00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:56.020]   one of the two.
[00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:57.100]   - One of them, I'm gonna go up and around
[00:53:57.100 --> 00:54:02.100]   and then up the side there, Chile, gonna stop in Chile.
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:05.260]   We're gonna, the cruise ends in Santiago.
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:08.780]   And I'm gonna take a plane from Santiago to Cusco,
[00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:11.220]   actually first to Lima, then I think a planar train.
[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:12.620]   - Lima, Lima's fun.
[00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:13.540]   - He's into the great town.
[00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:14.380]   - Oh, I love to see him.
[00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:15.220]   - I'm looking forward to it.
[00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:16.060]   - Just walk around.
[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:17.220]   - You're gonna go up into Mount full town.
[00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:18.420]   - Yeah, I'm going to Machu Picchu.
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:19.820]   - Well, I'm gonna tell you right now,
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:21.740]   no matter what they tell you, chew the coca leaves.
[00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:22.860]   - Oh, I'm gonna chew the coca leaves.
[00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:24.020]   I'm gonna drink the coca tea.
[00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:25.380]   Somebody sent me an email, so no.
[00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:26.580]   - And also there's a pill you should tell me.
[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:28.020]   - They said, "Hi, Eldridge."
[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:29.300]   - Yeah, I have that pill.
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:30.180]   I got that pill.
[00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:34.820]   I went to my doctor, I said, "Give me the pill." He said, "Okay."
[00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:37.140]   Four hours later, I was back in the hospital.
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:38.580]   No, it's a diuretic.
[00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:41.020]   They said, "The problem is that the high altitude
[00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:42.580]   "is your brain swells."
[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:45.900]   And so you get a brain edema or whatever.
[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:48.220]   - Well, it makes you get terrible headaches if you get
[00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:50.780]   terrible headaches, so they give you a diuretic
[00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:52.340]   and that makes you cool.
[00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:54.020]   - Cocoa tea, they have it all over the place.
[00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:55.260]   - You get to the hotel.
[00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:56.260]   - They have it at the airport.
[00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:59.300]   - I'm staying at the Monastario,
[00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:00.500]   which is right there in Machu Picchu,
[00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:02.260]   but when you get there, they give you the coca tea.
[00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:03.420]   But then somebody sent me an email saying,
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:05.660]   "Whatever you do, don't bring the coca tea back
[00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:07.380]   "because not only will it confiscate it,
[00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:08.940]   "but then it's on your record."
[00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:10.500]   - Yeah, don't bring the coca tea back.
[00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:12.820]   But they have it, you find the old timers up there
[00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:15.020]   that chew the leaves, big bags of them.
[00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:17.020]   - Those are the ones that the teeth are all blackened.
[00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:19.180]   - Well, you chew on the leaf, it's like chewing the
[00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:20.620]   chalk tobacco, you chew and chew and chew and chew
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:21.900]   and chew and chew and chew and chew and chew
