Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Am I Android ready with questions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, good. Yeah, this is going to be the Android Nexus One tip show, I think, because Gina Turpani and I are big fans.  There's Gina Turpani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's mine with answers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  SmarterWord.org.  Am I supposed to hold mine up too now, since we're all in the family?  And of course, joining us.  Let's see if Siva is going to be joining.  Yes, he.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's an iPhone.  Siva Vajanathan, who is the author of the Googleization of everything.  It's so 2007.  Yeah, even Steve Wozniak gave up the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You are a classicist, Siva.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Siva is a professor at University of Virginia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  UVA.  Thomas Jefferson's alma mater.  Yep.  And here, because I think you have quite a bit to say about the big blockbuster story of the week, the late night shenanigans with Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno.  I think it's going to be the whole show.  No, I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about the fact that Google got so pissed off at the world's largest nation, the world's biggest group of Internet users that they're ready to pull out.  You wrote a great blog post, I thought, Jeff, applauding Google, saying, yay, this is how, if you're going to do no evil, this is how you do it.  Why don't you give us the rundown of what happened, then we'll get a dissenting opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it is a chicken egg question as to what actually caused this.  There were cyber attacks on Google, and I think the number is now more than 30 other companies.  Google said they were going after the email accounts of people fighting for human rights and other things, including, I think, Google code as well and that of other companies.  Well, I think the secretary of state, Clinton, thinks it is because I think she said the State Department said we want some explaining to do, China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got to say what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And at the same time, it came along that they said that they were going to sometime in the near future stop censoring Google.CN results at the behest of the Chinese government.  They were going to open discussions with the Chinese government about whether they could stay there, which is to say that they're threatening to pull out.  Is that a fair summary?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Seems so, Siva.  And I should say that, Jeff, you applauded it, as I did when I heard about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Having been the official Google fanboy, having written the book on being a Google fanboy, I was looking for a copy.  But the one thing people always throw at me and that I throw at Google is Google's China policy.  And as far as I'm concerned, that Google stands to benefit from free speech more than any other company ever, even more than publishers.  It enables free speech.  And I thought that Google should stand up for free speech as a result.  And Google has its old policy was that a hampered Internet hampered Google was better for the Chinese people than no Google at all.  But I argued in the book and since that Google has more power here than even it knows and that the problem I see with China is that because the market is so large and our lust for its revenue and the fact that it's so large,  the fact that it holds us by the short hairs in debt has made everyone chicken to go after China and demand something better.  You have companies like Yahoo that have handed over email addresses for dissidents.  Cisco, Nokia, Siemens are helping China in their censorship.  Steve Ballmer this week threw Google under the bus and said, I don't know what's the problem.  It was kind of like the Jay Leno of technology.  And I think it's important to stand up.  Siva in his post, his very good post, and he and I, as we always do, civilly disagree on some of the points and not all, but does make the analogy that I make as well to apartheid.  And at some point you stand up for standards, for principles.  And the interesting thing I think too about Google here is that Dietzeit in Germany called Google a quasi-state under the headline.  I think it was the Google Reich.  And Tom Fallows, Jim Fallows from Atlantic magazine who knows China well, the way he phrased it was that Google had cut off diplomatic relations with China.  And the interesting thing to me is what we're seeing here rise is the rise of what I call interest states.  That Google is really acting a bit like a country.  And it has the economy itself that's the size of I think the 29th largest country in the world.  And so we're starting to see these cross-border influences.  And so the fact that Google is going up against China rather than the US or the EU or European countries tells a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Before we get to Siva, Gina, you concur?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do. I mean, it was a gutsy move. It was one that I also applauded and celebrated.  I mean, I found it very interesting that the cause, you know, that the events that led up to it, right, the hacking, the surveillance, and then the making that decision.  But yeah, I pretty much concur with Jeff. I don't know. I feel like maybe Google being, you know, another kind of state feels like a little bit of a stretch for me.  But, you know, I don't know. I can tell you how to use Android, but I'm not the one you want commenting on politics or business.  So I'll go with Jeff on that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean, look, Google is just a big company.  If Ford decided not to make cars in China or if I mean, there's economic clout that a big company has.  Google is only 31% though of the search engine business in China. Baidu is much bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry to put it this way, but Google is the new Coke.  In that sense, the Coke was the symbol of America and the symbol of capitalism. And Google is that now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Well, certainly it's got to have some impact.  Now Siva, what's your thought?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The only major statement of Jeff's that I want to take issue with is that Google is the new Coke because Coke is still Coke.  Coke is still a dominant brand and in many ways the world's favorite corn syrup flavored beverage.  So that's not changed. No, but I actually am a bigger fan of this move than I think Jeff is.  And I'm a bigger fan of Google's policy in China over the last five years than Jeff is or just about anybody actually.  And I'll explain why. So first, let me say I don't believe in corporate responsibility.  I actually don't think it's Google's business to be in the business of liberating anybody or enhancing anybody  in particular's political agenda. But that's a nice byproduct of this.  OK, within limitations, because I actually don't think Google has that much influence.  Now, Google may be 31 percent of the current Chinese Internet market, but we are talking about 100 million users  because just over 300 million people in China use the Internet every day.  But we also have to remember that the vast majority of people in China are basically subsistence farmers.  So the government of China has far bigger problems, challenges, issues and thorns in their side than Google could ever present.  So with that context, but let me explain first of all why I think that for the past five years, Google's been doing the right thing in China.  First of all, Google has never had the power to empower anybody.  The people in China who are fighting for their rights to speak, their rights to practice their religion freely, their rights to raise little girls on equal terms, right?  All of those important human rights, flesh and bone issues are so much deeper, broader and more grave than search results could ever affect.  Having people in China be able to Google Falun Gong or find pictures of the Tank Man from the Tiananmen Square incidents in 1989 is not going to improve anyone's life significantly.  Now those are all sort of side issues just to sort of play.  I think this particular move is important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Siva, we're getting some hesitation on your Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's icing on the cake. It's nice that they get to feel good and make us feel good and get human rights organizations to applaud them finally.  But basically for the past five years, they have not been a human rights problem in China.  While Cisco is, while Yahoo has been, Google was very deft and careful about how it did business in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cisco because it turned over information about dissidents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, not just that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because it did Cisco, I think, sells technology there, right?  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yahoo did turn over information about dissidents.  Now you have to do that if you have that information within the People's Republic of China.  By law.  In a lot of ways, Yahoo made the mistake of actually being there with sensitive information.  That was a dumb move from the beginning.  Once you're there, you kind of have to obey the law, right?  But Cisco is far worse largely because Cisco is actively selling the sorts of technologies that China uses to do.  Well, it's not just the filters are a big part, but China's major tool for limiting the distribution of unsavory material is the surprise reset of your connection, right?  So they have these ways of just blipping out people's connections if they end up going to bad places or places the Chinese government doesn't like.  In general also, the Chinese government makes sure that there are really, I think, only two major channels into the People's Republic.  And it's very easy for them to block YouTube and block blogger and block any service that they can say Facebook, which they often do, which they consider potentially troublesome.  So that's how China does its thing.  But Google five years ago decided to do the following.  Google.CN would be hosted in China because you need to do that to get it to run at a decent speed and to be able to work on the linguistic challenges that are so important in search.  You really need native Mandarin, you know, speakers, readers, computer scientists, linguists working on these problems and be able to mess with the code right there.  Right. So that makes sense.  But any service that required anyone to register, log in and leave a record, those services were offshore.  Those services were on held on servers, the same servers that we have.  So to get to Gmail, to get to Google Book Search, to get to Google Scholar, to get to any of those important services, even YouTube, where you can register, people in China who use these services would have to go to the same servers we use, which meant that occasionally they were blocked.  But they were safe.  The Chinese government couldn't come knocking and say, by the way, we want all the data and email of this person the way they could do it with any such business hosted in China.  So that worked out great.  I think now Google was always at a competitive disadvantage in China because it would not do what Baidu did, which is present direct, simple searches and links to pirated music and movies.  That's the number one thing Baidu does.  Baidu also takes advantage of nationalism.  It's the homegrown web company that's kicking the butt of this big bad American company.  I mean, that's a great story for the vast majority of people in China who are terribly supportive of the government.  And as a result, Google found ways to make money.  But, you know, it was slowly creeping up in the size of the market.  But the total market was still pretty huge.  I mean, 100 million people, you know, in a population where Google clearly had a much better representation among two very important groups.  One, the cosmopolitan elite, the people who are involved in international banking, people who go to college and university in Europe or Canada or United States, people who are interested in connecting with the outside world, usually for business reasons, but often for political reasons, religious reasons, whatever.  Those folks tended to use Google over Baidu, except when they wanted to get music.  Now, the other segment of the Chinese Internet user population that was sort of more Google than Baidu of late has been younger college educated people.  And there are more people than ever going to college now in China.  So there was a sense that younger people found a lot of virtue in the vast array of Google services as long as they were able to get to them.  And in college, one of the first things you learn in college in China is how to use VPN, how to use proxy service, how to use proxy service to get a consistent connection with Google services and get the thoroughly unfiltered search results anyway.  So that's kind of what they were looking at.  So this is by threatening to pull out of China.  This is actually a major risk for them for a couple of reasons.  One, it doesn't matter if they remain 30 percent of the market forever.  Thirty percent of a potential billion people is is is nothing to sneeze at.  You can still sell a lot of ads that way and maybe even a lot of phones to put some transition down.  But so that's what's really at risk here.  So I mean, I've read a lot of blog posts from cynics saying, well, Google is failing and this is they don't really mean anything with this because they're backing out because they're just the tail between the legs.  They're just they don't want to admit that they're losing.  Well, it's not a race. Right.  You know, every paying customer is a paying customer.  Every click is a click.  So so they weren't necessarily losing.  But of course, they would love to be the dominant search engine in any market.  Just wasn't going to happen any time the next decade.  But whatever.  The reason that that this is important in a larger sense is that Google is making a stand for the Internet itself.  What we've what we've discovered with Google revealed.  This is the other thing that's amazing about what happened.  Google is the first company to speak openly about that level of attacks and the level of vulnerability that that that's true.  And people who are involved in Web Security and server security have known this secret for a long time that nothing is really secure.  Now, think about the anxiety going, you know, going through the room as the top 10 people at Google discuss this issue.  Are we willing to explain to the world?  Not really secure, that Google Docs is not really secure.  We already saw the Twitter hacking event with Google Docs, you know, sort of demonstrate that.  So they're risking eroding the perception that they have been trying to put forth in their gamble on cloud computing, right?  They're putting cloud computing at risk as well as that huge Chinese market by this move.  The reason they're doing this is they find their current state of practice and environment in China untenable.  They cannot they can't stand for this level of aggressive intrusion into their security.  That's just not the sort of thing that would happen.  Because imagine if they hadn't announced this.  Imagine if they hadn't gone public with this vulnerability and 30, 60 days from now, some political dissident gets arrested and they come to his door with all his Gmail mails.  At that point, Google becomes as big a sinner, if not bigger than Yahoo was for giving up that.  And also we none of us trust our Gmail with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At that point, as you said, if that happens, if they hadn't gotten ahead of this and taken this stand, they knew they were risking monumental embarrassment both within China and worldwide.  Already Google's taken a number of important reputation hits.  They could not afford that kind of tragedy, nor did they want the blood of anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, nobody contrasted to Microsoft's response, which was essentially.  Well, no, I don't.  I don't think what's the problem.  I don't think we're being hacked.  Are we being?  Oh, my gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If we want to do this week in Microsoft, I don't think we're being hacked.  It's just Microsoft is just so, so dumb in this entire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But here's where Google really by putting a planting a flag in the sand, drawing a line in the sand says, come on, Microsoft and Yahoo put up or shut up now and other American corporations.  I don't know if I'd go so far as to say Google now has a foreign policy.  In fact, some in some ways you could say this is a fit of peak.  You know, they talk about in the Computer World article, which is a great article about a Christmas Eve meeting that Larry Page led to kind of discuss this.  And the reaction was, holy crap, the malware is accessing our internal intercept system.  And I think the first reaction from people like Larry and engineers is screw you, China.  You know, I can kind of understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. It's I think well said, but that as usual, we don't disagree as much as it appears that the new world here is the Internet and Google is what Great Britain?  Well, yes, it is the colonizer of this and it is the protector of this.  And I want to go back to one more one point you said before, though, Steve.  I think where we do disagree is on the idea of corporate responsibility.  I just put up on the on the wiki a piece by Umair Haik at the Harvard Business School blog where Umair has been arguing very, very eloquently that basically Google's don't be evil case.  That is a business strategy today that in an age when we can all talk about a company in an instant doing evil is bad business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it also begs the question why they've done why they've been there for four years.  What exactly?  Right.  They've always been not happy about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And supposedly is not happy about it.  And so this is I think I think the argument that this is really about the cyber attacks.  It's a convenient way to bring up the censorship and also try to make that the issue is a nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So gave him a hook, gave him a hook to do something they should have done four years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, I mean, I don't want to argue too much about this.  But look, basically, I don't I don't buy that there was a free speech motivation at the core of this because Google could have made a similar move in early December 2009 if it really were about free speech.  It could have made it in 2007 if it were about free speech.  No, it was really about the fact that there the the security and integrity of the Internet and e-commerce is directly threatened by this.  That's what it felt like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like clues free speech.  Yeah, but it but it's like it looked like to me it's like, well, we can deal with these guys until they start stealing stuff from us.  OK, now they've gone too far.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So but but putting that aside, the the the real challenge I look at that I try to imagine what they want out of this.  Right.  First of all, it's a total bluff.  And and maybe even it's a total bluff.  That's all I think there's an expectation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have an expectation that China might change its law and allow them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  It's a total bluff that they will run an unfiltered, uncensored web search project in China and Google.  It's absolutely a total bluff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me clarify this, though.  They're not they're not yet doing that.  What they know exactly what they said in the blog post is we're going to give you two choices.  China, you either change the law so that we can run an unfiltered search or we leave.  And you say that there's no that that first choice is not even a bluff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Total bluff. And so like it was weird because the first day that this broke, there were all sorts of people tweeting and blogging about the fact that, oh, now you can see Tankman on Google.  I never looked for it.  I don't know. But the point was, you can if you're searching from within the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But so they haven't uncensored anything and they're not going to because the moment that they go censor free, that's the point at which Chinese soldiers arrest every Google employee in the office.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do we know if that office is still open?  They have the beautiful new offices in Beijing.  Is that office still open to our employees?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I saw it on TechCrunch.  You could take it or leave it.  It was on TechCrunch that they Google had given them the long weekend, right?  The MLK weekend off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And a lot of them have to be Chinese citizens, which means they're not going anywhere.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Right. But still, you don't want to keep everybody in one place where it's easy to confiscate all the all the computers, all the servers, all the logs and and all the people at the same time.  Right. You may make it a little bit more challenging.  But basically, Google does not want to put its employees at risk.  Google does not want to put its infrastructure at risk.  It is willing to put its revenue at risk.  And because there's a bigger battle to be fought here.  Now, what Google would like with this threat to pull out is two things.  One, that class of Google users who deeply love Google.  And there's a story in the New York Times, I think, coming out tomorrow, sort of interviewing a number of these people, the educated elites, the folks who are really sort of deeply into all the different Google products.  You know, Google's hoping that that there is some sort of, dare we say, rising political sensibility attached to this.  I really doubt that people love Google enough to put their lives at risk.  And I really doubt that China is liberal enough today to even create space for that.  Nonetheless, seeding that dissatisfaction can can be really important over the long run.  But more importantly, I think Google desperately wanted to force the hand of Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and various European leaders so that they stand up and say, you know what?  China's activities in this area are threatening a major area of global commerce and a major segment of the European and American economy and the trust that we all hope to have in the Internet in the future.  That is major.  And there because so far the United States government under Obama has been meek dealing with China, not willing to challenge them on a number of issues.  I think Google felt it didn't have a choice, even though Eric Schmidt could pick up the phone and talk to the president.  It didn't have a choice without going public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't Secretary Clinton speaking on Thursday on this?  I mean, isn't that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was going to be a fuzzy speech about Internet freedom, blah, blah, blah, you know, flowers and puppies.  But now it actually has to be grounded in something that directly takes on the Chinese government.  And that is big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they did already say, you know, hands off or whatever.  Get your fingers out of our servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google succeeded in making sure that the United States government is on record about this issue and is taking it seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She does say that the State Department was briefed by Google.  So, you know, Google has access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I'm sure there's much more going on behind the scenes that we'll never know about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the quote from Secretary Clinton.  She says, We look to the Chinese government for an explanation.  Those are harsh words.  The ability to cooperate with confidence in cyberspace is critical in a modern society and economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She didn't say this about about, you know, dangerous products that were killing people.  Yeah, no.  Finally standing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was a different secretary of state.  So, yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a funny thing.  Jim Fallows says is that China is entering its Bush Cheney era in which in which they're pissing off,  pissing off their foreign foreign allies with their fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But not for the first time.  But let's also remember, I mean, this Jeff and I had this really neat sort of back and forth on our on our blogs about this notion of the extent to which Google is behaving like a state.  But so historically, though, let's let's be clear.  This isn't radically new that British East India Company acted like a state, you know, and basically colonized India and Indonesia.  The Dutch East India Company, I'm sorry, colonized Indonesia the same way, right, acted like a state with many of the powers of the state, you know, employing privateers to do warfare, to actually go, you know, and lots of, you know, basically raising their own private armies to do these sorts of activities.  So it's not new that companies, multinational companies doing work around the globe have foreign policies and actually military policies.  So that's actually been a longstanding thing.  You know, when Rockefeller ran Standard Oil, he had a foreign policy as he went beyond North America looking for oil today.  Exxon Mobil has a foreign policy and many of them, in fact.  So none of that's radically new.  Coca-Cola, of course, has its own version of foreign policy, one that's light enough we don't even notice.  So that's that's not necessarily the new thing.  The interesting thing about Google is that because so many of the challenges of sort of reining in or maybe civilizing or making the Internet work well for everyday people, those challenges, fighting spyware, fighting malware, making sure that the cacophony of information available out there is usable and navigable.  These are questions of governance.  And because no state or or group of states or or coalition of states is either authorized or capable of engaging in this level of governance or trusted to or trusted to Google is filling that vacuum.  You say it's super national.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's essentially what it's it's the governance of the Internet.  Right.  And some may, you know, get uncomfortable with that wording.  But I think he's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that that's I can't get away from the notion, though, that Google didn't care until their servers were broken into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they did care.  I think there was an argument going on inside the company.  The word is, and I have no inside knowledge on this, but the word is that Sergey Brin has been uncomfortable since the first I linked to a quote of his in 2006.  And it's clearly uncomfortable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's that's that's good PR.  Well, you know, one of our principles is uncomfortable.  We're still going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even if it's true, even if it's true, it doesn't matter.  What really matters is effects in the real world.  Right. So, I mean, William James said a belief is that upon which you are willing to act.  Yes. And and basically Google was for four years not one act on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's why I am a little suspect of the whole thing.  I applaud them.  I think one of the reasons they're doing it is because to the outside world where there's mounting suspicion of Google, they needed some way to say, oh, look, see, they needed virtue.  They needed virtue in this.  But the timing is very, very convenient for that.  So, you know, that's truly over.  That doesn't say what, you know, again, Yahoo hasn't done it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Microsoft hasn't done it.  Cisco hasn't.  No, it's the right thing to do.  I'm not saying it's not the right thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm saying it was the right thing to do four years ago.  Yeah.  And I understand the need.  Look, if you're eBay, you don't sell Nazi memorabilia in Germany, whether you agree with that law or not.  You have to follow the laws of the nation.  So the choice is not whether to do it or not.  The choice is whether to participate in that country's economy.  And that's where I think maybe Google could have said four years ago, no.  And I think that would have had equal power and would have put challenge, the same kind of challenge to Yahoo and Microsoft then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Leo, that was a corporate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina, what are you hearing in technology circles from people?  Is this a resonating as a big issue or is it more on the blather sphere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I think everyone's really happy and excited about what happened.  I mean, I think that I, too, am stuck like Leo on this idea that they made the announcement after, you know, after after realizing the attacks and the surveillance.  I mean, I think that this is very much like a geek ego thing.  Google couldn't stand the idea that they were hacked and that their servers were in a building somewhere in China and possibly wiretapped.  I mean, you know, then later on that week, I don't know if this is related, but it's interesting that later on that week, HTTPS, the encrypted version of Gmail becomes turned on by default.  So, you know, I think that this is about time.  It is about time.  You could turn it on before, but it's about time that it was that it was just the default.  So which is interesting because the security then becomes more important than speed because encryption speed is a tiny bit slower.  You really don't feel it.  But so, yeah, I mean, I really think that this was just a matter of ego.  They couldn't they couldn't swallow the idea that they were actually enabling, you know, the Chinese government to find dissidents, you know, to enter and to, you know, find information about those things.  Information about those people and they're right.  You're really up in arms.  And they should.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But so but that's how it changed.  I mean, that's the thing that changed the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's a little bit like saying we're going to do business with Nazi Germany selling them guns.  Oh, my goodness.  They're harming Jews.  Oh, well, we'll get out now.  It's like it's like, yeah, that's good now.  But come on.  What happened four years ago?  I still don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Leo, I think it is different in scale.  It's very different in scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, people aren't getting well.  I don't know.  Maybe they are getting killed.  I don't know.  People are getting let me let Gina finish.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me let Gina finish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I mean, the point that that there is that Google was attacked and some information  was what, you know, there was a security breach is a big threat to their business.  Right.  I mean, they want to convince the whole world that storing your information in the cloud  is secure.  So here's an example when it wasn't for whatever reasons.  And I think, you know, Douglas Roof-Croft wrote an article saying that this this was  a PR move to cover up what was a security breach.  And I think I've said this in past in past shows.  All Google needs is one major, well-publicized security breach to set back their cloud business,  you know, years and years.  Why wasn't this it?  Well, this wasn't it because they turned it into, you know, what could be perceived as  a brilliant PR move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rushkoff calls it the great Google cover up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  So you have lots of people cheering them on.  Yay, Google's doing the right thing.  But, you know, there's still they got into people's Gmail accounts.  Gmail accounts.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What does that mean?  Self-interest is not a is not a bad thing.  I agree with you.  I think that what was right, Siva is right.  And I think you agree with him that the cloud was at risk, thus Google was at risk.  The Internet was at risk.  And who was doing it?  A regime, a dictator, a tyrannical dictator that's been putting out products that kill  people, killing people for their views, imprisoning for their views.  And we never stood up.  Why?  Because we're all so damn greedy.  We don't want to pass up the market.  Right.  And so, you know, yes, Leo, they should have done it four years ago.  I said it at the time.  I've said it since.  Sometimes we all have to make mistakes and then come to our damn senses.  And I'm glad somebody did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think we're all applauding Google for coming to their senses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would say, though, that that Google was not complicit in the imprisoning of anyone,  the exploitation of anyone, the murder of anyone.  Unlike Yahoo.  Unlike Yahoo.  And Google was careful about that.  And not only because they're human beings and who would really want to, unless you want  to absolve yourself of all responsibility, but more than that, they also knew that post  Yahoo, it was an impossible business relationship to do on those same terms, to keep the sensitive  information on China.  In China, it just would have been madness.  So they learned a lot from what Yahoo did.  So I think that it would have been corporate malpractice not to do business in China.  Every major American company does business in China.  Nike employs people in sweatshops in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, every iPod we've got in fact, probably this Google phone is made in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. Look, if you have a problem, this is one of the big arguments in my book.  And the other side of the corporate responsibility dismissal is basically corporations are legally  bound to basically be immoral, to be amoral, to be interested in the interests of their  stockholders and period, right?  Basically period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you read our Hick on that, Siva?  I'm sorry.  Umar says, Umar's argument is that again, now that we can all talk about a company in a  flash, that being evil is going to affect your business, that it becomes part of your  enlightened self-interest.  That's right.  And that being good.  I don't disagree with that at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have a fiduciary responsibility to your stakeholders to be a good company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't disagree at all with what that deflates.  He agrees with me because what that deflates is a sense that corporate responsibility is  somehow distinct from self-interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And maybe that's what this is a manifestation of.  Now, Rushkoff raises a specter that I think is important, which is we don't know how much  Google was cooperating with China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Rushkoff's full of crap.  I mean, generally he's on the ball about a lot of things.  First of all, he gets completely wrong.  A major fact in his piece.  One, he says that Google has servers with sensitive information within the People's  Republic of China.  That is absolutely not true.  And that was the key to Google's strategy five years ago.  Nobody would be stupid enough to defy the policy as outlined to Congress under oath  about this sort of thing.  So that was absolutely untrue.  Rushkoff's also surmising that Google's close interaction with the government created  these vulnerabilities.  What we've seen from the security researchers so far, and we've had very little clarity  on this, was that basically the vulnerabilities were, surprise, surprise, Microsoft Internet  Explorer vulnerabilities, which were excited.  And maybe to some degree, some Adobe PDF vulnerabilities.  Again, not a surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that was for the human rights activists worldwide who got hacked.  Was that for Google as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Really?  So, you know, they're just, I mean, but again, we don't know exactly.  Well, okay, I don't know.  I don't know and nobody knows for sure.  But in addition, a lot of these vulnerabilities, a lot of sort of back doors in a lot of these  systems are actually required under US law to allow the NSA and the FBI into back doors.  Again, not very well expressed or understood.  So in a lot of ways, the government we tend to trust helps make a lot of these servers insecure  and open some potential vulnerabilities.  That's one possibility.  But saying that Google basically was in bed with the Chinese government requires either a  complete invocation of a falsehood, which is what he did, or a reaction to the absence of evidence.  Right.  The absence of evidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's pure speculation.  Obviously, it's pure speculation.  But it raises, I don't know if it's irresponsible.  I think it raises an interesting point.  We don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's worse because without any evidence to, I remember during the Iraq War, there were  bloggers who were in Iraq who were in favor of US policy.  They've all actually switched around, but at the time they were.  And there were people who went on the air who speculated they were CIA with absolutely no evidence  and could have killed them as a result.  Right.  And I think that it is just plain, I mean, as a journalist, it is just plain irresponsible.  Well, is it?  On the basis of a, gee, I guess, to then come to all these conclusions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But is it irresponsible to point out, and I won't go as far as Doug, but is it irresponsible to point out that  we don't really know to what degree Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't just prove a negative.  We don't really know that Google didn't cause HIV.  Everybody's assuming.  Show me, prove to me that Google didn't cause HIV.  No, I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't prove a negative.  But everybody's assuming that Google kept China at arm's length.  But we don't know whether they did or not, do we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we know for sure that there were no Google servers in China, even just serving search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As Siva was saying, there were some servers there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There were some servers there.  That's what you're saying, Siva.  But only for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The reason they had to hack into the email here was because the email was here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Right, Siva?  So Gmail was kept here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Gmail was here.  Any apps that you had to sign in to access and use were located in, like, Texas, right?  But there were some search servers in China.  See, I thought that Doug was saying that China, because there were servers in China, even the ones just serving search results,  that they could have been just, you know, tapped the wires and watched the search just happen.  Well, here's what we don't know.  We don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, you know as a programmer and as a geek that those servers were certainly connected to Google servers in the states  and could have provided a portal to those servers in the states.  We don't know.  We don't have any information about what happened, really.  Right.  We just don't know.  And you have to trust Google to tell us what, you know, happened.  And let's be honest, when a bank gets broken in two, they don't tell you what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not until they close it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Until it's done.  So we don't know.  But you're right.  You can't prove the negatives.  So I don't I think maybe it's irresponsible to promulgate a conspiracy theory.  But I'm just I'm not convinced by Google at this point.  It seems like there it was more of a fit of peak because they got hacked into than any commitment to human rights.  And I think the timing is very convenient for Google.  It gives them a chance to say, look, see how good we are.  It distracts from the fundamental issue of how secure they are.  They can't criticize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at another way, then.  Fine.  And Google could not criticize, attack China for the attacks and hold China to a moral standard.  They can't.  And not bring up censorship.  In that sense, Google was forced to bring up censorship.  Because if they turned around and said, nasty, nasty, you Chinese, how dare you do this?  The response kind of, A, they have no proof.  So you're in Rushkoff territory.  And B, it puts them in a delicate, ethical position because they are conspiring with the Chinese to the extent of censoring results.  But censorship.  I just got a tweet from Simon at Illuminant who puts up a link I will put up on the wiki saying that here's evidence that the Tiananmen Square stuff was up on a Google.CN search on 15 January.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Simon's in our chat room and says that he has, he's coming in from a US IP address, but he says that he has employees in China and uses LogMeIn to check those Chinese servers.  So it's, I don't know whether you can.  I don't know either.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look, stuff can appear and get indexed by Google.CN within a day and not get scrubbed immediately.  That's always possible, too.  There are lots of different ways things can happen, can pop up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw, I too saw these images from Google.CN that showed the protester and so forth, but you just don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I need to make two points.  One, search result censorship is trivial.  That's not the sort of censorship that really makes a difference in people's lives.  Most of the folks who want illicit material, whether it's pornography or Falun Gong material or Democratic activists, they are going to use proxy servers, use VPN.  They're going to find ways to do it.  It's not hard to do.  The knowledge is easy to get once you're in those groups.  Now, it's nice.  It's much better, makes us feel better as narcissistic Westerners to think that free speech is going to change the world instantly.  But in fact, what really matters is the flesh and bones issue.  The fact that China tortures people, imprisons people without charge and that the real human bodies at risk.  That's what the human rights question was.  And ultimately what the real threat to and by any Internet company was.  I just saw a tweet saying, hey, hey, me, my Twitter address, please stay off Twitch shows with your garbage Republican rants.  Republicans.  Just ignore these nitwits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should always warn anybody who comes on our show that no matter who you are, you will get some some some nitwits saying something because you're in public now.  Welcome. Welcome to the welcome to the general public.  They're a lovely bunch.  I hope you enjoy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is your Republican book coming out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you a Republican, Siva?  Because I'm sorry, we don't allow Republicans on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm a Republican with a small R and a Republican haircut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I only know and I tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  Well, I think the fascinating thing here, we can unpack motives, whatever.  The fascinating thing here is there's some major stuff going down here.  We have big, important companies standing up at least one in the lead, several others joining behind.  Standing up to this dirty little secret that the Chinese government has been actively disrupting some of the core functions of the Internet and of e-commerce.  And we are going to see in the next few weeks whether the United States seriously and puts its relationship with China at risk because of it.  And over the long term, we're going to see whether the cosmopolitan elite in China actually can forge some sort of political identity because all of the big political conflicts in China over the past 20 years have been largely on the margins of China in the Western provinces with the Uighurs in Tibet and so forth.  We've not seen an uprising since 1989 in places like Shanghai and Beijing.  This wouldn't be the trigger by no means.  You know, is a search engine company going to create a new demonstration?  But a sense of political consciousness and potential because good things that the elites who have been winning so much in China are suddenly in danger because of the quirks of the Chinese government.  That could help feed into a sense of sort of, you know, middle to upper middle class political consciousness within China.  I think there are moderate forces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, I know there are moderate forces in the Chinese Politburo and there are extreme forces and there is a very delicate balance between them and something as little as this can actually shift those forces.  So it might not be protests in the streets.  It might be something that's completely invisible that happens in the highest ranks of government where the moderates might make a huge difference.  The moderates might say, see, we're running the risk of getting cut off from the rest of the world by this policy.  Maybe we ought to think about it.  I'll tell you, you know, when I was in China in July, one of the things that's really apparent in Beijing is that and I talked to a lot of Chinese nationals about filtering of the Internet and censorship and so forth.  And they, of course, said, yeah, anybody can get around it if they want to.  We don't really care.  Some people said, oh, you know, they're mostly just filtering pornography.  That's fine.  And I think one of the reasons you don't see protests in the streets is there's this general sense of prosperity and progress right now in the cities of China.  And I think as long as that continues, I think a lot of a lot of the people there feel like, well, we'll get there and we're making progress.  I mean, it's a lot better than it was under Mao.  It's a lot better than it was 20 years ago.  So maybe they're not quite so revolutionary as, say, the people in Iran.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina, what we've learned so far about the question for Gina for the for the other attacks on other companies, was China just going after dissidents or was China going after the Internet for the rest of us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I actually haven't read a whole lot.  I saw a couple of headlines that Windows seven or like that that one of the bugs that was exploited was in like all the versions of Windows.  But I'm not sure exactly what the other how about other companies published information about these attacks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just Adobe, which is an odd company to have been hacked.  Yeah, you know, it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Once again, regardless of what happens, once again, Google is first to market.  Not this time, but this time with a decision now.  So like if other US companies do follow suit, say Microsoft and Yahoo both come out and say we're going to do the same thing that they're just going to look like me twos, which is really like Google strategy.  All the time, it seems like is to make these sort of, you know, whatever new products or revolutionary kind of stands right away.  And then anyone who tries to follow them, I mean, with with with the exception of Android, right, because iPhone was first.  But, you know, Steve Jobs, his phones are made there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, everything Apple makes is made there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It'll be interesting to see if other companies do what Google did.  I mean, in one way, it's like, do you want to look like the me too?  Do you want to kind of come out and say, well, you didn't have the guts to do this first.  But now that they did, we will. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, here's an interesting point, which is that sometime about six months ago, it became out that that it was believed to be the Chinese government had hacked the electrical grid in the US and that many private electrical providers had trojans on their system that appeared to have been put there by the Chinese government.  And instead, there was no hue and cry.  Secretary Clinton didn't say, well, you got some explaining to do.  It just kind of went over quietly.  And I think until Google kind of made this big stink, it was something that the feds could kind of say, you know, we know what's going on.  You know, but apparently, according to some, these these kinds of spear phishing attacks that were going after human rights advocates have been going on for three years.  And what's interesting, according to iDefense, which is a security firm, that many of these attacks were going after source code.  That, for instance, the attack on Adobe was for source code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what that's what makes me say that this is more than just it's this is economic espionage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Precisely. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. And, you know, look, the the idea of corporate espionage is not new to the world, but not new to China either.  And being able to get into Adobe's servers could certainly serve Chinese software companies quite well, could serve the Chinese military quite well.  Understanding Adobe's encryption could serve both interests quite well.  And and look, the Chinese military is heavily involved with a lot of major industries in China.  I mean, right down to the pressing of DVDs.  Oh, absolutely. DVDs that the army's involved.  They own hotels, everything. Yeah.  Right. Exactly. So, you know, you have while you have the Internet threatened and Internet security threatened and the cloud threatened and maybe even Amazon and eBay threatened down the line.  What is on top of that is the the trade secrets of so many major American companies.  One of the companies listed in the New York Times the other day that had been a victim of this was a defense contractor.  Right. Which should not be surprising if you were the Chinese government.  Sure. To get to breach some systems you'd you would want Northrop Grumman.  You know, you'd want to get some airplane engine information.  So, yeah, it's you know, it's such a huge problem.  But again, that's what's so fascinating about this is why this is I think going to be one of the biggest stories of the next three years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not even a story. Remember the ghost net attacks we heard about last year against the Dalai Lama.  These are the same techniques, the same technology, the same controlling servers.  So it's I mean, I think it's very interesting because this has been going on.  We know for since 2001, according to F secure, since two for nine years.  But now Google raises the issue and suddenly it's a story.  It does, in fact, kind of underscore what you said, Jeff, that Google is now kind of extra national, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's that's what Dietz Eit was saying in Germany was, look, Germany and the US didn't have the pardon me, cojones.  We didn't do anything. We just said, oh, yeah.  And then Google, you know, fine, 31 percent of the market, but it has less to lose.  And I think if SEVA's the question is if that middle class, if that intelligentsia does start to feel empowered by this and feel someone in the world  is going to back them up, that's the key. Someone in the world will back us up.  Then what will they do? Will it be like the Kurds in Iraq with the first Bush?  Or, you know, what will happen to people who do try to stand up on behalf of human rights in China?  Right now, there's, you know, we all on the occasional, oh, you shouldn't do that protest.  And then let's do some more business, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And just in case you needed some more encouragement, one of the security experts from I.T.  Harvest said, my message to everybody is you are all under attack.  You are all under attack. This is this is going on in a very widespread fashion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it in China's interest to hurt the Internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says these attacks demonstrate a shift with the Chinese now brazenly going after US industry interests.  They've the defense group, Incorporated says they've gone from attacking the military and defense.  Such that it benefited their state and national security to striking the heart of American, the American technology economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I hate to get, you know, to now be accused of being Republican, but Al Qaeda is rooting them on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Al Qaeda doesn't have the sophistication, though. This is what's really interesting.  China has the sophistication to do this. And I think what you're seeing is it's hard.  I mean, it's hardliners in China. And maybe if the world gets upset and finally stands up to this, maybe starting with Google,  I'd love to see Microsoft and Yahoo come along. There are those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is this goes to modernity. It goes to those who think that the Internet is a bad thing because the Internet takes away control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, or it's a good thing because it lets us invade your systems.  I don't think they're trying to shut down the Internet. They love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, nobody's more modern than Chinese. The Chinese just want the Internet on their terms.  Yeah, but the Internet is not forever. There's nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but it's not I think it's I would say I could even go farther say it's not about filtering at this point.  It's about it's about using the I mean, this isn't about the very definition of the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is the Constitution of the Internet. I agree with you there, but I won't go as far as modernity.  I mean, it's really a different. It's a different vision of how things should be laid out.  But, you know, look, the Chinese government would love, you know, everybody to be totally wired just under their terms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is I think this is them being economically very aggressive and competitive and saying we're going to we're going to steal your stuff.  We're going to make it make it better than you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The great irony to me is that that we attack China as a moral communist country when China China has become the most capitalist country.  I've said that for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you if you want to if you want to worry about capitalism run riot, you're watching it.  You just wait to one billion Chinese say, OK, here we come.  Because, you know, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The idea that no matter what the cause, if the rationale and discussion is about evil and ethics, I'm glad for that.  But it's not purely about even though it is enlightened self-interest, there's an enlightenment involved.  And I think that's very important for the discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it was Bill Gross who said that China slept through the Industrial Revolution.  They've woken up in the IT revolution and and they're not going to miss this boat.  They may have a different opinion about how to run it, but they're not going to miss this boat.  We're going to move on to topic two.  There doesn't really need to be a topic to on this one.  But we but but but we we promised we would talk about the Nexus one phone.  And where is it made in China?  I'm sure it doesn't say, but I'm sure it's in China.  It's made by HTC. I don't know.  So so, Jeff, now I'm going to say even more strongly than I did last week.  This and you've given it some time, I hope.  But this phone, in my opinion, knocks the socks off the iPhone.  It is simply the best phone I've ever used.  Gina, Gina, you're going to you're going to back me up on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, of course.  But you were the one in the middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was in the middle because I hadn't used it yet.  I, you know, mine was waiting for me at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But wait a second. So, Leo, this is your phone now.  Like, this is your primary phone.  Do you see an iPhone anywhere in here?  Well, welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's finally good enough.  And I'll tell you, in some ways, it's better.  The screen is spectacular, not great in daylight because OLED doesn't do well in daylight.  But it's when I go back to the iPhone, it just feels blurry and washed out and just converted.  That's the UI with the five pages.  And I used your folders trick, which basically gives the UI unlimited pages.  Right now we can. Yeah.  Now we can do or not unlimited, but we certainly smug grin on Gina's face.  That was that's a great tip.  And if you missed that, listen to last week, which, by the way, was late coming out because of CES.  And I think our editors and in fact, if you're watching live, I think it's still not as good.  But we'll get it out before we get this one out.  I just love the widgetting.  There's some great widgets on here.  I think Google has enhanced its applications.  Now I did get the straight scoop on multitouch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, let's talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got an email from inside Google.  You're going to love this.  And now again, it's unsourced.  It's inside Google and blah, blah, blah.  But I do believe it's inside Google.  He said Apple, Apple asked us not to implement multitouch just yet in the U.S.  because Apple knows its patents for multitouch are very weak and doesn't want to contest them at this point.  So Apple, which apparently still has very good relationships with Google over everything except phones, you know, said, hey, you know, Eric, dude.  Couldn't Google have licensed multitouch from Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that might have been one way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the truth is, multitouch is in here.  The milestone does do multitouch, the droid in Europe, that the U.S. supports it.  And in fact, the guy who sent it to me said I could prove multitouch is in there.  Press Shift and P at the same time on your keyboard.  And in fact, there are a number of applications available, including a browser that support multitouch on here.  So it's just that the Google apps don't have multitouch enabled.  It is on the phone.  And I expect it will be enabled fully as soon as Apple, I don't know, does what?  Licenses it to Google or whatever it is to avoid the court case.  But that's all that's missing on here is multitouch.  And I think in many ways that, for instance, the gallery application, which is much improved in 2.1 and pulls from Picasa is spectacular.  If it had multitouch, it would be the best photo application out there.  The camera is great.  It's a much better camera than the iPhone.  In fact, it's as good as the N95 or the N900.  It's a great five megapixel camera.  I'm just I'm blown away by this.  What network do you use, Leo?  It's T-Mobile. But you know where I am, T-Mobile is OK.  I have HSDPA and I have, you know, it's decent connectivity.  It frankly, it's better than AT&T here.  Doesn't drop calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, I would imagine you have your own cell tower in the backyard.  Oh, I did. I mentioned that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I, T-Mobile did put one out there.  So no, I've had good results with T-Mobile.  I think when this is out on Verizon, which I'm told it will be March 23rd, the first day of spring 2010.  This will be the best phone in America.  So, Jeff, how's your experience?  Have you done?  Are you coming along?  Are you coming along?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm coming along.  I'm being pissy.  No, be pissy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody's got a dissent here.  Talk to us.  I have a whole list of questions for Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK.  Let me see. Where do I start here?  The first thing that's driving me a little nutty about it is I cannot turn off all the frigging notifications.  And I can't tell what it's notified me about.  It's, you know, buzzing again.  And I'm going to turn them off all over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, you have to do an application by application.  I have no idea.  It took me a little while to figure this out, Jeff.  I'm with you.  But I love the notification system on Android.  And you can totally control it.  So you have different sounds for each program.  I have Twidroid that does a tweet when I get a direct message.  My email makes a different sound.  My text message makes a different sound.  None. I can't turn them off.  Or you could turn them all off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff, you found the window shade, right?  So like if you if you pull and drag down, you'll get the details of what the notifications mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, see, this is why I didn't know about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did not know about that.  Tap and drag this down.  This is one of the coolest things that Android has over the iPhone.  You know how the iPhone's notifications are just these kind of modal pop ups and you have to dismiss them one by one?  That's what this means, notification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But I only have two on here.  And it's been buzzing at me like every 10 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. OK.  So if you pull down the window shade, just check out to see what are they?  Is it you know, is it is it seismic?  Is it your Gmail?  And then you can use Google Voice.  And then you just need to go into each application in the settings and say notify me.  Yes, no, maybe seismic.  You can say notify me for DMs, but not for replies or notify me for all.  You can you just have to calibrate it.  And I agree when I first you know, when you first set up an Android phone, often the notifications come so so much and the phone buzzes so much that it gets overwhelming.  It's just a matter of configuring.  But you can totally configure it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's been it's per it's a per application setting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love the unified email box in this is great.  I mean, that that this is something the iPhone doesn't do.  Just put it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think the emails is good as the iPhone app.  I mean, I want to I have to open it to kill.  I don't know where to kill it, but I want to be able to.  It's again, it's not using the gestures enough, I think.  And the main app doesn't put conversations together.  And the Gmail app, I don't think is as good here as it is.  The main app does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I would use the main app.  Oh, you mean the threaded conversations.  I think you're saying, yeah, that is a nice feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I wish it was weird that it doesn't operate like Google Mail.  Right.  In the Google phone.  I think it's a little weak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What don't you like about the Gmail app?  Because that's that's actually one of my main reasons for being on Android as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Silly stuff.  We'll be able to read more on it.  I wish that I could use gestures more to do things like kill.  I've got to open.  You know, I can I can mark them and kill them.  Getting to, let's see, boxes.  Do I know how to do that?  How do I get the other mailboxes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there's well, there's there's two ways.  There's the Gmail app itself.  And then you just hit you hit the menu item at the bottom.  You know, the button at the bottom with the lines is the setting.  Is the setting.  How do I get into other mailboxes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do I get into my outbox or my my sent box from there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I see what you mean.  Other mailboxes.  OK, so just it's labels.  So hit that that menu button.  That's labels.  View labels.  Yeah, because you know, in Gmail, Google engineer, email, everything is a label.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's one thing I didn't like about Gmail is the focus on labels.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is helping me immensely.  All right.  Next, my seismic thinks that it's 19 hours ago at all times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would I would buy I would buy to twidroid pro.  I know a lot of people like Seismic, but twidroid pro to me is so much more customizable.  I have much multiple accounts control the notifications.  So, for instance, Seismic notify you for everything.  Twidroid, you can just say, oh, look, email just forced closed.  That's been happening a lot for me.  That's the only that's another question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do I kill an app?  Sometimes I just want to kill the app and I can't figure out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know what you do, Gina, but I got the advanced task manager, which I really like on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you go into settings, so you go to the menu, so you tap the tap the menu and you go to settings and you go to applications.  You can see a list of running services.  Thank you.  There you've done it again, Gina.  And you can quit any one of them from there.  Some applications have the option to quit inside of its own settings like Seismic.  You can go into Seismic settings and there's a quit option.  I think it's buried in like the more menu.  But but if there's a process running on your phone that's like sucking up a lot of battery and you can see that too, because Android will list the battery.  You know, I'll say your phone's been on for four hours and your display has used this battery.  That's also in settings.  Let's see.  I think it's in the running services in applications, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does that show you battery life?  No, see, I actually downloaded and use a task manager, which lets me just kind of mass kill everything.  And I do that from time to time.  If you go into settings about phone battery use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yeah, so my display has taken up 82 percent of the battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My live wallpapers has taken up seven percent.  Live wallpapers are cool, but they eat CPU.  Yeah, you can see a whole list there.  That's nice.  OK, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm getting there.  My list is beautiful.  You're you're you're I'm going to be taking communion shortly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, let's just say in Android, there are many sub menus and there's lots of tap.  Yeah, it's quite hard to get this logic up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speaking of logic, here's my main thing.  Give me a worldview so I understand the difference between the home screens, the little hash mark screens, the idea of a folder, the idea of a widget, what's a shortcut.  I'm just confused about the structure of this.  And I think it's simpler than I am giving it credit for.  But I'm there's some there's some elegant logic here that I'm not seeing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So OK, so you use a Mac, right?  Yeah.  So, I mean, the Android paradigm is much different from the iPhone paradigm.  And for these reasons, and I think this is why people who use the iPhone, who try Android at first, are just totally put off.  The Android paradigm is very similar to your desktop computer.  There's your desktop, which in Android terms are the home screens.  Those are the screens that you see when you kind of swipe left to right.  And then there's the menu, which would be the equivalent.  The menu when you tap the menu button, that little button that looks like a grid that shows you everything that's installed in the phone.  That's the equivalent is if you had an applications folder stack on your Mac's dock and you click it or if you just go to the applications folder, it shows you every single thing that's installed on the phone.  So the point of having both the applications menu and the home screens is just the same reason why you have a desktop on your desktop computer and an applications list.  The home screens give you the opportunity to put shortcuts to the things that you use the most.  So you don't have to scroll through the home applications menu every time.  Does that make sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That makes sense.  OK, so then if I hold down on the home screen and I let's say hit shortcut, I get a very limited list of a few things.  I don't understand that function.  The way to do a shortcut is just to hold down on the app in the in the grid thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the best way to do it.  That's faster. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's nothing special about this shortcut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no. And that, by the way, works best with Gina's folder tip because you can hold it down and drag it to a folder directly.  So if you want to add something to a folder, you just hold it down and drag it into the folder.  It works great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the add to home screen shortcuts dialogs, if you tap and hold your wallpaper, you get that add to home screen.  That also is pretty hierarchical.  So you only get a few choices.  You get shortcuts, widgets, folders, wallpapers, but then you drill down into each.  There's a lot of kinds of shortcuts, for instance.  Yeah, there's a lot of different kinds of shortcuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's worth investigating this.  I think widgets are fantastic.  I've even downloaded a few extra widgets because this is something that's lacking on the iPhone.  The ability to put, for instance, a big Facebook widget that gives you status updates or this widget that goes with a Google News and Weather application or even just a big weather and clock application.  This is something missing from the iPhone.  I love having the calendar right there that I can tap on it and see the calendar.  I think they've done a nice job with the widgets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really thought we were going to put a shortcut, for example, to get right to the Wi-Fi settings without having to go through the three layers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's what I would.  There's a set of widgets called beautiful widgets that are really great.  I use those all the time.  And there's a number of them, Bluetooth, GPS, plane mode, silent.  You can actually have a beautiful Wi-Fi, which will put a widget that you can just turn on or off there.  But there's also a larger widget.  I bet Gina uses this.  It comes on the phone where you get all of these wireless connections.  So I've turned off Bluetooth to save battery life because I'm not in my car right now.  Or I could change the screen.  And that general one is really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't really adjust things there, but you can just turn them on or off.  It toggles it on and off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, Jeff, if you wanted to do a shortcut directly to Wi-Fi settings, you tap and hold on the home screen.  And then you go to shortcuts and then scroll down and choose settings.  And then scroll down and choose Wi-Fi settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could take any setting and put it on there. That's cool.  You could do that also with a phone number if you want to text somebody with one touch or call somebody with one touch.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then just Wi-Fi settings at the bottom.  And so now you have a one-click access to your Wi-Fi settings right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's great. That's handy. That's a nice tip.  Gina, you've got to write a book on this. This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, she can do it in about a week, I think.  I got one odd thing. I tried to set up Google Voice Mail and it told me your network carrier is not configured for voicemail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Huh? Are you on T-Mobile?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I replaced... One of the things I love about this is I was able to replace T-Mobile's voicemail and everything with Google Voice.  I just use Google Voice for the voicemail. It's my voicemail application.  You're getting some weird anomaly there.  Okay, that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's strange because when it prompted me, I just hit yes, set up voicemail, and it did it.  It didn't do anything.  If it didn't work for you, just go to google.com slash voice in a regular browser on your desktop and then you can configure it there.  You just have to give it your T-Mobile number and it'll do it for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One more question. What was it? Oh, my contacts.  Is there any way to export my contacts from my Apple, from my Mac?  Because that's where I have my phone number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you have Snow Leopard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you go into your address book, you sync it with your Google account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can now.  That was something new in Snow Leopard.  I didn't have Snow Leopard.  Yep.  All right. Okay. So here's the story, guys.  Thursday, I called the company and the instructions and I got a return authorization code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Jeff, you're breaking my heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's where I am right now. You've done it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if it's going to be my main phone because it's still not an iPhone.  Oh, it's still a little rough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't find it rough at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that that's mostly a mismatch between expectations.  I find it very straightforward, easy to use.  And once you use it for a while, I find it more intuitive than the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're still capable of using it.  Once you use it for a while.  This is the thing. I think it has a learning curve that the iPhone just doesn't.  And I think that the iPhone has sort of set expectations on what smart, what app phones should look like.  So I think when someone switches from iPhone to Android, it's like, what is it?  In fact, Gruber, John Gruber has been cracking me up because someone gave him a Nexus One to play with  and he's been tweeting the most sort of sarcastic things about the Nexus One.  He's a total, you know, asthete and loves Apple products.  So it's kind of funny to listen to his impressions of Nexus One, like as he tries different things out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's bigotry. I think this is more elegant than the iPhone.  Believe me, I'm open-minded and I believe this is more elegant in every way than the iPhone.  And in fact, don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What Gina just proved my point against you, Leo, I think, is that it's what I said I think last week,  that Apple tries so hard to think like we do that we don't have to think to use it.  I feel constrained by the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The fact that I can only put an icon on the desktop is a huge constraint  and it really limits what I can do with the phone's display.  Things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is your Mustang a stick shift?  Yeah.  Yeah, you say, well, there it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, I think the iPhone...  If you use this phone for a month and went back to the iPhone,  you would see what I'm seeing, which is the iPhone feels antiquated compared to this.  I really feel like it's constrained compared to this. I really do, Jeff.  Yeah, yeah. I believe you.  Gina, have you seen this thing when you press and hold the...  I love this. There's a few things in 2.1 I really like,  these little ellipses on the left and right that let me go.  But if you press and hold, you get a thumbnail of the home screens?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, this is so slick.  I didn't see that. Wait a second. What button are you pressing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you know on the bottom of your phone, you have the ellipses  that let you go to a different screen?  Right.  Press and hold it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's a new one to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, that's new in 2.1. Isn't that slick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, that's the funny thing about this. This is so meant for engineers.  No, it's not. No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?  You've poisoned your mind with this iPhone thing, Jeff.  You need to get away from it.  Siva, what do you use? What's your phone?  I have an iPhone, but I hate it.  Okay, Siva, this is the phone for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, except that I live in the middle of nowhere  where T-Mobile doesn't work very well.  That's the biggest drawback.  T-Mobile's great in Prague and Budapest,  but it's not good in places like rural Virginia, Vermont, Westchester County.  And it's the opposite for Verizon, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It works great where you are, but not in Prague.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I lived in New York for a long time. I used T-Mobile.  It was beautiful in the city, but as soon as I got to Westchester, it didn't work.  As soon as I got to Vermont, it didn't work.  It was great in Europe, and that's why I had it.  Mostly because I was spending more time in Europe than in most places in the United States.  I moved here, had to break my contract for both my wife's phone and my phone with T-Mobile.  Had to then sign up with AT&T so I could get a phone that would work in Europe.  Used a BlackBerry for a year until the trackball broke.  My wife went to the first generation of my phone.  When it came time for me to replace that BlackBerry, they gave me a great deal.  I couldn't refuse it. I wanted to figure out why my wife liked the iPhone so much.  I love the apps. I hate all of the Apple native services.  I hate being imprisoned by this box.  That's what this is. This is open, ideologically.  Ideologically, I'm totally with the G-Phone, but I don't want to play...  But it's not a sacrifice, though, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem is you think this is a sacrifice to be open.  I don't want to think about my phone.  I'm going to show you the killer app. This is it.  This is the killer app. Are you ready?  I'm in Twitteroid, but it would work anywhere that you can type.  When you hit the typing key, you notice there's a little microphone.  I am dictating my tweet right now.  You can dictate anywhere.  Okay, I want this.  Anywhere there is a keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I put it on the Wiki. Fred Wilson did that for a whole blog post.  Really?  It was almost English.  No, no, no. First of all, you do have to train yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not perfect. You have to be online because it uses the Google servers for the recognition.  You have to speak slowly and enunciate clearly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know how easy it is for me, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I'll give you another one. You stop at every period because it doesn't do periods.  You have to stop. You have to say a sentence.  Let it recognize it.  Check it. Press the period key and go on.  I have had perfect dictation.  I've been tweeting with it for a couple of days and text messaging for a couple of days.  That to me is the killer app. It's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the question I put up on the Wiki.  Are we going to have a keyboard-less world or is that like having a paperless office?  It'll never come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think it solves that problem, although you feel like a dork when you're tweeting in public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One extra tip for the voice-to-text.  If you're driving or you don't want to look at the keyboard to find that little tiny microphone key,  you can swipe your finger across the keyboard to activate it.  That's a great tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Again, it's OS by Easter egg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it thoroughly documented somewhere, Gina, or is it just rediscovered and shared?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have just discovered this one from one of my...  Actually, I discovered it in one of the Google Android tutorial videos.  Another good one is if the keyboard is up and you want it to go away,  sometimes it blocks the Remember Me checkbox.  You can swipe down to put it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's cool because I'm always pressing the back button to do that.  Swipe down.  There you go. You have to swipe quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Listen, Leo, I'm thrilled that you feel this way, but I agree with Jeff a little bit.  I love it.  I still feel like it is an operating system designed by engineers.  I think that's clear.  I think that it has multiple layers of hierarchy,  which the iPhone doesn't have for better or for worse.  I like it because it gives me more options,  but the bad news is that things get hidden.  I do think it's a little bit like OS by Easter egg.  I had no idea that if you tapped and hold those little ellipses that that could come up.  In fact, to add to that tip, if you tap and hold the home button,  you can see all your currently running apps.  It's sort of like...  Oh, yeah. Isn't that nice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alt-tab on Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  These things are hidden. They're not obvious.  I get a lot of joy from discovering this stuff.  Me too.  And the discovery time with an iPhone is pretty short.  Because it doesn't do diddly-doo.  Because it doesn't do as much.  But at the same time, do most people want to invest the time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It went to the work for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what, Jeff, I'm telling you, and this is the same thing we said last week,  but you may never get to this point, but just give it a little more time, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it seems to me that the iPhone is Baidu, and this phone is Google.  Because basically Baidu satisfies most people in China for most of their consumer interests,  and they're not willing to dig deep, and they just want the easy access to the music.  And if you're a specialized user, a little bit more technologically hip,  you might be attracted to Google.  And so you may end up with the same market share.  If Google's lucky, they get the same market share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thanks for bringing us back right around to the top of the table.  But let me tell you, this is my great hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of all the things that Google has done and put itself into in the past five years,  the mobile phone environment is to me the most exciting  and the one in which it can make the most difference in my life and in the world.  Because the mobile phone system in the United States is embarrassing and cruel and expensive.  I mean, I ended up that switch from T-Mobile to AT&T cost me about $1,200 all said and done  with all the broken contracts and new boxes.  Well, let me point out something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Both AT&T and Verizon this week announced new rate plans  because T-Mobile's pay-as-you-go rate plan is starting.  I'm telling you, this is the crack in the egg.  Finally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So do we think Google caused that at T-Mobile?  Do you think that was Google's good work behind the scenes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it was for this phone. Yeah, you bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Listen, if I'm going to wear the Google fanboy hat, it's going to be for the phone activities.  What I want to see though is a real sort of severing of the habits of long-term contracts,  the idea that phones have to be locked to service carriers.  I mean, those are the sorts of things that Google really should and I think hopefully will play a part in.  That's why I wish they had put the AT&T frequency on this phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because I wouldn't have to go to T-Mobile.  I think that was probably a sob to T-Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was, I'm sure, the tit for tat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that was a compromise not on showing you Falun Gong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or not putting in multi-touch.  Look, they live in this world as we do.  No, it's their world.  We live in Google's world. It's Google's world. We just live in it.  I think this phone is the closest to an uncompromised phone I've ever seen and it's unlocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Any frustrations with it, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there are a few apps that I love on the iPhone like Mint.  The biggest frustration is no Audible.  But Audible is working with Google. It's up to Google to provide it.  But Audible is working with them and they say this first half of 2010 they'll have it.  That's the biggest thing is it's not an iPod so I can't listen to my audiobooks.  However, you'll see in my tool of the week there is a very good way to sync this, which I'll talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to hear that. I was going to say the media management is not as good as the iPhone to be expected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you can mount an SD card and I put a 16-gig SD card in it.  That is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's great.  The replaceable battery, being able to add more space to stores, definitely. It's fantastic.  But the media player isn't as good as it could be.  One of my problems is sometimes I accidentally tap one of the buttons on the lower part of the phone while I'm typing.  That's kind of annoying.  That's kind of annoying. I never did that with the G1 because those buttons were hard buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, these buttons don't seem as responsive sometimes and I think that's the same issue is that they're soft buttons.  So it's kind of part of the touchscreen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the funny thing about it is when I hold the phone in my hand, I'm fine with the bottom buttons.  But when I put it on a table and try to hit it, it somehow doesn't work. It's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure they did that on purpose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other good thing about this is that it does, correct me if I'm wrong, this does do flash, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Supposedly it will be able to. It doesn't come with flash.  Here's what I found was I called into Howard Stern's show on Thursday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, you were on Howard Stern's show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Thursday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How was that?  It was fine. I love calling in to Howard.  I called in because he was talking about Jay Leno and I told him about the time when I gave, I was TV critic and TV guide.  And when Jay premiered on The Tonight Show, I gave him a bad review and Jay called me.  What? You didn't like the show?  No, Jay, I didn't.  What did you like about it?  That's what I said in the review, Jay.  Were you going to watch it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tell the truth though. It was nothing like being on Twitter, right? I mean, come on.  No, not at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can get strippers. You want some strippers, we'll get you strippers, whatever you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel very bad about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, don't worry. Believe me, I don't want Howard Stern's audience listening to this show.  Hey, that's me. But I mentioned on the air that I'm so frustrated I can't get Howard on my iPhone.  The hilarious thing was that in minutes my email was just jammed.  Sure, sure.  He told me how to do it. There's a couple applications. I'm hesitant to say it out loud because the Chinese government will go after us.  There's the illegal redirection of the Howard Stern feed.  Pocket tunes and that kind of stuff. So it kind of fakes Flash.  I went onto the Nexus and went to Sirius and went to the player, which is a Flash player, and I got pretty far along.  It seemed to be playing and then I couldn't hear anything.  Oh.  So there's something there. But I think that's it. If you can do Flash, as much as I don't like Flash, getting Flash on this will open it up more too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are also people who illegally redirect the Sirius feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I still had to put in my password. I still had to pay $2.99 a month to get online.  Oh, that's good.  So it was, you know, Sirius lost nothing in this.  It was legit. Oh, that's good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, we're running real long, but this has been such a great conversation.  Let's quickly get to our tip number and tool. But after a commercial, how about that?  From our friends at Citrix, the folks who do GoToMeeting, a great solution for people who don't want to travel, who would like to get more done and travel less.  GoToMeeting is an indispensable part of how I work today, and I invite you to give it a try for free.  The idea is using their great remote access technology, the same technology as in GoToMyPC.  They allow you very quickly, very easily to set up online meetings.  You can be on the conference call once you've got this installed.  In fact, you can install it right now quickly. GoToMeeting.com slash twig, 30 days free.  And while you're on the conference call, you click a button, you start the meeting and you say, here's the meeting ID.  Go to GoToMeeting.com. Now you'll see my desktop. You can see my Mac or my PC desktop.  You can see the presentation, the spreadsheet, the websites, whatever it is we're talking about.  You can share control so you can collaborate. You can even, once you've got it running, you can even,  they can give you control of their computer so your clients can say, well, here's my thinking.  What do you think? It's so powerful. It truly is indispensable for sales, product demos, training sessions, collaboration.  And even one meeting a month will save you over a plane ticket or even a drive across town.  It's just $49 a month for as many meetings as you want, as long as you want,  including phone and voice over IP conferencing. I want you to try it right now. Go to GoToMeeting.com slash twig and try it free for 30 days.  You're going to love it. GoToMeeting.com slash twig.  And now time for Gina's tool of the week.  Tip. I'm sorry, you're a tip. I'm a tool. I always forget. I don't want to be a tool, but I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Quick tip this week. Google has just launched the ability for you to upload files up to, I believe, 250 megabytes in size to Google Docs.  So Google Docs becomes kind of this portable storage place to bring stuff.  Now, it's not as, I think you get one gigabyte of space so you can zip up.  But you can buy more, right? For 25 cents.  You can buy more. Yeah. I think you get one gigabyte for free and you can buy more.  So you can upload big old zip files or music files or something and put them in Google Docs.  The attachment size limit is, I believe, bigger than on Gmail and most email clients.  So it's a similar kind of thing to Dropbox or even like an online backup like Mozi or Carbonite.  Just this place in the cloud to store your stuff and get to access to from any computer.  And they said that they're rolling this out over the next few weeks.  So you may not have in your Google Docs account right now, but when you do, I think it'll be in a button that just says upload next to the right under the Google Docs logo.  And you can choose your file and and still it there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if you still just in time, just in time for the Chinese government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Exactly. Get your stuff.  I actually thought about making this my tool, Gina.  And then I thought maybe this wouldn't be the week to do that.  Get all your stuff up there so the Chinese can see it quickly and make sure it's as much sensitive information as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely. Social Security numbers, bank accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really do wonder if some companies will have second thoughts about using Google Docs because of this.  I imagine. I think the Twitter hack should have done that already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.  And that was that was pretty embarrassing.  And to have those two companies involved in something just so obvious.  I mean, apparently it was just a like a dumb password issue.  Right. I mean, it wasn't even exactly a forced hack.  I mean, brute force hack. It was just a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are the chances that next week the New York Times will report that Google's password was password?  No, no, no, it was Marissa.  Jeff Jarvis, time for your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, according to Flurry, I don't even know them.  They're a software company. They put out a report.  I don't know about the relative first week sales of phones and the Nexus one.  And the Nexus one, they say, sold twenty thousand.  Not many.  The Droid, two hundred fifty thousand.  Of course, the Droid had the benefit of considerable advertising, not just the Google home page, but also TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Verizon, let's not forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true. And then, however, you know, a fanboy that I still am for Apple, the iPhone first week was one point six million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is, by the way, can I just point out that Nokia sells more phones in a day than Apple sells in a month?  Just, you know, if you're going by numbers alone, people are still buying the Nokia candy bar phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that true?  Oh, yeah.  In Europe, right? I mean, globally.  It's not here.  It's everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, you know what I saw today? I remember a few months ago you had talked about how much you wanted the new Super Nokia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And nine hundred. I have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So apparently Apple is putting forth a pretty strong patent challenge to keep it out of North America.  Oh, interesting. Well, Nokia sued Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's a mess.  Yeah, over something else, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So this apparently like dueling patent battles right now to limit competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and Kodak is now suing both Google and Apple over photo displaying.  If you can't compete in this country, what do you do? You sue.  Well, that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me tell you, the patent system right now is so tangled, so thick with all of these, you know, broad and obvious patents that were approved, you know, five, ten, fifteen years ago, just on a on a basic memo back of a napkin.  And you have these, you know, these patent troll companies like the one that almost took down research in motion, you know, gathering up all these patents, finding some way to hold somebody hostage.  And it's a huge drag. And we pay for it.  And we pay for it. Who knows how many dollars out of the five hundred it's going to cost you for an open droid, you know, an open droid actually has to go for these hostage patents, right?  This sort of extortion that's built into the price of almost anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, Gina, do you think you oh, you never used a droid. I used a droid. I do think that the Nexus one is better than the droid. It's faster. It's got a gigahertz Snapdragon in it, which really makes a big difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it doesn't have a big clunky keyboard. That's not really easy to use to begin with.  Forget the clunky keyboard that we don't want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Better screen. I think it's a better choice. And the 2.1 is an improvement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, 2.1 is great. And hopefully the droid users will get 2.1. It'll get pushed down over the air to droid users soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope so. Yeah, because it's nice.  My tip of the week is for people who have Android, not necessarily a Nexus one, but Android in there saying, well, I really wish I could sync my songs, my iTunes music, that kind of thing.  It comes to us from DVD John, who's, I guess, gone legit or semi legit anyway. His company is called Double Twist, Double Twist.com.  This is a free program for Mac or Windows. You can download, install, and then it really is slick. It sees very much like iTunes does.  It sees what's on your droid phone, and you can sync that up to it. But it also sees what's in your iTunes library.  It has an Amazon mp3 music store, so you can buy stuff. You can add feeds.  It's pretty sophisticated and a great way to get photos, movies, and music onto your droid platform. Absolutely free. Double Twist.com.  And I think this is a really great solution for people who are saying, well, Nexus One or droid is a great platform, but it's not an mp3. It's not a music player.  I think this really puts it back into contention. So you just obviously install everything straight onto the memory card.  It does it automatically, yeah. In fact, I would suggest upgrading your SD card. It comes with a 4G card on the Nexus One, but you can get a 16G card for under $100, and I think that's a nice, if you're going to put a lot of stuff on there.  The only thing missing to me at this point is if I get audible on here, I'd be done with the iPhone. I really would. So there's my tip. Double Twist.com. That's my tool. That's what I'm using, yeah.  Oh, you know it already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I knew. Double Twist is actually, it says uncanny looks very similar to iTunes and with album art and the different ways to sync.  It's really great.  It's pretty great, yeah, and that is what I'm using.  There's another one from Saling for the folks who use a Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A Mac. Saling.com. Saling software has a sync program. It's very similar, but it's not free, so why not use Double Twist?  Siva, so great to have you on. Thank you so much for adding your perspective to this, which one of the biggest news days since this show launched, and frankly, every week's been huge. Google's been so busy since we launched this show.  Siva's blog is called The Googleization of Everything. It's a place to go to read about Google and his thoughts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When is the book coming out, Siva?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We don't have a pub date yet, but it's probably fall. It's days like, weeks like this have slowed it down.  Yeah, no kidding. I bet you would love Google to stop doing stuff.  I thought I had a totally solid China chapter, and now I had to break right back into it.  They are a moving target.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They really are.  Next book's about General Motors. Something that doesn't change that fast, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go. Yeah, newspapers.  No, no, that's not a bad one right now. Jeff Jarvis covers the media. Go ahead, I'm sorry, Siva.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Next book is actually about newspapers. We'll talk about that some other time.  Oh, Siva, we've got to talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's Jeff Jarvis's book. He's covering the end of journalism as we know it. He also teaches this.  Or causing it, some would say.  Some would say causing it. At Cooney at the City University of New York in the graduate program of journalism there, and he also is the author of the Buzz Machine blog and the book, What Would Google Do? available on YouTube.  What Would Google Do? available everywhere including Audible.com.  And Gina Trapani is still working on the complete guide to Google Wave, completewaveguide.com any day now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I'm working on the first edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, is Wave, I mean we don't hear much about Wave these days. Is it being changed a lot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's definitely not getting the kind of press that it was, and the changes that are coming out are like small kind of, you know, dribs and jabs of this, that, and the other thing.  There haven't been any major releases, but just little things here and there. This week they launched Suggested Contacts.  You know, if you create a new wave and go to add someone, it algorithmically recommends the people who you wave with the most, which is nice.  They added the ability to kind of expand your image thumbnails inside of a wave. I mean, they're adding little things here and there.  I'm kind of, I don't know, I lay awake at night and hope that there's going to be like a major wave release that integrates with Gmail and like makes the product do all the things that like I feel like it can do.  And just isn't there yet, but it hasn't happened yet. So we'll see. Hopefully it won't happen before, or it will happen before I put out the first edition because I want my book to be obsolete in the first month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The preview PDF is now available at CompleteWaveGuide.com for $6 as Gina says, the price of a sandwich.  Better than a sandwich and more nutritional and sustaining. But Gina, I do want to concur with Jeff. When is your Android book coming out? That's the one.  Oh man. It's begging for it. It's begging. The problem is, Android is in moving target. It really is. I'd hate to kind of try to pin this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We had some requests in Twitter to keep going with this topic of Gina explains the Android to Jeff and the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think maybe next week if nothing happens, if Google would just take a week off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff, keep using the phone. Like, take the phone with you this week and jot down questions.  Let's give more questions. Let's do it. More questions. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'd be happy to. I love talking about that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I wake up in the middle of the night. I play with the phone for three hours. It's my new girlfriend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know it's sad, but it's true. I love this thing. I was going to make a crack about all the porn apps in the Android market, but I'm going to complain about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know nothing about that. That's not what I'm playing with. No, I don't. I'm not looking at that. I'm just loving this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You search for mint in the Android market. Some enterprising developer realized that everyone in the world wants a mint app for mint.com.  But it's actually you get daily mint girls as result number one. So, yeah, I'm breaking out the S.D.K.  Or whatever. Get distracted. Take that China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You wouldn't see that in the iTunes store. Gina's blog is smarterware.org. A great place to go. Some great.  In fact, we didn't even talk about some of the really good articles this week you put up there.  I actually had them bookmarked and we didn't get around to them. How to tether your Android phone. I thought that that was going to be your tip.  You do have to root it though. Do you have to root it? You don't have to. There are three ways to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One is by rooting. Another is by sort of being a sys admin. And the third is cost $30, but it's super simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  PDA net. That's what I'm going to do. It worked beautifully for me on my old trio. May it rest in peace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right. PDA net. Yeah, it works great on Android. I mean, it's 30 bucks.  In fact, you can use it for free, but you just can't access any HTTPS, any encrypted connections.  But yeah, pay 30 bucks, install the software on your computer and you put the app on your Android phone and you can get online from anywhere.  And actually, I said in my blog post, I think I'm getting old because I decided to go that route instead of rooting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think given China, I think everything will be HTTPS now.  So you can't use Gmail if you have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's very clever though. That's a very clever way to do the freemium, which is you can see if it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just can't do Gmail. Not that you need to because you got Gmail on there. That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you'd have your Gmail cached in the Gmail app on Android, but I'm pretty sure that that app makes encrypted connections to Gmail so it wouldn't sync.  You know what I mean? So if you were tethering, it wouldn't sync.  But you could still use your Gmail offline using the Gmail app on Android, which is pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do you do Android screenshots? Are you just taking a picture?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's the worst. There's no screenshot app.  This is the one thing.  The iPhone, you press the two buttons and you have a screenshot.  With Android, it is like a process.  You have to install the SDK, connect the phone to your computer, bring up this debugger thing, and then save screenshots from there.  It is a rigmarole.  It's one of those things where if Android developers want people to show off Android, there should be an easier way to take screenshots.  So yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We should look. I bet if there's an API call to shoot the screen, it would be an easy app to write.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There are some apps, but you have to have root access to run.  So there's some sort of hardware layer protection in the hardware that isn't isn't letting Android take screenshots.  It's weird. I don't understand why they haven't figured this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We want Android to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We could do that.  Really great blog.  Must read if you're into iPhone or anything, anything productivity wise.  SmarterWear.org.  Siva, Jeff, Gina, thank you so much for joining us.
