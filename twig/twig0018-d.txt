And on the line with us back from her sojourn in England is the wonderful Gina Turpani.  Nice to see you, Gina. Thanks for coming back to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Great to be back. I missed you guys. I didn't have my hour-long tech therapy session last week.  So great to be back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good. Good. We missed you terribly. We're really glad to have you back.  Jeff Jarvis is also here. Held down the fort while you were gone. Good to see you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Always good to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm glad to see Gina's got a little plaid behind her because we have our resident Scott in studio with us, so to speak, via Skype.  Pete Cashmore from Aberdeen. Hey, Pete.  Hey, Leo.  Pete's, of course, the creator of Mashable, editor-in-chief of that great website that covers Web 2.0 better than just about anybody, mashable.com.  And he's at Mashable, and Gina's at Gina Turpani, and Jeff is at Jeff Jarvis on Twitter if you want to berate them.  And I'm at Leo Laporte. And let's talk about Google. Did you get to install? I tried. I came very close to getting Chromio OS working, Gina, but then I had to leave for Thanksgiving.  Did you get to play with it at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I played with it as the virtual machine image, which was pretty slow. But yeah, you know, I wasn't so excited about it.  And then the announcement came out and I started to read all the coverage and then I got really excited about it.  And when I tried it, I mean, I'm feeling pretty optimistic about it, pretty bullish about it, though cautiously.  I mean, I live in my web browser already. I write for the web. Most of my writing is for websites, except for the book.  Well, my current book, I'm actually writing in a MediaWiki installation. So I am writing in the web.  You're writing it in Wiki?  But everything else is in the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're actually writing it in Wiki?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. The complete waveguide.com. The whole book is in MediaWiki, which is the software that powers Wikipedia.  And yeah, I just hit that edit button and type right into that text field.  I know it's risky because I've had web browsers crash on me, but that's happening less and less.  And even when I was writing at Lifehacker, I would type all my posts inside the web browser.  I wasn't drafting them in text editors, although I know other bloggers that do write in a text editor.  Actually, I'd be interested to know if Pete writes in his browser or in a regular text editor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you work in your CMS, Pete?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I'm so used to WordPress that everything I do, even if it's for someone else, I do like a Comet CNN.  And I insist on doing it in the WordPress interface because I just don't use desktop software anymore at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Gina, you don't use Wiki syntax when you write, though, do you? I mean, brackets and stuff like that, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, now that I'm working on the book and we are using MediaWiki, yeah, I've gotten used to using Wiki syntax.  Like, you know, the footnotes and things, you know, we're using MediaWiki plugins to generate those automatically.  So I am sort of getting used to that. And, you know, when I was writing Lifehacker, I was writing HTML.  I was typing out my, you know, my a tags, my link tags, my image tags. And so, you know, you just kind of get used to it.  I mean, I'm sure most people don't write that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use text expander to do all my tags. So if I type a href, it types out the whole href thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, yes, I was doing the same thing. And I'm doing similar things for the Wiki markup as well.  But yeah, so I mean, I live in a web browser anyway. So Chrome OS makes a lot of sense to me.  Although I think that, you know, Gruber's comment about it being, you know, the bicycle, you know,  replacing your second car with a bicycle was actually a very good analogy.  Before we get to Chrome OS, let me just, as long as for completeness sake, Jeff, what do you write in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I write in WordPress mostly. If I'm going to be offline, I'll go to text edit.  So I don't mess it up with those stupid Microsoft bad characters. But I had to do the book in Word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are any of you at all interested in Office 2010, the web versions, as we're talking about cloud computing?  That sounds like we've got three people who live on the web who aren't going to use, they're not even using Google Docs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's either going to be the web browser or just a plain text editor.  I mean, I use a plain text editor to code and to write when I'm offline or if I'm writing something, you know,  not that's not going to be published on the web, which is rare for me.  I'm not that excited about Microsoft Office Online. I just kind of feel like, you know, Google Docs,  Oh, ho been there, done that. And I don't know, it's just I'm thinking about nightmare things like curly braces  or, you know, curly apostrophes and auto correct nightmares and HTML export.  Smart quotes.  Yeah, smart quotes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All those things that it wants to do for you, whether you want it or not, like a nanny.  Right.  And then you try to undo something, you've got to delve into Bill's brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or worse, Clippy's brain.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's really interesting because one of the things I thought about with Chromium at Chrome OS was that  Microsoft in a way was playing right into Google's hand by making the next version of Office essentially,  you know, live on the web.  But it sounds like it's too little too late anyway. It's like over for them.  Is Chrome OS a threat to Macintosh, to Microsoft?  Let me ask Pete, because we kind of heard Gina's opinion that it's you agree with Gruber that it's like switch into a bicycle.  Pete, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think, you know, increasingly we're asking whether we need the OS.  I certainly just live in the browser, whatever I, you know, the OS is really irrelevant to me.  So, you know, I think I really like the Mac hardware, so I'd probably not be having one of these netbooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's kind of an interesting choice on Google's part to say we're going to have, you know, premium hardware specification.  But it wasn't. Gina, have you installed native Chrome OS yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, not yet. That's a I only have my Mac with me and I'm traveling right now.  So but as soon as I get home to my PC, I'm either going to try to boot from the, you know, from the USB or, you know, I've got a netbook in the house.  See if I can get that to get that to go.  You know, I heard a lot of people kind of complaining that there was, you know, certain hardware specs that are going to provide, you know, the Google certified Google experience is only going to be for certain kinds of hardware.  But the fact that it's open source just means that, you know, surely there'll be images and and executives that will work on lots of different kinds of hardware, just not officially supported by Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. I mean, that's what we did.  I use this Hexa. The guy's name is Hexa.  He's on Twitter at at sign H-E-X-X-E-H and he made a bootable image.  He's in the UK actually.  He made a bootable image and then add instructions for creating it.  And on a Mac on Windows or on Linux, if you go to his website, carbon dot H-E-X-X-E-H dot net slash Chromium OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that the virtual Leo or is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, it's a boot. It makes a USB boot drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I also saw it's up on the front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It works on the Mac as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now this is an interesting thing.  I don't think it does work on a Mac.  But what I've been doing is putting I should try it on the Mac.  I've been putting it in different machines and booting and it boots in a well, the Mac cut said this last week.  And I would expect that what Matt had made is very similar to what this ends up being.  This is just a you just compile it and it works on a surprisingly broad range of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would buy a USB.  I just looked at eBay to see if anybody was selling them.  And unfortunately, all I found was vitamins under Chromium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You need more Chromium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Non geek, you know, quasi geek that I am.  I just buy the USB and put it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did that with the patch stick for the Apple TV.  So I'm with you on that.  I think that's not a bad way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On the front feed, there's a story that a Dell employee customized the OS for the Dell Mini 10V.  And so and announced that to the world.  So in that sense, Dell's the most selling Chrome now.  By the way, when I looked at the specs for that machine, I was really amused that the one next up on it is is called a Twitter machine.  The mini Twitter.  That's what you do that's special for Twitter.  But it says it's the machine that's ideal for Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all you need to Twitter.  But you know, I think that this survey that we did right at the beginning here was very telling that here you hear we've got three professional writers.  And none of them are using a word processor, you know, let alone Microsoft Office.  You're not even using Google Docs.  They're working in their CMS.  They're working in a basically a form on a web page.  So Chrome OS is plenty for you guys.  And you guys are pros.  I mean, that means that that means it tells me a lot.  It means a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's mainly the offline question that I still scratch my head about is that is that gears.  We'll talk later, I think about about the changes in Gmail for offline, but it's not sufficient yet for the plane ride.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the issue.  The offline thing, I think, is an issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's not hard to fix.  I don't think, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it works fine for me to do use gears to do calendar updates.  It just when I get off the plane, it syncs up to my calendar.  I don't see why it would be so hard to make a local word processor that didn't just uploads it to docs or somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, Chromium OS doesn't use gears.  Does it? Does it just use HTML5's offline capability or does it use gears?  I was confused about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Chrome doesn't use gears, does it?  But now that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Chrome for Windows definitely includes gears.  It does use gears.  It has a gears component. It does.  And the Chromium build for Mac does not.  Gears doesn't work on Mac 10.6, which is my complaint of the week, actually.  But I thought I saw Mark Pilgrim's tweet that Chromium OS, Chromium's Chrome, is using the HTML5 offline capability versus gears.  What does that look like? How does that work?  I mean, yeah, that's a good question.  I'm not sure what the differences are between gears capabilities and HTML5's offline capabilities.  I mean, I do know that with Wave, you need gears to do things like drag and drop files into a Wave.  But Wave takes advantage of a lot of HTML5's capabilities, which makes me think that maybe it'll be a little limited.  Yes, you're correct.  Leo, have you tried logging into Chromium OS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's as far as I got because at first I didn't know it.  I thought, oh, what's my password? I thought, well, I'll enter my Google account.  But the problem was I wasn't online, so it didn't do anything.  Then I found out later that this Hexa has a default password, which wasn't documented anywhere, which is facepunch, I think.  Or no, I think it's Chromium OS and then blank. Anyway, it's some default thing.  So truthfully, that's as far as I got. I had it running and then I had to leave for Thanksgiving.  So it was extraordinarily frustrating.  And then Jennifer had the painters in and the bedroom got moved around and painted and I don't even know where anything is now.  I've lost my Chromium OS.  Why? You don't like that, are you?  I've lost it. She just doesn't understand.  Honey, where's my USB key with Chromium OS? What's it look like?  It looks like my thumb.  All of your 500 USB keys you have?  It looks like my thumb.  So according to the demo that they did of Chromium OS, Google turns to HTML5 to solve this.  So yes, you're absolutely right.  But that's not new. I think that they were doing that in mobile too.  I'd be very interested to see. Gmail uses HTML5. I'd be very interested to see how that works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if the machine is offline, you can log in with credentials into Chromium OS.  Yes.  That's what you're saying. You log in with the facepunch password?  Bogus credentials.  And it got you in.  Yes.  Right. And it just says, and Chrome launches and just says you're not connected to the network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got a lot of snotty tweets from people who said, it's your Google account.  I said, but I can't. I'm not online.  And then they said, what good is an online operating system if you're not online?  But yes, no, you can actually use it without being online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that is the other thing that concerned me, Leo. I was going to get, I had a geek moment or Dr. Strangelove moment.  Stop me. Stop me. And I was going to buy that Dell or the clamshell that Matt Cutts used and just do it and take it on a trip to Washington with me, be gutsy.  But then I realized that my AT&T laptop internet card isn't going to work.  If I had Mifi, I guess that would work when I'm away from Wi-Fi.  Right. But otherwise, it's not going to have drivers. It's not going to be any good. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's an interesting point about the Mifi. That would work really well, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the reason to get it, I think. Now I have another excuse to get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love Mifi. Oh, don't get me started talking about Mifi.  That's the Sprint and Verizon both offer these credit card sized Wi-Fi access points that are based on EVDO.  So your EVDO works and you've got Wi-Fi.  It's one way I use to get my iPhone on Verizon's network. I use Verizon's Mifi. Works quite nicely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think part of Google's strategy that's worth bringing up there is that they're doing this free Wi-Fi in airports.  Right. And they're kind of approaching it from the other angle, which is what if we just blanket the whole world in free Wi-Fi?  I mean, the more people that are on the web, the more money Google makes.  So I think they're kind of approaching that from the other direction, which is just assume Wi-Fi everywhere in, I don't know, five years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you're right, Pete. But between now and then there are some pain points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, like right now. Yeah, that's what I think. I think you're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's where the strategy obviously goes. Absolutely. And when that happens, we're freed from all kinds of oligarchies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just looking. Somebody just sent me a link to a website for Ronix.  I'm just looking for a website that's called P-H-O-R-O-N-I-X.com that has done benchmarks of Chrome OS, Moblin, which is Intel's Unix mobile OS, and Ubuntu.  And I'm just trying to scan these to see which is faster. Chrome OS uses...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are we talking about Startup?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, that's what's interesting about this. It's not really Startup. Obviously, Chrome OS is the winner on Startup with seven seconds Startup.  Nothing can do that. But Chrome OS is the lowest average memory usage. So it's got a low footprint.  CPU usage, Chrome OS the highest at 66.3%. They're running a synthetic benchmark that they use.  I'm going to have to parse all this. This just came in, otherwise I would have had it a little bit better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, Leo, one thing I was wondering about too is that if you really push the Chrome OS stats to the limit, how cheap can a machine get?  Does this finally get to the one laptop per child level where you just need connectivity, but you need so little of the machine, and if it operates okay offline for homework, do we get down to a really basic, basic computer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's also not fair. These benchmarks are not fair really to Chrome OS because it is not really shipping. This is a very early version, I would presume.  Used more power, 15% more power than the rest. Not a huge amount, 13 watts, but more power than the rest.  It could be less.  It may well be when it ships in September. It may well be less. It's not really fair to take a very early pre-release and say these are the numbers still of interest.  I'll put those numbers in the show notes and you can take a look at it for yourself, folks.  Speaking of, anything else we want to say about Chrome OS before we move on? I think I made this point last week.  I think one of the most interesting things is maybe how that Linux to the desktop that we've all been talking about finally gets here via courtesy Google.  This may be the version of Linux that more people use on the desktop than any other.  Did you do any shopping in New York City, Gina, Black Friday? Did you run out and face the crowds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not at all. I was actually on a plane all day yesterday. I missed all Black Friday sales.  Smart one.  I landed last night at like 10 p.m.  Smart one.  Yeah, I'm not much of a shopper. I must admit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The reason I was asking is if you'd made it to Times Square, you could have seen that giant Droid ad. Did you hear about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, that sounded cool. I saw it in the links today. That sounded really cool. That I would have liked to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google, Verizon, Reuters, because Reuters owns the big screen.  A huge building, right.  And somebody called RGA, I guess that's the advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a huge ad or a high-end ad shop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Took over the largest displays on Times Square to do a Droid ad, which was also displaying Google's voice search.  Now it doesn't work anymore, but when you call the toll-free number and you did a Google search by voice, the results were displayed on the Reuters sign or the NASDAQ sign on Times Square.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd like to know who was moderating that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, how long before people started to game that sucker, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Things could have gotten ugly.  Oh yeah.  Even with safe search on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I can't find anything on YouTube on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you'd think they'd have posted some video by now.  You would. You would.  They had that giant red eye of Sauron Droid. I saw a picture of that.  For 20 hours straight, actually this has been going on for the past couple of weeks, but only for little chunks at a time, but it ran all day on Friday.  I know you go to Times Square all the time, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep, I work there.  Do you?  Yes, CUNY Graduate School of Journalism is next to the New New York Times building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I have to give you credit on the show from now on. I always forget to mention CUNY.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't hurt to mention the book a few times first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, what would Google do? What would Google do? What would Google do and CUNY? There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what? Actually that works because I finally got around to getting that book on Audible this week.  So the advertising does convert.  Yay.  It's a fantastic book. What chapter am I on? About three, I think.  Thank you very much.  Just talking about like control and how you've basically got to give it over to the consumer.  I'm not a book about Google. This is a lot, lot broader.  You know, and I think that was kind of my expectation that it was going to be a book kind of broadly about Google.  But it's much, much wider about that whole transition of consumers taking control and companies having to, you know, trust people with their brand, essentially.  Yeah, that's what Jeff's so good at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wasn't fishing for that, but I'll keep fishing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it got to go affordable as well.  There you go. It works for two. Two for one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't have Audible in the show today, so you can stop saying their name.  So I'm giving them free advertising.  No, no, I'm just kidding.  They have to pay to be here.  I'm just kidding. I did work, when we worked at Tech TV, they would tape over the logos for Apple and Dell and all the computers saying they're going to have to pay if they want their logo on screen.  Didn't work, by the way. I don't think we ever got any advertising from them.  So thanks to all the people who tweeted that the show was on. I wasn't able to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As soon as Pete tweeted it, that got spread like crazy.  He's a damned vector for the virus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The king of retweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twitter's fascinating, isn't it? It's just a whole ecosystem that we didn't really see coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, absolutely. And now, I mean, as you say, people are making Twitter computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what though, Leo? I think we kind of overbaked it a little bit in media.  I think we're a little bit pro Twitter when you look at the graphs and you look at Facebook.  There's just no comparison at all.  Why doesn't Facebook get more? I mean, it gets attention.  Well, here's my theory on what gets hyped in the media.  It's what's going to drive traffic to the media and what the media is using.  Twitter obviously has a broader role right now in how media is created.  It's about communicating links.  So as a publisher, I go look at my web stats and I see Twitter in there and I say,  oh, well, Twitter must be important to people.  Just like maybe two years ago, we were running right dig.  We had a proportion to how big it was.  Just because you look at your web stats and you say, well, this is a really huge site in terms of referrals.  It must be. And you get this kind of distortion around it.  Like it seems bigger to you than it really is.  And I think Twitter to some extent is like that.  It's still in a way us early adopters.  I think Facebook's increasingly managing to push traffic out to websites though.  So it's going to become a lot more visible.  It hasn't been a great platform for marketing a brand or media company up until now.  But suddenly they're moving towards this page model.  And suddenly it's a page is quite like a Twitter page.  It's broadcast. You can have a big audience.  It's about building audience.  How many fans do you have?  Kind of similar to how many followers you have on Twitter.  And I think it's evolving as a platform for referring traffic to other people.  It used to be like closed and it used to be about, hey, I'm going to connect with my friends around personal content.  And they're kind of opening it up a little bit to be more about sharing links, for instance.  So we look at our traffic stats and we're seeing a Facebook climb and almost take on Twitter in terms of referred traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The New York Times, incorrectly, but quite publicly called this the first Twitter Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's the third Twitter Christmas, but OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  2006, 2007, 2008.  The fourth.  Once upon a time, people mailed their holiday wishes to the North Pole and hoped for a reply on Christmas Day.  Nowadays, they're sending their wishes into cyberspace and are apt to get a reply in minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They still use the word cyberspace.  Yes, cyberspace. That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They still capitalize web and Internet. It's so cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me check the day line on this. This could be 2006.  No, no, no.  It's current.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you also have a fast company this time came up with God help us.  Oh dear. Oh dear. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that you? That seems.  Ashton Kutcher on the cover of Fast Company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the new issue. And it says, follow me.  Twittering Facebook fiend be a new kind of media mogul, which it bothers me that he's the cover boy for it.  But I think there is something to that. I was on Skype chat the other day with Nick Denton dropping names.  And I was I was speculating about kind of a future that was beyond media that, you know, when this idea that we have to go to a site, the site comes to us.  And what is that? And Nick came back in his typical brilliant brevity and just said, it's at Stephen Fry.  Yeah.  It exists. Fry has started a million audience media business without media.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and Ashton Kutcher, too. I mean, come on. This guy. This guy didn't have a career.  Did he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what goes for one these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, this is he's much bigger because of Twitter now, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, my fellow young people tell me he is, you know, well followed in a certain set.  So really, really, Pete, you follow?  No, but I well, I do follow him on Twitter, actually.  But that's kind of how he became relevant to me.  I've apparently pissed off the chat room. They're telling me to stick to tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It just wasn't our audience. You know, we see this kind of little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, chat room. I brought it up as my fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know nothing, Leo. You know nothing. He's huge.  No, come on. I'm sorry. Ashton Kutcher, best at best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A punch line.  Be great.  A punch line to an era.  Yeah.  As we look back at the 70s and, you know, genre volta suits, we will look back on this decade.  And Ashton Kutcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll be the Kutcher decade. And but thanks to but again, thanks to look, Oprah had a career without Twitter.  In fact, Oprah barely uses Twitter. But Ashton has clearly used Twitter very effectively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing, right? He was he had just enough celebrity and just enough tech savvy to use Twitter in a way that seemed authentic.  Right. I mean, he tweeted like regular humans did. You know, it wasn't just a press release thing.  That's true. That's a very good point.  He was twittering about his personal life and people are really interested in celebrities' personal lives.  And he was just celebrity enough to acquire those one million followers.  I mean, oh, come on. Now, wait a minute. He was celebrity enough to get on the suggested user list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He didn't get one million followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, OK. Well, right. Right. And there's a suggested user list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's almost four million now. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think in his defense, at least he tweets, you know, he does more like a human.  He puts content up there. You bet.  Most celebrities. And it's obviously him doing it. It's not like he's employing someone or.  No, it's genuine. And he does quite a lot to kind of connect. He does you stream as well.  Somebody told me.  And he does live chats with people. So.  Somebody told me.  At least it's him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it was Jason Calacanis who told me that you got to understand that when you're an actor, you got a lot of free time.  You know, there's a lot of time between movies. And if you're not working a lot, there's a lot of free time.  You're made for Twitter.  They're made for Twitter.  This is Twitter is the thing you do when you don't have other things to do. Right.  In fact, I even find my Twitter usage spikes, you know, when I'm standing.  In fact, I used to tweet a lot when I was standing around in the television set waiting for the next shot.  That's when you tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think, you know, it's one of those jobs. It's not exactly nine to five.  You know, it's not the you've got a lot of free time, but you've got these huge segments of time between. Right.  Between shoots and things or between various projects.  Precisely.  And then suddenly he has this period. I mean, he was marketing a movie.  It was like a couple of months ago. He had spread.  And then he has this period of like high activity where he's going to push it through his Twitter feed and go into interviews.  And then it kind of comes down a little bit and he's back to his tweet in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So to get back to this New York Times story, they're talking about how companies are using Twitter to respond.  And this has been very effective for Comcast initially now for other companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Best Buy has done some amazing things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Best Buy has what they call the 12th force. Now, that is the worst word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They went out and visited them and they were a bit sheepish about it.  They were trying to come up with something cute and that's what they landed on.  And it was too late. It was done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's too late. It's gone viral. We're the 12th force.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they put it on every commercial now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And there's and there's twenty five hundred people on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There went my number of the week out the window. Oh, shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got to just not say numbers. I'll edit that out.  But that is phenomenal.  Why? I wonder how many people they could possibly have, maybe five or six.  I mean, Comcast cares was just Frank Eliason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this is different. This is really smart because it mobilizes the entire employee force.  So if somebody has a question at the Times, things that a woman had a question about setting up her GPS and she got two answers like that.  You know, I think there was a book called Gonzo Marketing by Chris Locke, one of the authors of Clutrain.  And and he proposed this long ago. This is why every employee should blog.  Right. It didn't quite work out that way because blogging was just too much of an effort.  And I think it's also this idea of the post media world that Twitter comes to you.  You don't have to go to it.  You force the media company, which is Best Buy in this case, to come to you and solve your problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love that. Right. Sure. If they respond, does it scale?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. Well, it's double scaling, isn't it?  They've got twenty five hundred word number of the week.  No, no, no, no. I was trying to save it.  And they have, you know, customers just put a question in and one of those twenty five hundred is going to answer it.  It's that commercial they have of the people answering questions in the football field.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Right.  I love it. Well, you know, I think it's very interesting to watch it happen.  And I'm with you, Pete. This is unexpected out of the blue.  And who knows what it means?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, one thing it means is that that's marketing money that Best Buy doesn't have to spend.  Yes. And Dell and all these companies.  Right. It's customer service money and especially marketing money because they can get their message out directly to the customers around media far more efficient, far more targeted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It lives up to the Clutain promise, which is that markets are conversations.  And if you want to market what you do, you have to have genuine conversations with your customers, with real people, with real people.  And we just didn't have the technology. How are you going to do that before Twitter?  Now we have this perfect method to do it. I hope that I hope it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to put I want to put Pete on the spot because he's got he's got over a million followers and kind of going back to the scaling question.  Pete, do you do you feel like you have time to reply to everyone who who replies to you on Twitter with with as many followers as you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, that is the challenge. I mean, I used to and then increasingly, you know, one of the things about that is that you you kind of the more people who are following you, the more you feel like you have to put out things with really high value and it becomes a lot less conversational.  And, you know, I'm kind of tempted to set up a second account and just use that for the conversational stuff, because otherwise it gets really noisy.  You know, I think to Jeff's point, a lot of people who think it won't scale don't understand that this isn't making your customer service bigger.  It can come out of the marketing portion. I am a bit concerned, though, because we had this wonderful period at the start of Twitter where you could just mention any company that instantly finds you.  And I think if Twitter does become mainstream and, you know, Best Buy has thousands or tens of thousands of people mentioning Best Buy every day, this can be challenging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What scales about it, Peter, I think, is you have the 2,500 number of the week employees in there who can't, that's what scales. You have to go up on both sides, right? You answering everybody doesn't work.  But if you had 2,500 yous answering the questions, that starts to scale, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just don't have enough people at Mashable answering questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I need to expand our marketing budget a little bit, I think, or our customer service budget a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but that's kind of the point of this, though, is that it's guerrilla marketing. It shouldn't really have to, I guess it does, cost money, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, one of the challenges with Twitter is that it feels inauthentic if it's not you replying directly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, yeah.  You was the person that don't scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think it's a completely legitimate question. I mean, how do you handle that?  Now, Pete, you got to a million again because of the suggested user list. I don't think anybody really can get to a million without being picked by Twitter, anointed by Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Insert Dave Weiner rant here.  Yeah.  Probably so, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's the case. If you look at, I don't think there's anybody over a million that isn't on the SUL or wasn't at some point.  Did you notice increased engagement when you got to that million? Was it significantly more engagement?  Well, I mean, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the engagement is obviously that audience you're attracting is a more broad general audience, so you're not going to keep quite the same percentage as the one to one connections you were making in the early days.  So obviously engagement is going to fall as you scale as a kind of a relative, but as an absolute, it obviously increases.  It does go up, right? Yeah.  And the thing about blog traffic as well is that Twitter is referring a lot of traffic that's very, very engaged.  They're far, far more likely to leave a comment or to share something or to rate something, any kind of interaction.  I think that's interesting. So you do notice that.  What is that? Yeah, I think comment counts on blogs increased a huge amount with Twitter because it just kind of lowered the barrier to engaging and made, you know, it switched the broadcast model around a little bit for blogs.  So people were so used to engaging and replying that I think comment counts certainly increased with Twitter springing up.  Well, that's a value. That's a real value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And, you know, with dig, people would make the comments about your story on dig.  But with Twitter, I mean, people can respond on Twitter, but if they click on your link, they're going to respond on your site, which is which is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Exactly.  Let's talk about Rupert Murdoch. We love Rupert Murdoch. Wonderful, wonderful guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  May I do a dramatic reading, Leo? Yes, would you please?  So this is from Sam Gustin at AOL's Daily Finance.  How the Grinch stole Google News.  Every who down in Whoville liked Google a lot, but the Grinch who lived up in a penthouse did not.  The Grinch hated Google, didn't find Google pleasing.  Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.  It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right.  It could be perhaps that his views were too tight.  But I think that the most likely reason of all may have been that his heart was two sizes too small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now we know who Dr. Seuss was talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It goes on and on and on. It's quite amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rupert the Grinch Murdoch. Wow.  So did the Grinch steal Google? Remember Jason Calacanis's supposition that maybe he was about to do a deal with Microsoft?  Now there are rumors. I wonder, do you know how accurate these rumors are that News Corp is negotiating with Microsoft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It got hit this week where FDFT, the Financial Times, had the story.  Rupert Murdoch's own journal. No, no, no. That's the Wall Street Journal. How dare you, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, he doesn't own FT. I thought he owned the FT. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, not the journal. And I got press inquiries like mad.  And somebody tweeted that it's ironic that Jarvis is against repetitive commodity news, is making repetitive commodity performances all the time.  Which I was. That's how it works. That's how you do it.  ABC Australia, NPR twice, Canadian paper. It was kind of ridiculous.  But there was enough of a report of this that everybody started in turn repeating it and it became the ridiculous story of the week.  I still think, you know, consider that Murdoch has a $300 million deal per year.  He's trying to figure out what to do with with MySpace.  I think it is chest thumping macho bluster. But there's a danger here.  There's a real danger here that that this meme will take off.  And I'm hearing people say, well, why not? And we see a bifurcation, a balkanization of the web coming, which I think would be horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree. I mean, yeah, search results have to be agnostic.  Pete, you agree? Is this a I mean, I think I could see Rupert trying to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He wrote a great post about this that went went into great detail about how stupid it is. Right, Pete?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I read a piece on CNN this week about just how the consumer loses essentially.  I think once you have this situation where media companies are of the opinion that they can start selling distribution, essentially on an exclusive basis on the web,  you've got the challenge where are you kind of opening up the ability to have to switch from Bing to Google or remember what's on which site or which search engine?  And I just I just think is incredibly anti user.  And I think it's really just Murdoch trying to seize back control in the sense of he used to be able to go into a market and he owned the printing presses and he owned the trucks and he could buy the rival paper.  And it was all about kind of domination and control and power and now influences a lot more two way.  It's not more interactive. And it's essentially that whole piece of giving the consumer control.  And that's that's what's happening now. We can go to Google and we can find his paper.  We can find anyone else's paper. And I don't think he likes that.  I don't think he's a fan of the consumer suddenly being in control of the entire experience.  And he's trying to steal back some of that control and say, no, you have to pay if you're not going to pay.  You're going to pay. He's going to pay and you're going to go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's wrong with that? He's trying to make a living.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because it's not going to be the best way to make the most money.  He's going to be cut down where he loses discovery. He loses audience.  He loses advertising revenue.  He increases marketing cost markedly.  And it's just not going to be there. It's it's it's emotions speaking.  It's entitlement speaking. It's not it's not hard economics.  I think he's absolutely right.  The age is about hanging over control.  And that's the last thing that Murdoch and Microsoft each want to do.  That's not the way they think.  They don't see the way to take advantage of and exploit that loss of control as a good.  And so what happens is that we have walls going up.  The walls used to control and contain the value.  Now walls diminish the value.  And that's what they don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think that the regular user, the regular web searcher is actually going to if this if this came to pass,  do you think someone's going to know enough to switch to Bing in order to get these news stories?  I mean, I was thinking I absolutely agree with Pete and his CNN piece was great.  You know, when I was at Lifehacker, there would be all these the kind of spam blogs that would just pull our content wholesale and republish it.  And I imagine that happens a lot of the news sites as well.  So I think that regular consumers will just go to Google, continue to use Google and get the news stories from these other sites that are sort of syndicated in the more blogs that are commenting them and exerpting them.  And so then those other sites get the traffic.  They lose money, maybe make money from the deal from Microsoft, but become lesser relevant over time.  I mean, it just seems like they're just kind of shooting themselves in the foot.  I just don't see anyone except for bloggers or professional researchers really knowing enough to switch engines and know who has what access to what content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you're right, Gina.  And it's it's about I wrote a post to this week saying that Murdoch has balls.  I hope we can say that on your earlier.  You saw him.  Yeah, because he's always made huge bets.  Right.  He made some bad bets.  He almost lost his company at one point.  You know, my space satellite in the U.S.  But he made huge bets that won sports and Fox News and other things like that.  What's sad about this is it's not a huge bet.  James Murdoch has said that News Corp is no longer a news company.  It's a TV company.  And I think we kind of see the last milking of this thing.  So, you know, I have people I respect who've been saying online, well, you know, Jarvis celebrate this Murdoch will get fewer people.  That's that's great.  And I said, you know, no, I don't want anybody to be setting up these walls.  I think it's evil of Microsoft to be tempting old man Murdoch to do this.  And what's going to happen in the end is, yes, it may well kill News Corp faster, but it's going to do, as Pete says, more damage than just that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think to Gina's point is this assumption that is going to be this huge hole.  There's going to be a void.  You know, you're going to miss us because we're not going to have our content there.  But, you know, I search for Wall Street Journal articles on Google and I get the Huffington Post.  Now, that's not a spam blog.  It's not these, I think, what did he call them?  Content club to maniacs who are literally stealing, you know, in whole content.  But, you know, there's a lot of contrary, you know, if the Huffington Post goes and comments on a Wall Street Journal article, they're going to quote the relevant piece anyway.  I'm going to get the gist of it.  I don't, you know, I don't need to head over to Bing to find the original.  And I think even though the original might get lost over on Bing, there's going to be enough commentary around it to get the gist of the story anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the other thing about it is, you're right, that the information itself is a commodity.  I put up on the FriendFeed earlier a demonstration from Microsoft's labs on Pivot.  And the scientist who was doing it, whose name I suddenly forget, quoted Frank Zappa.  I'm going to get this wrong with saying something to the effect that information is not knowledge and knowledge is not wisdom.  And the thing about news is that it's just information.  It just becomes commodity information.  The fact that Tiger Woods ran into a fire hydrant and his wife used, God bless her, a golf club to get him out.  We all do instantly.  And it's really hard to imagine anyone making anything special about that because everybody has the same joke.  It's a real commodity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a commodity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But by the same token, the person who breaks it, you link to them.  That's how you express the value that, OK, this person broke the story.  And you're going to get less links if your content is less findable.  It just that's just the way it happens.  So you can't let us do that expression of value and say, hey, we found via the Wall Street Journal.  You're kind of cutting off the Google juice that will go to you, I guess.  Although I think there is still room for scoops.  I mean, I'm seeing a lot on Princess TMZ today of the coverage of that Tiger Woods story.  I think there's certainly value in that.  And if that was the kind of thing we were writing about, we'd be crediting them for at least leading the conversation.  So I think there is something to having a scoop and having speed.  But it gets commoditized incredibly fast by things like Twitter.  And you really need to be in there fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's even more than that.  I think it's an ethic of the link that you have to link to the journalism at its source.  I yammer on about the link economy all the time.  And the key thing is that he or she who gets the links has to monetize them.  And so if the Washington Post or TMZ or whoever is doing the story, the right thing to do for your reader and for them both is to link to it at its source, not at the tenth pale copy of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. It's hard to train users to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But when you search for this news story, yeah, but when you search for the news story and you get Huffington Post first result, you read the Huffington Post article, it's going to have a link to the original source anyway.  I mean, you might be less likely.  I don't know. I think an experienced blogger is going to put that via link in anyway, even if it's not the first result in the search, the initial search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would hope so. But I think that that's not the case a lot of the times.  What is an experienced blogger anyway? Who would that be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, someone who cares about getting credit.  You and Pete.  I mean, you know, Mashable is great.  Well, yeah, Mashable is so great because they give credit where credit's due.  We try to do the same thing at Lifehacker. People who try to do the right thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you do the right thing. You gain by that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think everybody gains. The ecosystem gains and it becomes a golden rule of the Internet.  If you want links, good links, you give good links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody's got to tell people that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We do hear every day and week, you know, and they're not listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not listening, especially on Twitter.  I want to take a little break and come back.  We're going to talk about Google's doing an interesting thing with Iraqi, the Iraqi Museum.  There is a new Google interface, which with a little bit of JavaScript messing around, you can turn on for yourself.  Snoopy and Woodstock for Thanksgiving and the offensive lady of,  offensive image of Michelle Obama that Google had to deal with in some way and found a way to do with it.  Before we talk about all that, though, I do want to talk about our friends at Citrix,  the folks who do the go to meeting product that we use all the time around here for our meetings.  A meeting without visuals nowadays is just really a phone call and it's not very effective.  And yet, you know, flying across country or driving across town for a meeting isn't very cost effective.  So this is why I want to set you up with something called Go To Meeting.  You probably heard me talk about it before.  Now you can try it for free for 30 days by just going to go to meeting, G-O-T-O, meeting.com slash twig.  When you get there, you'll be able to sign up for a 30 day free trial of this incredible meeting software.  I love Go To Meeting. I know you're going to love it, too.  That's why I'm telling everybody I know to give it a shot. G-O-T-O meeting dot com slash twig.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google and invite you to take a look at Go To Meeting.  So the Google cartoon, you probably didn't see it, Gina.  And I know you didn't see it, Pete, because you were overseas.  But Mashable did report on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did. I got our US editor's December screenshot over the weekend.  That was really cute. It was Snoopy making Thanksgiving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like that. That was quite nifty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder whether they got the rights or that was kleptomania.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got Schultz's signature. So I have a feeling there was some permissions involved.  I would bet there was.  I wonder if there was money.  It's fantastic marketing. How much is that worth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wouldn't Garfield kill to have done that?  Take it all the attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then of course the geeks are immediately tweeting when the Peanuts Thanksgiving special comes on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Geeks like peanuts.  On this show you guys were talking about how overkill they went with the Sesame Street stuff.  Yes.  Four weeks of that.  I have no idea how they set up because sometimes I hear you guys speaking about these things and I see them and sometimes I don't in the UK.  So it seems to vary wildly depending on what we can see and what we can't see.  Can you not go to the US Google?  No, I use the No Country Redirect. It just depends on your IP, I think.  It will look at your IP, but I seem to remember even when I was in France I could say no I want to go to the US Google.  Yes, you use slash NCR which is No Country Redirect.  Okay. And then you can choose which one you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you seen this new Google look?  There's a little JavaScript clip you can put in here.  Let me give credit to the people who do it.  And when you do a search, I don't like it. It's very Windows XP looking.  But when you do a search there's this new sidebar that gives you everything, images, video, blogs.  And then there's a more button that you can see news.  So instead of this more drop down here, they've got this on the side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This does approach our version of Kremlinology, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yes, this is Kremlinology. Who is making this and why?  Is there a change in the bullet portal? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google tries a lot of stuff there, don't they? I mean, they're always experimenting.  You know, I kind of prefer the one box strategy, which essentially figures out what you mean to search for and doesn't have to give you the options  because it can pretty much figure out that if you're searching for the title of the song, you're probably looking for music.  That's kind of more options than I need most of the time.  That whole sidebar thing and choosing from the countries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's very Bing-ish. And I think it's their response to Bing, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think, you know, they're trying to...  The challenge they face is that it's this one box and if you don't know what Google can do,  most people aren't experimenting with all these other options.  But I really doubt that one will get pushed through to be the final...  to be, you know, live on everyone's perspective because I think one box is just so much more elegant.  You don't need the options most of the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Credit to the Google blogascope for finding this. It is like Kremlinology.  You're exactly right. I don't know how you would even find this.  The box is now blue. What does that mean for the universe?  Ooh, it's blue. It's blue.  And I think what it's doing is it's changing your cookies.  You have to log out of your Google account, run this JavaScript, which sets a new cookie.  And then I was able to log back in. I guess my Google has now forever changed.  I don't know if that's a good thing or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, interesting. Yeah.  I could delete that cookie.  Set the preference cookie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, go find the cookie. Yeah.  It's an obscure cookie. Yeah, it's a preference.  Preference equals ID equals... and then it's a long, long thing.  Google, let's talk a little bit about Wave.  I know we've talked about Gina's doing her complete guide to Google Wave.  Let's give you a little plug, Gina, at completewaveguide.com.  You can get the preview PDF right now.  Yes.  Yes.  Leah Benton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That went on sale a couple weeks ago.  Yay.  At Web 2.0 Expo, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Selling well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is selling well. I'm really happy. Not like Oprah Club well, but certainly well for something that's in preview and invitation only.  So yeah, I'm really happy. Thanks to everyone who's listening who bought a copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When we got to get Oprah to plug it?  Now that she's on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think Oprah is going to... she just did like this skateboarding bulldog on YouTube a few months ago.  She just discovered YouTube.  I don't think she's going to make it by the time her show ends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As soon as she covers that book, it's jumped the shark.  Wave is just going to mainstream.  Oh, Oprah's on Wave now. Oh, how exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leah Bentoncourt wrote...  When Ashton gets on it, we know it's done.  Yeah, really. Leah Bentoncourt wrote an excellent piece in Mashable this week about mainstream media using Wave, something we haven't really successfully achieved.  Right.  What do you think of this? I mean, the Chicago Tribune's Red Eye blog has a public wave that started November 10th.  I think the problem if we do this is it just gets... we get overwhelmed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm impressed actually by... I see Leah writing these posts and I've seen on Mashable their use of Twitter lists as well.  We like to cover how is the mainstream media using this stuff.  And you know what? Give them their credit because they're actually ahead on a lot of this stuff.  A lot of the bloggers haven't rolled out Google Wave implementations yet.  We haven't found the point at which it works for us.  And like you say, we'll get bombarded because we have so many active users that we don't set it up right.  But credit where it's due, they're playing on the wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We bloggers are more loners. This is about collaboration in teams and that's what newsrooms are.  And they're stuck in their CMSs in ways that they find restricting where we find ours liberating.  Good point. That's a good point.  So we'll be able to create something new in some new way.  Gina, is it yet possible that I can publish something from a Wave to a web page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, you can. But the only people who can see it are the people who have Wave and are signed in, right?  Which limits your audience kind of right straight away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So either you have everybody and the public square is ruined or you have just too few.  I think once that changes, we're going to see a huge difference here.  A lot of us, the news business went wacko, not nearly as much as Gina,  but went wacko on Wave because of the implications it has for the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's all about potential, you know?  I talked about this in my Web 2.0 talk.  I think that Wave's best uses are when you have a small group of people,  six to 12 people collaborating on a single Wave.  I think public Waves get out of control really quickly.  And at this early stage, they turn into discussions of how to use Wave, honestly,  because people aren't used to it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina, if you could use that group of 12 to publish something that a group of a million can see  and take advantage of, that's really kind of the ideal, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, and that is the ideal.  But right now there's no easy way to kind of export a completed Wave  without the inline comments or to publish it.  Really what you want to do is be able to easily export it to HTML or Word  or something so that you can publish read-only.  The thing is you can't set a Wave to be read-only and you can't say,  let everyone in the world, whether or not they're signed into Wave C, yet.  But that's coming. That's been promised.  So I think that there's a lot of potential.  And I think, you know, I had to admit, I think that we all kind of fell in love  with the potential of Wave, right, versus what the preview is at the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're using Wave internally at Twit to plan our CES stuff.  And Kiki Sanford set that up, and that's working quite well.  But it's a small group of seven people.  There are a lot of Twigwaves.  But good luck in following them or using them or anything like that,  because it's overwhelming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they get paid. They get that control.  You know what? The Wave folks did a user feedback survey  where they asked users, you know, what do you like about Wave the most  and what don't you like about Wave the most?  And people said that they love the idea of having one place  where you could get everything, a central place for everything.  That's what they like the most.  And then one of the things that they didn't like the most  is that there's no integration for existing tools.  Like email and IM, although there are bots that can do some IM stuff right now.  So it's like, you know, there's a thin line between love and hate.  The very thing that they like the most is kind of the thing that they don't like right now on the preview.  So that's kind of a way that Wave is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's become another inbox to some extent.  Yeah.  Which is like another place to go and check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  An out of control inbox.  An inbox that seems to sprout, you know, tendrils every minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it does definitely create the yet another inbox problem.  And I, yeah, none of us need another inbox.  And that definitely is a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So how do you recommend managing it?  Because I'm just looking at, you know, my all and there's just a lot.  I mean, you know, it's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You go through and unfollow a bunch of stuff.  It does clean it up a little bit.  I think it's getting...  You know, they turned off that public wave thing.  Remember when you searched for public wave, I think you guys mentioned this.  You just ended up with noise.  Right.  With following all these waves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if I see this wave that says who likes Lego, I'm really not interested in following that.  I can just unfollow that by pressing the unfollow button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The unfollow button, yeah.  It's the same as the mute, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just they've just changed it.  It looks like mute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's got a speaker with a line through it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they changed it because it's kind of more into in keeping with the whole Twitter nomenclature.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, one good thing, we all got more invitations this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I got some news you guys didn't know.  Popularity.  I moved my invitation.  Go ahead and try to find...  I'll wait.  Try to find the invite others to Google Wave.  Wave.  I moved mine, fortunately, at the beginning to documentation so I can go right to it.  And I noticed some waves invites going out and I think I got another 10.  Something like that.  So check how many wave invites you've got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How many people aren't on it now though?  I think everybody has it, right?  Isn't it kind of evening out?  We went through that stage of really wanting it and then we got there and we wondered why we wanted it so desperately because we don't get it.  But it was the same process with Twitter.  So let's not assume that means that it doesn't have value.  It's just that the use cases haven't quite emerged because it's so open and there's so many possibilities that there aren't...  There isn't really a clear signal on which of these is going to pan out to be the most effective for say us as a publisher or as individuals or in terms of collaboration.  It was the same with Twitter.  We kind of kicked the tires and then we left it alone for a couple of months.  It is more like RSS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wave will arrive when you don't know what's there.  Right.  It's way inside.  Twitter's beauty is the simplicity that even a TV weatherman can figure it out.  Right?  And that's why it's spread.  That's why your media point was absolutely right is that it drives traffic to them and they get that.  Wave, no one is ever going to use it at this level.  But when Gina and her troops make applications on top of it, that's when Wave's going to take off I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So do you think that Wave's going to ever be a consumer facing thing or is it...  Because RSS was never big with consumers.  I mean what's great about Twitter is that it's basically that follow method for the kind of the general populace.  And RSS never really got to that stage.  It was still a little bit geeky.  You know, I think the mainstream still aren't building up their, you know, loading up their RSS reader.  Do you think that Wave will ever be a consumer facing app or is it just going to be pipes like RSS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's more of a platform and pipes and that applications will use it more than RSS inside.  I can see Salesforce using it in amazing ways, for example.  But I just don't see Wave as Wave becoming a consumer application.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that would be a shame.  I think that would be a terrible shame if it doesn't happen.  But I can see your point because Google has not got a good track record in building really nice consumer facing social applications.  But isn't that the beauty of it being a platform?  It's just not something they can build.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right? The people who read you and Gina can build the killer amazing uses of Wave, a top Wave.  That's what I hope for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure.  I think one of the things about having a consumer facing app is really great marketing.  I mean, you mentioned like Ashton and Oprah getting on board.  That's fantastic for user adoption.  And then the more users you have, the more value the network has.  So, you know, I guess you're not going to need to at some point, you're not going to need to have Wave to use Wave.  And I guess at that point, the network effect argument is irrelevant.  But I would like it to be a consumer facing app.  I think there's a lot of advantages to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What would it take to be that?  I would like it.  Gina, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I just I would like for it to be a consumer facing app too.  But I think, you know, at first it's, you know, it's a power tool for power users.  I mean, I think that, you know, it takes a certain kind of savvy user.  You know, I was talking to someone, a guy from MindTouch, which is this wiki company, and he was he was he they forked MediaWiki,  which runs Wikipedia.  And they said to the Wikipedia people, we want to make it easier to edit pages.  We don't want people to have to learn wiki markup.  And the Wikipedia people said, and I hope I'm not mispronouncing, but they basically said, well, that barrier kind of we like the bar a little bit.  And only people who are really like serious and committed are going to edit the pages.  And and, you know, certainly I think that applications should be should be usable.  But, you know, there's a little bit there's a learning curve with Wave.  It's not something you learn in an afternoon.  It's pretty it's pretty unapologetic about the fact that it's a it you know, it takes a little bit of commitment.  It takes a little learning to get to use to get the value out of it.  And I don't think that's a that's a bad thing.  And I think that that for for people who write and collaborate and process information all day long, you know, knowledge workers that that wave is going to spread because someone in the work group has, you know, caught, you know, caught the religion and realized how great it is and will will bring in their coworkers and bite them into a wave.  And they'll see how useful it is.  I mean, Oprah and Ashton ever going to be on wave.  I'll say no.  And I'm happy about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's gonna make me sound like a really.  I wish Twitter were a lot harder to use, to be honest.  If it only were harder to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I think there's a place for both.  Right. Like my Webtoon speech, I was saying that, you know, Photoshop expects to sit down, Photoshop and learn it in an afternoon.  It's an advanced tool for power users.  And I think I don't think wave is as complicated as Photoshop, but it is an advanced tool.  And it takes a little bit a little bit to learn.  And I think that to Jeff's point, the fact that it is a platform and that you can integrate apps, you know, with it, the gadgets and bots will make it more interesting to people who want to see what it's like to Twitter via wave or to, you know, watch YouTube videos via wave or plan their vacation via wave.  However, those those things will be hooks and we'll draw people in, I think.  And I think that what people really want is a central place.  I think people are feeling like my online life is fractured.  It's everywhere.  I have to go to six, seven different Web apps to get my stuff done.  And if wave can realize its potential and put all those things in one interface, that that will be that would be huge for people who for the kind of power users like us who, you know, who live in the cloud and just want a single place to do everything.  Speaking of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember a company that might when I worked for the new houses for Cunninghast, we almost invested in Munich years ago called Twist.  It's long dead.  And thank God we didn't invest.  But they had this this similar idea that you had a place where you could collaborate on things.  So you had the family shopping list and you could get it to it from your phone or from the Web or from here or from there.  But there was that place where the collaboration happened.  And I always loved that model.  And it was way too soon.  But I think that there'll be some really simple consumer applications that take the best of wave and make its use case obvious to a lot of people in certain cases.  Gina, what shares you've you've fantasized about this, I'll bet.  But where do you think the first breakthrough use of wave will be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, for me, I think that like at a very simple level for a regular person, you know, something as simple as just taking meeting notes or avoiding those email threads where someone sends out an email to people and asks a list of six questions and gets like fractured responses from all different people.  Just have this like mess of an email thread.  I mean, I think that those are the just very practical things that regular people in corporate jobs run into every single day or students sitting in a classroom and trying to take notes for the final from the professor who speaks to quickly and doing that together.  You know, crowdsourcing.  That's a great idea.  That's a really good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do you see it as a consumer app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I think there was a really good example.  I don't know if you guys saw there was a there was a conference that ran waves instead of instead of hashtags.  I forget the name of the conference.  It was a couple of weeks ago.  They started using wave and people could do could do the commentary.  What was it, Jeff?  Super geeks?  I was joking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Super geeks.  All 10 people who can use wave got together and had a great time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, well, here's what they did.  They gave out wave invites to start with so that everyone had it.  And then they took collaborative notes about the speakers and instead of each doing their own little tweets with the hashtag and them getting lost in the in Twitter, it was more like let's create a wave.  Let's have everyone edit this.  And at the end, they had really great summaries of what happened at the conference.  You know, every single panel and speech was summarized.  And then they obviously had like a wave where you could go and see them all listed.  And then they had a wave for feedback on, you know, what should we do better this year?  So I think that's a that's a good use case.  And it's really similar to what Gina just suggested, which is collaboratively.  We do much better note taking than we were as individuals.  And it's really hard to while someone's speaking, it's really hard to there it is.  It's really hard to type at the same time.  So if you have lots of people listening in and filling in different pieces that others might have missed or forgotten, I think that's a really, really powerful use case.  I also see, you know, to Jeff's point, I think about taking it to the consumer.  There might be a role for, you know, I'm not sure that Google necessarily understands marketing or doing that whole appealing to the self-promoters thing, which Twitter did, which is to say, hey, you want to broadcast to a huge audience, use our tool.  And then it turns your actions and your Oprah's into into marketers, essentially, and saves you having to have a marketing team.  I think what might happen on the consumer side is the applications that get that might start building it in.  I can imagine it wouldn't be too crazy to imagine something like a tweet deck having integration or a seismic desktop where it's bringing it to the desktop or it's bringing it into other applications where you're already used to that interaction with things like Twitter and Facebook.  What about mobile?  So someone else might build it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there'd be an application, a mobile application for a wave.  Or is it just too rich?  There is.  There is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it works.  I mean, surprise, surprise.  Well, badly, but better than you think.  If you if you just visit, you know, wave.google.com, there's a mobile version and you'll get the little little thing that says, you know, your browser doesn't quite support HTML5.  So go ahead at your own risk.  Go ahead.  It's functional enough.  And I assume that as mobile browsers, especially, you know, mobile Safari on the iPhone and the Android browser, you would get better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Waveboard.  Oh, yes.  And Waveboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think you need to redesign the UI for mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But go back to the shopping list app, right?  That you could do that without Wave.  But imagine a family getting together, a work group getting together, journalists getting together.  So there's the big story going on.  And this person puts in a photo and she puts in a caption.  Yeah, that's what I was kind of thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's where that goes.  I think.  And I want to see a lot of, you know, real hard development toward that.  But, yeah, I can see that you do that down the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina, Wave could be a back end for something like that.  You wouldn't have to have a Wave-like interface to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, you know, it's all open source and the protocol is open, right?  So anybody can make any kind of client, right?  So for example, someone could easily cook up an iPhone client that just let you snap a photo and add it to a Wave and let you set a caption so that a group of people could be at an event, a news event, snapping iPhone photos and creating, you know, contributing to a Wave gallery simultaneously without all the crazy drag and drop and extra doodads.  It's just, you know, iPhone photo gallery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, almost if you had a right-only Wave interface that was a simple interface that would then you could then go home and you'd have it all aggregated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, Leo, but you could go a little bit farther.  You could also, in what Gina proposes, have one, corrections.  Oh, Jeff got that caption wrong.  Yeah.  It doesn't know who that person is.  Yeah.  You could also have assignments through the form of questions.  Mm-hmm.  I hear this is going on with somebody go over there and take that picture.  Okay, I'll do it.  Here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, now that stripped-down interface would be a very good public Wave interface as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I wonder, Jeff, I mean, you look at things like CNN's iReport where right now it's kind of the situation, okay, here you can upload a photo or, you know, you can add some text or whatever.  Could we end up with a truly collaborative, and I think I did actually write a column maybe a couple of weeks ago with regard to all this stuff that's happening around Twitter lists and also Wave to some extent, could we end up with a situation where you're almost the back end of a news organization and, you know, there's this level below.  Okay, so you go to CNN.com and you've got all the filtered stuff by editorial, but is there a back end that consumers have access to where I'm uploading photos, correcting things, and then they just push it over and it just turns to basically news sites into work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, where you're invited in because the geo Twitter says, yes, in fact, Pete is really there and Pete's photo is coming from there and we believe that.  At CUNY where I teach, we're working with Nokia on a project to have kind of an assignment structure, an assignment back end, and we're struggling with that.  How do you take the journalistic ecosystem today and on a proactive basis say this story needs to be covered, who can cover it?  The New York Times and its blog, The Local, we work with, put up a post one day saying we can't cover this meeting, who wants to cover it?  So there's the kind of that angle of it. There's also, gee, 10 people are around this news event right now and there's somebody in the newsroom working together and they can all put it together into one cohesive thing that is constantly updated.  It's a living, breathing beast. It's news, not as a product, but finally as a process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To me, it only seems like if MySQL had come out and said, here, here's MySQL, here's the SQL search language, have at it. Wave at this stage is kind of like that.  It's like everybody's going home. How nice. A query language. But what's required is somebody to write. That's just, this is just the back end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If somebody writes. That's why Gina is doing God's work teaching the world how to do this. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And really who you need to teach right now is UI designers and application designers who are going to take that back end and give us some valuable, because really what Wave is just a layer on top of XMPP and a few other flavors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. My hope is that the Wave protocol is not too difficult for developers to make great apps for it.  I mean, you know, the Twitter, the reason why Twitter has so many great clients out there is because the Twitter API is like dead simple to use.  And I just, I hope that, I hope that Wave has that same. I hope that developers can grok the Wave protocol and make better clients.  I would love to see clients proliferate the way that Twitter clients have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think, I think that's all. All it really is, is we're looking at it. We're looking under the hood.  And, you know, it's like giving somebody an engine and saying, hey, go drive this car. We still need a car.  By the way, that was the e-comm, e-comm conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I also see the Wikia, the media Wikia conference used it to do the minutes. Ah, not Wikia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wikia Media.  Wikia Media.  What I'm saying though is they didn't use a Wiki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They didn't use Media Wiki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's just not real time. I mean, it's not real time. You just don't have that same.  You don't have locking. You have all these issues. If two people, we had this problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I used to use a Wiki for the radio show and you'd have two people edit the Wiki and it didn't have good locking and there was no multi-user.  There was very primitive multi-user support. We just needed a Wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's been the challenge with Wikia. It's finding that line.  I think the kind of the news organization that we described where you have this back end is still going to be a case of finding the line between process and product.  And at what point do you say this is done and this goes to some kind of level of finality or readiness?  I mean, news is never done. But, you know, what point do you decide and where's the line?  That's where that notion of publishing the Wave is important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can now publish this and I can choose what to constantly update and what to freeze.  And it really goes there. You see why the Wiki people, you know, obviously, Gina said it long ago that it's more Wiki than it is email.  By the way, the blog is mediawikiwave.blogspot.com and it has a very nice plug for your book, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Aha. They're paying attention. They know how to find out.  We have a few more stories I want to get to in just a second, including, by the way, Jimmy Wales responding to the accusation by the University of Madrid that editors are leaving Wikipedia and droves.  It's not much of a response. They're going to wave.  He says, no, they're not. No, they're not. That's the that's the story right there. No, they're not.  They don't really give much supporting information. Just no, no, they're not leaving.  I do want to mention Ford Sink, though Ford is very kindly decided to support this show and all the shows on the network so that we would let you know about Ford Sink.  And I have to say it's a pleasurable thing for me to do because as a result, I went out and bought a Ford car and I'm loving Sink.  It is it bonds via Bluetooth to my phone, actually to my phones.  You can do up to 25 phones. And the point of Ford Sink, it really is I don't want to I don't think they sell it this way, but it really is a safety feature because you are not now you can use your sound system.  You can use your phone. You can get information all without taking your eyes off the road or your hands off the wheel.  You press the Sink button, the voice button on your steering wheel, and you could tell Sink things like, you know, get me home.  It has GPS turn by turn GPS built into it. You can get 411 business searches. Find a Starbucks stat.  I say that one a lot. It doesn't understand stat, by the way, but doesn't understand Starbucks.  You can get personalized news, sports and weather, even traffic reports. It knows my route, gives me the traffic routes.  It'll even reroute me if traffic is a problem on my way home. You could say play this week in Google.  You could say play Twig 17. It'll play it. You can hook up a USB drive, a thumb drive or almost any phone as long as you have a USB connection.  I love a car with a USB connection. I know I'm just now entering the 21st century, but I think every car needs a USB port and you plug it in and it's charging my iPhone or charging my Droid.  And it's looking at all these songs on it and it will index them. And then I can say play the Beatles. I can go on and on.  But the best thing to do is to go to SyncMyRidePodcast.com and take a look at the new Ford Sync. It is amazing.  The new version 3.1 is out. If you've not looked at Sync lately, take a look at it. And while you're there, Twitter to win.  Yeah, Ford gets it. You know, Ford has a dedicated media guy, Scott Monte, who's on Twitter and really totally gets what's going on with Twitter.  And they have they're using Twitter for this contest. If you use the hashtag pound sync my ride podcast, say I'm listening to twig love Gina, love Jeff, love Pete.  And you add the tag pound sync my ride podcast. You're entered in the drawing to win one of 15 nanos and 15 zoons.  They'll be giving away through December 9th, 2009. That's all you have to do to enter.  Find out more at sync my ride podcast dot com. And already I know a number of our listeners have won.  So keep up the good work and keep listening. And thanks to Ford for their support. Sync my ride podcast dot com.  Let's see here. Yes, Jimmy Wales responding to the allegation that the English language version of Wikipedia has suffered a net loss of 49000 contributors  compared with one tenth that number a year ago says our internal numbers don't confirm all the claims made.  We do agree the number of editors has stabilized as one would expect since we've already we're already the fifth most popular website on the Internet.  However, our own data shows the number of active editors across all projects is stable.  That is new editors are replaced at about the same pace as existing editors are leaving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think he will. Wikipedia is done, isn't it? It's done. It's finished. They've written the whole thing.  Basically, there's no new knowledge. They've reached the last page and nothing more to write.  There is actually a genuine argument in that, which is that they have actually got the basis for, you know, you're not going to go, oh, my goodness.  I bet Wikipedia doesn't have a page about that. That's true. It's kind of improved. That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's because we've all got our pages. There are fewer covered wagons going across America now because it's been discovered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it's quite to that stage. I like what Google's doing with they're doing the visual, a virtual library of Iraq's National Museum.  That's a really interesting project. Is there a precedent for Google ever doing something like this before?  Books. I mean, since books. I mean, they're moving on from books now to objects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Old Mesopotamian clay pot makers can't sue them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, I think the government of Iraq is very pleased to have them in there doing that.  You know, I was serving as an alumnus of my alma mater's, my alma mater university on their advisory committee on digitizing their stuff.  And it's not just books. It's all the stuff in the museums, all the stuff in the galleries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the buildings too. It's kind of everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's everything. I mean, and what I was, you know, I'm really impressed with is Yale University is that their commitment was not to make money off of it, not to, you know, make it a private thing.  In fact, they actually went to Google and Microsoft trying to figure out who they should work with on the scanning project and end up working with Microsoft, which because of Google's restrictive licenses, I believe.  But of course, then Microsoft killed their efforts. So I don't know what the status is, but at least they get the, you know, unlike Google, I think they get to keep the data now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a very subtle way you got that in there. You know, you're a Yale-y.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I was, you notice I didn't do that at first.  You were trying not to.  I was trying not to. Nothing wrong with CUNY, mind you. But, okay. My brother-in-law says I went to the best college in Connecticut, and I'll grant you that. Anyway, but I was really impressed that they want to save this stuff.  They say this is part of our mission as a university is to get all of this stuff within the ivy covered walls and get it out to the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is part of Google's plan, though, isn't it, to basically index everything?  Yes.  And it comes back to the questions around books, which is, okay, that's brilliant, Google. You want to index everything.  But do we want a commercial entity to have the index of everything, or do we want something that's open source and, you know, owned by everyone?  Do we want Google to own the index of the world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Pete, I think there's actually two issues there. I think you're right.  What gets Google in trouble with books is that it was the first time that they were really playing host to the content, that and associated press stories, because they got blackmailed in that position.  There's one matter to index it. Anybody can index. Anybody can, you know, how many crawlers do you have? Anybody can do that.  But to host the content is where trouble comes in, where channel conflict comes in, I think.  But Google's response, I think, in this case would be, well, nobody else volunteered to do this for Iraq.  We had to do it.  So what's wrong with us doing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. We had to do it.  What is it? Well, let's, you know, in a way, this is a good test case for the book thing.  Is there anything wrong with Google doing this? Should Google step away and let, I don't know, who would do it? Iraq do it?  And the other question is how much, how much of the rights does Google assert to this content?  That's the key question, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't see any information on that.  By the way, Eric Schmidt went to Iraq, which is kind of a brave thing to do, brought his daughter, who just graduated from Princeton, along as a consultant.  She kept busy filming the event for YouTube. Good deal. Good deal.  He says he does not believe digitizing the museum's collection will undercut its ability to raise money later, as many museums do by selling images of its treasure.  Kind of an analog to the problem publishers have.  He says what typically happens is it's a demand creator. They'll still own the copyright to the images.  There you go.  Yeah, that comes back to that whole free argument, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You give it away and then you're going to get more people visiting your museum and checking out your stuff and buying the copies that you make money out of.  It's obviously marketing. So it's great for them and it's great for Google.  I think, you know, and I want Google to do it.  I just, we're definitely going to end up with a situation where Google owns the street view for the entire world and the index of the whole web.  And, you know, at some point, the index of a lot of these real world things like museums.  Well, let me play devil's advocate. Let me play devil's advocate because I agree, you know, probably it should belong to all of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's a capitalist world. Google's a company. They're spending a lot of money doing this.  Shouldn't they get something for it? What's wrong with them saying, you know, nobody else is doing it.  We'd like to assert some rights to it. We put the effort in.  I mean, is the choice, nobody does it because that's what it looks like.  I think so. I think if they hadn't put the emphasis for the books thing, I doubt the publishers would have gone together and said, hey, let's index all the books and put them online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, you know, it's going to take Google to do it.  I'm just, you know, making that point that is definitely headed down that route.  It's in our interest as a public interest. I completely agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is often the case, the public interest.  And corporate interests don't gel, don't merge, don't match.  But it's in our public interest that it be open.  But isn't it too much to ask of a company, a private, you know, a publicly held enterprise that they just give it away?  We'll just index it and give it away.  They're doing the effort. Why shouldn't they own it?  Rupert would say the same thing.  I think the question comes in the new economy.  How do you get the most benefit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But is it for us to tell them how to get the most benefit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it for us to tell them how to get the most benefit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think at some point it's not. It's up to these choices.  Tom Foremski wrote a, and I disagree with this, but he left a comment on my blog  linking to his post recently at Silicon Valley Watcher,  arguing that the Google algorithm should be in a not-for-profit,  not the public domain, but a not-for-profit,  and also arguing that that's what the Google founders initially wanted and didn't want commercial interests.  I understand that, and I see that it works in the model of WordPress.org  owning the platform versus WordPress.com exploiting it.  But I just fear that it's not going to get full investment and full development without a profit motive.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I agree, and someone's got to own it. I mean, do you want the government to own it?  No.  No.  So, you know, at least Google's going to do it efficiently.  And you know what? They do have a record of doing things in the public interest  and making things free and available and of not being evil.  It's just someone's going to own it, and someone's going to have all that control and power.  But we certainly don't want the government stepping in and saying,  okay, now you've got too much. Let us get involved.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's even worse.  I've decided I'm going to be the advocate for Google owning it all.  What the hell's wrong with that?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does it create a new market where it's like another company can come in and say,  well, you know, we have better or updated Street View images.  There you go.  We have 3D models of these objects in Iraq.  If you have a 3D printer, you can print out the actual object versus just this flat.  You know, does it create enough to be for competition and for better products?  Maybe if someone has the guts to step up and try that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the basis of IP law maybe should apply here as well.  You get, because you did all the work, you get a limited period of time that you can exploit it,  and then it reverts to the public domain.  Maybe, I mean, it seems like maybe that's the model here.  Unfortunately, copyright law is effectively infinite now, but it shouldn't be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that going to work like the web, Leo?  Am I going to have to stop getting no index tags on everything I own just so they don't sneak into Google's index?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Protect yourself. Well, that's a good point.  Google has been very clear that they don't own the index.  I mean, they don't own, well, wait a minute, they own the index, but they don't own your page.  They don't own the content.  You know, I think if Google wants to put together a lot of cars and drive around and map the world  and compete head to head against the, you know, I think fairly greedy companies telling Navtech,  they should be able to reap the benefit of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you don't like it, go ahead and you do it.  And that's been fantastic for consumers, by the way, Google stepping in there.  You look at the expense of mapping data and they held it to their chests and it was incredibly expensive.  You now have this TomTom app, which is, what is it, like a hundred bucks or something?  A hundred bucks. With very limited rights, by the way.  And then Google's going to do it on Android, it's just freely available, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Pete, in your neck of the woods, there's been a movement to try to get mapping data in the UK,  which is owned by the people through the government that was restricted and for sale.  And I think that's Tom Watson, I think has finally said that's finally opening up.  So part of what happens here is the precedent that occurs.  It creates a demand in other ways that you can't predict that is usually, I think, a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I might point out if you are a believer in openness and in mapping, there is OpenStreetMap, OpenStreetMap.org.  They're doing, you know, open source mapping and they're trying to do a crowdsource like a wiki.  And I think they're actually doing quite a good job.  These maps are pretty amazing. When I look at my local map, it's pretty accurate.  And everybody with a GPS can add to it, can enhance it.  So this does exist. It's not like there aren't open source initiatives to do this.  But if Google...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So in summary, we're all actually quite happy that Google is taking over the world.  Yes.  Welcome to our new workforce.  Doesn't the pod look good on my back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was too much work to fight them. I, for one, welcome our new Google.  Google overlords. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When I wake up in the morning and find the Googlebot indexing my bathroom first thing in the morning, I'm going to be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't mind us. Don't mind us. We're just coming through. Just coming through.  Well, but I think Google is struggling with a lot of issues.  This picture of Michelle Obama is a very good case in point.  Unfortunately, when it was hosted by a blog called Hot Girls, it's a picture, a modified picture, photo edited to make her look like her.  Very offensive. Very racist.  And unfortunately, it often was the first image to surface in Google's image search engine due to its page rank algorithms.  Who's fault is that?  Well, exactly.  The people.  The people.  So one of the things Google did, which I think is very interesting, is the first way they handled it is by posting an apology.  They actually took ad words and they posted an apology saying, sometimes our search results can be offensive.  We agree.  With a link that said, read more.  And then if you click the link, it says, sometimes Google search results on the Internet can include disturbing content, even from innocuous queries.  We assure you that the views expressed by such sites are not in any way endorsed by Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's more of a PR rear end covering, I think.  On the principal side, something in the world will offend someone in the world.  And if Google finds itself in a trap of having to censor or apologize for anything that would offend anyone, there goes the Internet, all information and everything we know.  It's not tenable.  It doesn't work.  So I think they know that clearly.  They really accepted it when the Chinese government, of course, makes them do it, which is the hypocrisy of this.  But I think in that case, I got to say, I think that's more of a PR move to say we can't take it out.  Here's why we can't take it out.  But we're going to apologize for it so that we cut off your complaint against us before you go too far with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think this president for this as well, isn't there, in terms of the George W. Bush result?  Failure.  There was a failure.  And they left it in and they said, you know, why they put in that question about the results, you know, what's up with these results or whatever it was.  I think that's as much as they can do.  And I don't think they should get in the business of editing search results or removing stuff or, you know, that's just that's just a kind of worms.  You're just never going to raise another question now that that the algorithm does have its prejudices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It may not be human, but it has its prejudices built in.  And because it's not transparent and can't be, we don't know what they are.  But the fact that you could Google bomb something is something they didn't want to happen.  So they had to change the algorithm to stop that from happening.  So, in fact, there is a prejudice that they did have to deal with there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although they work very hard, I know, to avoid that kind of thing.  And they look very carefully at the search results that they get.  And they're always tuning the algorithm.  You know, I'm glad you had this conversation because the latest news is that they remove the image.  I thought so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So just now I just did a search, a Google image search for Michelle Obama and that the image is not there.  But it says, did you mean Michelle Obama ape?  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my goodness.  Then you get the image in question.  I believe that this is probably the image.  And then you get the offensive search results ad words.  So now we're getting into even like this is obviously what people are searching for, right?  Because of the news story.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Google adjusted their results to be less offensive.  Exactly.  I made the poor offense.  Well, but exactly what we said they probably couldn't do.  And now they do it.  Don't they open a can of worms?  Aren't they suddenly a publisher?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Flickr got into a lot of trouble around this as well in terms of they started removing images  and then removing the conversation about why the image had been removed.  And once you start doing that, you're never going to, there's no exit, right?  Especially when it's political here.  You're never going to get away from that problem.  I think Jeff has a legitimate point, though.  Why is this?  Why is it possible to get in the algorithm in that way that Google bombs still appear to work?  I think it's an algorithmic problem.  It very much should be the I mean, OK, it's got to be descriptive rather than prescriptive.  I mean, but by the same token, if people are doing things, not because it's their natural behavior on the web,  but simply because they want to get something to rank on Google, it's going to be remarkable to make a story.  I think there's something to be addressed in the algorithm there around Google bombing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And I guess Google could make the case that, well, by making the result be you'd have to type in ape,  we have improved our search results by taking it off the first page of results with Michelle Obama  and forcing you to do a more deep search.  We've improved our results.  But there is editorial in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, right. And I should correct myself.  It doesn't say did you mean it's as related searches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Related searches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, related searches.  Which is even less inflammatory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't know. I mean, maybe they didn't do that.  Maybe that was done automatically by the algorithm when the original Hot Girls blog took down the image.  Maybe that changed the results.  But it sounds to me more like Google changed its return.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. But if I put in the word abortion, right, I have three ads on top.  I have Wikipedia, Planned Parenthood.  I have something called AbortionFacts.com, which I'm suspecting by the look of.  I'm pro-choice, I'm pro-life, right?  So that rose up.  You had some diversity of viewpoint under the most controversial word in America.  But that third result could start Google bombing and can rise up.  So then if Google stops that from happening, are they saying that that's a gaming of what they've done?  Is that a legitimate use like looking for this picture?  It's a hard ethical issue for them to deal with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now some people in our chat room are saying they're still seeing that image at the top of a Michelle Obama search.  I'm not.  So I don't. And again, that's apparently depending on your settings, maybe.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I signed out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You signed out. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I signed out to do it and I launched a different browser and made sure I was signed out and didn't get it.  But you know, I mean, there's so many different servers and different cookies.  Don't don't do an image search for abortion, which is what I just did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, please. Never do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did a text search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and the folks who discovered this particular image also pointed out that if you do a search for Jew, you get some pretty offensive results with the same Google apology.  It's an endless. I mean, I don't even Barbara Bush. I've read has the same problem.  Yeah.  So it's very difficult. I don't know what you do if you're Google.  But I think the last thing you want to do is modify search results because of some perceived defensiveness, because that makes you a publisher.  And, you know, I mean, it's all.  Yeah, a sensor.  Well, but there's even legal, you know, DMCA safe harbor stuff that you lose as a result as well.  This I mean, it's a tough line.  And, of course, as you point out, Flickr has to deal with this.  YouTube has to deal with it all the time.  We live in a new world.  Very interesting issues.  Folks, I really thank you for being here, Pete.  It's been really a pleasure.  I know you weren't feeling well.  I'm glad you're feeling a little bit better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm feeling fine.  Leo, I'm feeling fine.  It was a bit fluid this morning, but I'm good.  Thanks to over the counter drugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, he is Mr. Mashable from Aberdeen.  So good to have you.  Thank you for joining us.  Mashable.com and at Mashable on Twitter.  If you want to follow Pete and you know, I Pete, I would encourage you to create a Pete Cashmore account on Twitter so that we can have a long abandoned one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I should start.  Yeah. And then and that would be Pete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then you could use Mashable to promote Mashable stories.  That's what I always thought.  I'm getting more and more into Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to start using the Twitter for the personal and syndicating into it, I guess.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook.com slash.  Mashable.  Mashable.  And that's the public page.  And you're using that also to promote your, you know, to talk about yourself or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm using my personal page, but the problem is, obviously, that doesn't scale.  It's not public either.  Right. Your personal page.  It kind of is.  It kind of is.  Once you get to you just set everything to everyone.  And yeah, but you can only have five thousand friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know. I know.  I've been struggling with that myself.  You know what I ended up doing on Facebook is I created a Leo, my own personal account that's only friends.  Then I have the original account, which is now five thousand friends.  So it's really essentially a public account.  And then I have a page and never the twain shall meet.  It's crazy.  Gina's got it all.  She's got it all figured out.  Just, you know, at Gina Trapani, go to SmarterWear.org.  Read the book.  CompleteWaveGuide.com.  And you'll be done.  Yep.  That's all you need.  That's it.  That's the complete Gina Trapani.  That's all you need.  That's all you need.  Gina, you're going to stay in New York forever?  When are you coming home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm coming home on Thursday.  So next week I'll be from sunny San Diego on Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, we didn't do the tip tool stuff, but since I used Jeff's number, I felt like I felt like I really couldn't do with it.  But Gina, do you have a do you have a tip you'd like to give us anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do. I have a quick tip.  Google Reader this week added a fave icons to your subscriptions.  And this is just a really little tiny aesthetic thing.  But it makes your it makes your Google Reader sidebar look like a little candy store like a little branded.  A candy store of information.  I maintain the better G reader Firefox extension.  And this is a feature we had in the extension.  And I'm so glad that I don't have to maintain it in the extension anymore because it's built into Google Reader now.  But you just go to your subscriptions or your settings area and the preferences.  I was going to say because then I'll see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I have to go to preferences.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Click on subscription or manage subscriptions at the bottom.  Let's see.  OK.  Manage subscriptions and then in the.  Yeah. Which is at the bottom of the page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's all my subscriptions.  Do I have to go one by one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no.  Click on the preferences tab, which is the first tab on the left right there.  And then at the very bottom show fave icons for subscriptions.  Yeah.  Yeah. And it makes it makes your Google Reader.  Yeah. You know, just pretty.  Everything looks pretty because you get those little fave icons and ones you see on your tabs in Reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I like I like the fave icons because oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  It is. It's like a little candy store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is. Of all your favorite websites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look, there's Joel on software.  He's so cute.  Dvorak's head floating there.  That's great.  I love it.  Very good.  Do you have another number you want to give us, Jeff?  Don't because then I'll have to come up with it with a tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll do a quick tip, too, because this week I think Gina was going to do this, but I'll still steal it from her since you stole my number from me.  See, what goes around comes around is that you can now attach documents to Gmail when you're offline, which you couldn't do before, which is the reason suddenly when you send Gmail, it says not that it's sent, but that it's gone into the outbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Panic at first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm on my off.  No, it's because it goes through the outbox now so that if you're offline, it can sit there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You need gears for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a year thing.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, which is sad, which is bad news for Mac Mac leases are on snow bird.  Google bring us gears for snow leopard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that was going to be your wine of the week.  Bring us frickin chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's the well that to get gears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just give me chrome.  Anything Google.  What's the matter?  How long can it take to recompile?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What has been got to Bethlehem faster?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I understand what it's taken so long.  Jeff Jarvis is a professor at CUNY's Graduate School of Journalism.  He's also their director, their interactive program.
