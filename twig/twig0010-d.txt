Joining us right now, Jeff Jarvis from New York City and buzzmachine.com.  I'm waving.  He's waving.  He's waving.  And we just sent a microphone out to you, Jeff.  So your audio will sound superb.  Next week.  And Monday is Fios Day here at Jarvis House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  25 megs down, 15 up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's going to be fun.  Nice.  Also here, that's Gina Tripani.  You hear her lovely voice and her two bicycles now.  I'm back online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The bicycles are back online.  The bicycles are back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And a familiar British voice, Kevin Marks is here from British Telecom, VP of Internet  at British Telecom.  And Kevin, very involved in Wave because not only is he a former Googler, but he also is  responsible for working with the Ribbit Wave extension.  That's very cool.  We'll talk about that.  So Wave invitations went out and boy, this has been the hottest invite since Gmail.  People just begging to get their invites.  You've all now, Jeff, you're new to it.  I am.  I'm relatively new to it.  I've only had it for five days.  Gina and Kevin, I presume you've been using it since the Google I.O.  May show something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let me, I guess, ask first your impression, Jeff, since you're the most the least senior,  the newest user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I needed Gina a lesson here on how to use it.  That's the problem.  So far, so far, you know, to me, it looks like like chat because I haven't used it.  I haven't put in enough of the little wavelets and stuff.  I was I was gobsmacked this week that Scobel went on attacking it.  And I and I said, hey,  he just he just said it was just a time waster and too much communication and this and that.  I said, that's that's my I tweeted back.  I said, that's like looking at the first browser and saying, oh, it's gray and ugly.  It'll never go anywhere.  It's early.  It's just the beginning of functionality.  I think we've got to keep open to what's what the possibilities are here.  I know people in news are buzzing about as I have been beginning about what it could do there.  And I'm sure a lot of other areas we see that SAP and Salesforce dot com are writing apps for it.  You got Kevin Marks there writing apps for it.  I think that that's you know, I wonder whether Wave will be a little like RSS that it will be Intel inside Wave inside.  You may not know you're using it sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're actually getting a lesson in our wave right now from Kevin Marks on how to get our avatars visible.  See, my avatar is visible to me, but apparently I haven't shared it publicly.  And as a result, I don't see yours, Jeff.  So what do I click?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just got to put one up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's you click on yourself in the bottom left corner.  Then you do edit profile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, I'm not going to do that in public because my phone number is in there.  That's changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Edit profile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm wrong.  They've changed the UI.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no.  It says your profile photo is not visible to everyone.  It's currently only visible to people with whom you can chat.  OK, so that means that I have to just change that.  Yes, make my photo visible to everyone.  And you do that in your Google profile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's in the profile now.  They moved it.  OK, so that it used to be in the Gmail press.  It's interesting.  I move that into profile.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and there's one thing I've noticed that when I hit the contacts button, it goes to my Google contacts and it doesn't seem to be in any way attached to wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the same database underneath.  It's just that the wave one is filtering it for is on wave two, whereas your actual contact management is still in the same general Google database where the contacts are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So and this is another thing I puzzle about.  It seems that anybody can become my contact without any permission on my part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that needs to that needs to change.  Yeah, pretty much.  Definitely needs to be that needs to change.  There need to be permissions and I haven't heard about it, but I would be surprised if that wasn't on the list of things to do, which is long.  There's a long to do list.  Imagine my surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I sign up for the way.  We were we were we should mention this until Thursday.  Everybody was using the wave sandbox.  Yes, the sandbox was went down and then when it came back up, it said now you have to migrate.  And now we're at officially at wave dot Google dot com.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think the way sandbox is still there for the developers.  But so Gina and I now have two accounts, which makes it even more confusing.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what did you wear?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where did you wave?  Which one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So so there is no federation.  And this one, the wave that we're in right now.  So is it a different server, Kevin?  What is what is going on here?  Yeah, I think this is a different service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the original one was running under wave sandbox dot com domain.  So it was like running Gmail on your own domain or private domain.  And this one, the new wave is on is on Google dot com.  So that's like being Gmail rather than apps for your domain.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, one of the things we've been saying is, oh, wave will be a very different experience when there are lots of people we know in there.  And that's true.  Maybe not a better experience yet.  It's certainly a chaotic experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It definitely is.  Part of the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go ahead, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, go ahead, Jeff.  I think part of the problem is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is too much of a sandbox.  I've got to have something real to do with it to see how it works.  Now it's kind of like the beginnings of the first time you get a phone and you call somebody and say, hey, I have a phone.  It's like it's like Steve Martin.  The wave is in the wave is in and there's nothing to do with it when I actually start doing something with someone with a purpose.  Then I think I'll have a far better sense of it.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I gave a talk about wave here in San Diego at a local tech event and I did all my show notes.  This is on the preview.  I did all my excuse me.  My the outline for my talk and wave and I had someone the event organizer.  I had him get into the wave while I was talking and sort of note down questions and comments.  Oh, how cool.  And that was really, really, really useful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you really do have to because the first experience is a very I am like experience.  This is this is how it is with all my friends that are like, hey, I'm here.  You're here.  Let's wave.  It looks very much like an I am.  But it's using it as a document collaboration tool.  That's when it gets useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  And when we can use it to publish something publicly that doesn't open people into the wave, I think that's going to be really powerful.  We collaborate on something and make something together.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So that's I mean, that's that's sort of what I've been saying about it for a while, which is a lot of people saying, oh, it's like Twitter.  It's like Facebook.  It isn't like actually either of those.  It's really a document collaboration tool that happens to update very quickly.  So it's much closer to Google Docs or to Etherpad than it is to Twitter or Facebook because the model is completely different.  It is document centric.  It just doesn't doesn't quite seem to be because the UI they put on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If I'm not used to yet is that is the live nature of it rather than I'm so used to the bio rhythm of chatter or for that matter, even Twitter, Twitter, where you wait for completed messages.  You don't wait here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very weird.  It's very weird.  Everybody's typing at the same time and it's a very strange experience, although they're good tools for reviewing what's been added.  It gets highlighted in yellow.  You could press the space bar to jump through changes.  So it is possible to review.  There's even, of course, that playback thing that they demonstrated on that hour long video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, this is one of Scoble's one biggest critics criticisms of it, right, that it's so distracting because you're watching people's cursors go by.  And but they haven't released draft mode yet.  Right.  There's a little checkbox that's grayed out right now because they haven't built in the functionality yet where you can either check that you're going to type without anybody seeing you, you know, not naked.  That will be nice.  That will be really nice.  I think that'd be really nice.  And I think that should be on by default.  But I don't know if that's really funny, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the reason I had to get rid of Scoble on Twitter because he was very distracting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Imagine if Scoble's in a wave.  Now he's listening to the show by that, by the way, he says, I'd love to get him on.  And he says, I can't get on.  I haven't had a shower yet.  But I think one of the criticisms was that that he might have seen it more as a social media device.  It's not Twitter.  It's not friend feed.  It's not social media.  It's a collaborative tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you have to think about it more like Wikipedia than email.  But the problem with that with that is that most people don't edit Wikipedia.  So that metaphor wouldn't speak to the mainstream.  But I think that the serious geeks that have edited Wikipedia pages before or just pawed through the revisions of a page and watch it change over time.  There was that fantastic screencast that I think John Udell did of the history of the umlaut and rock star in like rock band names.  Yeah, it was fantastic.  Yeah, it's a good way to be a page.  And he and he did a screencast of the page that as it grew over time, which is exactly what wave playback is.  And so that's what you have to think about it like.  And then there's the talk page on Wikipedia pages where people can make comments.  I mean, this is this is really for nerds that know what Wikipedia really can do.  I think that's how we have to think about wave rather than email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Scobel does make a good point.  This was pitched as a replacement for email.  And I think that's part of the confusion.  I don't think this is wrong.  This is not a replacement for email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think that's exactly right.  I think that's the problem.  It puts something in your mind's eye and what it was.  It's like the iPhone should have come out first, I think, without the phone.  So you saw it as a computer and then add the phone to it.  Right.  It sets expectations.  Gina, I think you're absolutely right about this, that I keep looking at it as the future of the document online.  And it's not a page anymore.  It's a constantly updated thing.  I've been yammering on on this show about Marissa Meyer talking about hyper personal news streams.  And Eric Schmidt gave two interviews this week, one a really good interview to Danny Sullivan about news.  And he, too, was going on about this notion of the constantly updated, highly personal stream.  So I think if you look at Wave as a water metaphor, as a stream of stuff that you can come into any time and see, but it is constantly updated, that's a whole different view of it than email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. But that might replace email as a collaborative tool.  In other words, email probably wasn't a very good choice for that.  I like your analogy, Gina.  It is. It's real time Wikipedia is kind of what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  It's much closer to a wiki.  Well, more like an internet wiki because it's not, you know, each wave has a set of people who can modify it.  So it's much more like an internet wiki.  I think I think I mean, when Lars talks about reinventing email, I think he meant reinventing a lot of the practices that we use email for, for collaborating about documents and seeing how frustrating that is.  So if you think about email within a large corporation, which is probably his experience now is in Google, you spend a lot of time bouncing stuff back and forth and then sending links to documents and things.  So I think his his goal there was to replace those practices.  But the core of it, you know, if you go deep down to the protocol, the protocol, it's about simultaneously editing a document and having those edits coalesce into one thing that you can see.  And that's, you know, there's there's a plug in that somebody did that lets you edit media wiki using the way of interface.  And that's one of the other plug ins. And that's an interesting way to look at it.  But the tricky thing is that Wikipedia has this surface thing, which is the current state of the document and then hidden away underneath it is the argument.  And with wave, they're in the same place.  So that makes it a little bit harder because you don't have the two faces of the document.  And at the moment, because it's new, most people are using it to talk back and forth rather than try and edit something.  So what you see is this sort of badly threaded chat rather than we're collaborating on creating something together.  So I suspect that will change as people get more used to it and stop using it and stop playing with a new feature.  But partly because a lot of people have said this is it's like I am in chat in the same thing.  I am an email in the same the same app.  People are getting a bit sort of drawn towards that side and not seeing the documentary side of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, isn't it true, really, that if anything is going to be truly innovative, it's not going to fit into any pigeonhole.  It's going to be at first bewildering to its users.  Otherwise, it's just some rehash.  And I think of Twitter when you first saw Twitter, it didn't make any sense at all.  And it's taken a while for us to absorb it.  This is even more innovative.  So I think it's kind of a measure of how novel it is that it's not immediately obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was something Laura Fitton said at the 140 conference was that the users recreated Twitter into something interesting that extended Jack's original vision.  I think that's very, very true.  I suspect that we drew a wave as well.  Yes.  But as you said, there are places where Wade is like email in that anyone who has your wave address can add you to things and send you stuff and put them in your inbox.  So it hasn't picked up the sort of whitelist based model of who can talk to me that we have on Twitter and Facebook and the other social networks.  It still has the if you have my address token, then you can put stuff at the top of my inbox.  So that that's the piece that's tricky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the other thing that is maybe disappointing to me is I was hoping we can use it in a kind of a broadcast form of a massive wave.  And I don't think that that's going to work at all.  That's not something that you could do with this at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the mistake the L.A. Times made with its famous wikitorial.  If you remember back in the day, they thought it would be cool.  They put up a wiki of a tutorial.  It was about Iraq and no one was going to collaborate.  The key to wikis are that they must be collaborative.  It's not a place to discuss really or to argue.  And I think that's where the vision for wave comes in.  And it's right. It's real time collaboration.  But you've got to be trying to do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's more so than that. There must be a shared goal.  Because the wiki converges on the shared goal.  So Wikipedia works because you're trying to build an encyclopedia and you want NPOV to guide you so people would delete stuff.  But the trouble with wiki is if there's dissension, it ends up deleted because you get into edit wars.  And it then moves into the comment thing hidden behind the scenes.  And so, yeah, you're right.  It doesn't work for something where you're actually trying to have a back and forth debate.  And I think that may be tricky with wave if you try and use it in that mode in terms of getting consensus, which means deleting.  And Adena Levin wrote a great post on this.  She actually wrote it back in July, but she's spot on about there's a missing modality here,  which is what happens when you're having conversations in email and so on.  And so on is that someone sums up the discussion so far and said, this is where we are.  And I suppose the idea of wave is you delete all the stuff that wasn't true anymore and coalesce that down.  But I suspect it's going to take a while for us to get that social practice right.  Because people will feel like you're throwing away their comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's going to have to be in kind of consensual groups that these waves are formed.  They're not going to they can't be public.  They have to be joint ventures that we all have investment investment in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there has to be a gardener, right, as there is with Wikipedia.  I mean, there's a very strong watchful community always watching.  You know, when I published that wave on my blog, it was like, OK, I looked at it for the first few hours and check the comments.  But like eventually it's going to fall off my front page and I'm not going to look at it again.  And it could get totally vandalized.  And I wouldn't know because I just don't have I'm not going to have the time to constantly garden every wave that I make public.  So it'd be interesting to see what happens with the permission stuff.  Like I agree with Kevin that it's similar to email the way it works right now is similar to email.  Anybody can wave at you.  But I'm not I'm not so crazy about that system.  As I said, I mean, with G-talk, I can say, you know, only people or at least with with aim with instant messenger clients.  And I always set my settings like this.  Only the people who are on my list on my contacts list can actually chat me because I don't want the whole world to be able to chat me.  So I wonder if waves going to take that on.  I hope so. I think permissions are an important part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's an interesting wave I've been looking at in my wave.  Somebody has asked, would you like to see your Google email in a private Google wave?  And they've they've got a poll and a vast majority of users say yes to that.  That's an interesting use of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's weird. I'm not sure that would work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of. But see, remember, Kevin, we don't know how it's going to work.  We don't know what's going to happen. The users are going to find that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. But the point is, Gmail does a fairly good job of taking individual messages and turning them back into a conversational thread.  That's what keeps us using it in that it throws away all the repeated stuff and just shows you the new stuff.  So when someone's quoting someone else and there's craft in it, it chops that out and shows that just shows that and it collapses the ones you've already seen.  So it's doing a fairly good job of taking a message oriented protocol and turning it into a sort of time time order coalesced thread.  Whereas wave is built the other way around.  Wave is built as a document with a series of edits and it's presenting itself as a as a series of messages.  And so when you bridge it to something else, it doesn't work very well.  So that it was when you use the Twitter bot, it shows you a bunch of tweets and you send something back, but you don't see any responses to that because it's fed out to something else.  And it's not sitting there polling Twitter for replies and things and coalescing them back in.  And if it did, it's very hard.  It's very hard to bridge something that there is one true version of, which there is in a wave.  Even though it's slightly delayed, the delayed edits come in from different times and then create the one true version with something where there is many parallel things going on at once, which is what the state of Twitter is and other social networks.  Everyone sees something different because we're all seeing a different subset of the conversation.  And that isn't the sort of structural model of wave.  There's a couple of bits that let you do private conversations within a wave, but it's not very it's not very clear how that works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So far, let me understand something here is if you look at friend feeds relationship with Twitter and so on and so forth is wave going to feed out or is wave going to aggregate from elsewhere or is it going to be completely separate from the world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hard to say. It's a difficult it's a difficult bridge to do.  That's the thing, because, you know, friend feed and Facebook and Twitter all have the same conceptual model of you're writing an individual message that is self contained.  And then it threads those together into an overwhelming structure overarching structure that may be overwhelming to overwhelming and overarching that that is here's the list of things your friends have said recently, and it may connect some of them back together into a thread.  But but the the primary thing is the individual message, whereas wave is the other way around.  Each wave is a document and there are there may be threads within it, but they're not connected to the rest of the world at all.  And they're only exist within that document. They're not independent entities that are cloned in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to add a fourth voice to the conversation. Marshall Kirkpatrick is here of Read Write Web.  He contacted me and said, I want to talk about wave too.  And we're always glad to get Marshall on the show. It's good to have you, Marshall. Thanks for joining us.  We appreciate it. So somebody's asking in the friend feed room, and I think this is an apt question, is I mean, I'll ask you first, Marshall, is wave just a business application?  Is there a individual personal or public use for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I imagine if it's successful, there will be all kinds of different uses.  The the permissioning will make a big difference in security in terms of business use, and there will be loads of personal uses as well.  It seems like a really, really ambitious project that ties together so many different things that it's it's hard to foresee what beyond collaboration in general, it's going to make possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you happy, Kevin, with the structure of it?  Because it does look very email like you got folders on the left and you know, you have a viewing pains and you have a list pain.  I wonder if that's the it certainly waves not tied to that, as we've seen, you can it can look like anything.  What if this serves it or if it confuses people, if it looks too much like email?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's you know, there's there's different bits to this.  So the underlying thing is the the protocol for adding a document, the operational transform protocol, and that's the bit they've worked on interop making interoperable so far.  The piece they haven't released yet is the bit that translates from that document on the server into the stuff on the web client.  And in fact, that whole protocol is a bit fluffy in that it's not specified yet.  It's it's very reliant on Google Web Toolkit model of the world and how that's translated.  I know they're trying to change that.  But my strongest pushback on them is that the document format they're using on the server is some arbitrarily made up XML thing.  And my take was you should use HTML or a subset of HTML for the document format because everyone in the world can display that.  So you could just worst case you could take the current state of that document and feed it out to people as HTML.  And the pushback I got from them was but HTML isn't very friendly to operational transforms.  But I think that's that's like that's a we'll go do some more work then response for me because I can I can paste HTML into the wave and they do some munging into way format and then push it through as an OT.  And then when I someone else said it, it goes munch back to HTML to me.  So clearly there is a subset of HTML that will work with this.  But they decided they want this. They've made up their own document format.  And, you know, Tim Bray, who was one of the inventors of XML, has written a beautiful post saying don't invent XML document formats, use existing ones.  Right. And I think this is a strong case of that.  If the document format was actually HTML, then being able to build other presentation layers that show that would be much easier.  Whereas at the moment, the interoperability has mostly been done on the server side.  And if you look at the other client side interoperations, they're mostly a post a new message to the end of the feed thing, and they don't have the complexity of this one because this one is doing like four transformations between what you type on the screen and what the other person sees on the screen.  Because it's going from the browser side rendering into the OT, which gets sent over to the server, which gets consolidated, which gets translated back into another OT, which then goes through a transformation goes to your browser.  So there's there's it's going through several different document transforms on the way.  And as none of those are documented or specified yet, it's very hard for anyone else to sort of replace that part of it.  So for now, what we have is this way of editing model that we can see, which is running on Google's code on Google servers.  They federated the back end and they've federated how the edits get propagated.  And that stuff is people have been building stuff that interoperates with that.  But the piece about the structure of the document is not is not really there yet.  And I'm hoping that'll that'll come out in time.  But I still have the concern that it is.  It's a made up document. Yeah.  Another made up document format.  We don't need that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do like that XMPP is under the hood.  I mean, this seems like almost an instance of XMPP and how it can be used.  Right.  Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it adds it means it adds another requirement to your server setup if you want to run your own waves.  But hey, you know, the people who are going to run their own wave server are going to be people who have the resources and are going to be able to do that.  I mean, I don't imagine it's that complicated.  It's really complicated.  And you'll, you know, disagree a while back and said there are so many protocols going on under the hood and, you know, makes it more complicated.  You know, it's hard to say.  You know, I think the thing about way that excites me so much is that it's just so open, you know, there's so much potential like this client and this server is just one way to implement this one protocol.  And since it's totally extensible and gadgets and bots, I just feel like there's so much potential.  I said before the show and I should say this to your listeners that I'm just totally not objective at this point.  I'm a complete not her fan girl.  Is that because you're a developer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think that you get so enthused?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Someone on Twitter said wave is for developers egos.  The way complex jazz is for musicians.  It speaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It speaks to you specifically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I felt that rang a little bell with me.  I mean, Lars Rasmussen waved at me this morning.  I mean, I might as well have been in Hollywood and saw Angelina Jolie.  Like I almost died.  It's nice.  It's brilliant.  And he's like, hey, let me know if you have any questions.  I was like, oh, God, OK.  Lars.  So yeah, I'm just totally not objective.  I think part of it is that it really does speak to me as a developer.  I'm totally, totally excited.  I will sleep about it again this week.  You know, a few of my contacts did come online in this wave in this wave batch of invites.  And I've been using it all week and I'm excited about it.  I'm going to start making my own gadgets for it.  And so what kind of things do you want to make, Gina?  You know, this is this is the thing.  It's kind of it's kind of hard for me to figure out.  I mean, like getting your email in a wave, that to me doesn't sound very useful.  I was thinking about writing something from my own product, which is the Twitterlytic, which is a Twitter client.  I would like to, for instance, make one tweet a wave and then all replies to that tweet feed in as comments on that wave.  So that's what I'm going to like that.  Yeah, that's going to be my first gadget or bought.  Not sure exactly how to do it, but since I have, you know, threaded tweets on my server, I'm going to see if I can feed those out to wave that way.  And then I would like to be able to embed that wave somewhere so people can see.  So that's going to be my first little wave development.  In fact, Kevin, I might be hitting you up for development advice since the Ribbit gadget.  The Ribbit gadget, by the way, is incredible.  I know Kevin's too modest to say it, but it's it's it's all.  Yeah, I did a conference call with Kevin and his coworker and I was really blown away.  I never do demos. I was so glad that I did that.  It's really amazing. I haven't used it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have one set up. Kevin asked invited me and I just didn't get a chance.  Kevin, why don't you tell us a little bit about this Ribbit module or what do you call it?  A bot? It's a gadget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ribbit conference gadget, we call it.  OK, so what it is, is we looked at wave and looked at it as this collaboration tool where you're working with people on the same document.  And it's very, very textual. You're talking back and forth through text, you're editing stuff together.  There's this conversation going on.  And we thought, well, there's a lot of scenarios where we're doing that.  But when we do it, we're having a telephone call together and talking about the same thing at the same time.  So we're either discussing the document and saying, should we do this?  Should we do that? And settling it.  Or you're having a conference call or a chat like we're having now.  And someone's taking notes and other people want to join in the notes.  And the tools for doing that at the moment aren't great.  So we said, well, clearly it would be great if the conference and the wave were integrated together.  How can we do that?  So what we'd set it up was that you add the bot to the wave.  Should I try doing this? Am I in the right wave?  Oh, there you go. You got that one.  So you add the bot to the wave.  And then...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I put a phony number in there, Kevin, because otherwise it shows my actual number.  OK.  So you can't call me at this point.  But in theory, I put a real number in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. So what it does is it shows you your own number and it doesn't show you anyone else's.  Everyone who adds their number can be called.  Then you click Start Conference.  All their phones ring. You're in a conference call. You can talk.  It shows you the current state of the call.  I mean, if you click it, it'll call me and not you probably.  And then you can have your conversation while the wave's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's using VoIP though. It's not using... I mean, it's from BT.  Is it using a VoIP system? How is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What it's using is the underlying Ribbit telephony engine,  which lets you connect calls between anything and anything.  So at the moment, we're just making it switch to US phone numbers.  It doesn't work internationally yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to put a real phone number in there. I won't show this on the air,  but I will put a real phone number in.  And then we can... If I start this conference, can you answer the phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure. I've got a phone here, so it should ring in the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's see what happens. It says it's dialing.  And now I'm talking to Kevin over the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm talking to you over the phone. Oh, yeah.  We do demo-sites this week and I get a lot of echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You shouldn't be getting any echo right now, is it all right?  Yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So that's... I've turned my headphones off because I'm hearing through that.  So that's the point. The point is you can do a conference call with the people who are in the wave,  set that up, have that going, and then go back to collaborating on the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now we're typing in the wave, but we're also talking.  And that's going to solve one problem with wave, which is a lot of the side conversations end up in the wave  and you get all this... It gets crazy.  It'd be nice to have a side channel that actually doesn't end up in the wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And the other thing is that you can add people to the wave.  They can put their phone numbers in.  And then if you're having the meeting and not all of them are online,  you'll phone out to them and be able to talk to them about bits of it as well.  So it's bridging the mode of being on the phone in a conference call  and being in this collaborative document.  And I think you get some richness from both sides from that.  That was the underlying point. Anyway, I should hang up on this.  Yeah, put your headphones back on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'll turn everybody else back up now. Go ahead. You can talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are there any kind of whiteboard apps for it so you can do collaborative sketches and stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be cool? It seems like there should be...  Maybe even save a recording of the conference into the wave and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This use case in particular makes sense to me that phone calls,  but I do wonder how many of these types of functionality and bots and what have you  wouldn't be more simply offered as standalone applications?  At what point, where do you draw the line?  At what point is being part of wave add value and more value than it is complication?  It becomes the platform for it, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a trade-off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The point for this one was that the ordinary conference call experience is  everyone dials into a number and types in another number,  and you spend five or ten minutes doing that before anything works.  And with this, because you've got a set of people who know who they are  and they can add their contact details to it,  it becomes a one-click to bring them all back into the conference  or the subset of them that you want.  So I think the goal there was ease of, I've already set this group up,  let me call into them as well. Correlation there.  I think you can bridge into other apps too.  We could bridge that out to Skype. We have the technology to do it.  The question is, the user interface for that gets a bit more complicated.  You've got to put a Skype ID in as well as a phone number.  And that's something we're working on to try and make easier.  But the other half of this is, if you choose to use,  it's what we were saying earlier, maybe before you got on,  is that because Wave is different from the message-based things,  the individual message thread stuff,  once you start using Wave as your collaborative document,  you sort of have to keep using it because it is the sort of value of truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the definitive repository. Yeah, it's the canonical source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's my crude question.  Can you envision people getting rich using Wave?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I like that question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When I was speaking to the online...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  People make money on top of Facebook so far, including my son.  Is this commercial soon?  Potentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the things we're looking at with the Ribbit Gantor is,  conference calling is a fairly big business.  BT makes a lot of money from doing conference calling already.  So how do you package that up in a way that's useful to people?  What features make sense as a free app?  What makes sense as a value-added app?  We could transcribe the calls  and post the transcriptions back into the Wave for people.  Was that a service people would pay for?  There's a bunch of possibilities there,  and we're still working out what might work and what might not  and what we package out for different people.  The other thing is that with the Ribbit stuff,  we've got our own API for this.  If other people want to do telephony apps,  they can write to our API  and we'll work out the billing parts for the bits that cost money  and the bits that are free will get passed through.  Somebody asked about, was this easy to write?  The Wave part was reasonably easy in that it's basically web development.  You're building a gadget, which is very like building a website  with some extra bits of magic glue because there's shared state and stuff.  The Ribbit stuff, we already had an SDK for that.  So a lot of it was like just wiring some calls together.  It's like, okay, here's a set of people,  you need to get phone numbers for them,  here's a set of people and phone numbers.  So I'm not literally the guy who spent a lot of time hacking away on this.  There was a chunk of work there.  But at its heart, it was web development.  It was the models we're used to.  That's one of the nice things about Wave,  and I think why Gina's excited about it,  is it feels quite webby in lots of ways.  The hooks, the gadgets are very like creating web pages,  and the bots are like doing CGI's or something.  You get a thing you send a response back.  Is that fair?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it pretty easy to write a bot, Gina?  Is that something that's not so hard to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't believe that it's that difficult to do.  I'll be honest, I haven't dove into the code.  Most of the bots right now are hosted on AppSpot,  and they're written in Python because that's what AppSpot,  yeah, Python is AppSpot.  But yeah, I've seen bots that, you know,  high school kids have turned out pretty quickly.  And you know, bots that do pretty simple things,  like link at usernames to Twitter or turn a colon and a parentheses into a smiley face.  That's a pretty simple thing.  A bot can update content in a wave,  so it scans a wave and then it makes changes,  like turns something into...  The translation bot does that.  Right, right, right.  And that does appear to be pretty simple,  although I haven't yet dove into development.  So I'll let you know next week.  This week is my wave development week, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, good.  What is the percentage for Google in this?  Is it just another Google Docs-like collaborative environment?  Marshall, what do you think Google's up to here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I think that if they can transform communication online  as radically as this appears intended to do,  then they could do things like create a whole economy of premium widgets.  They could run advertisements on it,  and it's just more Google at the center of our online lives.  So if they can pull it off, I think it's a huge win for them.  Leo, I think that one of Google's weaknesses,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and we've talked about this in the show, is the live web.  That's why the interest in Twitter, of course.  Also the real-time web, you mean?  That's what I mean, yeah, the real-time web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so rather than just buying Twitter, which God knows it still could do,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  even though it's worth a billion dollars now,  it also becomes part of the structure of creating the next generation of the live web,  of the stream web.  And I think that that's something that puts it at the center of whatever comes next.  It's kind of post-page, post-site, and it's a new way of doing it.  Post-page, post-site, and it's a new web that's being invented here.  And if they're at the center of it and helping it create it,  that's got to be powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That makes sense to me, but I want to push back a little bit on the idea  that they are feeling threatened by Twitter.  I've been speaking to a whole bunch of real-time web companies  over the last few weeks in preparation for an event on the topic.  And there's so much more to the real-time web already than just Twitter.  And even the search engine companies are finding that Twitter isn't providing enough links,  that there's not enough link sharing going on on Twitter for them to build a good full index.  We agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When I saw Wave, the first thing I said was they didn't just buy Twitter,  they went three steps beyond it.  We agree.  And Twitter's not perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm noticing that, by the way, one of the top trending topics on Twitter right now  is Leo Laporte makes one dollar.  So I have it.  You click it, you get nothing.  So I don't know what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At least you make $1.5 million or something.  No, one dollar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just wanted to mention that a Wave called This Week in Google Wave was spontaneously created,  and they made public, and quite a few people are in it right now.  Our listeners made a Wave.  This is like instantaneous real-time community just kind of showing up someplace,  so it's just a pretty cool use.  How do I find that, Gina?  It's called This Week in Google Wave.  So do a search for with colon public space and then do This Week in Google in quotes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So because it's public, we don't need to be added to it to read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, but to find it, use the with colon public operator.  That was a really great operator Gina passed along to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because if you just do with colon public and nothing else, you'll see all the public Waves.  And it's a good way to see what people are doing.  A lot of it's silly, but it's a good way to see what's going on.  It's like looking at the public timeline early on in the days of Twitter.  So I could do with colon public and then space twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then space and then do actually the name of the title of the Wave is This Week in Google Wave.  So if you put in quotes This Week in Google Wave, it'll be the only one actually that shows up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. And there are 134 posts in there already.  So it's quite busy. Yeah, it is quite busy.  Yeah. So that's a very interesting use. Unexpected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. You know that with public search, you know, once you do a search and you add yourself to a public Wave,  or I think maybe just once you do the search, public Waves start automatically showing up in your inbox and things get nuts immediately.  Well, that explains it.  Giant sea of moving waves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I understand. I have a ton of stuff in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. So Lars actually left a comment on my post on Lifehacker saying that they're going to make it so that  public Waves don't show up in your inbox automatically.  And he apologized and he said it's going to take a few weeks for that to roll out, but that that won't always be the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think it's a great privilege in some ways for us to be watch ringside as they work this stuff out  because users figure out what Wave is and the developers respond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's an incredible time to be a user. It's an incredible time to be a user.  I spent pretty much all week with my friends who had just gotten on, who, you know, I would be the only person that knew anything about it,  who would wave at me and say, show me what this is.  And it was just so much fun to show them and then to watch documentation, you know, coming up fast and furious on Wave itself  and watching users who don't know one another, educating one another and bringing up issues.  It's a classic time to be a user. And I feel terrible that it's invite only.  I feel terrible for all the people who want so desperately an invite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You get eight nominations when you get an account and then the nominations will trickle out.  I know at least one of my nominations has gone out as an invite, but they don't happen instantaneously.  And is it kosher or is it not kosher to have more than one Wave account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good question. I don't know. I've only got one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have two.  Oh, well, you're the president of the Internet, Valdio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should have at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel a little guilty. I'm not sure if I broke a rule or not.  I have one that's my personal kind of I think of as my personal one and then one is the is the Twitter one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, actually, I have a developer account, so I guess I've got more than one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did your developer account not get converted though into a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, separate account, separate server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, so I guess I have three then.  Yeah.  I presume I still have my sandbox account. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I got three as well. So we're both breaking rules.  Although the build, I believe the client build and the server build on the dev preview box is a little different.  I don't know, Kevin, maybe you can clarify.  I think it's an older or I don't know if they updated it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know the exact details, but they are different builds because you see different menus on them and the structure is slightly different.  And I suspect that they will roll out new changes to dev one before they roll out to this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to say, incredibly brave of the Rasmussens to put this out here at this stage in its development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't you think?  Gutsy, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, you're kind of letting it all hang out.  I see the reason for it though, because you need the network effect to really test it.  You need people to write bots and extensions for it to extend it.  So you need that, but still pretty gutsy to say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're right, Leo, because I see snarking about it from the most ridiculous quarters, from people who developed other things earlier.  I won't say which ones and who are almost kind of jealous of the attention it's getting.  And it's an alpha.  It's so damned early.  That's where it's going to be powerful.  Do you think we're giving it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, this is a Google show, but do you think we're giving it too much attention?  I mean, is this like saying, I don't know, oh, look, Google Docs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Leo, to go to your magnificent online news association speech, if you were still trying to do...  And by the way, it's really, really good, folks, and go watch it.  I embedded it at newsinnovation.com.  Wow, I blush.  But as you were saying there, if you're trying to make a cable network for millions of people, yeah, we're giving it way too much attention.  But for your highly targeted audience of geeks who all know more than I do...  I think they care.  It's the perfect topic.  I think they care.  What does this mean for us?  What can we do with this?  It's clay to be played with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  And it's true that you're not going to see those conversations on...  You're not going to see the Today Show talking about Google Wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but Gina was on NPR.  I did an interview for Channel 4 News in London.  Oh, there is interest then.  And by the way, when I went on Channel 4, they warned me before I got on, can you please not make any tsunami references?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, geez. Yes.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have that much sense. Thank you. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Matt Cutts in the Friend Feed room says it has...  He wonders if it has anything to do with the way they use the word wave on Firefly.  I don't remember them.  It is. It is.  It is Firefly inspired on purpose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that everything is shiny, Captain.  Error message is also from Firefly.  I recognize that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But how do they use the word wave in Firefly?  I don't remember that part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They said I was sending them a wave.  If you actually watch them when they're communicating over the net to other ships, they said, we'll send them a wave.  Oh, I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like it even more now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I partner in day life with you, Pender Chardonnay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How can you go wrong with that?  That's pretty cool.  So, Matt, yes, you'd think Matt would know this, but yes, apparently it is, in fact.  That's why they call it a wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how long until this gets out of Google and becomes a distributed protocol?  I'd love to have a server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I really would love to run a server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The race is on.  And the smart companies are coding their servers and clients right now, I think, because Google's servers are...  Google's the first one to market.  But I think this is...  Oh, you mean there's no reason...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is all public.  There's no reason somebody couldn't just do it?  So I haven't looked into the Eternals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead, Mark and Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the protocol and the code for the servers is public.  There's an open source project that gives you a server that Google released a couple of months ago.  And people are starting to put them up.  So if you follow the dev list, people are saying, I've got my server up here.  People are working back and forth.  So far, I don't think you can point a Google client at another server.  I think that's something people are trying to work out how to do now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we need to have federation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the federation is built into the protocol as part of the design.  You're able to have waves where some of the wavelets, which are the individual sub threads, are on different servers.  That's by designing the protocol now.  And how much that's been tested, I don't know yet.  But certainly, if you follow the spec groups, that's been discussed.  And there was a lot of careful work on security protocols to make sure that waves can't spoof one another there as well.  Yeah, there's a lot of work to do.  Where's the identity stored?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is identity centralized?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, the identity is on the server you're on.  So whatever we are, what's the domain?  wav.google.com  Kevin Marks, wav.google.com, and we were Kevin Marks at Wave Sandbox.  Got it.  That's a sensible way to do it.  So it's an email-like identifier, but it belongs to the root server that owns the place where you originate the waves.  And part of the point is that you're supposed to be able to have a conversation with people on your own server,  and that will never leave that and get federated unless you invite someone from another server.  That's part of the lower level design of the protocol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What are the dangers of and controls on spam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the piece that they're still talking about.  The controls are better than email in that you can't spoof the address.  It has to be signed, so you can't pretend to be somebody else.  Fantastic.  So that's there.  But the piece, as I said earlier, the piece that's missing is that if someone has your address, they can add you to waves,  which is the thing we were discussing earlier.  So it still has the assumption that if someone has your identifier, they can put stuff at the top of your inbox.  And that's the piece that they haven't worked through.  And I suspect part of the bringing it out in public is to stretch that case,  because obviously when they're only doing it within a closed group within Google and then a smaller closed group within developers,  those issues aren't going to be as clear as they are as they add more and more people to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does a wave server have some sort of inbound capacity, a pop server or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not directly. It's more that the protocol federates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you have to actively choose to federate to pick up that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'd have to invite someone on another server, and then that would create the connection and it would propagate over the state of the wave.  And then the changes they made would get propagated back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So as long as that's done properly, it sounds like that would also protect you if you run your own server.  Only those you choose to participate would participate.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin, do you know if there's much communication going on between the wave folks and the PubSub hubbub and Webfinger and those groups in Google?  Well, I don't know in detail because I'm not there anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they've got different they're doing different things.  So, you know, this is what I was saying at the beginning is that wave is primarily there's a shared document with a shared with a shared server.  Wave is primarily there's a shared document with a shared with a state on one server and you're sending updates to that place.  Whereas PubSub hubbub and the other things that are like that are focused on here's an individual message that stand alone.  Let's make sure that gets propagated out.  So Brett Brett did say when I spoke to him on Gilmore Gang this week about PubSub hubbub, he said, well, you could run wave over PubSub hubbub instead of running it over XMPP.  But that's not actually a very helpful response because you could do for sending the individual messages.  But the actual consensual state is different.  The state in in Twitter and in feeds is here's a set of individual entries.  You have an array of them and they may refer to each other by links, but that's all they can do.  Whereas the state in wave, the core state is here's a document underneath and there are some little bits inside that that edits to that document.  And the the comments and the blips that appear are edits on that document.  They're not separate. They're not. They're not separate places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so much to wrap my head around.  I'm just boggled by the whole thing.  And it sounds like it's not the only real time initiative within Google.  Sure. Yeah. Yeah.  Not by a long shot. Not by a long shot.  Exactly. Marshall to answer your question. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It'd be interesting.  You know, it could be that the that the wave clients that that are very successful are the ones that pair things down and make this a little more simple.  You know, maybe this is, you know, maybe, you know, the Google's wave client is too complex and and, you know, other clients that come out will will make it a little simpler and maybe hide hide a little the complexity.  But this is what I'm excited about is that there are so many possibilities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's one of the things that I'm concerned about it, that there are so many real time initiatives going on all over the Web and usability is one of the concerns that's foremost in people's minds.  And then each of these individual tasks are challenging enough to to create a compelling and effective user experience for people who are just moving into this real time world and piling all of these different forms of functionality into one real time experience is really going to be a challenge to nail you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But this has been a lesson that I've learned today is that we're overloading wave perhaps a little bit or I was overloading wave perhaps a little bit.  It isn't all of the things that I thought it was.  If you think of it simply as a collaborative, a real time collaborative environment, it's much simpler, much more straightforward and not quite so daunting.  And it doesn't have to be all things to all people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's part of coming out of the sort of the beta period.  As soon as when you've got a product that you've seen demos of and has been described, people project their own view of what it could be on to it.  And then when it actually comes out, they say, well, it isn't what I thought it was.  It's disappointing.  And they write lots of long rants about how disappointed they are by it.  And that's that's always a problem when you're bringing out a new product.  I think the difference and Neil's objections that they're not using web protocols had some substance to it.  I said about the document protocol being made up and that would be a great idea.  But the fact that they've come up with a standardized protocol for distributed editing to a document, that's very powerful and very interesting.  That has a lot of implications for things that people could do in the future.  And that will be the bit.  There'll be a lot of other stuff built on top of this as well.  And they've coupled together a lot of pieces to build this thing as one product.  But there's some components there that are interesting and other things will be able to use those, too.  And I expect we'll see more of that over time as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have we exhausted the subject? Is there anything?  I mean, we've got four really great smart people, all of us trying to understand.  Well, five, if you include me, all of us trying to, which I don't, trying to understand this.  I feel like I get a better sense of it. I'm excited by it.  I still don't know exactly how I would use it.  For instance, we kind of tried fitfully to use it for the show.  And it's not, I mean, there are better platforms to do what we want to do for the show, for instance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, which is publishing, right? I mean, we all want to publish.  Jeff wants to publish. I want to publish.  Right.  We want to publish because not everybody's in it.  So you can't see it unless you can publish it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not good for a public facing thing.  It's good for a small group, maybe a large group that's collaborating on something together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the answer to your question, Marshall, is when you can publish and others can see it, if not use it, it has that use, whether that's within an enterprise or not.  I would love to find some way to have kind of a next prize right now for it to say, come in and take the use case of three journalists, two editors and five witnesses and how they can cover a breaking story using weight.  And use their PCs and their phones to do it and use various media, including video and audio and photos to do it and start to flesh that out.  I'm going to get very excited about that. I know I can't do it.  Well, you that's the kind of thing where you have use case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, Jeff, you've seen the site, All Voices, that is kind of I think I just love it.  It's a global kind of user generated site for news.  I can imagine something like All Voices making kind of a wavelet around a breaking story where people could add their content, add their commentary, but it would still have to be edited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It would still I can imagine the New York Times during the during the Iran story during the Iran story.  And would be perfect example.  Yeah, New York Times Guardian, Huffington Post and Andrew Sullivan were the best at pulling in the tweets that were out there in the world.  Right.  Well, now imagine if the four of them and maybe a few others Moran could have could have collaborated not just with with tweets through blog, but also with putting in the tweet, saying, no, that was not right.  This one's right. I know who that is.  Here's a photo. Here's a caption for that photo.  I think you're absolutely correct that.  Let me add a video.  Let's have a little interview about this topic and it all becomes part of a document that is the latest, the best view of the Iran story.  That's my dream for it.  Maybe I'm wrong, but that's where I think you can.  I think you're absolutely perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's a startup up in Seattle called Every that's a semantic web recommendation tool for publishers and they publish related content to news stories.  And one of the things they're doing is watching Twitter for emerging news trends and using those as a trigger to prompt a query of other mainstream media sources, photo sharing sites and to go and check Wikipedia, free base, other places like that for changes to the pages concerning these emerging news entities.  And then they collate all of that information together to produce a related content topic page that they push then out to their publisher customers.  And I can imagine bots performing that kind of functionality, perhaps to to create some an instant research bundle for for your wave that you're collaboratively writing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, Marshall.  I'm a partner at Daylife, which is a competitor to Every.  And yes, we could do just that is bringing that data.  And if you look at what, for example, SAP is doing with their wave outlet, they want to have a customer be able to interact with a bot to answer a customer service question and then record that and then you reuse that as a way to get ever better answers to customer service questions.  So the combination of the human and the automatic also becomes very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a whole spectrum I've found in this real time web stuff.  On one end, you've got human to human communication.  On the other end, you've got machine to machine communication using real time protocols.  And then there's a bunch of stuff in the middle that where humans and machines have mediated communication like aardvark that uses presence and people and and some of the same XMPP protocols, stuff like that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, Jeff, I mean, the interesting thing about that is it's like the stuff that Eric Schmidt and Marissa Mayer have been saying to the newspapers, which is if you make a page that is the focus of the ongoing focus of the story, then you've got a chance to compete with Wikipedia because they have a page about Aminijad and Iran and so on.  And when people search for that, that will be high up because that's that's our sort of locus of current knowledge.  And they've been saying, you write a story, you write a story, and then each day there's a new story.  There isn't a focus page for that.  And that's that's something they've been pushing back to them, say, you want to be web like, make somewhere we can go for the current state of the world.  And that's a mental shift that's difficult for the papers to do, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and then now I think as they finally start to get their hands around the neck of that idea, it then blows up again.  I've been writing to write this post for a while that you have a conflict now between hyper concentration and hyper distribution and hyper concentration.  You want to be the place.  So you beat Wikipedia, which is what you just said.  But you also want to be as Marissa has been talking about.  And now the last week, Eric's been talking about you want to insinuate yourself into people's hyper personal news streams.  You want to be out where they are.  You want to be distributed everywhere.  And so Google has to understand not only those hyper concentrated points, those those laser light points where all the content comes together, but recognizes that people are going to distribute this stuff.  And I think wave becomes this is a nascent thought becomes part and parcel of that because you can use it to publish a page that has all this stuff in it.  But then you can feed out of it not only to the web, but also to my Twitter or to, you know, bots and widgets all over.  And you are once both concentrated, you have a locus for that story.  It's kind of almost a DNS for knowledge.  And then you have things distributed all over.  Right.  Or else I've still got morphine in my system.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, this is a debate I had with Marissa at Food Camp because there is this issue that the way we use Twitter and the way we use FriendFeed and all the blogging and all these systems is that we're starting to use other people as our filters on the world rather than institutions.  And listening to Marissa and Eric talk about this, they still thinking about institutions, not about people.  And it's partly a Google blind spot.  They don't see people, but they don't see that, you know, Jeff, that you are a wonderful node for information about the future of news.  And if I'm following you and Jeff Rosen and Matthew and four or five others, I'm getting this wonderful feed on the way that's being discussed.  That is more than the sum of all the all the pieces that the institution is doing, because we will become each other's newspaper.  Right.  And that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You go to what Marshall said and you start using wave as a way to curate those people.  Right.  You start to get some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then you send that link out on Twitter to say, here's Jeff's summary of where the state is.  This goes back to the thing that Adina was saying, which is that there's a modality in discussions where you say, I'm summing up the conversation so far.  You do a roundup of it.  And there isn't a clear way to do that in the wave world because the wave is still is sort of tangly thing.  So if you do that, you end up deleting people's comments rather than.  So I suspect we may start a new wave and say, I've done it over here.  You know, and I think bouncing back and forth in these modes is still the hard part.  And we've got several of these systems that solve small parts of this and they don't they don't fit together.  And they may not need to.  The difference between current state of knowledge and breaking news may need to be retained.  But the idea of how the news gets to you is is is something that is changing very rapidly and very strongly.  And what I've seen in the hyper personalized news discussions from the Google folks is they don't seem to see the set of people I follow as a filter as being a strong part of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, I think part of the reason that they're they're hot on institutions is because the institutions are blaming them for killing them.  And so you're absolutely right.  In the Eric's interviews this week with with Danny Sullivan, we're saying that, oh, no, only institutions can support.  We have this link on our on the friend feed can support major journalism.  And that's not true when you have people like Josh Marshall out there.  But you're right. It's a blind spot.  But I think the bigger question to me is that you have multiple ways to get stuff.  You have this whole world of search causing most traffic today.  And then as Marshall was saying, you have this automated aggregation causing traffic.  And then a stat that I think I gave on our first show is that Bitly causes as many links as Google News.  And so you have human recommendation there and all three become part of a new means of discovery and recommendation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely. Yeah. Marshall's running out of power.  He says he has three minutes. He's got that little red line on the battery.  So, Marshall, we're going to let you go.  But I thank you so much for being here for the conversation today and I hope you come back soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My funky setup, but I'd love to come back again soon. Good.  We'll do it. Thank you, Marshall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Copactric read, write web dot com. I have to say it slowly.  It sounds like Elmer Fudd. Thank you, Sir. Marshall. Take care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let him go and do and do look up Marshall's real time web conference that's coming up on October 15.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, thank you. Forgot the plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That looks to be really interesting. And I'm looking forward to that.  So the Computer History Museum in San Jose.  And that's so it's going to be a curated unconference by Kalia Hamlin.  And that's that's a model that's worked really well for Internet identity world where a lot of these protocols that were invented been put together.  So I'm looking forward to that model being used for some of these more less code oriented more.  How does this stuff work? More and more into discussions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think just fascinating. You know, I mean, just really a fascinating world.  We're living in is changing so rapidly.  Before we do our tip of the week, our number of the week and my tool of the week, I want to mention a great tool.  Doesn't sound right, does it? Go to meeting. It's very useful.  Now talk about real time. We're talking about collaboration.  The whole idea of using the Internet to eliminate meetings really originated with these folks at Citrix and go to meeting.  It's an affordable way to meet with your clients and your colleagues.  If you just add up, I think American Express had a number I saw the other day that said that the average cost of a business trip is about a thousand bucks.  When you add airfare, hotel, travel, it can be a lot more.  My trip to Dubai is going to be costing that times 10, I think.  And it could be less if it's just driving across town, but the average cost is a thousand bucks.  That really adds up. In fact, that can hit your bottom line pretty darn hard.  Reduce your profitability, not to mention the amount of stress on you going all over the world to meet people.  That's why a great way to have these meetings, to prepare for presentations as I do or to make sales presentations,  to collaborate on documents, to train is go to meeting from the folks at Citrix.  Forty-nine bucks a month. Compare that to a thousand dollars a trip.  And that's unlimited meetings and it includes free VoIP and phone teleconferencing.  So you get a great deal for forty-nine bucks.  And it's so easy to use and so secure. All you got to do is go to go to meeting.com.  Actually, you can do it right now. You can install it while we're talking.  Go to meeting.com slash twig. That's our special address.  You want to show your support for the twig program.  You go to go to meeting.com slash twig and sign up today for your go to meeting account.  Now that's thirty days unlimited, use-free. As many meetings as you want, as long as you want.  Have them with your clients, your colleagues, show your boss, show everybody in the business and get their sign-off.  Get their approval. Make sure that they get it, what you're doing.  And if one person says, I don't like it, that's fine. But I have a feeling they're all going to say, why aren't we doing this?  This is fantastic. Once you've got it installed, you start a meeting.  You can use Outlook and send out invitations. It has an automatic button that says, start a meeting or send meeting invites.  Or you can do it by hand. You can just go to go to meeting.com, click the start a meeting button.  You'll get a meeting ID. Now give that to everybody on the phone with you.  Suddenly they're seeing your computer on their desktop. They see the PowerPoint.  You can give them control. They can show their computer.  You can work together simultaneously on a single document. It's incredible.  128-bit SSL encrypted 24-7. Great support. I can go on and on. Best way to do it. Just try it.  Go to meeting.com slash twig. Thank you so much for their support of this week in Google. Nice to have them.  I okay. Let's let's get ready here for start. I guess we'll start with Gina on our tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this week, my tip is about something that we talked about briefly a couple of weeks ago, and that's how to host your own domain email and Gmail.  There's a Google Apps. It used to be called Google Apps for your domain, but it's just now they're just calling a Google Apps now, which is a little confusing.  But it's a standard edition. It's free. If you own your own domain name, you know, you at example dot com, me at example dot com, you can host your Gmail, your email at Gmail without forwarding and pop fetching and setting or apply to addresses and all that jazz.  I like that. Yeah, it's really nice. You can host your email at Gmail.  And then if you decide at some point you want out and we talked about this with Matt cuts a little bit, you change your MX record.  You switch to another email hosting provider and you're done. You're good.  And there's no on behalf of me at Gmail dot com. Anyway, I wrote up the steps on how to do it.  There's a standard edition, which is free for individuals and for small organizations.  And then there's, you know, the premier and business editions, which you can pay for and you get more space and more services.  But it's also great if you have a domain name, you know, like my family dot com and you want to make accounts, you know, mom at my family, dad and my family.  You can do that. You can create user accounts. You can easily share calendars and doc and Google documents as well on the free edition.  So the link to how to do that will be in the in the show notes for people who are interested or just go to smarterware dot org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. If you've got the good sense to do that, you can read it all right there. Right.  That's the place to go. Thank you, Leo.  Well, I missed Marshall's plug. Thank God. Thank God.  Kevin got that in. At least I can do is plug you.  And now, Mr. Jeff Jarvis with his number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll give you the number of the week, but I want to mention first that folks online are demanding to know the story of your tie in your talk to the online news association and which sock puppet beat you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, for that, you're just going to have to come to Dubai for my 18 minutes of Ted fame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, man, Dubai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's going to be interesting. I will not be here next week to do the show.  Gina and Jeff are going to let you do it. And we bring in some more people if you want, whatever, however you want to do that.  But it'll be just like this, except that the ball will be empty.  There'll just be nobody floating mic just kind of like that.  But I don't think you really need me. I think that you'll do just fine. Much better. In fact, without me, the tie was a tie was it. No, have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just once for a Davos thing. And I recommend get the heck out of the crazy Disneyland world and go downtown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's not really old Dubai. It's really old Pakistan now.  But interesting real food and take a little water taxis across the water and go to the Gold Sook and that kind of stuff.  It's touristy in its own way, but it's not as.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Vagasy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Plastic as the rest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Jennifer, my wife is going with me and she's already said we're going on a water taxi. We're going to the Sooks. We're buying gold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you do negotiate. I'm so Goya that I don't know how to negotiate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I cannot do it. I'm so bad. Yeah, you cut it in half and you start there at best.  You know, it's good. My 15 year old, the tie Jerry Garcia. No big deal.  The 15 year old, my 15 year old is good at this. He went to China with me and he's brilliant.  He was he was getting T-shirts for like a buck 50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My kids are like that, too. They used to haggling on.  Which one is it? Not Warcraft.  He's hanging on like online games.  And so you're trading there and a lot of that is about I have this magic item. I want to sell it for this.  I want to put that. And so they learn negotiation.  Christopher learned huge amounts of economics when he was nine.  Just by sitting there playing these games where you have treasure and you want to try and buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's fantastic. Whoever thought that what value that would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Devorak. He was explaining arbitrage to me.  Now that word. But he said, well, if I go to this world, it's cheaper.  And so I call that merchant thing. I buy it. And I said, let's go arbitrage.  OK. But he was he was he was realizing this. His stuff was going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Holy cow. I mean, that's talking about a deep understanding of economics from that.  Devorak always said his kids were better drivers because they did driver games.  But this is even better, I think. So the tie is Jerry Garcia.  What was the other question you wanted to know? Sock puppet.  You. I don't know the name of the sock puppet.  We'll never be. We'll never go down in history without an Emmy award.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess it was triumph. No, it wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was some, you know, some crappy sock puppet.  It wasn't a good sock puppet. Anyway, it's a great speech.  Thank you again for the plug. I really appreciate that.  It was a lot of fun and a great organization, by the way, the online news.  Is it an association? Yeah, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I've got to say, I've got to eat crow because I thought that given the economy  and given the fact that it was on the West Coast, they would have trouble selling out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sold out. Well, because of Twitter,  Williams was the keynote and it was just they got a great attendance.  And, you know, there's huge interest in how do we move to this digital age?  And it's a great mix of old farts like you and me, Jeff,  and then young people who are living this.  And it's so wonderful to watch everybody share. And it was a it's a great organization.  If you're in digital media, you should know about it.  Oh, and a think it's journalist dot org. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Number of the week. Number of the week is 80.  Even as Bing comes out and even as Yahoo gets this new new strategy here,  Google's share rose according to a stat counter, a Web Analytics firm.  And, you know, there's a lot of these firms that count, but it rose from 77.8 percent  domestically to 80 percent. And it rose from 90 to 90.54 percent internationally.  Wow. Did Bing fall? Bing, meanwhile, went down from 9.6 to 8.5 domestically.  And Yahoo went down from 10.5 to 9.4 domestically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Wow. Very interesting.  So, you know, that was the question was, did Bing go up because of the massive ad campaign  and the press attention and would it recede after time?  And there's a lot of neat things on Bing. But, you know, Google, it's just so automatic now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's almost like Google also added on the friend feed list.  They also added a whole host of new search features this week.  So you can limit time and all kinds of stuff like that.  You can also ask to have fewer shopping references if you're not really shopping for something  and other things like that. And some of these are responses apparently to Bing, but fine.  Google just, you're never going to keep ahead on technology as an old boss of mindset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's a perfect segue, in fact, to my tool of the week,  because that's exactly what I was going to talk about, these new search options on Google.  And I don't know if it has anything to do with us, but Google has added a new feature on their  Google blog at Googleblog.blogspot.com called This Week in Search.  Hey, hey, Google, hey.  Oh, hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nice nod.  I guess it's a nod.  Indirect nod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It could be a nod. I don't know what it is. Anyway, it's actually worth reading.  Every week, they're going to talk about what's new on Google.  And one of the subjects they talk about, these new and exciting features in Search.  This is in some ways, too, it's like kind of real time search because you see they've got now  any time recent results past hour, past 24 hours, past week, past year,  you can even enter in a date range.  As you said, you can get fewer shopping results if you want.  That's been available.  You know, some of these features have been available for a while in Google.  You go to Google.com and you do a search for this week in, what, oh, how about Google?  And you'll see this show options feature.  It's worth checking it because they seem to be adding a lot of nice features,  including this fewer shopping sites, more shopping sites, more text, images from the page.  And I really like these real time searches. I think that's very interesting.  I think we mentioned Wonder Wheel before, which I think is kind of cool, too,  where it's kind of like a mini version of the brain that gives you related searches.  Oops. And that's smarterwear.org. Go there, too.  And I don't know. A little Jerry Todd action here.  Oh, there is a SmarterWear website. You got to make sure you check that out.  Okay.  So I do unhide those search options. They're really.  Yeah, it is a little bingish, isn't it, Jeff?  Come to think of it, that sidebar down there is starting to look more and more being like.  Although Bing doesn't allow you to do fewer shopping sites.  That's that's that's Google only.  Hey, great to have you on once again, Kevin Marx.  It's always a pleasure not only because of your great English accent,  but because of your nice English accent.  And not only because of your great English accent,  but because of your knowledge in the in the business and your association with Google in the past  and the great stuff you're doing at British Telecom.  Don't forget Ribbit dot com slash wave if you're on wave and you want to add the conferencing to that.  I'm sorry. Did you have anything you want to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Also, there's a there's a link from there to the Ribbit API spec.  So if you want to have a look at that, I'd love to hear her responses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's an API. That'd be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I could build that into my World of Warcraft bargaining and do some arbitrage with Ribbit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll get my son to help you.  Yeah, I think I might need his help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gina Trapani is at SmarterWear dot org.  And it's just great to have you, Gina.  You were Gina was wonderful on Mac Break Weekly last week.  If you haven't heard the Gina Trapani Merlin Man episode, you should go back and listen to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you. Thanks for having me.  Always fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The bikes are multiplying.  We'll see if next week we've got three on the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll work on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis is at BuzzMachine dot com.  And a great fellow to know when you want to know about what's happening in the news and the future of journalism.  And of course, all of this stuff that's happening on the web.  Great to have all three of you.  Thank you for being here.  We thank you for watching the show.  You know, I know we gave out and have given out several times a number to call and we have like seven thousand voicemail messages.  Maybe next episode we just won't do any stories at all.  We'll just do voicemail messages.  We just seem to always run out of time.  But thank you for thank you for your calls.  They're great. And if you do have some listener feedback, 97 95 twig V.M. is the phone number.  That's 9795894486 our Google voice number.  You can leave a message there.  We will get some in next week.  I promise we just run out of time every single time.  We didn't even cover all the stories.  Just one. It was Google Wave today.  You can watch the show live.  We do a two fifteen Pacific five fifteen Eastern time every Saturday afternoon at live dot twig dot TV.  And of course, you must subscribe in your favorite pod catching appliance, whether it's iTunes or Zoom or whatever it is.  Thanks for watching.  We'll see you next time on this week in Google.  Thanks for listening.  I should say.
