Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like that.  BuzzMachine.com, the author of What Would Topeka Do?  See wouldn't it be good?  Oh look, now available on the iPad via the Kindle Store.  Have you looked to see if the iBook Store has it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, a reader on Twitter told me it's not and that upsets me because I thought Harper Collins,  my publisher had done a deal with them so I'm lined on Twitter already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to be everywhere.  Well, we'll push them to do that.  Also joining us as usual, the great, the wonderful, the lovely, the talented Gina Tripati.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The jealous Gina Tripati.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.  Gina's got making a political stand and as with most political stands, it's painful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am without an iPad.  For a few different reasons, but yes, I am without an iPad and I am sad about it.  I'm sad Panda today.  So I'll just ask questions and I'll switch my user agent and look at websites in my browser  as it would appear on the iPad and weep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also joining us this week from Metafilter.com, the great Matt Howey.  Hello.  Good to have you back, Matt.  Whose shirt is that behind you there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a bike jersey from a famous bike race last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's cool.  So you're a famous biker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Matt does have an iPad, two out of three, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And there's the Kindle app.  So this is...  They gave me this cool clock.  Have you seen this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who they?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's good bling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hang that around your neck.  Yeah, check this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yo, yo, yo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh man.  Rockin'.  You know, how long is it before rappers start wearing their iPads around their neck?  Really, let's be honest.  Can only be a little distance.  So this is, you probably gathered if you just tuned in, is iPad Day, the day the iPad emerged.  And Gina's the only one of us who doesn't have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There'll be an Android pad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There will be an Android pad.  Indeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there already are Android pads.  Yeah.  We've had a list of iPad alternatives today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anybody get a Juju yet?  Speaking of TechCrunch, the old Crunch pad renamed.  Apparently they only sold, they sold 90 and had 15 returns or cancellations.  So it's not...  I tried to buy it.  I did try to buy it.  I thought I'll be fair.  I'll get a Juju and I'll have it side by side.  And their website was so poorly designed, I couldn't, I actually couldn't buy it.  I had it in my hand and I couldn't buy it.  So maybe...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The seven iPad alternatives.  One looks really interesting is a German one that's coming out very soon called, come  on, scroll, scroll, scroll, the WePad.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  W-E?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, or I guess they would say over there the V-Pod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  V-Pods.  You have this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Webcam, two USB ports, app store and Android marketplace, of course.  Multitasking.  Works with all ebook formats.  Larger screen.  Flash support.  No, none that we can see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I'm guessing TechCrunch doesn't mention the Juju.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Even though probably that's the most best known.  I think there's going to be some good Android choices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Part of the thing about the iPad for me or a tablet in general is like, I never find  myself going like, wow, I really wish I had a tablet.  Like I've got a netbook and I've got a laptop and I've got the Kindle.  Like, and part of me not getting an iPad was just, was less political.  I'm more just like, I have so many gadgets.  Like I'm not necessarily impressed with the iPhone operating system and that whole  thing.  But like I just don't know where it would fit into my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I absolutely agree, Gina.  And that's where I was.  But until my dean in my school said, you have to have one.  He wouldn't pay for it, but I use that as an excuse.  But the fascinating thing for me was how Walt Mossberg this week viewed it.  And so did to some extent Arrington viewed it as a possible alternative to a laptop.  For me, that's impossible to imagine because I do so much typing and writing.  But if you're a salesperson, you know, if you're if you're going to conventions and  stuff, maybe.  And that's right.  That's what surprises me here.  Leo, do you think that having used it for a little bit, Matt, that this is at all possibly  something you take on a trip with you?  I totally do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And now I have I've paired it with a blue with the Apple Bluetooth keyboard, although  it will pair with any Bluetooth keyboard.  And, you know, it's a it's a relatively credible screen size, not so different from a netbook.  But the two together are small, you know, go fit easily into a purse or backpack.  And I think for a lot of what people do, it's going to be more than adequate.  I you know, I don't see it really as its primary use case.  I think most people will hold it like this and will be, you know, will have it in their  arm and they'll be watching TV or they'll reading the news at breakfast or they'll be  on a train or a plane.  And I think it's I think it's very good for those those times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a I think we're moving past the keyboard in so many ways with voice.  And, you know, if this thing had a camera, Google goggles and the fact that things know  where you are and all that the need to type is going to decrease and decrease Gmail did

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to make a special interface.  So, Gina, it's what it's recognizing the user interface.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you just got our Gmail the way that you normally would.  And it should detect that it's the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your apps account, Gina.  You don't know.  You can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can.  You can.  I tried it because I actually switched the user agent in my browser to check it out.  And you can.  And yeah, it's OK.  I mean, it doesn't have the keyboard shortcut.  I wouldn't use it on my on my on my desktop, but it looks good.  I mean, I love the idea that you can have your both your inbox open and you a message,  you know, an open message at the same time.  And that's that's the case for the mail app, right?  The native mail mail app as well.  But yeah, I mean, it looks it looks nice.  It's the expanded version of the iPhone version or the Android version, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about the lack of multitasking?  I mean, any Android tablet would, of course, have multitasking.  How big of a deal breaker is that on a device like this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think it's that big of a deal since you're just concentrating on what's happening.  I mean, it's a real good like media consumption device.  So you're just concentrating on, you know, watching a movie or reading email.  And you're not doing 10 things in the background like on a laptop.  You might. So I think it's not that big of a deal.  I have noticed with the Gmail app that's amazing for reading email really fast and archiving stuff.  I'm like a inbox zero dork.  So it's great for bang, bang, bang, get rid of stuff.  But it's kind of terrible for writing email.  Like, you know, it's clunky.  The web interface isn't as nice and you have the cramped keyboard and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess that's what we said initially was it's a content consumption device.  Yeah.  People like Cory Doctorow wrote a scathing article saying why I'm not going to buy an iPad  and why you shouldn't either kind of see it as the end of the world.  They really have a political objection to it.  I think it's a closed device. It's DRM everywhere.  This is the war.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a very clear war between Android now and Apple here.  And Schmidt at Davos said the war is going to be won on apps, not on devices, not on OS, but on apps.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, in an app world, this is the king.  This is an app.  I mean, you couldn't get a more.  This is it. Right.  And when you're talking apps, you don't need multitasking because you're doing one thing at a time.  How is Buzz on this thing?  Did they do a special?  I know I'm the only one still using.  That's a good question.  It doesn't look like they did.  It's the same as in Safari.  They didn't do a special, but they could have.  They didn't do a special Google reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was really surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they did that on the iPhone when the iPhone came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like make a left pane, just make it like Gmail, like, you know, feed, feed, feed, and the full item on the right side.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this works a single pane.  I have to say this works very nicely for Gmail.  Yeah.  I think that it's a good it's a good metaphor for Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  One of the things that's gotten me so far is the constant quest for this being the tablet for Mount Sinai that's going to rescue media.  And though there's some good apps, I think that, for instance, the Reuters app is really superb.  And as Matt said, the ABC app is good.  But what amazes me on this is the Time magazine.  One issue.  One issue, four dollars and ninety nine cents.  And so I feel awful because I bought it because I had to buy it because I couldn't snark about it unless I actually saw it.  Even though I knew I was going to start.  All it is is PDF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dude, that's where we are.  It's a movable PDF.  And you go this way and there's there's, you know, once in a while a video in it.  But it's just this return to editorial ego that I want to control the package and I want you to go in my order.  And the most amusing moment I had in it was there's a huge ad in there for the wonders of droid.  That's a good placement.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, of course, you saw, you know, both Time and Newsweek had jobs and the iPad on the cover.  And you saw in the back of Newsweek with it, they have a big iPad on the front and in the back Amazon bought a big Kindle ad, which probably a pretty big waste of money at this point.  Yeah, the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kindle.  I'm sensing a bit of eBay soon because prices are about to go.  A glut of Kindle's.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The only thing is, Gina, that when I first picked up the iPad, Kindle had given me the expectation of weight and iPad felt really heavy.  Baratunde Thurston said that was his first reaction, too.  Just because I mean, compared to a laptop, it's not.  But just for this little thing in your hand, the Kindle really has a difference.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Kindle also feels like plastic, too.  And I imagine that this is much nicer.  I'm sure the iPad feels nicer.  I was watching, I guess, Baratunde hosted like an iPad brunch today.  So I was looking at some of his tweets and he had said somebody a couple of people had said that without 3G that the iPad was basically felt kind of useless when it was offline.  Has that have you guys had a chance to have a lot of fun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I also bought today the cradle point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, or a MiFi or a MiFi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can create my own MiFi since I'm stuck with AT&T and don't have MiFi.  That way I can have MiFi now.  So that's what made me decide that I could go ahead and buy this today without the Wi-Fi and without another AT&T account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the big thing you miss is the GPS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But how does it know where I am?  Is it knowing? Because the maps did?  Look at me. Is that because of my ISP?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's Skyhook, which is a company that maps Wi-Fi access points.  And they can triangulate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It did a good job, I gotta say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's interesting because maps couldn't find me.  Let me try again on that.  Maybe it doesn't know where my Wi-Fi is.  Maybe I'm not in the Skyhook database.  I don't know.  Oh, because you're on some weird...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Going back to the time app, Jeff, so tell me, tell us what you ideally what it would have looked like.  So you spent five bucks.  What did you want to see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's called a browser.  You know, the problem is I just don't want the package anymore.  I want media people to be out and ways to come to me and distribute across the whole web.  If I'm going to go to this package, you know, if I look at the Reuters app, it mixes...  Rather than just saying this is a serial product that goes from page one to page 100 or in Time's case about 35.  You know, Reuters gives me a web-like appearance of saying here's the whole world of news.  And when I go to the stock report, I can add my stocks and I can go to the stories I want.  It gives me that ability for me to control the experience where literally at time it is page, page, page, page, as if it were a book.  And I don't think media should be.  You know, beyond that, given the limitations of what the iPad can't do, you know, I can't...  It'd be nice if I could get into video comments or stuff like that.  But of course it has no camera yet. Won't do that.  You know, typing is hard.  But it just shows me the hubris of the editorial package these days in the age of the link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So customization. So you think that the readers should be able to determine how to organize the magazine?  Yeah. Well, that there even is a magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got into a pissy fit with some newspaper guy in Twitter just a few minutes ago.  And, you know, well, Entertainment Weekly.  I said, yeah, I wouldn't have started Entertainment Weekly today as a magazine at all.  Quite the contrary.  And I'd have a far better business than they have these days.  That's the problem.  It just shows me how outmoded the notion of a magazine is.  And that's painful to say, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff, have you seen Popular Science?  Yeah, I was just going to ask about that.  It's like the future of what a magazine could look like.  Let me see here.  You can just drag and drill down whenever you feel like into an article, like you can go in different directions.  It's like it was a big concept piece.  There's a new device. Let's try new things.  That is five bucks.  But then do you have to subscribe to PopSci to continue to have more stuff or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You get one issue, I think, with that five bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I assume new ones.  I would say for the sake of research, check it out, Jeff.  Like just like this truly is.  I'm doing it right now, Matt.  You just made them five bucks.  I think you're probably not alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you were saying, Matt, also the ABC app you thought was a pretty promising UI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think what Jeff's saying, like everyone can be lazy with this, just like when podcasts came out, you know, like talk radio and TV shows just basically repurpose their existing content.  But then some shows kind of got it, what it could be something different.  And they had new material where they had interview shows that were only available in podcasts.  So like ABC looks like, you know, what TV could look like in the future.  And I'm sure if NBC comes out with an app, it might just be, you know, click on four shows to watch a show or something.  I was just saying, like, I think it's a good idea to have a podcast.  It's just so clear and easy.  It's just, it's just that you, you know, this is the, you can't see with the light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a glary screen, I have to say.  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And well, it's better than the smudgy screen.  It also is smudgy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here, I'll show you got mine because I've got a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you can dive into like the daily schedule and click on the last two episodes you missed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, you can jump down to Thursday at 8 p.m.  You know, from the front screen, it's kind of cool.  I used the Netflix app.  If you have a Netflix account, you can stream your Netflix movie to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the quality is very nice.  I mean, this is a that's what I think very interesting about this is some kind of a multi-homed device.  It has a it has use cases for everybody from the Scrabble fan to somebody who wants to watch a movie on a plane to somebody who wants to read a newspaper at breakfast.  What about the New York Times kind of did an odd thing.  They have a New York Times Select, which is a way or editor's choice.  I guess it's a good thing.  I don't understand.  I thought they were going to they were they were the poster child for this device.  They were on stage with with jobs.  They had all kinds of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't understand.  Did somebody drop the ball there or what?  Well, at least it's free.  I mean, that's you know, and it's very legible.  It's very readable.  No, no pinch and zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to just, you know, tap on things and you can't get it bigger or smaller.  It does seem like you're all the New York Times increase the price of its Kindle app, which is not very satisfying.  Right.  And this is ad supported, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This has ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to think that eventually they're going to do a paid version or maybe a version for who are people who are already subscribing or that kind of thing.  This is just kind of a way of doing it.  And not even as functional as the Web page, which is a little frustrating, a little exactly what you're talking about, Jeff, which is the wrong way to go.  You know, it goes back.  We started discussing this last week, and I'd be really eager to hear all your thoughts on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've been arguing for a while that we're moving from a page based destination based web to a stream flow based web.  But then we also see the other alternative here is we move from a page and site based web to an app based web where you do have closed worlds.  They do have more control.  You can't or don't need to really multitask.  The concern I have for that is it becomes more walled gardenish.  It becomes more about look at just the stuff in my brand.  And so we go back to kind of a media destination brand thing.  I don't know if that's going to work long term, but I do see that starting to happen here.  I even wonder when we get to web apps in Chrome OS, whether that's the case.  I just I can't get my head around whether apps of the future or just a last minute salve to the pain of big old media brands.  Yeah.  And of course, the simplicity of the web is the same.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And of course, the simplicity of apps rapidly disappears as people start to do more sophisticated ones.  This is Autodesk Sketchpad and has all sorts of odd features and and frankly is more complicated.  It looks more complicated to me than anything I would see on a desktop.  And in order to get more more powerful apps on here, you have to kind of play with the UI in ways that I think are nonintuitive.  So I think I think maybe it's best to think this of this is a content consumption device, a player.  And even as much as Corey didn't like it, the idea that you can use you still can use the browser gives you some hope that I can still go to the New York Times in my browser and and and read the paper there.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  It's still it seems like apps though feel like this way to like here's a way to access the web totally sanitized and totally on the terms of the person who made the app and approved approved by Apple.  You still have to have this filter, this gatekeeper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If they took the browser out, I'd feel worse about it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, yeah, definitely.  Definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's not even Apple's fault necessarily.  It's Time magazine's fault for saying this is how we view our relationship with our public.  Start here, then go there.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Like start at page one and go to page two.  You mean, I agree with absolutely Regina on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's it's that's the that's the the mood that bothers me here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this this idea that like apps are this way a way to sanitize that the web a way to access the web, but through like a very controlled, a tightly controlled channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, this is not bad.  I'm looking at the New York Times in Safari and, you know, I can I can and it has pinch, which is, you know, I can I can zoom in on stuff with which I can't do in the New York Times app.  So if they're trying to drive people to the web, maybe that's maybe that's what these these silly apps are for.  I mean, this works.  This works nicely.  It rotates.  It does everything I'd want.  And this is the web page.  You know, it's got all the all the features of the of the web page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, Leo, I would like before we went on, I was watching your feed on my iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Isn't that cool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's it was it stopped after a few a few after two or three minutes each time.  But that was cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's not that's HTML five.  It is HTML.  Okay.  Sixty four.  Yeah.  So obviously, most of if you're watching the show on live that TV, you're watching it in flash.  But if you go to live that now, actually, I should take a look and see how this works.  If you go to live that TV on the iPhone, we see the user agent and we present you with a special page.  And I think we've set that up.  Yes, we have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, at least that's what it did.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you can get an application that does this, too.  We have a ninety nine cent application that lets you watch and has more stuff than the web page does because it has the chat room and has the calendar and some other things built into an interface designed for this screen.  So for the iPad.  Yeah, it's an iPad version of our app.  So as another nine cents.  As well, you know, this was free.  And I told the guy I wrote it charge for it because you put a lot of work into it.  And so the chat room is in there and you can join it.  I'm not crazy.  We're going to work on the design a little bit.  It's a little postmodern sci fi.  But that's the point is it does work.  So as a content as a content creator, I think this is really a nice thing to have, but it's not necessary.  And, you know, our our business model doesn't I think maybe this is the key doesn't require you use this or any other way.  We want to make our goal is to make it.  And I think this is what every content creator should be aspiring to make it available in as many ways as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's exactly what I'm saying.  The idea that a media brand is still a magnet that will draw us doesn't work anymore.  The media have to go to where we are.  The people are. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But we can do that because we're ad supported content.  So eyeballs are good for us.  And as long as we get more eyeballs, it pays for itself and we can count them.  That's kind of important to the ability to count them.  But we want you to listen. We want you to watch.  We want you to download whatever makes sense for you.  That makes us happy.  That seems like the only way to do it, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's that's where media is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And selling a four ninety nine.  You know, but we have we've never done that.  We've never sold, you know, by, you know, twig thirty six for for a buck.  We've never done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think you have opportunities to do other revenue streams like direct sales of merchandise.  You know, if I go to the I forget the name.  What was my old phone with the what was the old palm phone with my little keyboard on it?  Oh, the trio trio trio.  So trio nuts. And was it was a great blog that now has a nexus one site and so on and so forth.  And they're making they're making a business out of direct sales of merchandise.  The stuff you talk about, I think you could do a best buy store at twig and twig where you could sell direct merchandise.  And it's just basically another way to advertise this.  You're getting paid on true performance.  Right. Yeah, we've looked at all those models.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just easier for me to put an ad in the damn thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. At some point you could hire a head of merchandising who could probably make you some money there.  Yeah, I think you could have events.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, look at the look at the turnout they get for the dig nation events.  Exactly. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, and and and all those.  Well, the chat room is the proof.  Hey, chat rumors, wouldn't you like to meet in person or would that frighten you too much?  That's scary.  So, Gina, I wish I could do this.  We have a request from Johan Hillerstrom on Twitter to try out wave on the iPad.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so if you this is what I think is going to happen.  You guys can tell me if you guys go to wave.google.com and Safari, you will probably get a message saying that the browser isn't up to snuff.  But there's a great iPhone app called Waveboard, which is available.  I think there's there's one there's a version that's free and I think there's one that's like two bucks.  And I'm not sure if you have waveboard.  I think waveboard is probably the best way to try it out.  I don't know if he really or the developer released a an iPad version, but hopefully.  But yeah, I've been thinking that wave would render really nicely on the iPad because you just have a lot more room.  Oh, good, Leo. Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's in Safari.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now did you click? Did you have to click a go ahead link when you?  Oh, OK. Just load up. Oh, that's great. That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I can. Yeah. I mean, this is a very nice touch.  Makes sense in touch, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wave just crashed my Safari.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it just crashed mine.  And it just crashed mine.  Yes.  OK. So we'll have to use the the app.  You know, even the iPhone apps that aren't designed for the iPad usually scale pretty nice.  You know, you'll be able to use them, especially if it's just text.  So you see you I the widgets that don't work scale so well because you don't have the bitmaps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'll confess my stupidity with the thing.  I had to think like three or four times because every time I say I sanked and I went to the iPod app, I'd say, where the hell are my videos and TV shows?  So I'd stick again and I realized there's a separate button on this thing for video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is some usability stuff that you have to get used to.  There is some different stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you have to charge it separately than syncing.  It doesn't depends on what you're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you can charge it if you plug it into the back of a of an iMac or a laptop.  It should. It has a 10 watt adapter.  But some people are reporting it didn't work on my USB hub, my powered hub.  Some people are reporting it won't work on some some devices, but it's variable.  It takes a lot of juice. Yeah. Yeah.  But, you know, you get the battery life people are getting is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Walt Bosberg said it was actually more than Apple promised.  You got what, eleven and a half hours to maximum use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. And so that's it.  So did Andy and I. So did a lot of people. So that's that's pretty impressive.  You know, I'm at 62 percent. I haven't charged it at all. This is out of the box.  So, you know, I think that you're going to this is going to kind of thing.  You're going to be able to use all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of Mossberg, what fascinated me was Mossberg versus David Pogue in the times where Mossberg's take, as we said earlier, was, wow,  could this really be take some major function of the laptop?  Whereas Pogue wrote two separate reviews and really what he was saying was it's your grandma's computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Yep. I think that's doing grandma disservice, by the way.  Poor grandma. She's always the whipping girl.  I think I would I'm using this. I think a lot of geeks are using it and are very happy with it.  So, you know, we'll see. The proof will be in a month or two if we're still using it as a primary device.  Or if we've gone back to our laptops and said that that was nice, that was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My best use case I could imagine so far is I'm going to in two weeks to Germany to a conference called Republika,  which I think is the kind of German speaking South by Southwest.  And I can imagine spending all day at a conference with this thing.  Really? Watch the Twitter doing this, doing that.  Yeah. Not having to lug around the laptop, worry about the battery power.  I could see this. You're dubious, Gina. But taking notes in sessions?  Yeah, a little bit, because I don't take, you know, gigantic notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Right. Just jot quick, quick thing. What is the keyboard like anyway?  I mean, how bad is the key? How bad or how good is the keyboard?  Can you type out a sentence pretty comfortably or does it feel strange?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I keep stroking the wrong keys, but then I do that on the especially on the my Nexus One as well.  Yeah. Yeah. See, I, you know, I tend to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So at night, if I'm like watching TV or watching something I don't really care about very much,  I often will have my phone with me and will be browsing Twitter and just kind of checking email and archiving email, that kind of thing.  And so I can imagine using the iPad for that.  But I often need to kind of answer emails and I often need to like kind of, you know,  quote emails and answer in line and that kind of thing isn't easy to do on the phone for sure.  And it doesn't sound like it would be easy to do on the iPad as well.  I mean, I guess I feel like I type or I input information more than maybe I'm more of a creator than a consumer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you're a programmer. So you're going to type more. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think I'll be the same way. You actually create useful things.  I just create words, but words are useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Words are useful. It's all words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo's got a little whammy there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, Leo's that that's looking pretty comfortable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you actually say something right or does it? Yeah, no, it's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would love to see a shapewriter or swipe on the iPad.  That's what I would love to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was talking about that with Jake today, too.  I wonder whether because he said, you know, you can't write on the darn thing.  He said, I would have sold it with a pen.  I think that probably brings back horrible memories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't want that. Yeah. Right.  Definitely don't want that.  You know, it's interesting.  It's kind of weird to have a more more normal keyboard,  but still have these kind of strange iPhone replacement things going on and all of that stuff.  It's going to take a little getting used to.  But no, I think this is this is quite usable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I never carried a computer.  I just use my phone the whole time.  I could totally see using this at a conference because I was using like four square and Twitter  and I was even taking notes in the notes app.  Just a sentence here and there.  I think this could totally work at a conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you wouldn't want to you wouldn't want to write a program in it, Gina, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But yeah, no, that's definitely not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's pretty darn usable.  Actually, I'm surprised. This is the first time I've used it.  Now I paired it immediately with a Bluetooth keyboard and then it just uses a regular keyboard.  And that's very usable.  If you propped this up like this, it would be no different than a laptop, except there's no mouse.  Oh, right. Yeah.  It's a touchscreen laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. There is Google News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google? Who's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google. Google. The Google has been up to something, I believe.  Well, there's a redesign on YouTube.  We actually this kind of bit us.  We were trying to upload some video a couple of nights ago and we couldn't.  We couldn't. We didn't know what was going on.  And then we found out, oh, they're changing the UI on YouTube.  Pretty nice, too, I think a very clean, graphically much simpler interface.  Anybody have an opinion on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It looked like a beta when I first saw it.  Like, it kind of looked like what did they really make that live?  Like, I mean, it's kind of cool that half the stuff's gone, but it feels like a early CSS draft of a page to me.  Because there's just like, I think it's too simple.  Yeah, I couldn't find other videos from this user going down the side.  All I saw was related videos from everybody in YouTube.  So it was like, oh, it felt like it took away a feature at first.  And it's just sort of like raw.  Like, it's all HTML text.  Like, there was lack of graphics.  I mean, it looked a little rough.  Like, it looks like when you have a designer who works in CSS with early mockups,  you'll get before a site launch, it'll look a lot like, you know, the new YouTube page.  And then YouTube was useless for like a day.  Every single video's comments was, I hate the look of this page.  I want to hear about the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They got rid of the star system for voting.  They replaced that with thumbs up, thumbs down, a very, very dig-like system.  They said because people only use zero stars or five stars.  They rarely did anything in between.  But you're right.  There are things like, you know, it's harder to find stuff.  But then the embed looks kind of nice.  You can mess with it a little bit here.  I don't know.  I like it that it's cleaner.  I think it was getting pretty crufty.  But I can see what you're saying that some of the things you might be used to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What you say about that design, isn't that kind of true?  Everything out of Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, let's talk about the beautiful design of the iPad and Google's web app design.  There's a difference.  Obviously love Google.  That's why we're here.  But yikes.  Although the little page tour is pretty neat.  I confess I'm not a big YouTuber.  So this is the first time really looking at this.  But if you click on the take a quick tour thing, it kind of takes you on the page in a neat little way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Where's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On the right hand side, there's a blue box says welcome to the new video page.  I don't know if I guess I've taken that already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe I've taken it already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just go to like an individual.  You might have you can exit out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I'm going to a Walmart ad.  Stop.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No ads unless they pay here.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, anyway.  All right.  So there you go.  There you have it.  New YouTube interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a big news in video and Google is the Googlebot episodic.  Now, what's episodic?  I swear you can ask me that.  I believe that it is a service that enables people to do episodic TV better and have the functionality to do that, including organizing episodes across a series, charging for subscriptions and that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's another ad platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's another ad, but it's also another SOP to media companies.  I think that's SOP to but another opportunity for media companies to create episodic TV.  Jeff Pulver was one of a few of the people who some time ago tried to create guides to episodic TV and separate episodic from the one off viral stuff.  Right.  Blip has kind of emphasized episodic as well.  And episodic, of course, is the loyalty of television itself.  So I think there may be something in here that shows a direction for Google and its relationship to media companies and the wisdom of trying to get past viral because you can't really control viral.  I was at a really good conference at Columbia this last week called the Bright BRITE 10 conference.  And I got him something for his name, chief research scientist for Yahoo Australian.  It'll come to me was there talking about research they did on influencers and Twitter.  And it really struck me at some point that there is no such thing as an influencer, that it's the messages that are usually influential.  And the problem in that is that you can't bottle it and resell it, which is why marketers hate to hear this.  And the problem for YouTube then is you can't predict bottle resell and figure out of obviously when things go viral there.  And they're kind of dependent upon that.  And if they're going to put advertising on things, better to put it on something that has a loyal returning audience, which has demographics you can predict.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think that if in a way what you this also goes hand in hand with the YouTube redesign because really what they're what they're what they're creating is a place not where you put groin shots and lip syncing, but a place where mainstream media types and maybe some smaller ones are going to put their content.  And I think that in some ways that's kind of antithetical to what YouTube started YouTube and what YouTube is all about.  I mean, if YouTube becomes more it becomes a hulu.  Will it still be desirable?  It feels like a bait and switch actually probably be more desirable, but it feels like a bait and switch like you came to you came to YouTube for chocolate rain and you left, you know, with 30 rock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can't you have both?  Don't they live happily together?  Can you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think it's a zero sum game.  I think YouTube's just trying to become like Google, like all encompassing all video is just think YouTube just like any search you think Google.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Yeah, you're right.  I think the advertisers, though, are a little unhappy with the idea that they might show up in a groin kick video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why they yeah, that's that's why they do want to separate out and they want to know kind of an authoritative rule of who are the good people who are making reliable stuff.  Who can we count on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so there is pressure I would imagine on a platform like YouTube to kind of if you want to be a good platform for advertisers, then you want to have some way of kind of this is wasn't this a problem.  MySpace had still does, which is nobody wanted to buy an ad on MySpace because you had no idea where your ad was going to end up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Leo, aren't you the perfect person to judge this?  I mean, if Google came to you and said we now have a better platform for you to organize and present the episodes of the wonderful series you make.  Yeah.  And because you're Leo Laporte, we love and trust you.  And because we Google have huge advertising contracts and concepts will sell you on or off YouTube.  Wouldn't that be music to your ears?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, and we're doing it basically.  Okay.  You know, we're putting all our content, including the show on YouTube.  I have a YouTube, you know, YouTube.com slash twit and there's channels for every show there and I would love better episode controlling things.  I just think in time to what happens is there's pressure on people like YouTube to get rid of the kids stuff and the lip syncing stuff.  And I think that that's good.  That actually could be problem for it because what they sell people like me and NBC and ABC is is a crowd.  They sell the audience.  But if the audience is coming to watch Numa Numa, I don't know if that's the right.  It doesn't seem to me.  It does seem a zero sum game to me for some reason, Matt.  I don't know why.  I think I think Google's like it's just like with blogs, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's 20 million zillion blogs.  They're not very useful.  They're not very ad friendly, I guess, to advertisers.  But Google figured out this magical tool.  Like, you know, it's a total long tail thing.  To make, you know, like AdSense work on those right ages, no matter what someone's talking about.  I think with like the millions of random videos, you think like, I don't know, one to five percent are really good and kind of rise above.  And, you know, I guess they go viral, but they also, you know, there might be good work done by an independent.  And then, you know, Google's going to flow ads to that.  I think they don't know the answer to the question of how do we monetize all these ads?  How do we monetize all these videos for grandma?  But they will, you know, someday.  Someday.  Someone's 20 percent.  Someone's 20 percent time.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, the other trick to this is that and Hulu kind of ruined it because of the business deal going awry.  But you take shows like Colbert and Daily Show and you turn them into snippets.  You snippetize them.  So you get the best bits and the best bits become your best marketing for the rest, which the networks have realized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they get that idea.  They don't feel like it's cannibalizing there.  I think that's what they thought was Saturday Night Live is that, well, all the funny parts are on YouTube.  So nobody has any incentive to watch the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, years ago, going back, you know, four years ago, Betsy Morgan, who most recently was the CEO of Huffington Post, was then at CBS,  said that when somebody put up a pirated clip from Letterman, they would do the takedown, but then put up the exact same clip themselves and tell the person, here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it is a recommendation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's somebody's smart.  I don't know if they do that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, why would they do that?  Tell me that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because it was high quality.  They put up like a HD version.  So they knew somebody wanted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And that's the smart thing to do.  I don't know if they still do it at CBS because CBS isn't as forward thinking I think now.  But that's the way to take advantage of this.  And then you make your stuff embeddable around the whole web.  That's where media has to go.  All media has to become embeddable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to take a break.  Come back with more.  Our guest is Matt Howey, the man who started Metafilter, metafilter.com.  It's great to have you, Matt.  You said that Saturdays are bad for you.  Saturdays are bad for you.  We found a time when you weren't busy.  Dying Easter eggs or hiding them or anything like that.  Also, Jeff Jarvis from MuzzMachine.com, the author of What Would Google Do?  And the great Gina Trapani of The Complete Wave.  That's not you.  There you are.  CompleteWaveGuide.com.  And her blog is SmarterWear.org.  But we want to take a little break.  You may wander off, peoples, because I'm going to talk about go to assist.  No, not you.  No, no, no.  The audience stays there.  Unless there's an important message.  You stay.  Or take the iPod with you.  The iPad.  It's made for going to the bathroom.  Just take it on with you.  That's exactly what Steve Jobs said.  He didn't want to make basically a bathroom computer, but he has.  So I want to talk a little bit about go to assist.com.  You know, the folks at Citrix, they are pretty impressive.  They really have got the remote access thing down.  In fact, I know they're doing iPad apps for some of their products.  It's very exciting.  Go to assist is for Macs and Windows designed to help you if you're a support professional, an IT professional.  It uses their remote access technology to make it easier for you to do remote support.  You can be a support hero.  Go to go to assist.com slash twig right now.  You can try it free for 30 days.  They have day passes.  If you're a part time support person, if you're a full time support person, you'll love the features like  you can run eight different sessions at the same time.  So start a scan, move to the next one, start an install, move to the next one.  You can copy install files or fixes or patches from your computer to the guest computer.  You can see what's running on the computer you're supporting, what operating system, what security software, what software in the background.  I can go on and on.  It really is designed for support.  A great way to do it.  You can even let the person you're supporting look at your computer or if they're not there, you can do it on 10 is support.  Go to assist.com slash twig.  Give it a try today.  30 days.  Absolutely free from the folks at Citrix.  Go to assist.com slash twig.  So I we had a Droid user in the studio today who was very what was that you got there, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it is going to mean an iPad app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  Isn't that exciting?  You can do that.  See, that's a great application for this.  It's just instead of carrying a laptop, you just go into a meeting.  Well, you just have this.  I could I mean, I could think of a lot of good applications for it.  Anyway, we had a Droid user in the in the on the show yesterday.  He said 2.1.  It's finally being pushed out by Verizon.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My brother got his today, too.  Hallelujah.  My brother texted me to say I updated 2.1 all by myself without calling you.  Are you proud?  I've been his Android kind of consultant.  So so shout out to my brother, Joey.  Nice job.  Joey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well done.  And he's watching right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Joey.  Is he in Brooklyn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where is he?  In New Jersey, New Jersey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Close enough.  So this has been a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got a problem with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, how you doing?  This has been a problem, though, is this fragmentation you got had as somebody called the radio show  said, I have an heiress.  And you're watching the Motorola Droid get updated, but not the Motorola heiress.  It's got to be frustrating.  According to Engadget.  Off the record, Chris Ziegler writing for for Engadget says people told him at CTIA that  the next version of Android fro yo.  Bro, yo, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not pastries.  It's desserts.  Desserts.  We thought it was baked goods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We did.  Cupcakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Donuts.  Egg, Claire, fro yo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll take big strides towards stopping this OS fragmentation.  You've got as a as a developer to do four different versions if you want to run on one  five one six two oh and two one.  So how do they fix it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they're going to be decoupling the apps from the operating system so so that they  can push out updates to to to apps like Maps and Gmail and all that through the market  as usual.  And I think that's the kind of the main thing.  And then gingerbread, which comes after for yo is going to be basically they've been  iterating the platform.  They've been iterating Android faster than carriers or and and manufacturer carriers  rather have been pushing out updates.  So I think things are going to slow down a little more with with gingerbread.  So they're going to decouple those apps and they're going to keep which will actually  be good for people like cyanogen, right, who had to decouple those apps in order to  distribute his his ROM because the apps are closed source and Android itself is is open  source.  So this sounds like a good solution coming up.  And it sounds like they're this will this will be a step toward doing that anyway.  Good, good, good, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So carriers drag their feet and still say that like with Eris, there's all those custom  weather apps and desktop managers.  Can't they just say, well, it doesn't run in two point one or two point two or two point  three.  So we're going to stay on one point six or something.  Right.  I mean, that'd be my fear.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Mm hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And we've seen Droid currently claims it's up to date.  Oh, man.  Two point oh one.  Come on.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hate it when that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's lying to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it is really the carriers, isn't it?  However, so this is really designed to make it easier for developers to create apps.  Are they going to make universal apps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think they're going to couple the sort of built in Google apps.  Right.  So like Maps and the Gmail client, for example, are just come come with the distribution.  This is how I understand it.  So like those those things are going to be just separate in the market as usual and get  an update.  So get pushed out.  So I'll be able to update those apps the usual way versus having to wait for the whole  OS update to get out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see.  Well, that's good news.  I mean, they got to do something about this is the single biggest problem.  And, you know, complexity is the problem.  And that's what happens when you when you compare iPhone and iPad to a droid and Android.  Is it it's it's more power, but also more complexity.  Is there a way to is there a way to simplify it?  I mean, you certainly don't want to shoot yourself in the foot by having more OS versions  than you need to.  That's just unnecessary complexity.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had a problem with web development.  I think I just added as a twig bookmark.  I bought an Eris and a droid on one day in December to start testing out Metafilter and  other apps.  And like our actual web apps look completely different because one was in one point five  maybe.  And the other one was running two point.  Oh, and I was like, I have to come up with different CSS.  Come on.  Like crazy.  They look completely different.  But eventually, I think the Eris updated to two.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Other other choices in the other things we can take a look at.  There's OAuth and Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, that's that's that's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What does that mean?  It's a big deal.  OAuth is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I only know it's cool because I'm using it to authorize the software application.  I'm working on Think Tank with with Twitter.  So OAuth is a way for a user to grant an application access to their data without giving  their password.  Right.  So like there's this program called Gmail Drive that you can download to your desktop  and you can store.  You can just drag and drop files to it and I'll store it in your in your Gmail account.  You have to enter your username and password into this, your Gmail username password into  this application, which is not a Google application.  And it should make you feel weird and not want to do it.  It's a security issue.  OAuth lets you use your Gmail account.  You don't want to do it.  It's a security issue.  OAuth lets you authorize an application.  Say I'm going to let Gmail Drive or any other application access my data and you can define  the terms.  You can say read, write.  You can say read only without without handing over your password.  So it's great because it means you can change your password.  You can change your Gmail password and all your applications don't break.  It means that you can limit the kind of access that an application has to your data.  So read or read, write.  And you can if an application starts to behave in a way that you don't like, you can you  can deny it access from within Gmail.  So basically what it means is that an application like Gmail Drive can you can authorize  without giving your password.  And you can also just have web apps do things with your Gmail that Gmail doesn't currently  do.  So the first I believe the first application that's using OAuth is this iPhone application  called SmartPush, which filters notifications on email.  And I haven't tried out SmartPush by myself, but I believe that you can say, you know,  only notify me of new Gmail if it comes from someone in my contacts or, you know, define  a kind of a list of rules.  So this is pretty cool.  So Gmail had Gmail Labs for a while, right, where like they could roll out experimental  features.  But, you know, not anyone could write a Gmail lab feature like only in Google, you know,  could you write a Gmail lab feature.  But with OAuth access beyond, you know, IMAP and POP, you can really kind of build web  applications on top of Gmail and access Gmail data and do things with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is this beyond just simply the identity of Facebook Connect and Friend Connect being  out there?  This is more of an integrate, kind of an API without identity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  It's an API to your inbox without giving your password over.  So I think Anil tweeted something like, you know, I'd love it if Dropbox, you know, automatically  imported all my any attachments I get in my Gmail Dropbox to access and just automatically  put in my Dropbox, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It like Redux, I think he was talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And, you know, didn't you guys break that story on Lifehacker a couple of years ago,  the famous Gmail archiver that like stole people's username and password?  Yes.  I mean, that's the worry, right, that like unchecked someone, someone's group or list  developer could have could be, you know, transmitting your username and password up  to their server.  And that's not a big deal with like Twitter.  I feel bad putting my username and password in any app.  But Google, I mean, my Twitter username and password, whatever, they can make art jokes  under my name, big deal.  With Google, it's like my AdSense, like money, thousands of dollars are coming in every month,  my bank account information, my Google Health, you know, they could be looking at my medical  tests.  Like if you get my Google password, I mean, you get my life.  It's crazy how much of my life's in Google.  It's been creeping up year after year.  But I really am nervous about giving out my Google username and password to anything.  Like I hardly ever use Google Reader apps for anything like the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's probably why there weren't very many, as far as I know, apps that used your  Gmail login.  Nobody was willing to give it up.  Were there apps that did this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, there's lots of that.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Give me your Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the Gmail drive is kind of one of the few that I remember featuring on Lifehacker  and being like, this is just a brilliant idea.  It's totally not something that Google would approve of.  When Gmail first launched and it was like, oh my God, I have gigabytes of space in the  cloud, which is not a big deal now.  But back in the day, it really was.  So this is pre-Jockbox era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A year or two ago, everything would ask for, find your friends.  Just give us your Google login.  Oh, that's true.  You're right.  Like, Google did it, Facebook did it, Evite did it, everyone did it.  And then we came up with OAuth because nobody wanted to, well, the geeks didn't want to  do it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what other things, what other Google arenas should be using OAuth?  What other applications elsewhere should be doing what this would do?  What does it enable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I guess it's like Flickr, right?  Flickr's API is very granular.  You can say what an app can do with your Flickr.  You can't look at your private Flickr photos.  Can it post a Flickr or not?  And I think Gmail is a kind of weird one.  And I guess it'll be like Gina's been saying, like it'll be kind of like a Google Labs.  Like anyone can come up with a crazy Gmail hack.  But I'm more interested in, I don't know, Google Reader being more like I could do that  in anything.  I don't know what else.  I mean, I wish Google Analytics and Google even AdSense, like I wish I had remote access  to it or desktop access or I could have dashboards in my web apps, my private admin panels on  my web servers.  That could be pulling in some information from those through an API.  I'd be very happy about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this redundant at Facebook because of the Facebook platform?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I guess Facebook Connect is sort of their attempt at, well, they're more about  identity.  And then as you do identity, it also links apps together.  So they're trying to roll identity and authentication and application APIs into one thing.  So when you log into Foursquare with your Facebook thing, it's going to start posting  a Facebook on your behalf, usually by default without telling you.  And you have to go in and turn that off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's so annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kind of annoying.  I like the way Flickr does it because it's more developer friendly.  It's like, you just gave us access.  Are you okay with the following four things listed very?  It's kind of a pain because you have to go through three or four screens of it.  Yes, yes, I trust them.  Yes, go ahead, post.  But it's better than the Facebook flip side, which is turn everything on by default.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you have to opt out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Android is similar too, right?  So when you install an app on Android, you always get that pop up that says this application  needs these following rights, access to your network, access to your contacts, and then  you have to hit OK.  That's not the case with iPhone apps.  Don't do that, right?  Don't give you that sort of breakdown of everything an app requires.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they just ask for like geo location is usually the only sort of, oh, and they'll  ask you if you want to be annoyed by the little...  Notifications, yeah.  Yeah, the notifications.  But yeah, network access.  I always thought that was kind of silly on Android.  It's on the phone, of course.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is a long list, which nobody reads.  And sometimes it's on pages.  You read it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, but I like that it's there.  I like that I can tag.  I mean, something that's streaming video and you're like, all right, I want to know whether  or not it's going to use if I didn't have it on the metadata plan.  I don't know.  I like the idea that apps are upfront.  I like the idea of knowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  I think that Google would have been better off if they had put Buzz through this OAuth  path so that you would have gotten all that stuff.  Do you know what I mean?  Yeah.  But they wouldn't have integrated it all too much because it's all Google.  But if they'd actually had a separation of Buzz and enabled that, they might have solved  some of the problems they've had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, like when you opted into Buzz, it would have said to you, OK, we want this.  But if you literally made it use OAuth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the list of things we're going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If people knew that you really wasn't going to get your password and it really was separate  and here's what's happening, it would have been a smarter way to do it.  Right.  Speaking of which, one story on the feed is that a White House official who left Google,  his Buzz friends revealed that he was communicating with his old Google colleagues in some people's  view a little too much.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting.  Very interesting.  So Howard Stern apparently, well, I'm sure he doesn't listen to this week in Google unless  he's a lot geekier than I thought.  But of course, you can't mention Howard Stern without 50 listeners sending him clips hoping  that he'll say something about it.  So we talked last week about the fact that he was still using Lotus Notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think Gina was actually the meanest making fun of him for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was.  And you know, I'm so happy that I got to make fun of Howard because I'm not a big Howard  fan.  I just like the idea that I got to bust his chops sort of.  He has a rationalization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's Howard Stern from the show.  I needed to be with the hard keys.  I hate that keyboard on the iPhone and also, you know, I have Lotus Notes.  It's not, it doesn't work that well on the iPhone.  And by the way, there was a show the other day that Jeff Jarvis appeared on where he  made fun of me for using Lotus Notes.  He said, boy, Howard's really antiquated for using Lotus Notes.  He goofed on me.  The reason I use Lotus Notes, Jeff Jarvis, is because I was told that it is the most

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  secure software told by his tech guy who was an IBM employee for 17 years, I might add.  Right.  It's the most secure software you never heard of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So then I got an email from Jeff Schick, who is that guy who's been advising Howard from  the beginning.  And he's having me in at the end of the month to show all the wonders of how Lotus Notes  is used by the strong proof.  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My worst nightmare.  That does sound like a nightmare.  Better you than us, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get to see how Baba Bui uses the Lotus Notes.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, having been forced by Ziff Davis to use Lotus Notes for 10 years from  1992 to, or actually 1994 to 2004, I could tell you I don't care if it's secure.  I couldn't care less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's so secure that Howard can't access it on his phone.  I was thinking that I was really mean and I made fun of him.  And then I was thinking, you know, if an enterprise person, you know, if someone like Howard came  to me and said, I need to know what email server, software or system should I install  at my company?  I don't even know what I would say.  What would you tell him?  I mean, what would you tell him?  I mean, it's like the choices are like notes, exchange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are you trying to protect, fart jokes?  I love Howard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the other thing is like email security.  Like as soon as you send an email, it's insecure.  It's a postcard.  It's inherently insecure.  Right, right.  So I was like, okay, well, he's concerned about getting his inbox getting hacked.  Right.  I mean, that's the security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was trying to figure out what he was talking about, to be honest.  What's the security?  Are you not going to get spam?  No.  Are you not going to get phishing schemes?  No.  Is your mail somehow magically safe once it emerges from the server?  No.  So I'm not sure exactly what he's talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think what he gets is a group sharing of writing and things like that with his crew.  But these days I'd tell them to use docs.  I wouldn't push wave quite yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no.  Google Apps though.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Apps.  I was talking with this guy named John Payton who now he ran the biggest Spanish language  publisher in the US.  He now is heading a new job at a really beaten down newspaper company called Journal Register.  And full disclosure, I'm on his board of advisors.  But as I was at the whiteboard this week with John, it occurred to me that he really could  publish the entire newspaper with Google Docs, Google Apps, WordPress and Flickr.  And it really works, especially if you put the print stuff last.  The only thing it can't do is fit copy to a page and a layout.  But if you do that last in the process, everything else, imagine if a newsroom structure were  entirely on a blog platform and you do things as a process and you do them in the open and  you get people to contribute things to you through Flickr and through the blog and you  do collaborative documents through apps, it really becomes a new way to publish news products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do it. I want to see this.  Yeah, no kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Gina, okay, fine. We'll get your advice.  Okay. Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I signed up for something called VaultPress.  I'm kind of intrigued by this talking about security.  It's something from Matt Mullenweg, the guy who created WordPress, who was the original  WordPress writer. His company, Automatic, is doing it.  And I've signed up for Beta, haven't heard from.  The idea is it secures your WordPress blog and backs up your data somehow magically.  It's a plugin that will act as a backup service.  There are WordPress plugins, but it also apparently monitors your site.  It secures your site looking for hacking activity.  And people like me who use WordPress, this is our biggest fear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think between this and Backupify, which we talked about a couple of times on the show,  I think I see a real trend here in this notion of security and portability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You really need to pay attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's very good. And Matt created one of the first best comment spam protectors.  Yes.  Akismet.  I'm not going to be speaking that way for the benefit of the blogosphere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the Hello Dolly plugin.  Which I can never really understand why it exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually, I have to, I mean, I'm a nerd, so I like, I want to use R-Sync, but I have to,  I actually pay for two different web hosting plans so that I can like sync one to the other.  Oh, what a good idea.  So you can fail over. Oh, that's brilliant.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the right way to do it.  That's a very, very good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure that the WordPress plugin is much easier for, you know, to hook up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, maybe not. It's 20 bucks a month, maybe. They don't know yet.  I told them to charge less.  And they asked me if you want to be in the beta, they said, how much? I said, 10.  Five.  Five.  Matt, what do you do? How do you backup MetaFilter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We have two servers, like a web and a database server, and they're copying nightly to each other  and then to a third box that's outside of that.  And then we also just threw in Dropbox as a fourth.  Oh, that's neat.  If the data center burns down, you know, we still have a backup of the database.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You get, it doesn't take much to, you know, I've been hacked on several times on my WordPress blog.  It doesn't, it only has to happen once before you start really thinking of arcane ways to make sure that never happens again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's true. Mine has to. Matt, the entire MetaFilter database is in Dropbox?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The nightly backups, I think, are 20 or 30 gigabytes.  And that's like three million comments about half a million posts.  Yeah. I mean, 20 gigs to me seems huge for a database.  But yeah, it is. It's probably three to four million items.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. That's amazing. Very cool.  That is. Over what period?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ten years.  That's ten years of activity. But like if I lost that, I mean, the whole thing's dead.  We actually had a problem with a major database maintenance night.  You know, we lost like 24 hours of one site, which was bad.  It was like 1500 comments and like 100 posts.  And we rescued as many as we could out of Google cache.  But that was like, and then people would email in what they had in their browser cache.  Ooh, that's bad.  I mean, we had to build tools in a matter of an hour or two that would let us repopulate the database and stuff.  And we came back with, we got about 70 percent of it back in like one day.  But to do that for ten years would be horrible. Losing all that data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It seems like 20 bucks a month seems outrageous just for a blog.  It does seem like a lot.  Unless you're like GigaOM or something.  If I had to buy the WordPress blog, I would think five bucks is the most.  Because I imagine you can do an export from WordPress and toss that to Dropbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a plugin that mails my entire database to Gmail every night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep, me too. I use that one too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And so now I have it in Gmail and it's not that big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A few megabytes, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then periodically I'll go through and delete old versions.  It's really handy. It's very easy. And that's free.  I'm glad to know I'm using the same one Gina is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm also r-syncing MySQL dump. So, you know, redundancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not to be, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what are you doing, Mr. Nia Nia?  Super deep.  What are you doing, Nia Nia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I beg Jake to back up once in a while.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What else can I do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, what else can you do? Exactly. What's your choice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He rolls his eyes at me the way he did when we went off to the Apple Store.  Oh, Dad.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Dad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of cool, Google engineers have recreated Quake 2 in HTML5.  Obviously a demo of what you can do to in performance for HTML5.  Unless this is in April Fools.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't think it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm so glad that's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know. I hate April Fools, don't you?  I hate April Fools.  You have to think about everything you read. Is this real? Could this really be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Google now goes all out. I mean, they go all out for April Fools.  I realize it's part of the culture, kind of hacker culture. Pranks is like part of it. So April Fools is. But they like, I mean, there are a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they do okay. But the problem in general is that you have millions and millions of people who are not funny every other day of the year.  They think the date makes them funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let's see. To this year, they renamed themselves Topeka.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's funny.  As a very simple one, as a simple tip of the hat to the fact that the town of Topeka renamed itself to Google Kansas, trying to get the Google, you know, community fiber initiative there.  A few years ago, they did the toilet internet service provider, a free broadband service.  Google TISP, remember that?  The thing is they do a nice job of the design. So you really believe what you're seeing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Better, Matt would say, than they did with YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Sign up for a free...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's something about Google's April Fools jokes. It's like there's unfunny on the web and there's like mean and there's lying.  But then Google, it's like the nerd in the back of the room who, I don't know, is trying really hard, but it's not funny at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's really awkward. It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. It's just like, okay.  You're quite the card there, Norbert.  My biggest problem with April Fools is the believable ones and getting snookered by people you trust. I hate that.  Like I believe the Michael Arrington nuclear power. I was like, well, you know, I mean, there's a lot of green people talking about, you know, we kind of have to think of nuclear power again.  I was like, Google's working on nuclear power. They're working on crazy fusion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're doing some green stuff. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. They're trying. And they're trying cold solar power.  Yeah. Like fuel cells is what they're into and like new nuclear's, you know, why not?  Yeah. I was like, that's probably true. Yeah. It was false. He made it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hate that. I hate it when that happens.  So you can go. It's a GWT port of, I like that. This is a GWT port of Quake 2.  Now easy to install. You have to install Og, Vorbis and Lame. That's for the audio.  On Linux you run pseudo apt-get install Vorbis tools. You know, you just use apt-get or Mac ports on the Mac.  Then you build the server, install the resources and navigate to localhost 8080 and your GWT Quake.  And there you go. You got a Quake server running. Have you done this yet, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have not. I'm realizing how the instructions to my software looks to regular people right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what I told you, Gina, right? Like I always hate it when I end up on GitHub.  Yeah. Yeah. No problem. Everyone wants ice cream. Everyone wants ice cream, right? Here, there's some salt, some ice.  Easy. Anybody can do this. In three hours you'll have ice cream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh dear. I have you. I have quoted that line because it you're absolutely right.  I'm working on making the installation easier. In the meantime, I'll install Quake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you're better. I don't think you need. Hey, you don't even need to have SVN or get installed.  This is this is just a simple apt-get. No problem. No problem. No problem.  Let's see. What other stories are we working this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got a few fun ones. The Germans go nutty on privacy and somebody sabotaged the Street View truck there or car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they sabotaged it. How sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's an Australian minister, communications minister, who went ballistic on Google on radio this last week, really kind of wacky.  And one of his complaints was that Eric Schmidt told Wall Street analysts, we love cash. What's wrong with that?  I have no idea. Shocking. Shocking.  Because Australia, it's very frightening what's going on in Australia. It's almost as frightening as China.  Australia wants to basically put a rating system and filter all web content and force it to happen.  And it's getting wacky there. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He says Google's doing more filtering than we're doing.  He says, so when people say, shouldn't we just leave it up to the Googles of this world to determine what the filtering policy should be?  Make no mistake, anybody who wants to go on to Google's sites now and look up their filtering policy, this guy's just making this stuff up.  He's wacky. We'll actually find they filter more material on a broader range of topics than we are proposing to put forward.  They're just nuts. Google, in fact, said that they were not going to voluntarily comply with the Australian government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you've got stuff going on all over. You've got the Digital Millennium Act.  I mean, you've got stuff Kevin Marks talked about last week in the UK, Digital Britain.  You've got this in Australia. You obviously have China going on. It's frightening stuff for the internet, I think, at some point.  It's going to be very hard for Google. Once again, Google's our defender.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's going to be very... Well, they did cave eventually to the Australian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We did sign up this week for Digital Due Process, which is a group of a bunch of companies trying to...  at digitaldueprocess.org, trying to guarantee our rights better on the internet in terms of better protection of our stored data,  better protection of our location privacy, better monitoring against people who would...  better protection against monitoring of what we do, and better protection against bulk data requests.  And I think it's important work. It was just formed this last week with a bunch of people including AOL, ACLU, AT&T, and others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you what. I think that pretty much covers what's going on. I want to go back to my iPad.  So let's get our tip, number, and tool of the week and we can wrap this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like Christmas morning, huh, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is. It's so hard. You're making me breakfast and I just want to go to the tree. Man, this is hard.  Gina Trapani, do you have a tip of the week this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My tip of the week is for all of you people who didn't get an iPad, who are interested to know what Gmail and the rest of the apps look like.  If you want to check it out in your browser, you can do so. I'm using this Firefox extension called User Agent Switcher,  where you can... I mean, this isn't going to be any really new news to our listeners, our tech savvy listeners.  If you use User Agent Switcher, you can enter an iPad user agent and it makes your browser look as if it's an iPad.  So then you can visit Gmail and other apps and see what the interface is like for the iPad, even without having one.  And the link for the... you need a string to describe the user agent. It's in the story linked on the friend feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So what is the user agent for the iPad? Is it Safari, iPad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is Mozilla, slash 5.0, iPad, you CPU, iPhone, OS 3.2, like Mac OS X.  Why does it have Mozilla in there? I don't understand.  And then it says Apple WebKit, 5.3.1, a couple of version numbers, KHML, like Echo. Yeah, it's long.  I'm not sure why Mozilla is in there. I wonder if Mozilla is in there for the iPhone. Let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think a lot of user agent strings have Mozilla in it, but there's no Mozilla in Safari. That's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the iPhone 3.0 user agent also starts with Mozilla. So I'm not sure. A question maybe for the chat room or for next week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody should tell us. Our number of the week, Mr. Jeff Johns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me look at the latest number here right now. 4,150.  4,150. I wanted to do my Karnak. 4,150.  I'll put my iPad against my head.  Of course, Karnak as a reference won't mean anything to 95% of the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, isn't that sad? Only the old folks know that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Before there was a Jay Leno. I know.  So 4,150 is the number of related articles on Google News today about the iPad.  Wow.  And it does strike me there's a serious point here is that that's what's wrong with the architecture of news.  That's not even blog posts. That's just articles.  It means that there's a lot of people who are rewriting the same stuff over and over and over again, and we can't afford that anymore.  And it's this magnificent hype. Of course, I waited just an hour after the line was gone. I went in and bought the thing.  Fine. So we overdid the Apple hype.  But it also says the architecture of the news business, the ecosystem, is wildly wasteful, filled with ego and repetition.  So that's my happy moment for the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but news has always been that way, isn't it? A Pac mentality.  Yeah, we can't afford it anymore.  Well, we don't need to do it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do what you do best. Link to the rest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  I don't really have a tool. My tool is going to be the iPad, but it has nothing to do with Google.  Which you can't get back to.  That's all I'm going to play with for the rest of my evening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does Google have any iPad apps that are like notable or that aren't available on Android or the iPhone already?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, not that I know of. No.  Although I was just playing with Google Earth, it works, but it doesn't scale.  You know, they don't have an iPad specific version of it.  Gmail is the only thing that they, the only nod at all to the existence of the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The web app.  I will confess that I did take my iPad to the bathroom already.  Yes.  You?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not yet. I just got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you taking it to bed tonight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm definitely taking it to bed. I warned my wife.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Honey.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about you? Any personal confessions here for your iPad relationship?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it will be, unfortunately, the best bathroom reader on the planet.  Too much information.  Oh, dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I need to build a new little shelf. You know, you need to build a dock.  That's the real geeking to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A dock into the wall.  To hold your iPad.  The other thing I wonder is I'm not sure yet whether I read the New York Times on my iPhone on the subway.  I see other people reading it on the Kindle on the subway.  Is it too obnoxious to pull out the iPad on the subway?  Wait a couple of weeks and then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, give it a few weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know everybody will.  You just want to let somebody spot it, spot somebody else doing it first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like flaunting your bling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, or you could just get a cover that really is, you know, kind of surreptitious.  Looks just like it's a notebook.  Put it inside a newspaper or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like that play. I'll put it inside Time magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Time magazine. They'll never know.  They'll never know.  I mean, the new business model from New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One more thing that referenced earlier to the Yahoo research scientist who did great work on looking at Twitter and bit.ly stats to look at influence is Duncan Watts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Duncan Watts. There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wanted to give credit where it was due.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Credits to Duncan.  Well, it was a fun time, Matt.  Thank you so much for joining us.  I know you probably had other things you could do like play with your iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  Thanks for having me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We really appreciate it.  Go to Metafilter to see the 30 gigabyte database of amazing things that have been collected over the last decade at Metafilter.com.  Really is a wonderful site.  A must visit.  It's what the web was made to do.  Jeff Jarvis is the author of What Would Google Do?  That's his book not yet available in the iBook store any day now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, Gina, I got to ask you after this last hour, did it change your odds at all of getting it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm holding out.  I'm going to wait.  You're tough.  I'm going to wait.  Yeah, I'm still good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's interesting.  Very interesting.  Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I'm a software geek.  I'm not so much of a hardware geek.  I will go to the Apple Store and check it out, but I'm not convinced yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're tough.  I appreciate all of you, though, figuring out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You own a Kindle, though.  This is like a thousand times better than a Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's true.  Well, this is the deal that I made myself.  I'm going to sell the Kindle and the iPod Touch, and then I'm going to get a tablet, and it could be the iPad.  I have to sell those things first.  That's the prerequisite.  I have to sell those things first in order to make the move, because I just I can't have another gadget.  I need to simplify and reduce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Help a sister out.  Buy your Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Once I get my eBay auctions up, I will be letting you all know.  Or just buy 12 copies of the Complete Wave Guide.
