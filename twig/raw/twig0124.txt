[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.400]   Leo, he's out in France.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.360]   This week, but happy to be here, Phil and Infra.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.680]   And joining us, as always, we're glad to have Ms. Gina
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.480]   Trapani from smartaware.org.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.440]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.880]   Hi, great to be here.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.080]   Great to be alongside with you.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.120]   And Jeff Jarvis from Buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.280]   Hello, Jeff.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.920]   Don't bother me.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.840]   I'm playing words with Fred.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.240]   You'll have to leave the show, sir.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.760]   You talk.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.080]   I'm pulling this plane right back around.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.680]   Are we going to start with Alec Baldwin on the show today?
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.560]   It looks like it.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.160]   It's top story, folks.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.920]   Alec Baldwin kicked off of an American Airlines plane
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.400]   for playing words with friends while they sat at the gate.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.920]   Now, you may ask what this has to do with clouds.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.800]   We will see planes go into the clouds.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.000]   And this is what this is--
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.920]   Words with friends hosted in a cloud.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.760]   --on this show.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.480]   Well, you know, the story broke because my boss,
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.760]   Neil Dash's partner at his other firm, Michael Wolf,
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.480]   had tweeted, I'm on this flight, and Alec Baldwin just got kicked off.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.800]   And they pulled us back to the gate.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.960]   So Michael had said that we had to go back to the gate
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.240]   for him to get off the plane.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.160]   Whereas Alec later said, we were sitting at the gate doing nothing,
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.840]   and I got yelled at for playing words with friends.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.960]   So it was such an interesting thing.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.720]   Because I think when you're in first class New York to LA flight,
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.440]   there's this unspoken, no filming, no photographing, no tweeting
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.880]   rule, because there are celebrities take that flight.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.840]   But this story broke because Michael had tweeted this,
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.800]   and then people said, hey, Alec, what are you doing?
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.240]   And then he started with the tweets
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.560]   about how American Airlines is clearly the airline from hell.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.920]   Yeah, he said, flight attendant on American
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.160]   reamed me out for playing words with friends
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.560]   while we sat at the gate not moving.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.720]   No wonder America is bankrupt, ironic hashtag.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.080]   Later, he said, United should have app on board
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.240]   where you can play words with friends with other passengers.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.600]   American should have an app where you read the New Testament
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.560]   with flight attendants.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.720]   Now, if they were moving, if they were taxiing,
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.280]   of course, they're like, sir, you have to turn off your electronics.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.440]   But he's claiming they were just sitting.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.120]   They say that as soon as they close the door,
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.760]   you're supposed to turn all off.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.680]   We've seen that stretch.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.520]   And then it got even weirder because last night,
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.360]   he wanted a mass unfollowing if presuming his account wasn't
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.720]   somehow spammed at 10 o'clock.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.560]   And then the account disappeared, it was deactivated.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.200]   And then today, all those tweets reappeared at deactivated 001.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.440]   And now that account's gone.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.320]   I can't figure out what's going on here.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.000]   He got mad.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.400]   He posted a bunch of stuff on Twitter.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.920]   Then he changed his mind.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.920]   I mean, deactivated.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.080]   I mean, he's probably just going back and forth
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.200]   about what he should and or should not have done.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.560]   You know, this is a little bit celebrity gossip here.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.960]   We're talking about Alec Baldwin.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.640]   He's been in the news for all kinds of crazy stuff
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.720]   over the years.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.520]   But what's interesting is it's playing out in the cloud.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.520]   It's playing out on Twitter, right?
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.320]   And there's also the question of like,
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.640]   should you really have to--
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.440]   couldn't you just put your device in airplane mode?
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.880]   I mean, this is kind of a mood question, right?
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.120]   Because the play words of friends, you have to be connected.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.760]   But there was a time article earlier this week
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.640]   about how there's really no good reason why you shouldn't
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.160]   be able to just put your device in airplane mode and read
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.680]   or play or whatever.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.200]   But this policy was just enforced before there
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.600]   were devices with airplane mode.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.800]   So I kind of wanted-- I was hoping that Alec would jump
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.320]   on the bandwagon and sign the White House.gov petition
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.160]   to get the FDA to change the policy.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.200]   But it doesn't sound like this is going to turn into anything
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.600]   actually productive.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.280]   Yeah, the FAA claims that we're just
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.280]   being extra careful about electronics.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.400]   We don't know what they do.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.320]   We haven't had time to really study what they do.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.040]   So we want it off.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.720]   Right, right.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.320]   But Air Force One doesn't ask the president or any his staff
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.840]   to turn their devices off before they--
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.600]   Well, you know, I have heard-- and I don't know if this is true.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.160]   I've heard that's because of numbers.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.680]   They say, yeah, we don't think one electronics device
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.840]   or two even is going to bring the plane down.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.400]   And it's obviously true that it won't because there's
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.720]   plenty of people who leave their electronics on that aren't
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.400]   caught.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.760]   But they say if we have everybody on the plane running them,
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.480]   that could cumulatively cause enough interference.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.760]   We don't know what it would do.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.200]   Right.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.960]   Well, I guess that's reasonable.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.720]   I guess that's reasonable.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.880]   Let's do the studies.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:34.320]   It is.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.840]   Let's do the studies.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.120]   Let's figure this out because I don't want the plane
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.920]   to crash either.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.760]   I don't think anybody does.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.600]   This is clearly a problem of the privileged.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.880]   I mean, I understand that there's probably things
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.240]   that we could spend more time on and maybe that would be more
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.600]   productive.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.080]   But it would be nice.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.000]   First, a little bit of a first world problem.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.560]   Well, let's talk about the web since we're all not there.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.760]   Or at least I am not there.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.800]   That's why I'm here, filling in for Leo.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.880]   So I don't know.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.640]   Frankly, I think I get the better end of the stick.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.720]   He has to work.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.040]   And I get to hang out and talk with you guys.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.080]   But Eric Schmidt was on stage at the web.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.600]   And when Eric Schmidt is on stage and opens his mouth,
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.720]   he makes news.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.360]   Which one should we pick first?
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.160]   How about this one?
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.240]   By the summer of 2012, the majority of the televisions
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.880]   you see in stores will have Google TV embedded in it.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.040]   Everybody who believes that starts singing--
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.200]   star-spangled matter.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.880]   No, I guess nobody believes it.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.320]   Either that or I hate America.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.400]   It's one of the top.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.120]   Maybe the Google TV has been so successful in all the manufacturers
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.920]   who have put out Google TV's that top boxes are so thrilled
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.040]   with how the launch went.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.840]   Clearly, this is going to happen by the summer.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.080]   This is a really bold statement.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.240]   Does he realize that 2012 is the coming year,
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.960]   that it's over less than a month away now?
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.680]   Over a less than a month away from 2012.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.400]   This is bold, really bold.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.440]   I had to kind of laugh about it.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.160]   I actually really liked Google TV.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.800]   And in fact, right before the show was refreshing my Logitech
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.120]   reviews system settings, trying to get the new update.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.160]   Did you get it?
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:06.960]   No, I have not.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.960]   Yeah, I haven't got it yet either.
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.280]   It lies to me and says that my system is up to date.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.000]   And I shake my fist and say, it is not.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.960]   You show the story on the web.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.160]   You're like, no, look.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.280]   No, it's not update.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.280]   I will go to Chrome right now and show you the story.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:18.480]   That's right.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.320]   You don't even have to show it.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.440]   You could pull it up on the Google TV.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.240]   You could pull it up on the Google TV.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.400]   So I think I'm a little more bullish about the Google TV
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.120]   than most people.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.520]   I still think that this was a two-folded statement for him
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:27.880]   to make.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.960]   So OK, we can all laugh at that.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.760]   What do you use Google TV for?
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.200]   Why do you like Google TV, Jada?
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.320]   I like it because--
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.360]   the sell was that it's a browser on your TV.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.640]   And I really like that.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.840]   I mean, I look stuff up in the browser on the TV a lot.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.040]   I stream things in the browser.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:53.200]   I like to watch obscure streams of live sport events
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.040]   and that kind of thing.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.720]   So I really like being able to go to a page and get flash
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.640]   and be able to watch a stream.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.480]   I think the YouTube interface is really nice.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.760]   I like doing picture in picture.
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.920]   So I like being able to watch Glee and also
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.840]   have a search for the Glee hashtag and Twitter going
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.920]   and watch what people are saying as I'm watching the show.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.640]   So I don't think the interface is great.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.240]   I think it really needs to improve.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.280]   I think there need to be a lot more apps.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.640]   And that's why I'm really hot to get this update.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.480]   But I just really like being able to look up stuff.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.160]   My friends come over and I'm like, hey,
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.480]   you have to see this YouTube video.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.720]   And I bring it up to my TV and we start watching.
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.880]   And I know people do that generally with their iPad
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.080]   or on their computer.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.920]   There are lots of interfaces to YouTube.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.720]   I just really like that it's Chrome.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.440]   And it's just a full browser.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.280]   - Right, next question.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.720]   Does your wife ever use it?
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.360]   (laughs)
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.040]   - She, not as much as that.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.840]   She doesn't like the keyboard in the living room.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.720]   She grabs the remote.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.440]   Like she grabs the TV remote and I grab the keyboard remote.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.640]   So no, she doesn't use it as much as I do.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.080]   Although I will sit her down and say,
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.040]   look at all the kind of cool videos I saw today.
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.400]   Here's a video video.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.120]   - And she bats you on the head and says, that's nice to you.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:00.960]   - Yeah, right.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.800]   She's like, oh, that's funny.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.840]   So like, let's, you know, watch Survivor now.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.640]   So yeah, baby, it's just me, I guess.
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.520]   - We use it in the spare room, in the bedroom,
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.320]   as our Netflix device in there.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.640]   We have the Roku in the main room.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.520]   And I have to say, I like using the Netflix on Google TV
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.280]   better because of the full keyboard.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:25.160]   I was watching Down Naby on Netflix this week in there.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.480]   And just, you know, the ability to just kind of pop in
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.000]   and say, well, what else do you got?
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.480]   Like once I've finished the season
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.760]   I could just be like, oh, you know what?
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.600]   I just want to see some more British stuff.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.200]   And I could use that keyboard.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.360]   It's much handier that way.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.480]   - It really is.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.040]   Typing searches, typing URLs and searching Netflix.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.600]   And app interface is really nice.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.760]   And just, you know, just being able to type
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.360]   without having to use the thumb pad and choose the letters.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.200]   - You know, it'll make a big difference when voice
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.280]   comes to TV, or your two way voice when you, you know,
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.320]   TV, find me, Xbox.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.880]   Yeah, you can already do that.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.040]   Go to the Xbox.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.800]   - Yeah, I have the connect and I don't use the voice commands
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.840]   as much, but I mean, I really like waving at it.
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.840]   So I don't know, what do you think, Tom?
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.080]   - Yeah, I think somebody's going to have to crack it.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.320]   I think the connect has got a nice way of doing it.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.920]   The new dashboard update, I haven't tried it yet.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.800]   I haven't got it, but it doesn't have everything.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.720]   And I guess that's the problem with Google TV.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.240]   Also, it doesn't have everything.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.160]   Nobody's cracked this access.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.200]   What people want is to easily tell the thing
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.200]   what they want to watch and have it show up.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.800]   And so part of that is the voice activation
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.320]   or the keyboard or whatever the input device is.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.680]   We're pretty close to cracking that with things like Siri
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.360]   and connect voice recognition.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.080]   But the other side of it is having your television programming
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.280]   there and we're far away from that
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.400]   because the industry's digging its heels in and saying,
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.400]   no, HBO just said, we will not provide an option
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.120]   for people to watch HBO unless they have cable television
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.240]   and subscribe to us that way.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.000]   - Right, like HBO Go, you can't get that unless you're--
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.800]   - Yeah, unless you're a subscriber.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.840]   I want to get rid of that stuff.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.040]   - Yep.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.880]   - All right, we should have just had Eric Schmidt
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.920]   do the rundown today because that's just one of the things
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.760]   he said at Le Webb.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:18.600]   Another thing he said, Android is ahead of the iPhone now
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.800]   by unit volume with ice cream sandwich features.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.800]   Prices are lower with more vendors, more price points.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.400]   Do I need to continue the list?
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.440]   It's free.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.080]   Does he need to continue the list?
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:30.920]   (laughs)
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:31.920]   No.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.840]   - I just, I feel like this whole iPhone versus Android,
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.680]   which is better and which is having bigger growth
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.400]   and which is, you know, do developers prefer to develop for?
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.760]   This conversation just always uses different numbers
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.640]   and different metrics as it activations, as it devices.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.920]   You know, and everyone can make an argument
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.280]   for one over the other.
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.000]   I mean, Android's doing really well,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.160]   which I think is, you know, which is a fair statement.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.200]   Not doing as well as the iPhone yet, but getting closer, right?
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.280]   And growing maybe, maybe growing faster?
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.120]   I don't know.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.880]   So these are Google's internal numbers.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.920]   Yes.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.560]   200 million iPhone Android phones
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.920]   and 550,000 new ones being activated daily.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.000]   And then the Android market just celebrated a milestone.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.720]   I think it was 10 billion apps.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.200]   - Some ridiculous number, yeah.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.360]   - Yeah, I think it was like 10 billion apps downloaded.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.200]   - Right.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.040]   - And then the 10-cent sale.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.360]   - The 10-cent sale, exactly.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.760]   - The 10-cent sale, which is a really interesting sale,
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.160]   the 10-cent sale, because it was not free.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.000]   It was 10 cents.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.960]   So I think that the, and you know, at first I kind of had
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.160]   a little rant on Twitter.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.960]   I was like, you know, why are you thanking developers
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.440]   and then selling their apps at such a discounted price
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.160]   that they're, you know, gonna be losing money?
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.760]   And then I thought, you know, that 10 cents deal
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.240]   was actually really brilliant because that makes people
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.080]   who haven't set up a Google Wall account,
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.320]   who haven't linked their credit card yet, do it.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.280]   And that's what they need to do.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.000]   If I, my wife, she's never bought an app on her Android phone.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.080]   Not even my app.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:53.920]   - Wow.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.760]   - Okay, so just because she doesn't, she just had,
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.320]   it was like, you know, she keeps putting off the inconvenience
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.120]   of setting up her, you know, her account
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.600]   and entering her credit card and all that stuff.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.560]   So I think that that 10-cent sale was actually really brilliant
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.920]   and they're trying to get people who have Android,
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.440]   who haven't bought apps, you know, just want the web browser
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.440]   in their email, which comes stock,
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.360]   to take that extra step and get into the buying app,
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.280]   Osphere.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.800]   - It's the Amazon e-book strategy.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.640]   - Yeah.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.240]   - Right, it's the lost leader that gets you into it.
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.080]   - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:26.560]   - More things from Eric Schmidt.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.000]   In response to a question about Android's app lineup,
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.120]   I guess the questioner said it pales in comparison to iOS,
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.680]   despite Android's shipment win,
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.680]   and despite apps catching up by volume,
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.920]   Schmidt said, "Six months from now, you'll say the opposite.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.640]   "Ultimately, application vendors are driven by volume.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.720]   "The volume is favored by the open approach.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.600]   "Google is taking, whether you like ice cream sandwich or not,
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.600]   "you will want to develop for that platform,
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.480]   "perhaps even first."
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.240]   This seems like one of the more measured
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.760]   and reasonable things he said.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.920]   - Although, I wish that he hadn't said
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.640]   whether he liked it or not,
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.480]   like as if ice cream sandwich is like,
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.080]   you know, like the ice cream sandwich is jail.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.840]   Like I'm a developer and I really didn't want to,
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.520]   but I have to develop for ice cream sandwich.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.520]   - But you like it or not, Mr.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.920]   you're developing for ICS.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:09.760]   (laughs)
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.520]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.200]   Marco Armat, who builds one of my favorite iOS apps
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.640]   in the InstaPaver app, which I absolutely love,
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.640]   wrote a piece about this and basically saying,
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.240]   you know, a developing for Android
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.120]   is much less profitable for developers
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.200]   and it's very expensive and it's a pain in the butt.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.040]   And this, you know, what Eric,
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.400]   which Smith said about this is just crazy.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.600]   It doesn't make sense for developers
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.080]   to develop for Android first now
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.840]   and it won't in the next six months.
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.400]   And I, you know, I disagree with him.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.160]   I don't think that, I think that developing
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.960]   for both iOS and Android,
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.080]   if you're a mobile app developer,
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.280]   a native mobile app developer,
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.920]   you have to develop for Android and iOS at the minimum.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:46.880]   Just because, you know,
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.920]   Android gives you that distribution,
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.240]   the way that that statement says.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.600]   And, you know, all the iOS developers say,
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.600]   yeah, but Android developers don't actually make money.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.960]   But, you know, sometimes, you know,
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.240]   Apple has had this emphasis on revenue over distribution,
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.800]   whereas Google has always been distribution over revenue
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.240]   and that's in the DNA of both of these companies, right?
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.320]   Like Apple makes its money by like selling shiny objects,
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.080]   hardware objects and now shiny software objects, right?
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.920]   And Google's, in the DNA of their company,
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.600]   is like, we build this platform for the web
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.120]   that's totally freeing and offers this awesome service
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.680]   and then we advertise to you, you know, to you on it
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:24.960]   because it has such a wide distribution.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.760]   So, we see this in both kind of, in both iOS and Android.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.600]   So, I think, you know, for developers who want both,
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.840]   you know, who want distribution over revenue
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.080]   and distribution can lead to revenue,
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.160]   I think it makes total sense to develop for both platforms.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.200]   I think that Schmidt is obviously being very bullish
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.760]   by saying that you're gonna develop for Android first
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.720]   in six months, I don't know if that's necessarily true,
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.280]   but I think right now in the present,
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.200]   if you're a mobile app developer and you want,
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.280]   you want to get your stuff out there,
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.600]   you've got to do it for both platforms
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.240]   and even all the new kind of apps and web services
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.200]   generally launched with both iOS and Android apps.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.280]   - Is Google, this is an ignorant question,
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.040]   but that's why it's special to you here.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.280]   Is Google offering ad sales for apps?
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.000]   - You can, yes, you can.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.040]   So, I don't do this in my app
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.480]   but you can have ads in your app.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:17.040]   So like Angry Birds, for example, you buy it on iOS
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.040]   but it's free on Android but with ads.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.040]   So, yeah, so they definitely do offer that.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.200]   And you can also do an in-app purchase
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.560]   and that kind of thing on Android as well,
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.600]   but I think the ad model is more popular in Android apps.
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.480]   - Which goes to the volume, right?
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.680]   - Right, which goes to volume.
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.000]   - If they have a huge volume and they have data about,
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.880]   then that's gonna make the ad marketplace
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.760]   within apps more valuable.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:40.840]   - Right, exactly.
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:45.360]   - Jeremiah O. Yang at LaWeb asked Eric Schmidt,
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.800]   if Google were a country, which country would it be?
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.640]   But instead of answering that sort of weird interview-like
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.160]   question, job interview-like question,
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.320]   he said, "We're not a country."
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.520]   Okay, fair enough.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.120]   I think he was responding to a different question
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.600]   which is, you know, that question of like,
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.000]   is Google too powerful?
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.120]   They have the economy of a small country.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.640]   Schmidt said that they don't have nuclear weapons.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.080]   That's good to know.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.640]   They don't have a police force.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.160]   They're subject to the laws of most actual countries,
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.600]   a fact made most obvious in China.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.080]   But Google does have values.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.360]   And Schmidt emphasized those values,
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.640]   freedom of speech, transparency.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.560]   And oddly, the Chinese government wanting to censor
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.640]   Google search as an example of when they let their values
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.520]   stand and resist at that.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:35.080]   Now, I have heard that Schmidt was not the leader
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.440]   in that movement, but you know,
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.840]   he's taking the company line now.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.520]   He said, "If we were to take our values to a country,
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.640]   we'd value personal privacy and personal expression,
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.720]   but a lot of public debate and discussion."
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.320]   This was kind of a reflex answer.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.480]   It's the same one that he gave two years ago in Davos,
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.640]   pardon me, around China.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.040]   China was a hot issue right then.
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.760]   And people were looking to Google to kind of be
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.480]   the ambassador of the internet to the world.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.200]   And Schmidt, to me, or it, and said,
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.240]   "No, we're not a country.
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.600]   We don't have a police force.
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.520]   We don't have diplomats other than Dave Drummond.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.120]   We don't have police or any of these things.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.200]   And we're not a country.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.600]   Don't put us in that position."
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.680]   So I think he's been so used to giving that answer
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.000]   for so long that when that Google country came out,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.720]   it just went dang, in goes the cart, hit play.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.280]   And then in response to another question,
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:30.880]   he mentioned that Google buys around one company a day
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.720]   or a week at the same time.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.560]   He went back and corrected that a week,
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.840]   which is still amazing.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:36.840]   Yeah.
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.840]   Yes.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.040]   Quiet.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.520]   And Lexi has sought this from TechCrunch,
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.640]   so why do you never announce them?
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.640]   He said, "We don't have to."
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.640]   We're Google.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.640]   We're Google.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.760]   We are-- you're like a whole other country,
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.880]   but you're not, because you don't have a nuclear weapon.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.880]   And I hope you never get them.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.960]   All right, anything else on the web before we move on?
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.560]   I want that t-shirt.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.800]   I feel better now because Google doesn't have nukes.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.800]   You can't index the web with nuclear arms.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:07.800]   Oh.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.920]   You know, because you know, if Google gets a nuke,
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.480]   then Facebook has to have a new--
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.480]   Right, right.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.480]   --mutual then, and Twitter has ICBMs.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.920]   It gets very complicated.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:18.920]   Let's keep it out.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:19.920]   Keep it off the way.
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.480]   You really want Zuckerberg to have his finger on the button.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.480]   No.
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.480]   Absolutely not.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.480]   No.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.480]   No.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.400]   This guy who kills chickens, so we don't want that.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.480]   I don't even want his finger on the like button.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.560]   What's on his that button?
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.360]   I'm just looking at the Wikipedia page of Google acquisitions.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.080]   And it does look like there's one per week.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.080]   Really?
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.600]   The most recent one was November 14.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.320]   So I guess that's not exactly a week ago.
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.000]   But there are a few that happened kind of around the same time.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.880]   Katango-- I mean, a bunch of these I've never heard of.
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.760]   Katango, Aptor, Will Zagit, We Knew Daily Deal, Social
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:53.280]   Grapple.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.440]   I'm sure there are a bunch that haven't just
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.360]   haven't been reported.
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:57.920]   But this is an impressive list.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.520]   Yeah, TechCrunch went and dug up an October report from Google
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.040]   that indicated 57 acquisitions over the past year
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:05.800]   to that date.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.440]   So that 52 weeks in a year of the average--
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.000]   What proportion of those do you think
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.200]   were motivated as much by recruiting as by the technology?
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.040]   Act hires rather than acquire.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:17.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:18.920]   I don't know if I had to guess.
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.440]   I'd say 30%.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.600]   Yeah, I might have got a little higher.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.000]   A little higher.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.440]   Yeah, maybe 40 or 50 even.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.000]   Yeah, close to half.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:29.640]   All right.
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.840]   Well, it's not to jump around.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:37.120]   But in a related link, we have Facebook and Goala.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.400]   An act hire with a twist, right?
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.320]   With a twist, right, where they didn't actually
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.880]   acquire the company and the company dies.
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.360]   But they got all the people.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.080]   But the investors don't get their money from Google then
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:48.720]   or from Facebook.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.720]   They mean, yeah.
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.240]   No.
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.640]   They wouldn't appear so, no.
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.640]   Yeah, that's going to cause some--
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.200]   and it is apparently causing some consternation
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.480]   about how they're going to get their money back
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.200]   from their investment when they're going to get it all of that.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.280]   And it doesn't sound like everybody from Goala
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.000]   is making the move out to Facebook headquarters
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.280]   in Palo Alto.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.960]   Only the founders and some of the team are going,
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.280]   and we lose Goala, which I use Goala for a while
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.440]   and I've used it for a long time.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.000]   So I'm not going to miss it that much.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.560]   But I know there's some pretty enthusiastic folks out there
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.560]   that are pretty disappointed about it.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:22.840]   So it's a really interesting thing.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.840]   It's not was a case where they wanted--
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.280]   they killed the company to get the best talent.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.760]   And the company, obviously, I don't
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.960]   remember what it was saying, money to get back to the investors.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:32.960]   Yeah, maybe not.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.520]   But it becomes a new strategy to get hired by these companies.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.400]   Sam Lesson, who worked a lot on the timeline,
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.840]   that kind of stuff, started that file transfer company
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:42.720]   and he's really good.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.040]   And he got bought and they didn't want the technology.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.440]   They wanted Sam.
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.840]   But do the venture capitalists now
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.040]   start have to worry about this and say, look, you're not
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.160]   going to go just get hired, are you?
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.640]   Because we want you to sell the company.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:58.120]   Right, so is there a contractual way you can deal with this?
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.120]   I don't know.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.600]   That's a really interesting question.
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:01.840]   Because most of the time--
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.640]   yeah, go ahead, Gina.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.800]   I was going to say, wouldn't the investors
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.640]   have some sort of say about whether or not
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.560]   to wind down the company?
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.760]   And it doesn't seem like they--
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.040]   well, I don't know what their deal was.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.560]   But it doesn't seem like they made decisions.
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.080]   Right, so the staff doesn't own the assets.
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.360]   So the assets do go probably back to the investors.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.080]   But all your talent just walked out.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.520]   That's your asset.
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.160]   And usually with an act higher, the company
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:32.000]   buys the other company so that they can get the talent.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.200]   This is kind of an unusual case.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.640]   And maybe it won't come up that often.
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.560]   Usually you want the intellectual property
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:37.440]   that the company developed.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.080]   But Facebook looked at it and said, now,
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.080]   you don't have anything that we can't cover with places
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.000]   already.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.680]   Well, what becomes interesting too is, let's just imagine--
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.080]   and I have no knowledge of this whatsoever--
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.600]   but I would imagine there were probably
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.840]   sweet, exciting bonuses for those people.
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:51.760]   Right.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.160]   So normally, if you got acquired,
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.800]   you'd hope that you'd get some level of cash upfront
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.600]   in terms of cash in your equity.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.920]   But if the equity is worth nothing,
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.160]   if you're in the hole to the investors,
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.720]   this is a way you can go around that
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.680]   and still get some cash in your pocket,
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.080]   because you're the asset.
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:09.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.160]   Right.
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:10.760]   That's a really good point.
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:11.880]   Really fascinating.
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.040]   I don't have time.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.440]   It's a really good question.
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.560]   I haven't seen the VCs talk about that yet,
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.000]   because I'm probably scared to.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.760]   But I'll bet Fred Wilson will probably weigh in on this.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:24.280]   Yeah, probably once it's known what exactly went down
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.600]   and who got what?
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.240]   We may get a clearer picture of that.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:28.760]   Right.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.400]   Let's take a quick break and thank our sponsor, Ford,
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.760]   featuring available sync.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.720]   Sync Entertainment features a light access music
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.400]   and podcast for most devices, iPods, mobile phones,
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.560]   tablets, flash drives, and with sync, my Ford Touch.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.720]   You can play videos or display photos--
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.120]   no, not while you're driving.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.680]   But while you're sitting to wait and pick up the kids
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:49.160]   at the park or at the school, you're
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.560]   waiting outside shopping mall while somebody's
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.040]   running into get something.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.520]   You can watch some videos, look at some photos,
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.880]   right there on your sync with my Ford Touch.
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.200]   And it's all made possible through a versatile media hub,
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.720]   which supports a convenient variety of devices
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.160]   for your music and entertainment.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.800]   Wired connections work through USB, through SD,
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:09.920]   through RCA jacks.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.080]   Wireless works through Bluetooth.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.840]   Pretty much anything-- any way you can connect.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.560]   You can connect it into sync and then use your voice
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.640]   to tell it what to do.
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:21.920]   Play me some SCA, and it'll just play all the scottunes that
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.800]   are tagged in your library or play me some Ella Fitzgerald.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.080]   And it gives you all the best Ella Fitzgerald tunes you've got.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.440]   You just tell it what to do.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.080]   It does it.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.400]   Also available is sync with my Ford Touch HD radio.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.160]   So if you're listening to HD radio,
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.360]   it features iTunes tagging.
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.080]   Tag a song you like on the radio and transfer the info
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.120]   to your iPhone or your iPod.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.280]   And then you can purchase the song directly from iTunes,
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.240]   because it saves all that information from you.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.640]   Sync's versatile entertainment features
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.960]   are available in the 2012 Ford Focus.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.160]   And you can learn more about this and other technologies.
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:56.280]   Ford is bringing two vehicles at Ford.com/technology.
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.880]   We thank them for their support of this week in Google.
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:02.600]   We sort of moved into the Facebook section of things,
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.440]   but they've got some other news going on.
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:09.160]   Timeline, apparently rolling out today in New Zealand
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.200]   and then a smattering of other places.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.560]   But Facebook says they were launching in New Zealand
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.560]   because they want to have a small audience use it
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.000]   in an intensive way.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.160]   So they picked a smaller country.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.800]   And New Zealand, they're very close to the timeline.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:28.400]   So you can theoretically just keep rolling it out all day
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.200]   long if it goes well, I guess.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.080]   I can't wait for this to get rolled out.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:36.360]   I just can't wait to hear what my friends and family who
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.320]   aren't in the tech world think of it.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.680]   I think that they're--
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.280]   I think it's going to be really jarring.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.680]   So I think it's smart for Facebook
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.400]   to start with a very small group of users and see what happens.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.000]   I think there's going to be some backlash and confusion
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.400]   about Timeline.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.560]   So Sanjay is worried that his friends will react badly.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.400]   And he'll lose his friends from Facebook.
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.400]   And have you heard any rumors of why it's taken so long?
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.560]   Since F8, it was supposed to come out pretty quickly.
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:04.440]   And it's been delayed.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:08.000]   Some guests, not really a rumor, but a guest,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.880]   that Facebook got nervous about Timeline.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.520]   I wonder, Gina, do you have a good guess?
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.360]   No, I haven't heard anything.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.680]   And I enabled it through--
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.680]   I don't know, there's some sort of developer back door.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.320]   So I enabled it.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.200]   I've had it for a while.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.440]   And a few of my friends are the same.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.400]   But most of my friends haven't.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.840]   And I've wondered what the slowdown has been, actually,
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:27.920]   but I haven't heard anything.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.160]   Yeah, I enabled it, too.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.560]   And it seemed to work as advertised.
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.360]   I didn't have any issues with it.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.040]   I mean, there's things I like and don't like about it,
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.000]   obviously.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.760]   But it worked the way they said it would work.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.760]   So yeah, Jeff, I think that's probably the best guess
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:45.360]   is with all of this FTC stuff that they're having to go through,
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.880]   maybe they're being very careful and running over it
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.640]   with a fine tooth comb to make sure
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:52.240]   that since they're changing the way stuff is displayed,
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.520]   that they're not changing anything from their privacy
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.040]   policy.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:55.880]   Oh, well, right here.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.280]   Because that's one of the conditions.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.040]   Right, well, the other thing is that one of the conditions
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:03.720]   is that you can't retroactively change the public of stuff.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.960]   So I'll bet they had to do a lot of going back in and coding.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.800]   You're right.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:08.640]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.280]   You can't retro-- so if you publish something publicly,
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:12.760]   you can't go back and see--
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:13.760]   No, it's the opposite.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:14.920]   It's the opposite.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.280]   This is the changing default problem.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:20.320]   So if you publish something to a group of x,
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.960]   and Facebook comes along later and says, well, actually, it's y,
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:26.000]   it's bigger, the FTC settlement says, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.240]   you can't do that unless you get notice and permission
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.400]   and other things.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.240]   OK, OK.
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.680]   So that makes sense.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.880]   Timeline was going to put stuff up that was not meant
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:38.520]   to be fully public when it was published first four years ago.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:39.640]   It was going to become public.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.720]   And now in the FTC settlement, they can't do that.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.600]   So I don't know, Tom, but I'm guessing you're right
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.280]   that may have had an impact just on a practical level.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.760]   Because you have to opt in to anything
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.440]   that Facebook wants to turn public.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.440]   So there has to be a system for them to ask you,
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:57.560]   is it OK if we start making this previously private stuff
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.800]   public?
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.640]   Right.
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.520]   Any app that has to ask you that question, that's not good.
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.960]   Is there any situation where an app should have to ask you,
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.600]   you're like, hey, you need this in private.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.920]   It's what you like to make public.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.000]   Is that OK with you?
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.200]   You know, when you put it that way,
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.400]   it does sound kind of stupid.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.560]   But I'm glad they're asking at least, which is better.
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.200]   You know, it's a step of the rhetoric.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:16.960]   Just doing it.
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:17.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.720]   Well, speaking of that there was a bug,
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.840]   I guess this past week that inadvertently revealed
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.600]   private photos or photos marked as private,
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.840]   including Zuckerberg's private photos, which
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.120]   is how Jeff saw that picture of him with a chicken.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:33.200]   Because it's a chicken who has the biggest complaint here.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:37.480]   That chicken did not opt into that photo being cut.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:41.280]   Neither in chicken form or wing form.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.720]   There are two photos of holding the dead chicken
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:46.280]   and then the wings that he made with the chicken.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.080]   So I mean, you know, I really, I absolutely
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.200]   agree with Zuckerberg's approach, which is just like,
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.480]   move fast, break things, ask for forgiveness over permission.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.880]   You know, we're just going to push the envelope,
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.800]   see what works, and roll back when things don't.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.960]   So I actually think that that's a smart way
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.160]   to develop products.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:07.000]   But when you're on the sort of privacy thin ice,
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.680]   and when you've built up so much distrust about the way
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.160]   that you, you know, change defaults and handle privacy,
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.120]   I think that, you know, Facebook's really on thin ice.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.600]   So I think that that guess that timeline hasn't rolled out
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:18.480]   right away probably has to do with that.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.560]   Just making sure that they've dotted all their eyes
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.680]   and crossed their T's in regards to that.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.240]   Yeah, they've joined Google and Twitter in the 20 year audit
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.400]   club now.
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:26.640]   Right.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.560]   Exactly.
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.040]   Exactly.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.000]   They see his good audit them every two years.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.480]   Well, part of the problem here is that,
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.000]   Janie, you're way right about this.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.120]   And the problem is that regulators don't understand the beta.
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.880]   They think that fans should be released, you know,
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.640]   perfect, like industrial age view.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.400]   And this idea that you're going to put something out
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.680]   that is not perfect, that does have mistakes in it,
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.280]   just throws them.
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:48.440]   So Jennifer Stoddard, the head of privacy in Canada,
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:54.160]   led the letter that attacked Google for buzz
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.040]   and basically said you shouldn't have betas,
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.360]   which is just so don't get it.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.280]   Yeah.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:05.280]   You can have a new ruling this week about the Canadian version
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.360]   of Do Not Track saying that sites must give you
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:10.680]   an easy way to opt out of tracking.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.480]   Well, the New York Times, which is editorialized in favor
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.960]   of Do Not Track, requires you to use cookies to use the site.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.240]   Yeah, because they make you log in.
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:19.800]   Boom, it's good.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:19.800]   Right?
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:20.320]   Right?
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:21.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:25.160]   So what happens now that these regulators are telling
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:29.720]   these sites how to operate in a key business way
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:32.040]   and that violates the way they're operating their businesses
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.520]   today, it's kind of an issue here.
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.800]   Although I think the Do Not Track thing is what
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:37.760]   it should be achieving.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.680]   And I think you're right, it's not always clear
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.480]   that this is what they're trying to achieve.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.280]   It should be achieving that you aren't
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.520]   tracked without your knowledge.
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.320]   With New York Times, you know I'm logging in.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.360]   But that's different.
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.640]   That's about transparency and a good system
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.920]   of transparency and openness, which I long
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:57.240]   agree that the ad industry and media industry screwed up with.
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.600]   That you didn't know what they were doing,
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.600]   why they were doing, what you got out of it.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.640]   And they made that bed for themselves.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.000]   But however, having said that, to demonize tracking
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.520]   and to demonize a lot of this stuff
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:11.240]   and say you can't do business that way,
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.520]   that makes me uncomfortable.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.320]   And so what you see with this 20-year agreement
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:19.480]   with Facebook and Google, how can you possibly today
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.800]   guess what technology and its capabilities are going
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.880]   to be like in 20 years?
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.040]   And they've set this wall now that
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:29.400]   says it defines the world and as we know it now.
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.880]   And whether it comes to those consent degrees on privacy
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.040]   or whether it comes to do not track
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:37.480]   and those kinds of things, I keep on coming on
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:42.200]   the my side of this fence, but I think it's too limiting.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:45.480]   - How come we never get back the old things that are awesome?
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.480]   Like a two-hour tea break in the afternoon
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:53.120]   or multiple mail service delivery four or five times a day?
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.400]   - Here's what I want back.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.400]   Very simple, the busy signal.
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.280]   - Oh, yes, yes.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:04.520]   - A customizable busy signal where you just,
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.600]   you turn it on like I'm busy right now.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:07.920]   - Or I'm busy for you.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:08.800]   - Yeah.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:09.640]   Well, yeah, exactly.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.400]   It can be a much improved busy signal.
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.200]   You can set preferences.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.560]   - I could imagine the VORAC's busy signal.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.280]   - You, ha, no.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:20.400]   - Busy tones.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.680]   - Maybe a month.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:22.840]   - Oh, father.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:23.680]   - Like, yeah.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.600]   - I want it so that when certain friends visit
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.840]   my Facebook profile, they just get the bat,
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.280]   bat, bat, busy sign.
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.640]   Always, what's a certain friend?
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.920]   - I'm sure that could be done.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.240]   - You, I'm busy.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.120]   - Yeah, oh no, not you.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.720]   In the bath, washing my hair,
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.840]   taking the dogs out for a walk, cat talk.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.000]   Oh, you know, we should point out that bug
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.800]   that you mentioned about Facebook with the chicken
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.640]   and the Zuckerberg, it wasn't, it was a bug.
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.480]   - Yeah, it was a bug.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.000]   - It was not, you know, it'll be interesting
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.320]   how this sort of stuff gets treated by the FTC,
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.680]   but if essentially you flagged a photo as inappropriate,
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.040]   then it would give the user the option
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:01.440]   to select additional photos as inappropriate,
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.800]   which allowed you to go and see all of their private photos
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.280]   to see if any of them were inappropriate.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.920]   Facebook says they've addressed the problem
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.160]   and they've disabled that reporting,
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.040]   that's part of the reporting system
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.000]   while they fix that bug.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.320]   - I think that Zuckerberg learned a long time ago
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.960]   to never post something on Facebook
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.200]   that he truly considered private.
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.040]   And I think that's a lesson that probably all of us
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.800]   as we become more, more public figures can learn.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:26.640]   - Absolutely.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:30.880]   - What I've been saying in talks now on privacy
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.120]   is that listen folks, this is the simplest rule.
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:37.040]   The internet is a lousy place to put secrets.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.160]   - Yep. - Period.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.240]   And this idea that was,
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:42.800]   the Facebook is a place to put secrets is on its face absurd,
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.960]   but that's what we've kind of assumed lately.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.320]   - Well, you know, I mean, that's true of the world too.
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.600]   People are, 'cause if they can keep secrets
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.560]   by not putting them on the internet,
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.800]   but most secrets get out.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.560]   There's only one good place for a secret in your head.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:57.400]   - Yep, in your head. - Yep.
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.280]   - Exactly. - And there it stays.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.240]   - Except the JFK assassination,
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.680]   I can't think of anything else that stayed secret.
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:07.600]   Unless one of you knows, you know, what really happened.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.200]   (laughing)
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.040]   Not talking, huh?
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.880]   - They tell you, but not have to kill you.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.080]   - All right.
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.520]   Should we, should we talk about Facebook
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.040]   losing the Godfather exclusive
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.880]   since we're speaking of assassinations?
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:23.320]   Google+, getting the Godfather game
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:26.240]   as a, on the Google Game Network,
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.600]   it used to be on Facebook,
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.560]   but now Google+ gets it exclusive.
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.000]   Kaban makes the game.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.440]   Chris Carvolo said it was strictly a business decision,
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.760]   which is a quote from the Godfather.
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.160]   - I like that style points for that one.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.600]   - Yeah, yeah, nicely done.
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:44.880]   But Google, you know, Google+ small amount of games right now.
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.200]   What is it, 28 games total?
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:51.120]   And 40 million people on Google+ versus 800 million,
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:54.640]   but it seems like the rev share was one of the justifications.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:57.960]   At least that's what I get from Tricia Durya's All Things D article.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.920]   Google only keeps 5% of your revenue,
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:04.240]   whereas Facebook keeps the more normal 30%
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:05.760]   that people tend to choose.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.120]   Is this just an experiment?
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:10.720]   Do you think, Gina?
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.240]   - This is just Google making the terms really good
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.320]   in comparison to Facebook,
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.600]   because they just need to build up,
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.360]   you know, they need to build up their games area.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.720]   They want people, more people playing games in Google.
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.920]   So, you know, it makes sense.
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:24.160]   - Would you say they made them an offer they couldn't refuse?
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.000]   - Yeah.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.800]   More style points.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.480]   I'm sad I didn't think of that.
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.240]   - You know, I still have from the chat room.
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:33.080]   I can't take credit for it.
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.640]   Somebody said that in the chat room.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.640]   - Yeah, I gotta be spending my attention in the chat room.
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:37.800]   - Yeah.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.400]   All right, real quick.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.720]   I wanna thank our sponsor Newegg.
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.720]   Newegg now is not only the place

[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:51.240]   Great place to pick up tech.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.240]   Parts, hard drive, RAM,
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.000]   full on electronics, music players, everything.

[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.160]   What could be better?
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.000]   - Yeah.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.800]   - You got over 84,000 products there on Newegg.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.600]   It's an award-winning website.

[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:17.920]   and not just the positive ones.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.440]   They're not one of those sites that stacks the deck.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.720]   You get the good, the bad and the ugly in the reviews
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:23.560]   when you're looking.
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.760]   And now Newegg has a new trade insight.

[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.480]   Get rid of your MP3 players, your laptops,
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.120]   your digital cameras, your GPS devices, your e-readers,
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:39.640]   and buy more MP3 players like the digital cameras,
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.280]   GPS devices and e-readers.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.280]   'Cause that's what you do, right?
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.000]   You see that new Kindle Fire.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   You see that new Barnes and Noble and the Color.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.840]   You see that new device and you wanna go out and get it.
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.360]   Well, this is a great way to do it all in one place.
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.520]   Newegg has a great selection of electronics.
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.800]   So trade in your old ones, get the Newegg gift card.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.400]   They have 20 product categories,
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:01.120]   over 200,000 unique items that you can trade in.
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.960]   Some of the prices, the HTC Sensation 4G,
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:06.520]   go in for 195 bucks.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:10.000]   The Kindle 3G plus WiFi, that's an older one.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.800]   You still get 43 bucks for that.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.560]   iPod Touch 4G going for $107.
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.640]   Round up all your gadgets from your home or your office.
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.960]   Visit newegg.com/trade

[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:22.400]   Newegg will give you a gift card, like I said.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.200]   The sooner you trade, the better the price.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.040]   Newegg.com, check it out.
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:26.880]   Take it from a geek.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.280]   - If I'm not correct,
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:30.800]   it's not Newegg a new sponsor, to Twig.
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.040]   - Off-case. - They may be.
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:32.880]   - Welcome.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.080]   - I think they are.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:36.000]   I have to say, one of the things I love about doing this show
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.480]   is that the sponsors are so cool.
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.760]   I've been a Newegg customer for years and years,
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:40.600]   so that's awesome.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.600]   I'm really excited there.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.840]   And I'm excited there with Gazelle too,
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.000]   'cause I've used Gazelle.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:44.840]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:45.960]   It's two great tastes all in one.
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:47.680]   I mean, that's so cool.
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.200]   That's the final, I mean,
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.480]   that's sometimes it's 'cause they're a sponsor,
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.640]   folks, the commercial's over.
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.680]   But that's so neat to put the full recycling there.
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:58.120]   To buy something there and return it there
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.240]   and give the next new thing there.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.680]   You know, a long time ago on this show,
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:03.720]   I talked about the wish for having kind of a subscription
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:06.640]   to new gadgets in some way.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.480]   That starts to get close to that, which is pretty cool.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.280]   - Yeah, great play, great play.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.800]   Things like RAM, thumb drives, all that stuff.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.480]   I'm always shopping, Newegg for that.
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:19.000]   Let's talk some Android, the Galaxy Nexus.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.440]   It may or may not be coming this week.
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.720]   Depends on what rumor you believe.
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:25.680]   But we do know that it's not gonna have Google Wallet.
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:29.120]   Google told Computer World it will not have Google Wallet
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.200]   on the Galaxy Nexus.
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:34.240]   Nine to five Google reports that that was Verizon's decision.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:37.480]   Of course, Verizon immediately took to the press saying,
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.960]   "Well, we're not blocking Google Wallet.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.960]   We just need to do some testing with it.
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.120]   We wanna make sure that it's secure
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:46.120]   and that it works on our network."
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:49.160]   - What does that do to the Google marketplace then?
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.560]   - You have to pay through Verizon.
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:53.280]   - And you can't. - Yeah.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.560]   And I wonder, I think Google checkout
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.160]   will probably still work or will it
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.360]   because Google checkout, isn't Google checkout merged
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.440]   into Google Wallet now?
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.080]   - Yeah, Google checkout is Google Wallet now.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.280]   So it's like that's one thing.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.960]   Well, this sounds like this is just the Google Wallet app.
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:11.640]   Isn't shipping stock on this.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:15.440]   So the Google Wallet app is the app that lets you pay
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.800]   by just kind of swiping the phone over the thing it's seeing.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:19.040]   - Right, it's the NFC thing.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.320]   So I don't think it affects the Android marketplace, right?
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:22.160]   - Right, right.
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.920]   So the Android market is connected to your Google,
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.480]   well, it used to be your Google checkout account.
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.720]   It's now your Google Wallet account.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.760]   Google Wallet is sort of like the umbrella term now
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.240]   for the way that Google gets money to take it.
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.440]   - When they simplified it, they made it more complicated.
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.760]   - They did, they kind of did.
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:37.640]   So it sounds like this is the NFC app thing
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:38.560]   that they're talking about.
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:39.400]   - That's right.
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:43.640]   And the big suspicion is Verizon is partnering up
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.120]   with AT&T and T-Mobile on their own payment system
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.960]   called ISIS, which is a competitor to Google Wallet.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.320]   And so they're, they say this is not why,
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.960]   but it sounds like they're looking for an excuse
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:56.280]   to delay implementing Google Wallet
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:58.360]   until they could also launch ISIS.
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:01.120]   - What if the phone company said
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.920]   just got an email from Verizon?
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.040]   - Wait, what?
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.720]   A phone company would never do something like that, Jeff.
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:07.640]   - No, no, no, no.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:10.000]   - What did you say, Gina?
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.680]   - I'm sorry, someone in the chat room just said
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.280]   they got an email from Verizon VP
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.600]   and saying that there's no Galaxy Nexus on Friday
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.840]   because of the wallet dispute.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:21.400]   - Because of the wallet dispute?
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.080]   - Yeah, that's-- - Wait a minute.
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:26.080]   Now I did see any, a rumor earlier today
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:31.080]   that they would not be having the Galaxy Nexus this Friday.
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:34.120]   But maybe, we just, Jeff,
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:37.560]   but maybe they are actually looking at it and saying,
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:40.240]   you know what, let's get it so that the wallet is on there
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.720]   so people don't think we're doing this
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.200]   for nefarious purposes.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.200]   Does that even be-- - Maybe possible?
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:46.040]   - Could be.
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:49.360]   - All that Verizon is saying to CNET is
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.440]   we haven't officially announced a launch date
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.760]   for the Galaxy Nexus.
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:55.600]   - I'm still curious about those,
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:58.680]   so if I buy an app on the Galaxy Nexus
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.080]   and if it doesn't have Google Wall over any of that,
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.840]   does Google checkout, then my purchase
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.760]   will go through my phone bill.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.760]   Is that what they want so that they know what you bought
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.880]   and get more data on you around Google?
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:12.400]   - Nah, I think we figured it out.
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.960]   The Google checkout that is now also called Google Wallet.
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:17.520]   We'll still work the way it is always worked.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.880]   - Still work, okay, fine, fine.
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:19.720]   - Do you have a market?
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:20.560]   - Yeah, never mind.
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:22.640]   - In the marketplace, but it's the NFC payment
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.280]   which is only exist on the Sprint,
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:27.720]   which one, Nexus S?
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.080]   It's only on one phone right now.
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:33.840]   - Yeah, the other Nexus S, the latest Nexus S.
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:38.560]   You know, the Nexus Galaxy Turbo 4G,
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.280]   the Flux capacitor one.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.200]   - That one, right.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.680]   - That one.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:47.320]   - It's only on the latest Sprint Nexus phone.
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:51.120]   And Nexus S 4G, I think is what maybe maybe called.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:54.840]   But it was supposed to be on the Galaxy Nexus S,
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:58.040]   which does have, or I'm sorry, the Galaxy Nexus,
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:00.080]   which does have an NFC chip.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.320]   So that was gonna be the big thing.
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.800]   It's like, oh, now another Google Wallet phone
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:04.880]   that I can use.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:05.720]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:07.480]   - Web 8915 says use cash.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.740]   (laughing)
[00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:12.600]   - Except everywhere.
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.080]   - Right, exactly, what is that?
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:15.480]   Never heard of it.
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.880]   I use, you know what, I think this whole NFC stuff
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.800]   is just gonna be dead in the water
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:24.240]   because I use card case at the coffee shop down here,
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:26.160]   Acre Coffee in Petaluma.
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:29.000]   They take card case, which is the app on your phone
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.840]   that geo-census you through your GPS chip.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:35.160]   And because they're using an iPad in there,
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.640]   they can tell that I'm on the network.
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:39.680]   It communicates over the internet and it says,
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.360]   oh, Tom's nearby, open a tab.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:45.200]   I just say, oh yeah, give me a medium latte on Tom.
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.560]   And I'm like, oh, hey, Tom,
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.280]   click my face on the iPad, done.
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:50.160]   - Wow. - I don't have to pull the phone out.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:52.080]   I don't have to tap anything.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.880]   I don't have to, I don't have to do anything.
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.360]   It works.
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:59.520]   Now, there's issues on what merchants will be able to do that
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.680]   because right now this is an iOS system, right?
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:04.880]   So not everybody's gonna wanna put an iPad
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:08.520]   in their location, in their retail location.
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:11.000]   But if they could make it easy for merchants
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.480]   to implement this somehow,
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.680]   and that is the way to do it,
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.480]   I don't wanna have to do any tapping at all,
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:17.560]   just be wireless.
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:20.760]   - No, well, indeed, on my Starbucks idea
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.920]   when it started up, one of my favorite suggestions
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:25.720]   was that with your card or not your phone,
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:28.800]   when you go to the Starbucks and you wave it,
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:29.760]   it should take the money out,
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.840]   but it should also put your drink order in.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.640]   - Yeah. - Right?
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:35.080]   And it's ready for you.
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:40.080]   So you're within a poor's distance from the place.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:44.360]   Your phone says, you want what I think you want?
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:45.760]   Yep, the moment's done.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.800]   - You waited, Tom, when you said tab,
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.760]   I thought, browser tab?
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:51.600]   (laughing)
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:55.240]   - You have to get the card case website,
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:56.880]   and I see that you meant your tab.
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.400]   - Yeah, yeah, put it on my tab, right?
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:43:59.240]   - Right, right, right.
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:01.360]   And it looks like there's an Android app for this as well.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.840]   I had no idea that the feature had landed in Petaluma.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:05.120]   I gotta move up there.
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:05.960]   - I know.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:06.960]   - That's very cool.
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:09.000]   - It's, honestly, it's one,
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:09.920]   it was a smart thing.
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:11.200]   That place is packed all the time
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.600]   because they make good coffee, in my opinion.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.080]   But I also go there more often,
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.880]   'cause I'm just like, hey, I get to use cards.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:17.800]   - This is so cool, I get to use a thing, right?
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:18.960]   - I get to walk in and go,
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.600]   and now they know me, right?
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:23.200]   - They learn you faster because they're always,
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.880]   oh, Tom, you know, it's another like, oh, hey, Tom.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:27.280]   - Yeah, nice.
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.680]   As you're both touching your touchscreen devices.
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:30.680]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:32.080]   - Not looking at each other.
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:32.920]   - No, no.
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.440]   - Petaluma has a lot of chickens too,
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.120]   which is good for Facebook.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.440]   - That's true.
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:41.600]   - Actually, you know, one Facebook story
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:45.240]   that we skipped over, do we care about the subscription push?
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:47.640]   Facebook wants famous people,
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:50.240]   Jeff, to promote its new subscribe feature.
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:51.240]   - Hey, famous.
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:54.320]   - Well, you could be if you use this.
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.920]   - So the story here is interesting.
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.640]   So they're gonna let you subscribe
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.480]   to websites inside of Facebook.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:03.080]   And coincidentally, just recently,
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:07.400]   Facebook disabled the ability to auto import RSS feeds
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.080]   as notes into Facebook.
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.920]   So yeah, this is kind of interesting
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.400]   because it annoyed me because I used to sort of
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:17.240]   auto import my blog into my Facebook page,
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:19.480]   like using this notes feature that they had,
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:20.320]   and they stopped that.
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:22.080]   They said, if you wanna post a link,
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:24.360]   you should do it manually and write a little status update
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:25.200]   yourself.
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.720]   And there's some third party apps in Facebook
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.240]   that will do that for you.
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:29.720]   But now that they've launched this feature
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:32.960]   where you can subscribe to websites in Facebook,
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.080]   I was, my initial reaction was just to be sort of
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.800]   immediately indignant, like Facebook is just like stretching
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:40.200]   more of its tentacles and every single part of the web.
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:41.120]   And this is so annoying.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:43.200]   And why wouldn't you just use RSS?
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:44.360]   But you know that I thought the better of it.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:47.400]   It's like, you know, my sister-in-law has no idea
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:49.520]   what RSS is or how to use it.
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:52.640]   But if I said to her, hey, you can subscribe to my website
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:55.040]   in Facebook, she would totally get that.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:57.720]   - But why couldn't Facebook use RSS to do exactly
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:58.560]   the same thing?
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:01.480]   That's my worry is that Facebook does this and for the
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:04.240]   exactly the reason you say it becomes popular with people,
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:06.200]   but then it only works in Facebook and you're stuck.
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:09.480]   It's not like you can export it, you can't use it in
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:12.480]   things that you haven't anticipated wanting to use it for.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:15.000]   - Right, I mean, it just brings more people into Facebook.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.520]   It's just another way that Facebook is saying,
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:19.880]   Facebook is the web, it's your web.
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.640]   We want everything that you want on the web inside Facebook.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:24.480]   And that's how we're getting every single thing that you do
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:25.960]   on the web inside Facebook.
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:28.000]   Everything you like, everything you listen to,
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.080]   everybody you talk to, everybody you friend,
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:32.160]   it's all, Facebook is just gonna be your main hub.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.240]   This makes a lot of sense for Facebook, right?
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:37.640]   But it freaks me out because I really like the web.
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:38.480]   (laughs)
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:41.320]   You know, it's the AOL thing that's going on at Facebook.
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:43.360]   So listen, I think this is gonna be great for people.
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:45.560]   Hey, if people wanna get all their content,
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:47.320]   get their website content inside Facebook,
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:48.640]   then Facebook should make it easier.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:51.560]   I just feel like, oh my God, here's another Facebook button
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:54.000]   that's gonna be on every website that we go to.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.880]   Which, you know, just concerns me.
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:59.720]   - I mean, I also got off the phone just before the show
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:03.000]   with Google and it's no big deal stuff
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.160]   when it's under embargo, which Leo wouldn't do, but I do.
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:09.680]   And involving the author stuff there.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.200]   And you can see the direction that Google's been taking
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.000]   is that they wanna bring together the stuff
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.040]   that you've written in the distributed world
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.800]   into a public place with Google, right?
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.720]   They have that author thing that I'm already part of
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:27.720]   where if I write on Buzz Machine, on Business Insider,
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.480]   on Howvietam Post and on The Guardian,
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.600]   Google will compile that all under my name
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:35.360]   and they're doing that now on Google.
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:37.800]   And so you can subscribe to me,
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.120]   though I don't know why, anyone other than my mother would,
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:44.320]   and get your distributed writings from all over.
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.920]   I think beats this notion from Facebook.
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:51.760]   - Yeah, I just, I would like Facebook to do exactly
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.080]   what they're doing, just use a standard
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.160]   that everybody else uses so that it's ex-portable
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.480]   and cross-platform.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:00.160]   And it could still work so that people
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.800]   who don't know anything about RSS don't have to.
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.320]   They just press the buttons.
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:09.000]   But you know, I think 85,000, 881 people would disagree
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.040]   that only your mother wants to read what you're right.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.280]   (laughing)
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:15.680]   Actually, my mother doesn't want to see
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:17.400]   when I use dirty words, so you're right.
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:20.120]   (laughing)
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:22.520]   - Let's talk a little bit about tablets.
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:23.920]   A couple of different stories out
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:26.720]   about how well the Kindle Fire is doing
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:30.760]   and whether or not it is actually stealing
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:32.600]   the thunder away from the iPad,
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:35.960]   the iPad being the dominant tablet in the market right now.
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:38.400]   After hitting retailers on November 15th,
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:42.480]   it is already outselling the iPad at Best Buy, sort of.
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:45.440]   If you store tablets by top sellers at the Best Buy website,
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.600]   it shows the fire in first place,
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:50.240]   followed by the 16 gigabyte Wi-Fi only iPad too.
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:52.280]   Now, these aren't, you don't see numbers here.
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:54.520]   It's just kind of seeing what Best Buy says
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:55.780]   as their top sellers.
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:59.280]   Question is, if you took all of the different skews
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.080]   of iPads and totaled them up,
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:04.680]   would they still be below the Kindle Fire
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:05.440]   and total sales?
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:08.120]   However, it's selling very well.
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:12.120]   It's out there eating up sales and people are buying it.
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:15.280]   However, there's also another study out there
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:17.320]   from Evercore analyst Robert Chira
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:20.960]   who says that the Kindle Fire seems to be headed
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:24.320]   for half of the Android tablet market by 2012
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:26.280]   and he thinks it will demolish
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:28.880]   the other Android manufacturers offerings.
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:32.440]   He doesn't think that the iPad is going to be hurt by it
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:35.880]   because people will see the fire as an introductory tablet
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:38.520]   and it actually could help iPad sales in the long run.
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:41.200]   Somebody else sat down with Tim Cook
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:46.200]   and the CFO over at Apple and they said,
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:48.160]   look, we love the Kindle Fire.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:50.120]   It's a way to get people into the market for cheap
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.960]   and then when they're ready to spend more on a tablet,
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:54.520]   they can upgrade to the iPad.
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:55.440]   - And trade drug.
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.440]   - Yeah. - Yeah, the gateway drug, right?
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:00.520]   I mean, I think that that's probably really true.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:02.480]   I mean, the fire just seems like it's going
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:03.840]   for a different market than the iPad.
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.880]   It's for people who aren't, are curious,
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:09.480]   but aren't $500 convinced that they want an iPad.
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:14.560]   You know, the Kindle Fire cannibalizing
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:17.840]   other Android tablet sales, that may be true.
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.360]   Although, you know, there have yet to be that.
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:24.640]   I mean, there aren't that many Android tablets yet out there.
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:26.840]   So, you know, at six months from now,
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:29.040]   I think we'll have a better sense of this.
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:33.560]   Apple wants to think that anyone who wants a high-end tablet
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:35.240]   is definitely going to go for the iPad
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:37.520]   and not an Android tablet.
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:39.160]   I don't know if that's necessarily true.
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:40.720]   And I think it's too early to say yet.
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:44.800]   I mean, the Galaxy tab that I got at the Google I/O,
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.040]   you know, has had some problems
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:48.360]   because it was a really early release
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:49.720]   and it certainly hasn't been selling
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:52.000]   not nearly as well as the fire or the iPad,
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.160]   but I think there are going to be other choices later on.
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:56.080]   I think it's too early to say.
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:57.720]   - Yeah, and a lot of people make a,
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:58.880]   there's people like Captain Kipper
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:00.240]   in the chat room saying, look,
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:01.400]   Kindle Fire is not a tablet.
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:02.440]   It's an e-reader.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:06.240]   That is true, but it's semantics.
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:08.760]   And when people go out to buy electronics,
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:09.880]   they're probably not thinking,
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:11.640]   well, I want an e-reader or a tablet.
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:13.280]   They're thinking, I want the thing that does the thing
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.120]   that I want to do,
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.600]   whether that's watching video or reading
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:19.720]   or a combination of multiple different things.
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:21.640]   And I've got this much money to spend.
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:22.960]   That's how they're making the decision.
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:26.320]   And in that sense, these tablets and e-readers
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:30.000]   are starting to compete because they do multiple things.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.280]   - Yeah, I want to touch the web in a bigger screen.
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:33.200]   I think that's what people think.
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:35.280]   I want a web browser I can touch on a bigger screen
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:36.120]   than my phone.
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:38.640]   - That's why you need to move to China.
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:42.680]   So you can get the $100 ice cream sandwich tablet,
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:46.680]   half the price of the Kindle Fire.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:48.880]   Now shipping with Android 4.0,
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:51.080]   MIPS Technologies and Ingenix 7 Conductor,
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:52.800]   a China-based mobile chip provider,
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.520]   announced with worldwide availability.
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:57.040]   So we don't actually have to move to China to get it.
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:59.880]   The world's first tablet based on Android 4.0,
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:01.600]   at 99 bucks.
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:03.400]   - It's just crazy.
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.040]   - How bad will this be?
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:07.480]   (laughing)
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.320]   It's obviously not approved by Google
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:11.440]   or Google would be out there making a big deal about it.
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:12.880]   So it's not gonna have the Google branding.
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.960]   They're just using the free stock Android ice cream sandwich.
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:18.600]   - Which must be, there's no marketplace, right?
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:21.000]   - Well, it means no Android market.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.440]   There might be another market.
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:24.200]   - Sure, they're gonna get jarred.
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:27.080]   - Yeah, or they can, you can install the Amazon market
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.560]   or the Amazon App Store on it, right?
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:29.720]   'Cause you can, well, actually,
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.000]   I don't know how you'd install it.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:31.840]   It'd be interesting.
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:35.160]   They have to ship it with some sort of way to get apps on it.
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:36.000]   - Yes.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.200]   - I might buy one of these just to see how awful it is.
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:42.400]   I sort of expect that it would be awful at that price,
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:46.240]   but I don't know, maybe they will surprise us.
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:47.720]   - Well, it's a MIPS-based processor.
[00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:50.680]   It's not a bad processor, one gigahertz.
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:53.520]   Graphics come from Vivante, GCA60.
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:54.960]   I don't know anything about that.
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:59.120]   But 1080p video decoding, front and rear cameras,
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:03.680]   seven inch screen, WiFi, USB 2, HDMI 1.3 microSD.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:07.960]   I mean, the specs aren't bad for a $99 tablet.
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.040]   - Yeah.
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:11.440]   - Well, I wanna, you know, if this is true,
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:12.520]   and I think there's some, you know,
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:14.280]   I'll believe it when I see it,
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:17.400]   but this starts to get the price point
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:20.040]   that really could explode.
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:22.680]   The notion of connecting this way.
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.800]   - Well, this seems like the tablet that you would buy
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:28.320]   at Kmart, Walmart, someplace like that.
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.960]   Where it doesn't quite really do all of the things
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:36.960]   that other tablets do, but you get it at a bargain.
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:39.040]   And if your budget is, I can't spend more than $100,
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:40.040]   well, now you got a tablet.
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:41.440]   It's, you know, maybe seven inches
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:42.920]   and it may not have the Google Marketplace
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:45.880]   or Google Maps or any of that stuff built in.
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:48.480]   But maybe you don't care, I don't know.
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:50.760]   It is interesting to see anything
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.160]   at a tablet at that price point, I agree.
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:54.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.280]   Although I think people are much more likely to buy
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:58.000]   the Kindle because it's a brand that they trust
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.280]   and commercials and, you know.
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:01.880]   - Well, then you can just go put ice cream sandwich
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:02.720]   on it anyway.
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:06.080]   - So I just went to the, I just went to the buy it
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:07.840]   and your item is sold out.
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:14.400]   - Of the OMG technology is one, the $99 one.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:17.480]   - The iron oil, electron, yeah, sold out.
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:19.400]   - They made 500 of them.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.240]   - Yeah.
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.080]   (laughs)
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:21.960]   - I'm not sure exactly right.
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:25.200]   It probably got a lot of people to the MG.
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:26.440]   Let's see if they get it.
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:27.640]   - They had some spare chips.
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:29.520]   They threw them in some tablets, both.
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:32.280]   Inventory problem solved.
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:33.960]   - They bought some of those HP things
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:35.120]   and just rebranded them.
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:36.280]   - They're touch pads.
[00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:38.040]   (laughs)
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:39.440]   Oh, you know.
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:40.560]   Look at those things closely.
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:41.840]   That's seven inches though, right?
[00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:43.400]   It's smaller than the touchpad.
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:48.200]   So, Kindle Fireowners can now put ice cream sandwich
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:51.040]   sidling up as Engadget puts it alongside
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:54.760]   cyanogen mod seven is the ice cream sandwich
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:59.760]   on the Kindle Fire XDA developers forum member G101199
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:04.360]   is offering up shots with the promise of a kernel release
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:05.200]   in the near future.
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:06.760]   So, you can't do it yourself yet,
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:09.480]   but you can ogle it and salivate.
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:12.000]   I don't know.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.400]   I'd do it.
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:16.240]   Would you do it?
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:18.480]   - I'd do it, but we're the only ones.
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:19.320]   I mean--
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:20.160]   (laughs)
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:21.000]   - Yeah, probably, yeah.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.160]   - The people who bought the fire aren't doing this,
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.240]   but it's a neat proof of concept.
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.160]   (laughs)
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:26.160]   - And for nerds.
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:28.640]   I mean, it sounds like squarely a nerd project.
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:31.240]   - And there's no reason Amazon couldn't do this eventually,
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:32.080]   right?
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:35.000]   I mean, ice cream sandwiches open source already,
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.880]   so they can modify it and test it and put it out there.
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:39.680]   This proves it'll run in the hardware.
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:41.360]   I don't think anybody doubted that.
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:42.200]   - Right, yeah.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:43.600]   I mean, unless there's, you know,
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:44.960]   they don't feel like it's snappy enough
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:47.200]   or there's some sort of, something doesn't work,
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:49.880]   you know, there's some sort of deal-breaking bug.
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:52.520]   Yeah, there's no reason why they wouldn't do this.
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:54.840]   Although, you know, Amazon, I think made a lot of,
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:57.040]   you know, wrote a lot of software kind of on top of Android,
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:58.800]   so it'd be a lot of work for them to upgrade.
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:01.280]   I mean, I imagine that they will probably just release
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:03.680]   a Kindle Fire too with the upgrade,
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:05.160]   you know, have people rebuy the device
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:07.080]   and then push an update over the air.
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:07.920]   - Yeah, they do.
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:08.760]   Yeah, you're probably right.
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:10.480]   - Yeah, you know, I mean--
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:11.320]   - Exactly.
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:12.640]   And then they can legitimately say,
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:15.680]   well, we just didn't think the hardware was good enough.
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:16.520]   And then we can pull--
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:17.880]   - Yeah, we want you to have the best experience, right?
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:19.520]   - Yeah, we can pull this out.
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:22.880]   - Dell no longer offering the Android powered Streak 7
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:25.440]   on its site, told Engadget,
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:28.280]   it's referring to the Streak 7 in the past tense.
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:31.120]   They did point out it'll be available at certain retailers still,
[00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:33.120]   but it looks like the Streak 7 is,
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:35.600]   at least in the United States, it's gone.
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:36.680]   Goodbye, Streak.
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:39.160]   - On the Streak 5 is dead too, I didn't know it actually died.
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:41.520]   - Yeah, yeah, Streak 5 is already done.
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:44.280]   - So does Dell have tablets?
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:45.920]   - Not in the US.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:47.360]   They have tablets in China.
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:49.640]   - Weird.
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:52.440]   - But yeah, they've sort of moved out.
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:53.920]   And they didn't have to threaten to sell
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:56.600]   their computer group off to do it either.
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:57.440]   - Yeah.
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:59.520]   - All right, let's take a quick break
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:01.600]   and thank our other sponsor, Carbonite.
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:04.680]   Ask yourself this question and answer honestly.
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:05.520]   You don't have to tell me,
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:07.320]   are your computer files backed up right now?
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:10.800]   If the answer is no, you are living perilously.
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:12.760]   And maybe you're just the person who likes to live
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:14.920]   with possibly all of their data disappearing
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:17.600]   in a split second, but that's not the way
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:18.440]   I would like to live.
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:19.840]   And if you don't want to live that away anyway,
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:22.520]   either get a local backup.
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:24.280]   So you have three, one, three copies of your data.
[00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:25.600]   You want the data that's on your computer.
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:27.960]   You want the data that's backed up locally
[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:29.520]   to you like a network attached storage
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:30.960]   or some kind of hard drive.
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:32.880]   And then you want something offsite
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:35.720]   because if your home burns down, God forbid,
[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:37.600]   or something else happens locally,
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:41.480]   you want that data to be safely away from your home
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:42.480]   and away from where you are.
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:44.680]   That's why I use carbonite.com.
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:45.880]   Your files are automatically
[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:49.200]   and continually backed up, stored safely offsite.
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:50.800]   And after you have a computer disaster,
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:52.560]   it's easy to restore them.
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:53.960]   Plus you can access your backed up files,
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:56.960]   a good side benefit from any computer on the internet
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:00.520]   or your smartphone or your iPad with a free app.
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:03.840]   Unlimited backup for your PC or Mac is only $59 a year
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:05.920]   and you can try it for absolutely free.
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:09.680]   Go to carbonite.com and or the offer code Twig
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:12.560]   and you can sign up for a free trial from the homepage.
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:13.680]   No credit card required.

[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:18.600]   Sign up from the homepage and you'll get two months free
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:22.160]   when you purchase the service if you decide to purchase it.
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:23.400]   So no credit card required.
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:24.640]   Go to the homepage, sign up for the trial.
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:28.520]   You just use that offer code Twig at carbonite.com.
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:29.720]   And even if you're sitting there like,
[00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:31.520]   I don't know if I need this, you'll sleep better.
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:33.600]   There's a little part of your brain that's going,
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:36.720]   you know, my data could all just appear overnight
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:38.560]   and it's keeping you awake at night.
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:40.080]   So get some better sleep.
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:42.360]   Go to carbonite.com, use the offer code Twig.
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:45.280]   And we thank them for their support of This Week in Google.
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:47.840]   Do either of you get a chance to read
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:50.600]   this NC State University research
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:54.080]   about the Android app bug?
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:55.920]   Nope.
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:56.760]   A little bit.
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:58.800]   I'm just looking through the article on ours now.
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:02.240]   Michael Grace, Yajin Zhu, Jiwang and Juchen Zhang
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:04.880]   published a paper finding Android smartphones
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:07.560]   from Motorola, HTC and Samsung
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:10.480]   did not properly protect privileged permissions
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:13.440]   from untrusted applications.
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:16.400]   The HTC Legend, the EVO 4G, the Wildfire S,
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.920]   Motorola, DROIDAC, Samsung, Epic 4G
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:21.720]   and the Google Nexus one, the Nexus S,
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:23.920]   were the ones they tested.
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:26.560]   Google and Motorola have confirmed the vulnerabilities.
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:31.240]   HT and Samsung are having trouble accepting the reporting.
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:33.440]   There are two leaks going on.
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:36.200]   The explicit capability leak is the one that's troubling.
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:38.960]   It allows applications to exploit a public interface
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:43.680]   or service of another app without making a permission request.
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:47.720]   So you can actually have an app that you have given permission
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:49.280]   to access, say, your contact list.
[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:53.360]   And another app can then kind of ride on that app's permissions.
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:55.920]   There's also implicit leaks that allow other applications
[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:57.760]   to inherit permissions from another application
[00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:00.560]   with the same sign digital certificate.
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:02.320]   Those would have to be apps from the same company.
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:07.000]   So you give, let's say you give Google Maps location information
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.400]   and then Gmail could use this vulnerability
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:10.480]   to get location information.
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:13.280]   That's less troubling, although it shouldn't happen.
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.000]   An untrusted app on these affected phones
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.160]   can manage to wipe out user data on the phone,
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:20.800]   send out SMS messages, record user conversations,
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:25.280]   or obtain user geolocations, all without asking any permission
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.880]   because they use that permission that's already
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.720]   been given to some other app.
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:32.560]   Now, the Google reference phones, the Nexus one and the Nexus S,
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:35.600]   were the only ones that did not suffer this vulnerability.
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:38.880]   So it's something that's going on in the non-stock implementations
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:41.080]   on the other phones.
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.680]   Interesting.
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:46.600]   The most relevant, I think, part of these kinds of things,
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.400]   when these vulnerabilities are found,
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:53.000]   the question is how easily are they reported
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.680]   and how quickly are they addressed?
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:58.240]   So the thing that jumped out to me out of this article
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:03.200]   was that which companies-- oh, the researchers
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.120]   experienced major difficulties in trying
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.720]   to report issues to HTC and Samsung.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:11.720]   That makes me really distrustful of HTC and Samsung's ability
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:14.680]   to have to be open to bug reports.
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.400]   You have to have people ready to test
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.240]   these kinds of vulnerability reports
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:19.760]   and address them right away.
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.520]   And that's just part of the--
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:23.960]   it's got to be part of the development cycle.
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:26.440]   So an interesting that Google's references phones
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:29.200]   didn't-- on the show, I've said a bunch of times
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.800]   on this show that I always--
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:32.000]   sort of I'm a little bit of a snob.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.080]   I always want to buy the pure Google experience phone
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:38.800]   because I feel like it's the purest manifestation
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.360]   of what Google wants Android to be.
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:42.680]   And that's just what I'm most interested in because
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:45.640]   of the show, for the most part.
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.120]   I've been thinking about whether or not--
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.960]   I mean, I think it's great when researchers find
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:51.600]   these kind of vulnerabilities or students or hackers,
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.920]   even if there's just a hacker contest for finding bugs.
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.520]   But I wonder if there's a place for an organization
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:00.440]   or a company to do this kind of security testing
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:05.120]   and offer some sort of extra third party stamp of approval,
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:09.360]   like, hey, this handset passed all of our tests.
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:10.360]   I wonder about that.
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:12.600]   I look for the Google stamp on phones.
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.880]   Hey, if this got Google's approval, then this is good.
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.360]   But maybe we need a third party organization
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.200]   that can do this for every mobile OS.
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.800]   Kind of like trusty for--
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:21.320]   Exactly.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:22.000]   --or for OSS.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.640]   --trusty for OSS, right?
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:26.560]   And they can even-- not only for the handsets themselves,
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:29.040]   but they can have this layer on top of the app stores
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:32.400]   and marketplaces where you say, if I
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:35.160]   earn the certification that can show up on my app store,
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:37.320]   listing as well, that this has gone through a rigorous set
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.200]   of tests.
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:41.480]   And it does exactly what it says it does and no more.
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:44.120]   I wonder if there's a business there.
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.480]   And I'd like to see it come up.
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:47.440]   So it's kind of like I want all the openness of the market
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:48.880]   where as a developer, I can submit an app
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:51.120]   and have it listed right away and maybe not necessarily
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:53.360]   go through Apple's approval process.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.600]   But I also want to have this higher level where I can also
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:58.440]   submit it to this organization or board
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.000]   and also get their stamp of approval.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.960]   And as a consumer, I can say, hey,
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:04.760]   I'll only download these apps or I'll only buy these handsets.
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:06.120]   That's a fantastic idea.
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:06.640]   I love that.
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.880]   Yeah, it is.
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.960]   All right, Wall Street Journal reports
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:13.400]   that Google is in talks with major retailers and shippers
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:15.720]   to create a service that lets consumers shop for goods
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:18.600]   on the web and receive orders within a day or two
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.480]   for a low fee.
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:21.240]   Sound familiar?
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:23.640]   I'd say to competitor to Amazon Prime.
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:25.120]   I'm doubly interested in--
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.440]   at this time when the post office is about to get rid
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:30.120]   of next day delivery on a regular basis for--
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:32.080]   On their first class stuff, yeah, the letters.
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:35.360]   And sixth day delivery and all that.
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:39.280]   And so it really starts to make you see new possibilities
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:42.360]   of consolidation and delivery of goods.
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:43.840]   And Wall Street Journal speculates
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:45.760]   that one of the reasons Google would want to do this
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:50.440]   is because they're finding that people search on Amazon
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.080]   for products.
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.440]   That they're losing some search to Amazon.
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:56.400]   And I find myself doing this when I'm like,
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.600]   what's the price of something?
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.920]   I go to Amazon to look up the price
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.160]   because I know that they have pretty much everything
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:04.000]   in their catalog, even if they don't sell it.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.920]   They have so many third parties.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:09.440]   So the idea is to strike these deals.
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:11.560]   And they've got deals with big name companies
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:12.520]   according to this report.
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:13.840]   Again, Google isn't talking about it,
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:18.280]   but Macy's and Nordstrom's and big name retailers like that.
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:22.160]   Apparently, there's already something called shoprunner.com,
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:25.080]   which does this with major sites like Newegg, ToysR Us,
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:26.840]   drugstore.com, sports authority.
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:29.880]   So it's not like there aren't alternatives to Amazon Prime
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.960]   where you can get this free shipping,
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:34.760]   but you gotta figure this is gonna be a bigger deal
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:37.840]   and get more pickup right away if Google does it, right?
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:41.360]   - Yeah, and I think it's one more nail
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:43.320]   in the coffin of much of retail.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:46.680]   Not retail's not gonna go away as a whole,
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:48.280]   but I think you're gonna be paying a premium
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:50.040]   to get things immediately and things
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:53.160]   gonna be cheaper to consolidate at a distance.
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:56.680]   And delivery's gonna change and it's gonna be huge.
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:59.600]   - I think the next big move for retail
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:01.760]   is honestly brick and mortar.
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:04.360]   For online retailers, they're going to find
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:05.880]   that they, in some industries anyway,
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:09.200]   they've run so many of these other businesses out
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:10.840]   that they're losing the benefit of people
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.760]   going and picking it up and looking at it, right?
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:16.160]   We were just saying on security now this morning,
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.360]   if you're shopping for an e-reader,
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.160]   go to Best Buy, go to Target, pick it up,
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:22.520]   play with it and figure out which one is best.
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:25.600]   - I think they're gonna have to do find some kind of strategy
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.240]   that bridges that gap eventually.
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:28.960]   - Well, yeah, I've actually been working with somebody
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.960]   who has a strategy in mind.
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:33.200]   They've almost got the huge mall in New Jersey
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:34.640]   and didn't quite get up, but there's another chance.
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.840]   And I think what you see, Tom, is that that's a case
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:39.280]   of touching this marketing.
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:44.360]   - Yeah, yeah, I see with my hands, not with my eyes.
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.080]   In this case, it's a good thing.
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:46.920]   - Yeah.
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:49.160]   - But yeah, I do think it's fascinating
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:52.400]   that Google would move against Amazon
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:55.680]   and they've been trying to do this since the days of Frugal
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:58.000]   to get people to use them as a reference for products
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.920]   and they've never really cracked it.
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.320]   - Yeah, Frugal, wow, that goes back.
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.280]   - Yeah, it does.
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.240]   - I was thinking about, in this article they were saying
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:07.440]   that like three quarters of product searches
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:10.280]   happen on Amazon and not on Google.
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:13.120]   And I was thinking about when I go shopping,
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:15.440]   I go to Amazon and search,
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:19.000]   mostly because when I search for a product on Google,
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.840]   I get a bunch of links to online stores
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:23.240]   that are kind of in all different places
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:24.560]   and have different payment methods
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:28.280]   and I'm not really sure whether or not they're reliable.
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:30.520]   And on Amazon, we're not only doing Amazon Prime,
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:33.480]   but I've been shopping at Amazon for so many years
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:34.760]   and I've had such a good experience with them
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:36.200]   over and over again, that just seems like
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:39.440]   Amazon's the place you go when you wanna buy something.
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:41.040]   And so I think it's interesting
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:43.600]   they're trying to get those product searches back, right?
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:44.960]   They don't like the idea that people are going straight
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:47.720]   to Amazon to search for products.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:50.480]   But of course, it was like the day before Thanksgiving
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:52.760]   and I realized that I needed a new roasting pan.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:54.920]   I didn't have time, I knew exactly the kind I wanted,
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:56.880]   but I didn't have time to order it online
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.200]   and have it shipped to me.
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.360]   And I went to Google and I was like,
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:02.320]   I just want Google to tell me what is the closest store
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:05.120]   near me that has this exact roasting pan that I need
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.480]   because I need it right now.
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:09.720]   And I had trouble finding it.
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:12.560]   So I think there's a lot of room for improvement here in Google.
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:13.880]   I think this is just about Google wanted
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:15.640]   and wanted to get those searches back
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:17.560]   or get those searches at all.
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.480]   Where do you guys go when you have to search for a product?
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:22.000]   Do you do it on Google or do you go to Amazon or somewhere else?
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.600]   I go to Amazon.
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:26.000]   I'd say maybe two or three times out of 10
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   I will use Google product search.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.520]   And it's usually because I tried Amazon
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:30.840]   and I didn't get the answer I wanted.
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:33.000]   Well, right, but when you know you're looking for something
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.640]   that you're ready to buy right now, you go,
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:37.000]   and it's not like something specialized like electronics.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.720]   So you might go to Newegg for that or someplace else.
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:40.040]   You go straight to Amazon first.
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:41.040]   No, it's a good point.
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:44.880]   If there's a trusted retailer that I use normally
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:46.720]   for something, I will go directly to their site
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:48.920]   because I know, oh yeah, that's the place
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:50.600]   that always has the thing I want.
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:51.800]   But yeah, when it's something where I'm like,
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.080]   I don't really know where it is.
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:56.400]   I just want the best price that I will all look on Amazon.
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:57.240]   Yeah.
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:58.240]   Mm-hmm.
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.080]   Ah, yes.
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.920]   Ama, I think that's it.
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:04.200]   I think Amazon is trying to,
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.960]   or I think Google is trying to figure out
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:08.000]   how to get product search back to Google.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.240]   I don't think this is the way either,
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:13.640]   but it's certainly not a bad thing if they can pull it off.
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:18.560]   YouTube launched a brand new front page, December 1st,
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:21.520]   and it's more channel and more social oriented.
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:24.200]   So you'll be able to see things by type.
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.960]   You can kind of pick a channel and go into it.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.560]   It's more of a TV type interface.
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:32.200]   You'll also see what your friends are listening to.
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:35.880]   And I guess it's based on your Google+ circles.
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:39.400]   It shows you just what kind of stuff they're watching
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:41.080]   so you can see more recommendations.
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:42.560]   What do you guys think of this?
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:45.120]   I haven't played with it yet.
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:47.080]   I've looked at it when I saw this stuff on the side.
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:48.240]   It looks kind of pretty.
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:52.720]   I think that YouTube has to try more and more and more
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:55.840]   to become a way that we find entertainment,
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.880]   because I don't usually use it that way.
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:00.040]   You know, I go in when somebody looks me to it,
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:01.640]   or when I go in to search the panel,
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:02.720]   and looking forward to like,
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:04.640]   do I ever go to YouTube and say,
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.720]   I feel like watching some stuff now.
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.400]   Is that just 'cause I'm old?
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:09.240]   No, I don't know.
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:10.080]   Well, I'm old.
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:10.920]   I don't do it either.
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:11.760]   Yeah, maybe we'll.
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:13.000]   But I'm old too, I mean, relatively.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.560]   I mean, I don't think it's even--
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:15.760]   You know, no old.
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:16.880]   I know old.
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:20.800]   We're old enough to not share on YouTube.
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:21.640]   It's true, though.
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.040]   I generally will watch YouTube videos
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.680]   that I find for my friends on Facebook or Twitter.
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:27.960]   So it makes sense that they've integrated social.
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:30.200]   This is a nice redesign, although it surprises me
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.240]   that they're still maintaining YouTube
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:34.640]   as a very separate product from the rest of the products.
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:37.120]   Like, it didn't get the new Google bar,
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.000]   which surprised me.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.600]   It does feel like this kind of island still.
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:44.480]   Like, the YouTube brand is very strong on YouTube still.
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:46.240]   It doesn't look like a Google product.
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:49.440]   I also-- I have trouble with sign-in on YouTube sometimes.
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:51.640]   I think it has to do with the multi-sign-in thing.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:53.440]   I have to sign out of everything, out of my apps account,
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:55.160]   and everything to sign in with my regular account.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:59.360]   But otherwise, I like that they're injecting social in here.
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.000]   And I would like to see more like,
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   if show me all the YouTube videos that my Google+ friends
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.920]   have plus one the most or something like that,
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.440]   that would make it really cool.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.480]   Right now, it's just filled with a lot of a twit.
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:14.360]   And I think it's because I'm subscribed to the Twitter channel.
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:16.920]   Oh, yeah. No, I have a lot of toy break.
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:19.640]   It's a show that I subscribe to on YouTube.
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:22.120]   So of course, it pops up there.
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:23.480]   But yeah.
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.760]   Actually, I do see the T-Mobile YouTube video
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.080]   that Jeff shared on Google+.
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:28.280]   So they do have some--
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:31.800]   That's actually how I saw it because it's commercial there.
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:34.040]   And when I saw the rundown, I went there.
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:36.360]   And that's where I came to it.
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:40.040]   And you can connect Facebook if you want as well.
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.720]   I mean, that somebody-- a couple of people in the chat
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.120]   remember bringing that up.
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:46.240]   It's kind of defaults to Google+ if you're logged in to Google
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.440]   because it's a YouTube property.
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:49.760]   But you can connect it with Facebook Connect
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:53.120]   and see what friends are sharing on there as well.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:56.480]   Does any other Google product connect to Facebook?
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:57.720]   That's a really good question.
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:58.760]   I was just wondering now.
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:10:59.840]   I'll bet that.
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:02.880]   Yeah, I mean, that's pretty unusual.
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:05.400]   Very independent of YouTube.
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:05.920]   Yeah.
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:07.360]   Yeah.
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:08.520]   Notable.
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:11.040]   Jeff, you noticed that Google News is adding qualitative
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.160]   metadata to links.
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.120]   Well, I'm told they've been doing this for a while.
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:15.200]   I just hadn't noticed it.
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:16.560]   So I did a search on something.
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:23.480]   And it says, I think, in-depth blogs,
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:26.080]   but also highly cited, which is really interesting.
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:28.000]   It's an effort for Google News to try
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.080]   to get some measure of authority in there.
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:32.640]   And so an article has been cited a lot.
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:33.840]   They're now going to rise up.
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.600]   And it's specifically labeled that,
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:37.280]   which is really interesting.
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:38.520]   I noticed this the other day, too.
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:39.800]   And I think it's probably something
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:42.040]   that they've started to highlight in a better way,
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.760]   even if they've been doing it for a while.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:45.840]   Because I use Google News all the time as sort of a check
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:48.080]   to see what's buzzy out there.
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.440]   And I love that.
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:53.240]   I love having the ability to say, OK, this is the big story.
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:56.240]   This is the one that everyone's referring to.
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:59.280]   It's a shortcut to having to drill down and say, well,
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:01.680]   who reported it first and where did they get their information?
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:05.080]   So I think that's pretty cool that they're doing that.
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:08.560]   All right, any of these other stories before we move on,
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:11.200]   Chrome's getting closer to Firefox or in front of Firefox,
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:14.480]   depending on what metric you're looking at.
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:16.200]   Gina, what did you think of Glee last night?
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:20.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:21.800]   I enjoyed it.
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:23.000]   I enjoyed it.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.280]   I'm very happy that the team is coming back together
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:27.040]   and without spoiling it for anyone.
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:29.240]   Because I know all of our listeners and viewers
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:31.360]   are on the edge of their seats about Glee.
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:32.760]   Yes, there are.
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:34.480]   The kind of arc of the season, which
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.480]   is that division makes us weaker and being together
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:39.640]   makes us stronger, sort of coming to its end now
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:40.720]   and they're coming back together.
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:42.680]   So I enjoyed it very much.
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:43.760]   They're on the edge of their seats
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.200]   because they're falling down drunk
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.520]   because we've mentioned Glee too much.
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:47.520]   So it's got to be--
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:48.400]   Exactly, exactly, drink.
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:51.880]   They were parched to this episode.
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:55.120]   They needed to wet their whistle.
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:58.000]   Do you want us to play this T-Mobile commercial that you say is--
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.480]   No, I just--
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:01.200]   No, I thought it was actually a nice commercial.
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.000]   That's all in the comments.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:03.520]   But--
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:05.320]   Dancing Pink Singers.
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:05.920]   Well, that's OK.
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:08.080]   And then it ends with Carly, which is nice.
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:09.080]   Who's the T-Mobile girl?
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:09.680]   Yeah.
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:10.440]   We talked about it.
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:14.080]   I'm going to look like a dirty old man saying that.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.960]   All right, well, let's move on to Jeta's tip then.
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.360]   What do you got for us this week, Jeta?
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:21.560]   Google is a graphical math calculator now.
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:24.360]   I mean, for years, you could enter math equations
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:25.440]   into Google and get an answer.
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:28.440]   If you enter 2 plus 2, Google will answer 4.
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:31.160]   But just this week, they launched the ability
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:33.960]   to graph really complex mathematical formulas.
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:37.280]   So if you type in sine x, Google
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.560]   will show you this beautiful sine curve
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:40.760]   right within your results.
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:42.840]   Oh, I would have died for this during trig.
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:44.600]   Yeah, no, seriously, right?
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:46.400]   So you don't have to go to Wolfram Alpha
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:48.760]   for this kind of thing, which is kind of neat.
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:53.120]   The other quick tip, Google+ supports phone calls as well.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:55.520]   If you go to a Google+ Hangout with extras,
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:58.000]   you can have people call into the Hangout.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.880]   So I actually haven't tried that one myself.
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:03.400]   But neat to see Hangouts adding little features
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:04.520]   in their extras.
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:06.720]   Yeah, I've started an experiment.
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:08.320]   I do a podcast called East Meets West
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:11.800]   that's really just an experimental podcast to try stuff out.
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:13.040]   I do it with Roger Chang.
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:15.040]   And we've started because we don't
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:18.360]   want to have to spend time booking people for the show.
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.280]   We want it to be a kind of self-directing.
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:22.240]   Because we just sort of do it on a whim.
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:24.440]   So we don't want to have to schedule it.
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:27.120]   And we've started taking to using Google Hangout
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:28.200]   as our guest booking.
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:30.840]   So we just start doing the show on a Hangout.
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:33.360]   And then we have a limited circle right now
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:34.360]   to test this idea out.
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:35.920]   But anybody who's in the circle who
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:37.600]   sees that we're recording the show
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:38.480]   can then join the show.
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:40.920]   We actually had Darren Kitchen tell us
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:42.640]   that he was buying a sandwich at the grocery store
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:44.920]   during the last episode.
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:45.920]   That's cool.
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:50.480]   So far, not hard-hitting contributions.
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:51.320]   But--
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.160]   I think that's really cool.
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.280]   I love that love this spontaneity.
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:54.160]   It's a really good idea.
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.800]   I mean, I think Hangouts really kind of gives you the opportunity
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:59.760]   to do that kind of thing where people just sort of stop
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.560]   and I'm with the digital color.
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:03.880]   That's how do you make it public?
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:05.760]   Is that easy now?
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:07.600]   Well, yeah, you can just hit public.
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.520]   You could make it public if I want to,
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:11.080]   but just choosing the public option.
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:12.840]   And then it just goes public.
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:13.440]   No, no, no.
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:16.680]   I mean, how can people not in the circle on the outside
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:19.200]   watch the Hangout?
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:21.520]   There's a broadcast option now.
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:25.600]   There is that is now distributed, OK?
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:26.800]   Yeah, we haven't used it myself.
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:27.400]   I don't know.
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:29.320]   Are you recording?
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:31.120]   He's meets West, Tom.
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:33.200]   And then distributing later, right?
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:34.680]   But so you just-- when you're recording,
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:37.720]   you make the Hangout available to a limited circle.
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:39.400]   And then people can hop in if they want.
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:40.440]   I see what you mean.
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:42.200]   But I think you actually can--
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.760]   I might be wrong, but I think that you
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:45.600]   can invite certain people in to join the Hangout
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:47.480]   and then broadcast it so people can watch.
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:49.160]   And the public can watch, but only certain people can go.
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:50.000]   No, I think you're right.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000]   We just aren't doing that.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.880]   But the reason I'm bringing it up is I'd like this idea of being
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:57.040]   able to phone someone in who's not on Google Plus, that we
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:59.440]   decide like, oh, hey, this person's around.
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:01.600]   Let's do the Hangout thing so we get the serendipity.
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.320]   But we can also just phone somebody in,
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:06.200]   because it's an audio-only podcast.
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:08.440]   Yeah, that's really cool.
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:10.000]   All right, Jeff, your number, sir.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.840]   All right, don't do this one.
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:20.200]   255 out of 358, the Indian government in Google's transparency
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:25.640]   report for the, I think, quarter asked for 358 take-down
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:26.600]   requests.
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:30.120]   But 255 are the more because of criticism of the government,
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:31.160]   which should freak us out.
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:33.080]   And in a related story, I have one from the Guardian.
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.400]   It was also reported in The New York Times
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:39.240]   that Google met with four services, including Facebook.
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:41.400]   I mean, sorry, the Indian government met with four services,
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:44.800]   including Facebook and Google, saying that they should self-sensor
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:48.720]   the users and take out offensive things of every user, which,
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:49.840]   of course, is freaky.
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:52.080]   And when did India become China?
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:55.160]   And these are the things we have to keep our eyes out on,
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:57.240]   folks, protect the net.
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:01.560]   I feel like it is a sign of the growth of the internet,
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:04.000]   that the rich and powerful have started
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.720]   to recognize that people use it.
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:10.800]   And they don't have control of how people use it.
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:13.880]   And so we're going to continue to see this for a long time.
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:16.680]   Different sectors, governments, corporations,
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:17.760]   we've been seeing it.
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:19.640]   But this sort of idea of, like, wait a minute,
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:21.520]   you could say whatever you want over there?
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:24.960]   Oh, well, that can't be allowed.
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:29.040]   It is disappointing to see the world's largest democracy try
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:30.000]   this sort of thing.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.040]   But the United States is not innocent of this sort of thing,
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:35.720]   with SOPA and protect IP.
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:36.560]   And those are--
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:37.240]   Exactly.
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:40.720]   Yeah, those are other moves of the same sort.
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:41.880]   Yeah, I just came back from--
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:44.520]   I was in Paris last week for a emotional event.
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:45.960]   I was in Berlin in Paris last week,
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:48.440]   because you knew I had my horrible phone connection there
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:49.800]   in Berlin.
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:51.680]   But in Paris, I was making fun of Sarcos
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:53.160]   for all the various reasons.
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:57.520]   But we got SOPA too, where it's hardly immune.
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:00.000]   I think the Swiss are probably the best so far,
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.320]   because they were the ones that had a recent study saying,
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:02.680]   you know what?
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:04.280]   We don't see any reason to change the law
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:06.600]   that it's OK to download copyrighted material
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:09.320]   for your personal use.
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:12.040]   They said another reason to move to Switzerland.
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:13.800]   They determined that the people who
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:17.680]   did download free copyrighted material for personal use
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:20.320]   actually ended up spending more on entertainment than others.
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:20.880]   Oh, my God.
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:23.480]   That's how refreshing enlightenment.
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:24.640]   I know.
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:26.040]   It won't ever happen anywhere else.
[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:28.240]   But we can dream.
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:30.520]   All right, Leo's not here, but I've got sort of a tool.
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:34.000]   Since I'm filling in, I'm going to take the opportunity
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.720]   to give you sort of a useless tool.
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:40.520]   The Android phone name generator at AndroidphoneNameGenerator.com.
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:41.920]   I just saw this today on TechCrunch.
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:42.280]   I don't know.
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:43.840]   It may have been around for a while.
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:46.000]   But you just press the button, and it gives you
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.480]   a potential Android phone name, like the Motorola Bionic Plus,
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:55.440]   or the LG DefiEpic E1Z.
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:56.320]   This is great.
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:58.680]   The HTC Charge Vivid S2.
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:03.280]   The HTC Galaxy Epic 4G One Plus.
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:08.440]   You know, I have a feeling that people
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:11.880]   may actually be using this to name their phones out there.
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:17.720]   I have the Samsung Nitro Plus X24G Plus Z.
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:20.280]   The Acer Mesmerize.
[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:21.760]   That's great.
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:25.600]   The HTC Atrix Slide E3D.
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:30.160]   Oh, I got the HTC Wildfire Slide E4G Plus Plus.
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:31.080]   OK.
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:32.800]   Hours of endless fun folks.
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:33.280]   It is.
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:36.280]   AndroidphoneNameGenerator.com.
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:39.000]   You know, this is kind of a take on an old internet meme
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:39.680]   of the generator.
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:40.840]   But I was--
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:41.600]   Totally.
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:42.600]   I was fun.
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:43.100]   Yeah.
[01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:45.760]   I clearly even need to use those starting future episodes
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:47.440]   while we're talking about ANSATs.
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:50.720]   I'll be like, well, that Acer Wildfire Incredible G12.
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:52.280]   Yeah, that looks really good.
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:54.640]   You know, when the Samsung Wildfire Epic Prime comes out,
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:56.640]   I think we'll all realize.
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:00.360]   The LG Micsut Black E1G2 is going to be the one I get.
[01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:01.680]   Here's a challenge, Tom.
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:07.000]   Can you take any random name and then blog and G Plus about it
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.560]   and see if you can get somebody to pick it up
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:11.320]   as if it's a rumor?
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:14.680]   You know, I just saw a screenshot of an inventory
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:17.720]   with the Sony Ericsson Xperia Incredible 2G2 listed
[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:18.920]   as coming out in January.
[01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:19.520]   There you go.
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:20.640]   There you go.
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:21.140]   Yeah.
[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:22.800]   In distinguishable from news.
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:24.160]   Clip that out.
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:26.360]   Post it to YouTube.
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:29.200]   I heard it on Twig.
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.200]   All right.
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:31.920]   That's it for this episode of This Week in Google.
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:33.720]   Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:35.720]   Gina and Jeff, a pleasure, as always.
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:36.240]   I really enjoy it.
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:37.200]   You're a great show, Tom.
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:37.880]   Good work.
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:38.720]   Yeah, great show.
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:39.280]   Thank you, Will.
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:40.080]   Thank you very much.
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:42.760]   Find Gina at smarterware.org.
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:45.160]   Think up is the big product.
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:45.880]   I'm using it.
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:46.880]   I love it.
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:49.680]   So check it out, because it's 1.0 now, right?
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.000]   Yeah, 1.0, 1.0.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.440]   Think up app.com.
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:53.040]   Think up app.
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:53.840]   I'm so glad you're using it.
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:56.320]   No reason not to check it out.
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.240]   If you want some good analytics and Jeff Jarvis,
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:02.000]   Buzzmachine.com, great talking to you as well.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.440]   Anything nifty going on these days?
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:06.360]   No, just buy my book, Public Parts.
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:08.480]   It's coming out in French soon?
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:10.720]   Yeah, it's not this week in French.
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:13.160]   The title-- I forget that I don't have the title of the French
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:16.520]   from you, but it translates to naked on the web.
[01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:17.200]   All right.
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:17.720]   Awesome.
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:18.920]   And in French.
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:20.160]   Come on.
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:22.200]   All right, thanks, everybody, for watching or listening.
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:25.560]   I believe Leola Porte will be back next week.
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:28.960]   Until then, until I'm here, see you next time.
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:32.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:35.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:38.260]   (upbeat music)
[01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:40.840]   (upbeat music)
