[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.200]   Leo's off today.
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.920]   I'm Mike Elgin, Twitt's News Director.
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.320]   Jeff and Gina are here, and we'll be
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.280]   talking about the future of Google, the future of privacy,
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.320]   and we'll talk about the growing power of Google
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.280]   and the other big tech companies as well,
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.000]   and just what should be done about it, if anything.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.960]   Other than a more coming up right now on Twig.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.880]   Netcast, you love.
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.240]   From people you trust.

[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160]   It's time for Twig this week in Google,
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.480]   the show where we talk about Google and the cloud.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.560]   Leo's on vacation.
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.680]   I'm Twitt's News Director, Mike Elgin, filling in for Leo
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.120]   this week.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.840]   And we have the usual cast of characters, Jeff Jarvis,
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.800]   the professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.200]   And he's coming in from the said City University of New York,
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.480]   right?
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.080]   That's your office.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.560]   Are you calling me a character?
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.960]   Yes.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.600]   Hey.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.880]   And this is a very character building show.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.320]   So I don't blame you.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.360]   Jeff is the author of Public Parts.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.160]   What would Google do?
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.560]   And Gutenberg, The Geek, three very awesome books,
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.320]   which I loved reading.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.240]   And he blogs at buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.600]   And everyone should go and read that blog all the time
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.680]   because it's really great.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.800]   And also Gina Trapani, the creator of ThinkUp.com,
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.960]   host of Twitts, all about Android, and founding editor
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.600]   of Life Hacker and Gina Life Hacker.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.240]   You had an interesting inspiration for that named in you.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.840]   I did.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.280]   I did.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.080]   This guy named Danny came up with this phrase called Life Hacks.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.480]   And he did a talk back in 2004.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.840]   And we just loved the idea.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.200]   And we launched a site based on it.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.840]   So I kind of owe him a big part of my career.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.680]   Daniel Bryan.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.320]   And in related news, we have Daniel Bryan.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.320]   On the show today, I hear to talk about a really interesting
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.800]   article he wrote this week.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.440]   Thank you so much for joining us, Danny.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.480]   No problem at all.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.280]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.760]   I'm compressing beautifully here.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.760]   But this is what I look like in real life.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.400]   We like that hostage video kind of vibe on the show.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.240]   I know exactly.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.280]   I should hold up.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.880]   I like that.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.480]   In newspaper that you can't actually make the date out on.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.680]   Well, anybody who watches this and doesn't want to remember it,
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.800]   you have the right to forget it.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.160]   And that's our topic today.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.560]   We want to bring you on because you wrote an article, Danny,
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.160]   called "Rights That Are Being Forgotten--
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.800]   A Play on the European Union's Right to Be Forgotten
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.120]   Ruling."
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.480]   And you and Jillian, New York, wrote this really interesting
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.920]   piece that talked about some of the other things that
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.480]   are being sacrificed in the quest for privacy in Europe
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.760]   under this ruling.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.600]   And we'd like to talk about it with you for a few minutes,
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.960]   if you like.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.880]   Now, it's your day off.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.280]   And I appreciate you coming on today
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.040]   and joining us on your day off.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.520]   It's totally fine.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.600]   I like talking about this sort of stuff on my day off.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.200]   It's all well.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.520]   So we wrote the piece because I think
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.960]   this is one of those examples where
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.440]   there are considerations about privacy and considerations
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.200]   about free speech and sometimes laid
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.760]   butt against one another.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.120]   And I have concerned with the way
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.400]   that the rights have forgotten has been interpreted
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.200]   in the CCJ decision.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.440]   And by Google-- because I think Google's
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.840]   had a lot of leeway in how it might implement this stuff--
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.480]   has meant that the right of free expression
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.880]   has been kind of missed.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.280]   And I think that's going to become a bigger problem
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.400]   as more and more companies feel they have to adopt protocols
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.360]   to take into account this decision.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.680]   Now, you talked about three victims of this ruling.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.640]   And I'd like to go through them if you don't mind.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.120]   The first one was that the first victim you said of this ruling
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.520]   is Google's implementation of the ECJs, the European Court
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.480]   of Justice's decision, which is transparency under censorship.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.480]   What did you mean by that?
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.360]   How is transparency under censorship being victimized here?
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.360]   So let's go back a million or so years to 2001.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.360]   And Google, in its early idealistic phases,
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.040]   was bumping into some of the--
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.920]   its first challenges as a big search engine.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.920]   And that was people in the US coming along and demanding
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.200]   that content be taken down, or in particular,
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.160]   links be taken down.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.560]   And one of the most controversial of those cases
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.160]   was the Church of Scientology, which up until then,
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.000]   had already attracted quite a reputation on the internet
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.040]   as being an organization big enough and concerned
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.400]   enough to demand that content be removed.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.840]   So Google was trying to work out how
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.680]   to deal with these takedowns.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.360]   And it set what I thought was an interesting precedent
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.160]   for big companies.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.960]   In that Google took down the content
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.400]   because they were legally obliged to do so in the United States.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.400]   But they put a little message at the bottom saying,
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.160]   you've typed in this search term,
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.400]   and we've had to remove some of the results.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.040]   And click here to find out more.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.240]   And you click there, and you went to Chilling Effects,
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:58.960]   a great site that EFF supports, that actually lists
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.560]   the court orders and the DMCA takedown requests
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.760]   that led to this removal.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:09.360]   So you could get an idea of why things were being censored,
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.560]   who was doing it, and what the extent was.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.120]   Something was missing, but you knew it was missing.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.240]   The Google has done a similar thing
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.880]   with the implementation of this European Court of Justice
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.360]   requirement.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.120]   But they've skipped on this.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.560]   Actually, what they do is they put that notice
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.720]   at the bottom of search results in Europe.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.880]   But they put it for everything that looks like a name.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.440]   So if you typed Danny O'Brien into Google.co.uk,
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.640]   there will be a little message saying, oh, something
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.720]   might have been removed from this search.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.160]   And in fact, that's not the case.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.040]   I mean, I haven't put a request, neither of the 1,500
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.720]   other Danny O'Brien's in the world.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.280]   It's just that Google has placed that in every single name
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:55.920]   request.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.040]   So as Donald Rumsfeld would say, it used to be a known unknown.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.320]   And now it's an unknown unknown.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.000]   And that's a real problem.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.080]   Now, if you're just joining us, we're
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.760]   talking with Danny O'Brien, who's
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.640]   a technology journalist and civil liberties activist.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.920]   He's also the international director
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.640]   of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.800]   Why do you suppose Google is doing that?
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.080]   Is it because they want to get more publicity for the fact
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.800]   that they're being forced to do this?
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.720]   Or is it just hard to do a warning
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.680]   for the specific search results?
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.000]   Or do they just want to not antagonize the European authorities?
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.640]   Well, so this has been the subject of a lot of press
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.760]   interest in that there's been an open question
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.040]   where the Google is implementing this.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.440]   Some people have said in sort of a deliberately clumsy way
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.520]   in order to increase opposition to it.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.440]   Or alternatively, they're implementing it
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.960]   in the only way that they know how.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.760]   And the ruling is as bad as that, and there's nothing they
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.480]   can do about it.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:05.000]   I don't have any particular insight into which one this plays
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:05.280]   out.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.360]   I mean, I don't see Google as being
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.560]   pure as the driven snow in a lot of these cases.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.480]   They have their own motivations.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.560]   And as working at the EFF, one thing I know
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.840]   is if you have your civil liberties
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.200]   decided by a big fight between the courts
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.200]   and a large corporation, it's really not your civil liberties
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.240]   that are being decided.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.960]   It's what's being decided is the intent
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.600]   and motives of these companies.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.920]   Personally, and I don't know if you agree, Jeff and Gina,
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.800]   but I would love to see those big black bars as if somebody
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.120]   came in there with a Sharpie or something like that.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.920]   And just so it'd be super obvious and really just
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.640]   mar the appearance of the entire circle.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.640]   So of course, the problem with that
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.520]   is that-- and Danny, I agree with you on this.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.520]   I've spoken about this on the show.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.160]   And in fact, when I wrote my book "Public Parts"
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.320]   a couple of years ago, I attacked this whole notion
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.000]   started by Vivian Redding of the European Commission
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.560]   of this right to be forgotten and have raised a flag about the
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.880]   danger to speech that this raises.
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.200]   And now it's only proving to be the case.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.440]   And last week, we talked about Guardian and BBC's stories
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.200]   being taken down.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.840]   And then since then, they went back up.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.840]   I don't think Google is being cynical in this,
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.560]   but Google is absolutely stuck with a terrible ruling
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.920]   where there's no good way to do this.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.120]   The irony of it is that many Europeans don't want Google
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.040]   to have more power.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.880]   And the court only gave Google more power.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:32.040]   And more power Google doesn't want in this case.
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.160]   But the stress end effect.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.520]   The irony of this is that if they said specifically,
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.400]   this is exactly what we took down, then of course,
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.720]   they're going to get taken to court
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.880]   saying, well, you've just countervanted the point
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.000]   of the ruling and pointed to what was taken down.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.800]   Well, Google's are no win situation here.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.360]   I mean, there's a lot of mind reading going on here.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:01.080]   Like Google says that it's trying to anticipate objections
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:05.360]   like that and build a system that works that way.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.800]   Well, if you're in a situation where you're
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.920]   having to mind read that the courts-- the best thing to do
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.520]   is actually go to the courts and find out.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:20.760]   And there are 29 data protection authorities in the EU.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.720]   And we're in this curious position
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.840]   where Google has jumped in and started implementing this
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.960]   before the authorities--
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.800]   Well, not in this group, Danny.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.440]   This was an unappelable decision.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.840]   It was a final decision by the highest court.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.080]   And Google had really no choice but to get going.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.880]   There's no appeal back to lower authorities separately.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.640]   The court said, this is a decision.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.320]   That's it.
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.480]   There is no appeal.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.320]   There is no choice.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.120]   You have to do this.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.760]   The only appeal that's going to come now
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:49.960]   is through legislators.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.800]   And we have the Justice Minister of the UK saying today
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.800]   that there is no right to be forgotten.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.000]   And I think we're going to see this
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.280]   fought out at different levels.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.440]   But Google-- I disagree.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.720]   Google was stuck with having to go and pour something.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.200]   And you're also said in your piece
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.240]   that being as the alternative.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.560]   As far as I understand the ruling,
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.040]   this was not specific to Google.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.760]   This is Bing, En-Yahoo, and other search engines
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.920]   that they've got to deal with the same thing.
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.080]   Google is just the first doing it.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.480]   Well, I was going to say I don't want
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.000]   to get into like dealing EU scholarship.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:18.680]   But why not?
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.640]   Let's do it.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.960]   So it is true that this is a court of last appeals, as it were.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.040]   However, it doesn't quite work in the same way
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.520]   as the Supreme Court in the United States.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.600]   What's happening here is that a lower court has gone up
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.720]   to the European Court of Justice
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.880]   and asked it a bunch of questions.
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.720]   And the European Court of Justice
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.080]   has given an answer to those questions.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.040]   Now, everything else begins to sort of roll out.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.040]   That court-- the lower court will make a decision based
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.240]   on that answer.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.600]   And data protection authorities and search engines
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.120]   like Google and like Bing will work out
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.840]   how to implement that.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:02.200]   But it's not just a crack of lightning and everything changes.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.320]   And my concern is really that I actually
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.440]   want to hold the data protection authorities to account.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.200]   Because one of the things that we're profoundly worried about
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.960]   is that the entire regulatory space here
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.400]   is all about protecting privacy, which
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:23.000]   means that publishers like the Guardian, like the BBC,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.440]   don't really have an obvious way of appealing this
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.200]   without going and begging Google to put this back.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:30.760]   And as you said--
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.280]   Well, in fact, there was no requirement
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.800]   that Google had to even notify them.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.720]   I was delighted that Google notified the Guardian
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.480]   and the BBC of this.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.800]   And yes, some may say that was a cynical act to get the PR.
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.320]   Whatever.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.840]   Among the 70,000 takedown requests that were there,
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.880]   there was one four or five for the Guardian, one for the BBC.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.440]   And they got notified, which means
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.240]   that they then did have the appeal
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.000]   of going to Google in the court of public opinion.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.320]   And Google did change.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.000]   We didn't even know how that was going to work out
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.080]   whether Google was going to notify anyone
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.560]   that their free speech rights had just been affected
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.680]   by this ficocketer ruling.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.160]   And Danny O'Brien, that was your second victim, which
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.320]   is the victim of the implementation of fairness.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.400]   And you said that Google, in fact,
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.240]   did go to the people with, as you said,
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.880]   as a bully pulpit at the press, essentially, which
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.280]   raises the question, yes, the press could sort of get
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.800]   Google to make a change.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:27.440]   But can people who don't buy digital ink by the barrel
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.000]   do that?
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.120]   Is it fair that the press has one set of rules
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.960]   and that the little people have a different set?
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.760]   And that was one of your points.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.160]   So it's interesting, the nitty gritty of this particular case.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.560]   So one thing-- and I cut the paragraph out of RSA
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.800]   just because it was getting huge--
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.840]   is that, in fact, the way that Google notifies people
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.120]   and Jeff's absolutely right.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.320]   It's great that they're doing this,
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.360]   and they didn't have to do this--
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.120]   is through their Google Webmaster Tools system.
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.760]   So basically, if you use Google Analytics
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.400]   and you sign up to their service,
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:06.240]   you now get a little message when Google is removing links
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:10.520]   because of a privacy takedown request.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.600]   This is weird in that it now means
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.240]   that you have to sign up to a Google service in order
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.480]   to find out whether your content is being removed.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.480]   But the other part of this is that, what
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.120]   is the appeal process here?
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.600]   It turns out that when Google put back some news items,
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.040]   it actually put back, I think, one news item that
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.840]   was due to them making a mistake.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.720]   So it's not actually a sort of legal challenge
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.240]   that we're seeing here.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.240]   It's just Google, as will inevitably be the case,
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.400]   making an error in its internal system.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.600]   I mean, we deal with terrible problems
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.560]   with the DMCA copyright takedowns and in Google's
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.640]   and other companies implementation
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.200]   of their legal requirements under that.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:02.800]   And at least the DMCA system has a legal method
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.960]   for someone to appeal this decision.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:05.480]   I'm right now--
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.440]   Let me ask you about that.
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.280]   Let me ask you about that.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.320]   Because in a way, I was happy, but unhappy
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.960]   that Google turned around and put something out
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.840]   as backup for whatever reason.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.320]   Because what I would like to see happen
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.360]   is for the likes of the Guardian and the BBC,
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:22.480]   to bring their own free speech, complaints, suits,
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.040]   that their rights have been impinged by this.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.360]   And then we fight that out in that case.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.200]   I don't know enough about European law and the structure
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.000]   and how that goes there.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.160]   So I will concede defeat on any EU scholarship immediately
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.480]   to you.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:40.440]   But how could you imagine a case going for whether it's
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.360]   the Guardian or whether it's Blogger Joe Schmo,
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:51.440]   or being able to then have a complaint of their civil rights
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.440]   being violated?
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:55.160]   And how would they bring that?
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.120]   So what potentially could happen
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.360]   is they were actually in the middle of reforming
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.640]   the data protection laws in Europe.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.560]   And it's at a fairly late stage.
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.360]   So conceivably, they could add something to that, which
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:13.080]   would add a sort of right to appeal.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:17.560]   But we're in, as everyone said, incredibly uncharted
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.080]   territory is here, because there's never really
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.360]   been this face-off between privacy and free speech
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.720]   within the data protection system like this.
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.480]   And just very quickly, it didn't have to be this way.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.320]   The advocate general, who's sort of the research wing,
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.240]   as it were, of the European Court of Justice,
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:43.760]   published his report before the final decision,
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.000]   and said what actually I think everybody, including Google,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.400]   thought this decision was going to play out, which
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:55.160]   is the court saying that Google can't wriggle out
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.600]   of data protection requirements in Europe.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:03.400]   But a free expression, right, trumps the requirement
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.600]   to sort of delete this data from the survey index.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.360]   Indeed, Danny, I think you're right.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:12.440]   I was brought to speak for travel, not for pay,
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.760]   to Google's privacy all hands in Mountain View,
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.080]   about a day and a half after this decision came out.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.760]   And as I said on the show previously, they were gobsmacked.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.920]   They did not expect this to come.
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.440]   But my European friends, when I was in Berlin a few weeks
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.560]   later, said, oh, well, they should have expected this to come.
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.880]   I know what I think everybody expected.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.800]   And again, I've been speaking to people,
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:40.600]   is that Google had somewhat aggressively challenged
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:45.520]   the idea that they were susceptible to any European data
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.520]   protection requirements.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.040]   Because they said that Google Search Index is done
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.200]   out of Mountain View, and then Google Spain,
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.960]   the department just deals with ads.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.200]   And I don't think that was ever going to fly.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.120]   And I think what happened is they aggressively said
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.920]   that in the courts, and when this decision came down,
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.720]   a lot of people were so happy about Google actually
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.680]   being obliged to comply with European law,
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.680]   that they didn't realize this really counterintuitive decision
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.680]   that the ECJ had sub-packed on the end.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.200]   Now, yeah.
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:27.160]   So now, Danny O'Brien, your third victim in your article
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.880]   and final victim was Europe's privacy a lot.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.640]   So if you pointed out that-- and you
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.920]   made a really interesting argument about censorship
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.840]   and that any small step down the road of censorship
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.840]   causes information to essentially route around
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.480]   that censorship, forcing those who
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.800]   want to censor information to have ever more repressive forms
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.720]   of censorship, and then you go down
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:50.440]   into the wormhole of totalitarian dictatorship
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.280]   or something like that.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.400]   But this is clearly a step towards censorship.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.200]   And that's the part of this that to me came kind of out
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.960]   of nowhere that Europe would not only take a big step--
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.040]   what I think is a big step toward censorship,
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.640]   did it in such a clumsy way, did it
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.960]   in a way that seemed to be an available way.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.320]   You can't just-- it would have been
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.880]   an entirely different proposition for them
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.680]   to go and have the articles removed
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.280]   from the Guardian website, for example.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.800]   And so this was the kind of a weasily way, in my opinion,
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.960]   a kind of a weasily way for them to get a similar effect.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.800]   But as you point out, it's a step toward a censorship
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.280]   in an otherwise generally free society.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.920]   What's next, do you think?
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.520]   Well, the reason why we said that
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.920]   was because I'm really used to speaking to governments
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:45.080]   who have, in their eyes, a perfectly reasonable reason
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.760]   to try and censor and block content online.
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:51.240]   I mean, when we deal with, as we often do at the EFF,
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.480]   with the copyright industry, they'll
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.560]   say, you know, that we have an whole industry hanging
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.720]   on this, piracy is rampant.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.480]   And therefore, we need to use this censorship tool
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:07.720]   to prevent our industry's collapsing.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.160]   Same thing when I talk to the Thai government.
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.440]   And they say, you know, we're in an environment
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:17.120]   where the country is being driven by civil unrest.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.320]   We have to block and censor political speech.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.560]   And the same thing's happening here.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.160]   And all you can say in all of these cases is, look,
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.040]   this isn't going to work.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.760]   And when you discover that it isn't going to work,
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.880]   you're going to double down, right?
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.280]   And this is what we saw with the copyright industry.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.640]   And this is what we see in any country that
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.360]   tries to control what its people see.
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.520]   And the problem with that is, is you end up
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.400]   with this ridiculous situation where
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.800]   you have incredible fines changing
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.640]   the entire internet infrastructure
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.440]   to comply with censorship requirements.
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.840]   And it still doesn't work.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.760]   Essentially everything that's being
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.800]   removed from Google's index is still out there.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:08.560]   And any other person who knows how to put together a script
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.480]   could write you a program that would find it.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.080]   And in fact, of course, we've just
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:17.800]   highlighted what is seen as being valuable content
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.920]   by doing that.
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.280]   So it's not going away.
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.200]   And you can't half censor.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.640]   Half censoring is being half pregnant.
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.080]   It just doesn't work.
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.960]   And then we just go down this slippery slope.
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:31.280]   All right.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.720]   Well, Daniel Bryan is a technology journalist and civil liberties
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.480]   activist at the EFF and also the international director of said
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.240]   EFF.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.160]   Thank you so much for coming on this week in Google
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.360]   and telling us and discussing your article with us.
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:45.880]   Thanks, Danny.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:46.520]   Keep on beating the number.
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.520]   Thank you, Brian.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.760]   Thank you, Danny.
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:49.200]   All right, man.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.720]   And Danny, don't send any cease and desist letters
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:55.200]   to Gina about Life Hacker, OK?
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.760]   It's like the last guy on Earth.
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.360]   Yeah, the last person who could do that sounds good.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.020]   Exactly.
[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.520]   Yes, Gina.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.120]   Thanks, Danny.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:05.880]   You're the best.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.520]   Thanks again, Danny.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.360]   Well, and just as Zach, we're going to talk about more instances.
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.120]   I think the theme of the show is probably
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.240]   going to be the overwhelming and growing power of companies
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.320]   like Google and other technology giants, especially
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.120]   cloud-based giants.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.360]   And we're going to talk about that in a sec.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.120]   But first, I want to tell you about our sponsor today,
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.840]   which is Nature Box.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.240]   I have a box of nature right here.
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:31.400]   And the Nature Box is an awesome subscription healthy snack
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.520]   service that is fantastic for a whole bunch of ways.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.320]   And it's a kind of a googly business model.
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:39.200]   And I'll tell you why in just a sec.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.440]   But first, I want to tell you about some of these snacks
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.480]   that they have.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.680]   I was eating this before the show.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.160]   And we couldn't start the show until I finished chewing.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.800]   It's really delicious stuff.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.880]   Basically, Nature Box snacks have zero trans fats,
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.520]   zero high fructose corn syrup.
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.560]   Leo says fructose.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.040]   I say fructose.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:55.560]   Doesn't matter.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.560]   They're zero.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.040]   They're all right.
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:57.040]   All right.
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.160]   OK, good.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.760]   You tell Leo that when next time when he's back from vacation,
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.440]   fructose is here for fructose.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.520]   And also nothing artificial.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.680]   If you're going to snack on something healthy,
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.520]   one of the reasons people eat unhealthy snacks
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.280]   is they shop at the store when they're hungry.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.240]   And then when you're hungry, you see potato chips
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.000]   and all this other stuff.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.560]   And you buy junk food, and then it's in the house.
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.480]   And then you get hungry, and then you eat junk.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.200]   With Nature Box, they'll always make sure you have healthy snacks.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.560]   Very convenient right there in your house.
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.560]   What they do is they send great tasting snacks right
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.800]   to your door with free shipping anywhere in the United States.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.160]   You just go to the site and click on the continue button
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.760]   to choose between three subscription options,
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.960]   then place your order.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.920]   Once you're a member-- yeah, this is a membership snack service.
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.000]   You can select which snacks you'd like in your monthly box.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.640]   Now, this is the googly part of all this.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.160]   Google has a tendency to be very experimental.
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.400]   They throw all kinds of stuff against the wall to see what sticks.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.000]   They throw lots of products out there.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.280]   And the ones that don't really work, they pull back.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.560]   The ones that do work, they build into gigantic services
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.160]   like Gmail and these other things.
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.760]   And that's what Nature Box does as well.
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.040]   You can keep trying different services.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.000]   The ones you like, you can go on the website and say,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.360]   I want to keep getting those, but keep surprising me
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.440]   with new ones.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.360]   They have more than 100 delicious, healthy choices
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.200]   that you can choose from.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.480]   And you can also select by dietary needs.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.040]   So if you're a vegan--
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.840]   if you don't want soy, if you're gluten conscience,
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:22.240]   if you're lactose intolerant, you don't want nuts.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.840]   You have nut allergy or something like that.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.440]   And you can also choose non-GMO.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.560]   Whatever it is, you can just simply select that on the website.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.800]   And they'll only show you the products that suit
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.160]   your dietary needs.
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.760]   You can also select by taste--
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.400]   savory, sweet, or spicy.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.080]   I love them all.
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.880]   But your mileage may vary.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.840]   So the next time you get cranky and hungry and are ready to eat anything,
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.280]   don't eat anything.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.280]   Eat nature box snacks.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:50.640]   They have guilt-free snacks like coconut date energy bites,
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.920]   Santa Fe corn sticks, pear, praline, crunch.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:53.760]   I haven't tried that one.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.760]   I'm going to have to try that one.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:55.640]   That sounds good.
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:57.920]   We've got them around the office here all the time.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.040]   And people talk about this as like, maybe I can get this for myself.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.800]   I can get a subscription for myself.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.280]   If you've got a kid in college, this
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:07.080]   is a great option to make sure that they get healthy snacks that
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.280]   just keep on coming.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:12.360]   And I know a lot of Silicon Valley startups that use nature box,
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.200]   because otherwise, somebody has to go to Costco
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.840]   and buy a bunch of junk food.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.760]   This way, it just comes to the office, and it's office snacks for everybody.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.000]   And again, they are healthy.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.800]   And so you don't have this ever-growing, unhealthy staff.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:29.600]   So to get 50% off your first box, go to naturebox.com/twit.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:34.080]   Stay full, stay strong, go to naturebox.com/twit.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:39.120]   And we thank nature box for their support of this week in Google.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:43.120]   And let me thank-- let me thank Twit for having sent us boxes of this stuff.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.200]   My favorite so far from what I got are the kettle kernels.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.840]   I've gone through them all through the peppery pistachio.
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.080]   And dried pineapple.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.760]   Those are the-- die for.
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.600]   I got a lot of points when that box arrived at our house.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.960]   I was like, oh, yeah.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:00.520]   All right.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.280]   All that time you've been talking to your computer,
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.640]   worth it, because we got these snacks.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.800]   Unbelievable.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:06.320]   Look at this one.
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.840]   Sweet blueberry almonds.
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:08.480]   Blueberry almonds.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.840]   Oh, we even heard of that before.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:10.960]   That looked fantastic.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:11.440]   Yeah, good.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.920]   Do I have to give these back?
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:13.920]   Can I keep this whole box?
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:14.920]   OK.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:15.760]   What else is in there?
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:16.520]   Is there anything else in there?
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.280]   Yeah, let's see.
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.280]   Let's see here.
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.680]   We have roasted garlic pumpkin seeds.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.680]   Oh.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.800]   Oh, I do that.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:24.800]   Cranberry almond bites.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.720]   These are basically-- this is like-- yeah, this is like where you eat a lot of stuff,
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.840]   but you're really not eating that much.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:31.320]   Great for it.
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:32.960]   And yeah, periling pumpkin seeds.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.240]   We looked at that one.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.960]   Yeah, and I've never even seen any of these.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.960]   There's so many different flavors.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:42.280]   I actually don't tell anyone, but I actually have a couple of bags of these kind of like--
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:43.280]   they're fig bars.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.280]   One is blueberry.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.360]   One is fig.
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.360]   And they're just so good.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.400]   Each one is individually wrapped.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.400]   Really good.
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.400]   Really enjoy that.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.080]   Well, back to the show.
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:58.680]   Now you may have heard about Vinod Kosla's fireside chat with Sergei and Larry, the
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.680]   founders of Google.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.400]   And it was a really interesting conversation.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.800]   It lasted about 45 minutes.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.200]   And they talked about a whole bunch of things.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:11.960]   Some of them were actually kind of funny, which is that in the very early days of Google,
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:17.600]   when Sergei and Larry and two other people were the grad students who collectively made
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:25.200]   up the whole of Google, they were actually offered an acquisition proposition by Vinod
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.560]   Kosla himself.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:30.840]   And at the time he was, I guess, advising excite.
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:35.640]   If you've been around long enough, you remember excite was a major search engine, I guess,
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.680]   in 1999.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:42.240]   In this conversation, they disagreed about the amount that was offered.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:47.600]   Kosla said that they offered $350,000 to buy Google, if you can imagine.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.320]   And the Google founders remember it being over a million.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.240]   Either way, the acquisition didn't happen.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:59.480]   And I think everyone in the conversation agreed that that was a good thing because now, of
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.400]   course, Google makes tens of billions of dollars.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.840]   You imagine if Google had died with excite?
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.760]   Oh, man.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.760]   What a different world.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.080]   I wonder how many startups have died in an acquisition.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:14.840]   How many startups that would have been destined for greatness otherwise?
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.600]   They will never know about ever because they were killed in acquisition.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:22.120]   And in fact, that's one of the things that I worry about some of these serial acquisition
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:27.840]   type companies like Yahoo, they're constantly acquiring companies, then they make you forget
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:28.840]   them.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.880]   And then like four or five years later, they announced that they're closing it and you're
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:35.400]   like, I kind of remember that site from years ago.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.720]   And it just seems so unnecessary.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:40.160]   You never know if there's going to be some brilliant ideas in there.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:44.320]   But the Google founders had some interesting ideas that they talked about.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:48.680]   They generally expressed their dissatisfaction with the pace of society, with the fact that
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:54.200]   people work as hard as they do and spend as much time as they do with computers given
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.720]   what they get back from those computers.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.000]   And so it's a really interesting conversation.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.800]   I don't know if you guys had any additional thoughts about this.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.760]   There were some aspects of it that were controversial, for example.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:12.480]   They Sergey Brin expressed a comfort level with robots taking over your job that some
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:16.040]   press outlets took Umbrage at.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:20.200]   But his point was that we have more automation and more robots doing things than we can all
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.200]   do things that are more enjoyable.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:27.040]   I thought it was ironic that they were suggesting a four day work week to help solve the employment
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.040]   issues.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.920]   And as you said just a minute ago, they were working too much.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:32.840]   Who are the hardest people working people you know?
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:33.840]   Googlers.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:34.840]   Exactly.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.240]   They're there constantly.
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.240]   Right.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.040]   They have four day workdays, some of them.
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:43.000]   It's a brutal place to work.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.520]   And of course they give free food and beverages to all their employees and they have dry cleaning
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:51.360]   and massages and all that stuff so that people never have to leave the Googleplex.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.480]   I guess they could start right there at home.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.560]   Well, it was an interesting conversation.
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:02.120]   And toward the end of the interview, they talked about society and that sort of thing.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:06.840]   And this is one of the themes of this show I think we're going to find out which is that
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.200]   Google is such a powerful company.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:15.360]   And when they say things like this, people tend to freak out and probably maybe they
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:18.160]   should because Google has so much power.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:23.480]   And that's where we get to our next story which is that there was an article in Salon
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:29.080]   suggesting that Google and some of the other big tech giants be nationalized.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.600]   This is my nominee.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.600]   I put it up there.
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.480]   This is my nominee for the dumbest article of the decade.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.480]   Okay.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.000]   And the author of this article.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.480]   What it says is that we should nationalize Google because it's too powerful and yeah,
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.840]   I had Amazon because it's too powerful.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:46.960]   And by the way, they got started with government's help on the internet.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:47.960]   So we own it anyway.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:52.680]   To which my response is the nationalized tang because it started in NASA.
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:57.400]   You know, it's just what didn't start with government help is that the point is society
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:00.440]   is that we have we have the this help out there.
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:04.720]   It's just it's I feel a little ashamed myself of pretty enough because it is clickbait.
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:08.800]   But I just wanted to have the chance to say.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:09.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.800]   So let's let's actually talk about that.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:18.920]   And so do you support the continued, you know, ownership by the government of the US Postal
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:21.040]   Service, for example, Jeff?
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:25.280]   Well, I end up doing a lot of work on that topic because I help a friend of mine named
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.480]   John Callan of the past.
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:30.920]   I helped him organize a conference called Post Division 2020.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:34.520]   And it's not really owned by the government.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:40.160]   And indeed, no, I would I would say that the primary benefit of the Postal Service is
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:44.680]   it gives a everywhere delivery of guarantee, but that could be handled through a subsidy
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.280]   as phone services handled through a subsidy to remote areas.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.080]   And so it's never going to happen.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.520]   We're never going to get rid of it because there's too many votes there.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:55.200]   But no, I don't think we should be in the Postal Service business anymore.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:01.440]   And indeed, when we had the Postmaster General of this event a year ago, he said that the
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:05.640]   primary job of the Postal Service now is as an ad delivery medium.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:09.560]   So the Postal Service basically competes with our business right here.
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.440]   And that's not the job of the US government.
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:17.320]   One of his arguments is that the big tech companies, including Google through YouTube
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:21.640]   was singled out, but also Amazon and others, they abuse their power.
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:24.600]   And because they abuse their power, they need to be nationalized.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.440]   I can't say it with a straight face either.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:32.200]   But do we agree that there's a lot of abuse of power at least and that something more
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.320]   needs to be done regarding their abuse of power?
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.880]   Well, let's hand it over to the people who run the NSA.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.680]   Yeah, that'll work.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.600]   Well, there's a there's a there's a big left right.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.120]   There's always a left right component to this.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:50.120]   In general, people on the left tend to trust government more than private companies and
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.840]   on the right vice versa.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.200]   I'm a Hillary Clinton Democrat.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.200]   I think it's a Democrat.
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.200]   Yeah.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.200]   So I've said enough, Gina.
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.200]   Yes.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.200]   Yes.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.200]   This seems crazy.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:09.640]   I mean, I look, I mean, I think there are issues that we discuss on this show quite a bit
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:13.560]   about about some of the things that the these big companies do wielding their power.
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.640]   But I don't think this is the solution.
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:23.000]   I think I think the biggest flaw in his argument, frankly, is that, you know, I guess the uber
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   argument that he's making is that the public square, this is so important, the stuff we
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:33.080]   do online, it's replaced what we used to do in meat space and the public square where
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.960]   we discuss all these things is privatized.
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:41.280]   The problem with his argument is that there are a million public squares.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:46.720]   It's not that Google's public square is the only public square that Facebook's, you know,
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.440]   that Facebook is the only place where people can have conversations.
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:52.600]   There are gazillion places where people can have conversations.
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:56.000]   And of course, one of the reasons that these companies are so aggressive in doing all these
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.680]   things that he's saying is that they are freaked out, that they could be wiped out, wiped
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.200]   off the mat, go out of business.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.920]   They all feel like they're 18 months away from complete obsolescence.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:09.800]   And in fact, that's true unless they continuously re reinvent themselves.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:14.200]   And so I think that's one of the reasons why his argument is completely flawed.
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:16.120]   But it's an interesting one.
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:19.120]   There's no God given law that says your company has to live forever.
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.120]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:24.520]   I mean, that was the argument that Microsoft made in the 90s when they were being pursued
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.880]   for antitrust, for bundling internet explorer with Windows.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:31.240]   They said, hey, you know, we are we are it'd be so easy.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.600]   We're not a monopoly.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:37.160]   Windows is not a monopoly simply because we're just a few months away from everybody just
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:40.400]   erasing Windows and moving the Linux or whatever.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:45.560]   And in terms of the browser, if people if somebody made a better the reason everybody
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:48.120]   uses our browser is because it's the best browser.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.000]   And if somebody else made a better browser, we would decline the market share.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.640]   And that's exactly what happened.
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:53.640]   That's what happened.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:57.520]   Several other companies made better browsers and and Microsoft went right to the bottom.
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:01.160]   So so yeah, there's it's understandable.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:07.240]   And of course, you know, it's a Darwinian world in technology, though the giants are giants
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.640]   and are still around because they've reinvented themselves because they've been aggressive
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:14.920]   because they've been aggressive about changing users about changing law about changing society
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:17.880]   and doing all these things still interesting article.
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:24.520]   I've actually argued in a column before that the the wireless carrier should be nationalized.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:28.680]   And in exchange, we should privatize the post office so that it's a swap.
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:32.600]   So we don't have to run in one direction.
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:37.120]   But but I did that simply because of the way pricing works with with wireless carriers.
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:41.040]   And because it's so you know, the all the incentive many of the incentives tend toward
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:45.360]   having worse service and you can't tell what you're paying for.
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:49.480]   You know, you pay this you get this monthly contract is this a good thing bad thing, whatever.
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:52.760]   Anyway, that that's a that's another issue unto itself.
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:56.440]   I don't really I'm not generally in favor of privatization, but I thought that was an
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:02.040]   interesting column because of the theme of, you know, all this power that these companies
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:03.040]   have.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:08.000]   So it's really, you know, it's it's really it was really an interesting piece in in the
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.440]   sense that it captured the I got this with you.
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.080]   I think it was it was an incredibly laughable piece.
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:16.080]   Well, it was a ticket.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.080]   It made no sense.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:21.640]   I got facts wrong, by the way, about Google penetration, but that beside I think there
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:27.800]   was no logic to it, I think that it's the kind of what I talked that we have now is,
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.680]   Oh my God, these people are scaring us.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.000]   Let's let's try to stop them.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.040]   But that's why it was but that's why it was interesting.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:37.440]   I think it captured the Luddite sensibility that's rising.
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.600]   And and you know, I know I didn't think it was a good piece from it from a from a.
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:43.000]   No, no, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, we agree, but
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.520]   it's it captured the thing that is happening in our society that's just so toxic about
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:52.560]   just, you know, especially in like San Francisco when people tearing Google class up people's
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:53.560]   faces.
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:56.480]   Yeah, so encapsulation of technopanic.
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.600]   All of yours around it.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:00.600]   Exactly.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.560]   Or I have the new subset of this, which is by call Euro techno panic.
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:06.720]   This is this is not this is America.
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.080]   This is a Yankee techno panic.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:10.280]   Yeah, we've all got our little variants.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:15.840]   So it's like the soccer friendly wooden shoe wearing, never mind.
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:21.040]   All right, well, Gina, if the if the trumpets and the timponies are ready, I think I think
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.040]   Gina, I don't think we need Mike.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.280]   I think you would like to go home.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.600]   Looks like the change log is so long today.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.400]   The show is just headed over to Gina.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.760]   So much so much change to log is is really impressive.
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:36.480]   Why don't we go ahead and launch into the Google change log.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.000]   Take it away, Gina.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:45.360]   All right, we got a couple of really cool things this week in the change log.
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:50.520]   Google now always changing, always getting smarter, a couple of new new functions here.
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:54.040]   First, everybody knows how to use Google now to set a reminder, you know, remind me at
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:58.520]   two o'clock to get ready for my meeting, remind me on Tuesday to meet with whoever.
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:01.040]   Well, now you can set up occasional reminders.
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:05.760]   So you can say to Google now, remind me to take out the garbage occasionally.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:09.400]   And it's not clear exactly what occasionally means.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.680]   It just means that everyone's in the wild.
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:12.680]   Yeah, Google will.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.160]   We'll let you about taking out the trash.
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.160]   I don't like this one.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.160]   I don't like this one.
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.160]   It's too ambiguous for you.
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:21.120]   No, I don't want to do my chores.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.760]   I just like that's one of my best excuses I forgot.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:28.040]   You know, it's like, I don't need this kind of help, you know, no more excuses.
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.040]   No more excuses.
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.120]   I haven't had a chance to test this out.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.240]   I don't know what occasionally means.
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.240]   So I don't know.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.240]   Maybe that's a good thing.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.240]   But it'll be interesting.
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:40.880]   I would love to know if Google is doing any sort of AI on take out the trash and then
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:46.320]   making occasionally, you know, every few days or what.
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.520]   Also new coming soon to Google now.
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:53.040]   Apparently, this is more of a leak or a rumor, but it seems totally, it seems like it would
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.400]   be totally legit.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.280]   Voice controls for media playback.
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:59.800]   So you can say, okay, Google, play the next song.
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.640]   This dovetails really nicely into Android Auto.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:06.640]   It seems like the kind of voice command you'd want, particularly in your car.
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:10.400]   So you can do play next song, stop music.
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:14.200]   And if you, when you do okay, play next song at Google now will also pop up a button.
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.000]   This hasn't rolled out yet, but there's a video and it looks like it.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.480]   It probably still will.
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:23.440]   So good, nice stuff going on in Google now as always.
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:27.400]   Speaking of voice, I didn't realize that you could do this, but this is a pretty neat
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.520]   little trick.
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:36.120]   You can correct Google's voice search interpretation by saying, no, I said.
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.720]   If I say, if I.
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:40.760]   If only this worked on children.
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:42.240]   Right, exactly.
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:47.400]   So if you say, okay, Google, tell me about this week in Google and it takes me to this
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:54.320]   week in Boggle, I can say, okay, Google, no, I said Google and it will actually correct
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:58.240]   the word that it that it meant that it screwed up and I'm sure it's using some smarts to
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.440]   do that and rerun the search.
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:06.840]   So you're seeing some of this kind of conversational functionality that we've seen, what's the
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:11.520]   weather like in Santa Monica and how do I get there and Google kind of associating the
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:15.000]   object from one search to the next in this.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   So try it out.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.920]   It's a little, it's less satisfying than just being able to say, no, I said.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:23.000]   You actually have to say, okay, Google, no, I said.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.360]   So it takes a little bit longer, but also kind of fun.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.360]   So if Google.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.360]   How are you guys?
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.360]   Sorry, Jen.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.400]   Have you guys been using voice with your watch?
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.400]   After all, I have.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.280]   Yeah, I've been using it a lot.
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.320]   My watch, the battery actually died for the first time today.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:40.000]   So I'm not wearing it right now, but yeah, I've been using it all the time.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   It's not listening.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   It's not hearing me very well.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   Really?
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   How about you?
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   I use Google.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.840]   I use voice search so much that my one year old now points to my watch and says Google.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:58.240]   Like, yes, yes, which is crazy, kind of scary and cool at the same time.
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:03.920]   But I mean, I don't, out in public, I don't love saying, okay, Google, end of my watch.
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:06.640]   I swipe over, you know, I just tap and swipe.
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:10.600]   But yeah, it does a pretty good job of interpretation.
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:13.120]   Jeff, it doesn't hear you, like, or.
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.360]   It gets the wrong word.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.520]   So I was, and I was out on the street today when I did it.
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.520]   I was sending an SMS back.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:19.760]   That was me and somebody in a car.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:22.760]   And I said, almost there.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:24.760]   And it said, fear.
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:31.560]   And I said, one minute and it said 15 minutes to how the hell it got 15 out of one.
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:32.560]   I don't know.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.400]   So it's getting those misinterpretations.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.440]   It sounded like it was arguing with you.
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.000]   Yeah, well, 15 minutes.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.120]   I'm not ready in one minute.
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.120]   I said one minute.
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:45.800]   I feel like I'm going to be walking to the streets and then find Jarvis going, no, I
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.800]   said in a minute.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:51.560]   Definitely need to move to a quieter place, maybe.
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.120]   Yeah, well, it's like Petaluma next year.
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:59.520]   So I love that, Gina, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.360]   thinks that your watch is Google.
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:04.360]   I mean, are you talking to Google so much?
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:08.360]   Google, yes, she pronounces Google more clearly than she pronounces grandma.
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.440]   Like she says a lot of times saying grandma.
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:14.080]   She says Gaga for grandma, but Google, she knows.
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:17.120]   But you are replaced by a robot.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:21.160]   She's going to get Lady Gaga playing on your phone if she's asking for grandma with that
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.160]   thing.
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:23.160]   It's true.
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:30.760]   But isn't that an interesting image where this child is growing up in a world where some
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:35.400]   of its first, her first memories are going to be talking to a wristwatch and that's
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:36.400]   normal.
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:39.400]   This is the, this is the normal world that, that she lives in.
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:40.920]   Future babies, they are here.
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:42.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:43.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:45.320]   I mean, she sees me, she sees me talking to my watch and she just wants to touch my watch
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:50.400]   and I actually installed an app that locks my watch so that she can play with it without,
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.360]   you know, ordering me a car or something.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.360]   Oh, accidentally.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:58.560]   Because she sees me, you know, playing with it and that's what she wants to touch it.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.360]   She wants to put it on and she says Google.
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:01.640]   I mean, it's the whole thing.
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:05.160]   It's really, it's amazing to watch actually because she just, she's just mimicking right
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:06.160]   now.
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.400]   Well, if a pizza shows up, you'll know where it came from.
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.400]   I don't know why.
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:14.400]   But, but in fact, on, on tech news today, this morning, we, we talked about a new product
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:20.840]   from LG called the Kizan, which is a children's smartwatch of sorts, essentially a cell phone
[00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:25.800]   wristwatch that does GPS tracking so parents can track where their kids are, but it has
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.320]   10 pre-program numbers.
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:32.720]   They push the button and they, they call the parents or the parents can call the child.
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:36.640]   And even if the child doesn't answer after about 10 rings, it answers automatically.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:39.520]   It has other features, waterproof and so on.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:43.160]   But yeah, it looks like you can also talk on these kids.
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:45.160]   What, teenager?
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:47.840]   The, the teenager probably wouldn't wear it.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.040]   It's very, very childy looking.
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:52.040]   Yeah.
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.040]   Very Fisher Price.
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.040]   Ask.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.040]   And it's appearance, but I mean.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:59.960]   What's funny about that is young people don't talk on the phone.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:00.960]   Right.
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:01.960]   Yeah.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:02.960]   Well, it's true.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:03.960]   That's right.
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:04.960]   But text messaging.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:05.960]   That's right.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:07.960]   That's best of jazz, but phone.
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:08.960]   No.
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:09.960]   Reddit hated.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.960]   So what else you got, Gina?
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:12.960]   What else you got here?
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:18.360]   Oh, so Google Drive is getting a brand new interface redesign.
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:19.360]   I actually got this.
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.400]   This is rolling out slowly.
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:27.240]   You'll know if you got it, if you go to drive.google.com and you'll get a little, a little prompt that
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:30.160]   says try the new web experience.
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.240]   It's just a really nice kind of overhaul.
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:36.480]   A new default view uses a thumbnail grid instead of a list.
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.880]   You can see file details from the whole screen.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:43.560]   You've got desktop style selection tools, including click and drag and control modifiers
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.280]   and drag and drop.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:49.600]   It's just, it feels Google Drive makes Google Drive feel a lot more like a desktop app.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:50.840]   So again, this is rolling out slowly.
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:51.840]   You might not have it.
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:52.840]   It looks like Chad.
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:53.840]   Is that you, Chad?
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:54.840]   It looks like Chad's got it there.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:55.840]   I'm having it.
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:57.840]   Just screenshots.
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:58.840]   Just screenshots.
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:44:59.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:00.840]   Looks really nice.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:01.840]   Dig in it.
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:02.840]   What else we have?
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:09.400]   Oh, speaking of Google Drive, the Gmail app for Android phones and tablets just got a new
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.920]   insert Google Drive file command.
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.640]   So this is on Android.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:14.640]   You got the Gmail app.
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.000]   You got a compose window open.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.200]   You go to insert a file into your email.
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.480]   You can select from Google Drive.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:27.000]   If the file isn't shared with the person you're sending it to, and I always have this
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.800]   problem where I send people links to a Google Drive document and don't have rights and can
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.600]   you set the rights of blah, blah, blah.
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:37.160]   Well, this new insert from Drive feature will let you know if the person has it, doesn't
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:40.520]   have rights and let you change the sharing settings.
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:44.080]   So really easy way to send, send files and not just directly from Drive.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:45.960]   You can do that directly from Gmail now.
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:50.440]   And that update, I have not gotten that update yet, but that update is rolling out to Gmail
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:52.920]   and Android now.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:59.280]   An update to the official Chromecast app for Android now has been updated to allow streaming
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:03.720]   your device's entire screen to your host.
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:04.720]   So excited about this.
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:07.080]   This is such a cool new feature.
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:08.720]   So basically you run your Chromecast app.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:13.760]   If you flip out the hamburger menu like Chad showing on the screen there, there's an option
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.600]   to cast screen.
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.160]   This new feature is limited to certain devices right now.
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:26.160]   The Nexus 4, the Nexus 5, the Nexus 7, 2013, the Nexus 10, the Samsung Galaxy, S4, S5, Note
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:30.960]   3, Note 10, HTC One M7, which may be very sad because I have the M8.
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:35.080]   LG Pro 2, the LG 2 and the LG 3, I think they're rolling this.
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:39.440]   I'm not sure why actually they're rolling this out to certain devices first.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:42.040]   There must be some hardware dependencies going on here.
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:46.840]   Yeah, really neat way to show off what's going on on your Chromecast.
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:47.840]   It casts a screen.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:53.680]   Isn't that related to what we saw at I/O where you could show your Android screen onto
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:54.680]   a TV?
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.920]   Yeah, that's exactly right.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:57.920]   So that's what it does.
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:59.920]   It casts a screen.
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:01.360]   You can show off what's going on.
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.720]   This is the first app exactly.
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:07.920]   And that update is also rolling out with the Chromecast app for Android right now.
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:11.440]   And finally, this got me really excited because this is an Android Wear thing.
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:15.920]   There's a new update to the Google Camera app for Android that allows you to use your
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:18.160]   watch as a remote shutter.
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:19.160]   Wow.
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.840]   Yeah, this is really cool.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:22.160]   And I got to try this out.
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:24.440]   This is such a neat use of Android Wear.
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:28.120]   So the way that it works is you got your phone, which is connected, of course, to your watch
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:30.040]   through Bluetooth.
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.400]   You initiate the camera app.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:37.080]   You launch the camera app and a card shows up on your watch that says, you know, tap
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:38.640]   here for remote shutter.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.800]   It counts down three, two, one.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:44.240]   And then you see a preview of the device on your screen.
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:48.520]   So really, really, really cool way to take remote photos with your phone.
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.280]   My only nitpick.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:54.120]   I mean, this would be an amazing selfie function.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:59.240]   If you could preview the viewfinder, you know, on your watch before you take the image,
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:00.240]   you can't.
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:04.240]   You only see the image on your watch after you take the image, but still really neat
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:09.880]   use of Android Wear as a remote shutter for those of you considering jumping an Android
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.200]   Wear early.
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.200]   Really fun.
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:13.200]   And that's a cool one.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:17.560]   Well, before you hit it, before you hit it, before you hit it, while you're on Android
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:21.120]   Wear, have you guys discovered any great new Android Wear apps?
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:26.960]   Well, there's actually a flappy bird clone that now exists on Android Wear called Flopsy
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:28.800]   Droid.
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.200]   And it's as bad as it sounds.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.600]   There's a little Android robot that flies around.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.680]   But no, I haven't seen a good one.
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.040]   I've got a good calculator.
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.040]   Really.
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.040]   Oh, wow.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:45.040]   Well, baby time is the one that I use to lock my device so that my child can't, you
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.560]   know, or SMS China.
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:48.120]   Jason, I'll hit that one.
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:51.600]   Yeah, Jason, I'm sure I knew Jason would go for that one.
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:55.400]   And I installed Flopsy Droid, which I'm sorry to say, as I said last night on all about
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:49:01.000]   Android, is very playable, much more playable than I wish there was.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   Yeah, very cool.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   Wow.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   That's my calculator.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   Very nice.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.840]   Yeah, just numbers around calculator.
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:08.840]   Very nice.
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:10.840]   Here come the apps, man.
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:11.840]   This is great.
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:12.840]   This is really exciting.
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:14.640]   I want better look at faces.
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:15.640]   Yeah.
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:17.640]   Yeah.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:21.080]   You think that'd be the first thing that would come before Flopsy Droid.
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:27.200]   Well, Flopsy Droid was a third party developer who did it.
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:30.880]   And actually, it never occurred to me that I would want to play games on the watch.
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.400]   It was actually kind of a neat proof of concept.
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:37.920]   I didn't think that a game would be playable on a screen that small, and yet there it is.
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:38.920]   There it is.
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:40.600]   Sort of the beauty of Flappy Bird, right?
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:42.840]   And you can probably play that while you're holding your baby, right?
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:45.440]   You're sort of holding the baby like this, and you can kind of...
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:46.600]   Oh, man.
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:47.760]   I got to show her Flopsy Droid.
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:49.600]   I haven't shown her Flopsy Droid yet.
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:51.200]   Well, I'm in big trouble.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.200]   All right.
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.200]   So...
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:54.200]   And that's all I got for the change look.
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:55.200]   All right.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.200]   Wonderful.
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:00.480]   That is the Google change look.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:07.120]   So we got a couple of stories here about people complaining about Google search and Google's
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:12.000]   sort of internal processes for dealing with errors and problems, one of which appeared
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.600]   on Wired, Wired.com, and by Kevin Paulson, it's called "How Google Map Hackers Can Destroy
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:19.560]   a Business at Will."
[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:26.680]   And according to this article, there was a Serbian restaurant that Google misreported
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:31.280]   the hours of operations for in the Washington, D.C. area.
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.720]   This is a restaurant, by the way, that serves the lion meat.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:36.280]   I have to check that out if they ever come back.
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:40.960]   But anyway, the misreported hours caused, according to the owner of this restaurant,
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:45.040]   caused them to go out of business, and it said that there weren't open on the weekends
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.440]   and so on.
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:54.480]   And so the Serbian Crown restaurant sort of declined into poverty and in obsolescence
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:57.960]   because Google misreported the hours.
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.480]   Is this just somebody whining?
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:05.440]   Their business went out of business for reasons like their serve lion meat, for example,
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:09.880]   instead of meat that the general population wants to eat?
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:13.800]   Or is this legitimate that Google has way too much power and they have the ability to
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:15.960]   crush businesses with their little errors?
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:19.680]   What do you think, Jeff or Gina?
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:20.880]   I'm confused.
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:26.160]   I thought that as a local business listing that you had control or that you could update
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.160]   your business listing.
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:28.160]   Is that not true?
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:31.000]   Do you need to submit it to Google and wait for them to, I mean, I don't understand why
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.240]   these folks couldn't just update the hours.
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:34.640]   I don't either, right?
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:35.640]   Yeah.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:36.640]   I don't either.
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.920]   And I was under that impression as well.
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:41.400]   Maybe this wasn't possible.
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:45.960]   In his case, for some reason, we don't know about, but that was my impression as well that
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:50.240]   you could just go in there and maybe there was a dispute, maybe the other Serbian restaurant
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:52.400]   across town was changing their results.
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:56.200]   The story is not very complete and answering those pretty obvious questions.
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:57.360]   That's a good thing.
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:58.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:03.680]   What I find interesting in this, though, it's not as if, I don't know what this is, the
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:05.880]   guy as I understand didn't pay for the service.
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:08.480]   He's just saying Google listed to be wrong.
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:12.760]   And he built the business apparently on the back of Google existing.
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:18.320]   And so, do you then have some right to be listed correctly?
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:20.520]   Is it a violation of your rights if you're listed incorrectly?
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:25.920]   If somebody makes a mistake, if a newspaper, I guess the analogy would be, if a newspaper
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:31.920]   runs an ad and puts it in the wrong time for your show, then you get to sue the newspaper,
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:34.440]   at least for the money back for your ad or the business lost.
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:38.360]   If the newspaper puts it in a free listing, the show started at eight when it started
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:39.360]   at seven.
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:41.480]   Do you have a case against them?
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:42.480]   Newspaper screwed up.
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:46.960]   Well, Gee, but the only way we're going to get people to our show that way, well, that's
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:47.960]   true.
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:48.960]   It's screwed up and that's too bad.
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:52.360]   But I'm not sure that there's a basis for suit.
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:57.920]   Well, you mentioned, yeah, you mentioned the listing show coming on at the wrong time.
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:03.720]   The other story that falls in this category is that Dinesh D'Souza's new film called
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:10.240]   America was confused on Google's listings with his previous movie called Something or
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:13.480]   Other Using the Word America.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:17.840]   And as a result of that, the database showed that the movie wasn't playing in theaters
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:21.480]   when in fact it was, because his old movie wasn't playing in theaters.
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:27.800]   And so he turned the screws on Google in the court of public opinion and said that essentially
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:31.960]   that Google and you guys are going to laugh at this.
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:38.360]   Google's a left-leaning organization that was deliberately doing this to prevent his
[00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:43.360]   right-leaning movie from being popular or something like that.
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:44.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:48.200]   And then we went to a big giant Google sat down and said, you know, we want to stop that
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:50.040]   Dinesh D'Souza's name's movie.
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:55.400]   Let's bring all of our huge and vast power behind stopping it.
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:57.400]   I think I'm more likely.
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.160]   Of course, that's ridiculous.
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.920]   That is, of course, ridiculous.
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:06.960]   But I do try in these cases to kind of, I don't know, be empathetic to the person, you
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:08.320]   know, the less powerful party.
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:13.960]   I mean, so it looks like in this case with this particular lion meets, this fellow,
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:18.520]   who immigrated from the US from Northern Italy, you know, he's 74 years old.
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:20.360]   He doesn't own a computer.
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:24.640]   He's not, he'd heard of the internet, but didn't really know much about Google and didn't use
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:28.920]   Google, didn't realize that this was happening.
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:32.360]   But and I guess his accountant called Google and tried to change the listing.
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:33.360]   I called them.
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:34.360]   How do you call Google?
[00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:38.720]   And eventually he hired an internet consultant to get it fixed.
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:41.800]   But by that time, his business was in a nose dive.
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:45.800]   He decided that this was Google's fault and hence the suit.
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:51.840]   So this is sort of just like, you know, lack of awareness going on here.
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:55.520]   But you know, for a filmmaker or for someone who makes something, listen, Jeff's an author,
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:56.520]   I'm an author.
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:59.520]   I mean, you know, when you make something or you make a site, particularly or an app,
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:02.760]   I mean, in a lot of ways, Google is the way that people find you.
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:03.760]   And it is frustrating.
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:04.760]   And I've been in this position.
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:09.320]   It is frustrating when Google's snippets or search results or whatever show something that
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:14.120]   you know is untrue or out of date or misleading.
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:17.560]   And you know, that whole process, there really isn't a process to appeal that, right?
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:21.960]   I mean, all you can do is kind of go in and try to tweak your copy and get more links
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:23.920]   and like hope for the best.
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:28.200]   And you know, while there's like a whole industry of SEO people trying to, you know,
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:32.120]   get high on the search results, I do feel for the, you know, the folks who have a legitimate
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.920]   case of like, hey, you got this wrong.
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:35.920]   Your algorithm is wrong.
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:39.400]   I'm one of the, and I'm one of the, you know, casualties.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.440]   But is that, is that Google's responsibility?
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:42.440]   No.
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:43.440]   It's hard to say.
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:47.760]   In the case of the D'Souza thing, I mean, I don't, I don't know how common this is,
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:50.000]   but in his case, you know, Google did make an error.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.720]   And I think he seized on the opportunity to get a whole heart of attention.
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:55.720]   Is that an error though?
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:59.480]   Is that an error or, or, or, or, or the problem is that, that, you know, if, if you're named
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:04.000]   John Smith, yeah, it's going to be hard to be found on Google.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.160]   And if you really want to be found, then you've got to go through a whole bunch of steps
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:09.200]   to say, no, I'm the John Smith.
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:13.360]   You really care about America as a title of a, of a show.
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:15.880]   I'm not trying to defend Google here, but I'm trying.
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:19.600]   I don't know what, it's the same as the, as the guy with the, uh, Lyamy, which by the
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:21.600]   way, I think serving Lyamy is a nasty thing.
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:23.400]   And I'm, I'm not sure that I'm.
[00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:26.000]   Tastes like, happy with him anyway.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:32.080]   Um, uh, but, but, uh, you know, we don't know enough to know people just say, ah, it's
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:33.320]   all Google's fault.
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:34.320]   Maybe it is.
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:38.600]   Maybe Google messed up and maybe it's impossible to get to Google and that's an issue for Google.
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:44.280]   However, it is a behemoth and there are just ways you have to deal with this.
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:47.320]   It's like, you know, it's kind of a new DMV and you got to deal with the rules and you
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:48.320]   got to deal with the factor.
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:52.080]   And we don't know enough to know who is in the wrong in this case, but I certainly don't
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:54.920]   think there was a conspiracy to get rid of either party.
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:57:00.320]   Neither do I, uh, falls into the category of, of when organizations tech companies have
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:01.560]   so much power.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:05.600]   And you know, right now they probably have what 80% of the search, uh, search engine,
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:09.360]   traffic, uh, market share, whatever you want to call it in the United States.
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:11.000]   What if they had 99%?
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.560]   Uh, you know, it's, it's an interesting question, but let's move on from that whole issue that,
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:20.080]   because it's a total bummer, frankly, uh, all of these stories we've talked about so
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:21.080]   far.
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:25.600]   Let's talk about something really awesome, which is that NASA is using project tango to,
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:31.360]   uh, to, as robot eyes for these little soccer ball sized robots that are going to do EVAs
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:33.440]   on the space station.
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:36.840]   And this is a schedule to blast off.
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:37.840]   What is it?
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:42.480]   Day after tomorrow, on Friday, uh, to go up to the space station and, uh, these newly,
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:48.200]   uh, you know, project tango oriented robots are going to be put into immediate use.
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:54.320]   Now if you're unfamiliar with project tango, this is an experimental project, uh, that
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:58.520]   builds, uh, 3D mapping into a smartphone.
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:02.560]   They also have a tablet version that they're working on, but essentially has special, uh,
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:07.440]   hardware and software that enables in the normal use case, you walk around a room and
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:11.960]   it instantly maps or very quickly maps the entire indoor space, all the furniture, where
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:15.440]   the ceiling is, where the walls are, where the doors are, where the windows are, and
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:17.960]   you can do all kinds of cool interactive things.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:22.240]   Um, app developers will be able to do all kinds of amazing things, but NASA is going to
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.240]   use it.
[00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:24.720]   They bolted it onto this robot.
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:26.480]   They've integrated it electronically.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:32.640]   So now a project tango phones are actually controlling the little CO2 jets where these
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:34.680]   circular robots fly around and zero G's.
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:39.320]   They're going to deploy them out, out the shoot of the space station and they're going
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:44.320]   to fly around on the exterior, mapping the exterior of the space station.
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:46.920]   Uh, sounds really, really cool.
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:48.960]   This is awesome.
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:50.760]   This is just awesome.
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:52.840]   How cool is this?
[00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:57.200]   I just love this and attempt to make the robots smarter, used to astronauts, engineers and
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:00.600]   NASA's Ames Research Centers and Chief Smartphones, the space station, which they had purchased
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:01.600]   from Best Buy.
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:08.960]   I mean, this is when we live in an amazing world where NASA is heading over to Best Buy
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:13.720]   to equip their robots with some extra smarts to like map the space station.
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:14.720]   That's incredible.
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:15.920]   That is incredible.
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:16.920]   It really is.
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:17.920]   It really is.
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:22.040]   And what's also incredible is the fact that this technology is moving so quickly into a
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:23.040]   usable form.
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:28.120]   I mean, when I first heard about this technology, I thought, okay, you know, 2020, we're going
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:30.120]   to start seeing something like this come out.
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:32.800]   But it's really, you know, I believe it's LG.
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:37.600]   I could be getting this wrong, but I think LG is actually going to ship a consumer tablet
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:39.880]   later this year or next year.
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:41.280]   I'm sorry I don't have the facts.
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:44.640]   We reported on techniques today some time ago, but it's actually going to be a commercially
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:48.560]   available consumer product that can map and indoor space like this.
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:51.360]   And I think that, you know, there's got to be some kind of partnership with Google where
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:55.240]   they're really, they want the public and the developers to know that this is going to
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:56.240]   be out there.
[00:59:56.240 --> 01:00:00.840]   And so for, you know, people that create apps for this, this sort of technology and obviously
[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:03.240]   games are going to be killer on this thing.
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:05.000]   Yeah, for definitely.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.160]   So, you know, and the applications, you know, every time you see one of these things and
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:12.320]   you wonder what's behind it with Google, right?
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.760]   So my first presumption is they can map a room, right?
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:18.600]   Then we, I think we talked on the show about, wow, would this be amazing for a blind person
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.960]   to know what's what in a room?
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:24.120]   And I kind of never thought of that idea of how do you deal with something that's in
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:29.960]   space where you really don't know, you have no bearings at all and it can start to virtually
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:34.680]   map what it's going to go deal with and how phenomenal.
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:35.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:36.680]   It's absolutely incredible.
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:41.600]   I love this technology and I love the fact that, you know, usually NASA, you know, it's
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:45.160]   it's they're awesome, but usually it takes them a long time to get stuff implemented.
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:50.520]   And here they are with a very, you know, prototypical thing that pretty much we heard about very
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.680]   recently and they're already deploying it.
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:54.400]   It's just a great, great thing.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:59.680]   Well, of course then, because NASA's doing it, we should nationalize LG.
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:00.680]   Yes.
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:01.680]   And Best Buy.
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:02.680]   And Google.
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:03.680]   And Google.
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:04.680]   Immediately.
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:05.680]   Well, let's.
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:06.680]   And Tang.
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:07.680]   I think.
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:09.160]   And any store that's on a public street.
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:10.160]   That's right.
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.240]   Did he was was Tang ever nationalized?
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.800]   That was always private, I think.
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:16.360]   Anyway, that didn't really work out the way they thought.
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:20.120]   I want a big Tang in your oven, Mike, but as we're getting off on another time.
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.120]   Yeah.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:22.120]   Tang.
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:23.120]   Tang flavor bread.
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:27.600]   I actually made bread recently with grape seeds, grape seed flour and regular flour together.
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.600]   That was interesting.
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.600]   But I thought about Tang.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:31.800]   How did it, how did it taste?
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:32.800]   It tasted great.
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:33.800]   It didn't taste that different, actually.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:34.800]   The color was different.
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:36.800]   It was slightly brownish purple, which was interesting.
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.440]   There are Pino grape seeds.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:43.560]   It had a slightly different flavor, but it was, you know, it worked out fine and it was
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:44.560]   interesting.
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.720]   So anyway, when you're in the wine country, that's the kind of crazy thing you get inspired
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:50.720]   to do because they have that stuff for sale.
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:53.800]   So let's do our tip tool and number of the week.
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:56.200]   Gino, why don't we start with you?
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.200]   Yes.
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:01.800]   So I think my tip thing was last week was how to get to the old Google Maps.
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:06.640]   Well, this week I've got a tip for something that only works in the new Google Maps.
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:09.400]   You can, and I didn't know this and this is thanks to Gizmodo.
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:16.680]   You can measure distance to, just kind of doodle on a map if you want in the new Google Map.
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:23.560]   What are the new Google Maps, you know, in any location and you right click, is that correct?
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:28.760]   Yeah, right click your starting point and you choose measure distance.
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:33.480]   You can just start drawing lines on the map and Google will tell you what the distance
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:34.800]   is from one line to the other.
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:39.240]   So you can see how far things as the crow flies or any sort of route that you want to
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:45.040]   take or you can just draw something cool on the map just for fun.
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:46.400]   Really, really neat.
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:53.080]   And when you drop, you can drop as many points as you want when you draw and you can click
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:58.400]   and drag any point to adjust it as well to get adjusted distances.
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.320]   That's cool.
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:01.960]   That is really cool.
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:07.080]   That's also great for setting up a route for running and jogging, that sort of thing.
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:08.080]   Yeah, definitely.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:09.080]   Nice job.
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:13.720]   Chad did like as the crow flies, it looks like from Twitter to in and out.
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:20.240]   Yep, I wanted to know how far it would be for a drone, yeah, to get and then if the
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:23.960]   drone needed to be carried back because it probably won't have power, there we go.
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:28.040]   Or for running, if you calculate the distance and then you figure out the number of calories
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:32.640]   burned by running and then match that against the calories in the burger, you could decide
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:34.400]   whether you could like zero it out.
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:36.040]   Yeah, this works really well.
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:41.120]   I mean, there's also, if you grab the starting position, you can drag it around and you can
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:43.600]   see that has a really animation on how long--
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:44.600]   Yeah, these really neat.
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.600]   This is a cool feature.
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:47.600]   Very neat.
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:48.600]   Look at that, watch out.
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:50.600]   Somebody did that for a living.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:52.720]   How fun.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:53.720]   That's cool.
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:54.720]   I got to try that.
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:55.720]   Never done that before.
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:04:01.360]   So I'm going to do my mind very quickly and then we'll end with Jeff's spectacular number
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:02.360]   of the week.
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:06.960]   Since I have two things, I have a tool of the week and a toy of the week, the tool of the
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.920]   week came to me right at the last minute.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.120]   Patrick told me about it.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:14.840]   It's a new Twit fan created Chrome app that shows you the live Twit stream.
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:17.600]   It's the same thing you get on live.twit.tv.
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:21.400]   But it shows it to you as a Chrome app and it's on top of your other windows.
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:25.000]   So as you're working, as you're moving windows around, it'll always stay on top so you can
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   watch the Twit network.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.320]   There's a course there is nothing more important than watching Twit.
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:29.320]   That is--
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:31.560]   It'll always be a top everything else, bravo.
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:32.720]   That's exactly right.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:33.720]   That's exactly right.
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:35.760]   So check that out.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:39.600]   You can find that, by the way, at Twit.tv/apps.
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:44.080]   There's a section called Laptop or Desktop and it's the last item in the laptop or desktop
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.080]   section.
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:46.080]   Yeah, look at all those apps.
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.240]   Those are all Twit-related apps.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:51.920]   And it shows you which one show you live, which one show you recorded and so on.
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:52.920]   Not plus the fans.
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:53.920]   Yeah.
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:55.760]   Now, one of those is made by Twit, I believe, right?
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.120]   Every one of those is made by fans.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.080]   Pretty sure that's correct.
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:00.000]   That's phenomenal.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   So--
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   Nationalize them all.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.280]   Nationalize them, never stop watching Twit.
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:10.440]   But my actual item is what I'm calling a toy of the week.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:15.040]   So we all went to Google I/O. They gave us these things, which are-- this is a Google
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:16.040]   cardboard.
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:20.560]   This is an open source project that gives you 3D in an app in your phone.
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.720]   You put the phone inside.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.960]   You look at it like a viewfinder.
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.120]   It shows you 3D.
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:29.520]   There's several apps that came with it and other people are creating more apps.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.520]   It's a really cool project.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:34.240]   Unfortunately, if you didn't go to Google I/O, you didn't get one.
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:40.120]   And we've talked in previous shows about companies like Dodo, which makes cases like
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:42.880]   this is my iPad case.
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.120]   They make really nice cases, among other things.
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:48.920]   But Dodo actually immediately went on sale and said that they were going to be selling
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:50.320]   cardboard versions of this.
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.400]   But the wait is four to six weeks.
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:55.840]   So if you're impatient, there's a quicker way to get your hands on one of these.
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:59.720]   And that is something called the unofficial cardboard.
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:02.080]   The cardboard is the name of the product that they're selling.
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:04.160]   It's $29.99.
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:07.640]   And they will send you something that looks a lot like the one that Google gave out at
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:08.640]   Google I/O.
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:12.120]   It has a couple of lenses in it, a magnetic controller, a rubber band.
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:15.520]   And basically, it's a cardboard viewfinder thing.
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:17.960]   It'll come fully assembled or you can also choose to get it.
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:19.640]   The unassembled version.
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:22.440]   Oh, it was too much fun watching Gina assemble it.
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:23.440]   You want to go to that fun?
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:25.040]   Yeah, get the unassembled version.
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.400]   Yeah, that's a good one.
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.640]   And of course, this works with most Android phones.
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:32.960]   If you go to the unofficial cardboard site or several other sites that talk about Google
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:35.960]   cardboard, they'll tell you which phones these work with and which they don't.
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:39.560]   Most major Android phones works great with Moto X, for example.
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:42.720]   And this is just a really fun and really cheap, 30 bucks.
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:45.360]   And you have like 3D.
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:48.000]   And not only 3D, but it's motion control 3D.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.160]   You have to experience it.
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:52.600]   And at these prices, I highly recommend it.
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:54.960]   So that is my toy of the week.
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.960]   And Jeff, you have a number.
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:58.520]   Oh, I have a couple.
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:03.200]   I just want to mention before we get started that our dear twig friend Matt cuts is after
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:05.920]   15 years at Google said it's one of those very matte moments.
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:09.640]   He just announced that he's taking a few months off to be with his wife and do what
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:10.640]   he wants to do.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:14.400]   And I think we wanted to give a salute to our dear friend Matt.
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:18.040]   And I can't think of anybody who deserves a break more and we expect him to come back
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.040]   soon.
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:20.040]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:22.400]   And it's funny that the post that we see on the screen here was really funny.
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.480]   He's like, no, really.
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:25.640]   I just wanted to spend some time with my friend.
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:28.960]   He says, you know, when there's some problem that they're going to spend time with their
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:29.960]   family.
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:30.960]   No, really.
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:31.960]   He just wants to spend some time with his family.
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:32.960]   It's true.
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:33.960]   He's the one guy I believe.
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:34.960]   Yeah, right.
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:35.960]   All right.
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:38.360]   A couple of quick numbers real quick.
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:42.560]   Google Cloud Storage is going to offer two terabytes of storage per year free to its
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:43.560]   customers.
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:46.960]   Point of that being that the cost of storage is getting towards zero rapidly.
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:49.520]   Two terabytes for nothing is phenomenal.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:50.520]   Second number.
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:56.520]   35.6 million tweets about the Germany Brazil game in the World Cup, most popular for sports
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:58.020]   game ever.
[01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:00.440]   But the number of the week I wanted to do was this one.
[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:05.440]   Google just spent $600 million on real estate just in Mountain View.
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:09.280]   And that also speaks to the value of real estate in Mountain View.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:11.320]   I probably got him two sheds.
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:16.760]   But that amazes me and the amount of space that Google needs and it almost makes me wonder
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:20.480]   about whether given all the hell Google was getting because of the buses and San Francisco
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:21.480]   I'm fanist.
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:25.080]   I started fantasizing after I read this of Google condos.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:26.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:27.080]   Right.
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:29.660]   So imagine you start to really live in the company store.
[01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:31.120]   What would Google apartments be like?
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:32.760]   Wouldn't that be the coolest thing?
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.600]   Wouldn't you work for them just so you could live in one?
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.200]   They're not doing that with this real estate.
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:37.200]   But I wish they would.
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.200]   I wish they'd build.
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:44.040]   You know, and then you can imagine the sitcom about living with Google all day long.
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.960]   I just, you know, there'd be probably no garbage.
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:47.960]   There'd be robots.
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:50.880]   You'd have slides instead of stairs.
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:51.880]   Exactly.
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:52.880]   You'd sleep in a pod.
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:57.720]   And so you'd imagine a Roomba with Project Tango tablet kind of mounted to it.
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:00.120]   Just constantly indexing your stuff.
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:01.120]   Yeah.
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:02.120]   Yeah.
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:03.120]   Don't you want this?
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.120]   Right?
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:05.120]   Yeah.
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:06.120]   Self-driving flying cars to go from sky.
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:10.360]   So one of the thing that I started fantasizing about because apparently according to this article
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:15.120]   Google is interested in building buildings that are taller than what's allowed by Mountain
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:16.120]   View law.
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:17.800]   And they're working on changing those laws.
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:21.400]   And I personally think that Silicon Valley ought to have lots of skyscrapers.
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:24.640]   I mean, I think that the value of real estate is so high there's so many people who want
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:25.640]   to live there.
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:31.240]   Earthquake technology is so good these days that you can build all kinds of tall buildings.
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:32.400]   And why not?
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:37.840]   These communities used to be lovely orchard farming communities.
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:42.080]   Nowadays for the most part there are a bunch of strip malls and track housing.
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:43.080]   They're not.
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:46.280]   It's Silicon Valley is not a pretty place.
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:48.120]   It's okay.
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:51.360]   But it's not something that's precious and needs to be preserved.
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:55.360]   I'd rather see the Jetsons city of the future erecting Mountain View.
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:56.360]   Yeah.
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:00.120]   And you support some more residential, you know, outside of San Francisco than do you deflate
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.600]   some of the issues there?
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.440]   You support more offices down there.
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:06.040]   You know, is that an issue?
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:09.480]   I think it has some opportunity.
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:12.200]   But so so Google just keeps growing and growing and growing.
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:15.480]   I also think there's something too, though, wherever I'm very happy to have a large Google
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:17.160]   office here in New York.
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:20.320]   And I think the part of the answer for Google and all of San Francisco fight is also to
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:23.880]   have more people elsewhere than the Valley.
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:25.600]   Yeah, that's true as well.
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:29.440]   And of course, Apple's really up the ante with their spaceship campus, which is well
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:30.440]   underway now.
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:31.880]   The construction is happening.
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:34.000]   The circular floor plan has already been built.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.320]   And when that thing is done, supposed to be done next year, I don't believe it.
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:41.800]   I think it'll probably be done 2016, 2017, something like that.
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:45.160]   But when it's done, it's going to be amazing.
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:48.880]   And I think that Google's going to want to step it up and have a spectacular campus
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:49.880]   to match it.
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:52.960]   Right now, Google probably has the coolest campus in the Valley.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:55.400]   The Google plaques, they have big dinosaur statues.
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.200]   And it's a really cool place to be.
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:02.120]   But when Apple's spaceship goes live, I think Google's going to want to step it up.
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:05.440]   And I hope the city of Mountain View lets them build whatever they want.
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:07.000]   I'd be curious to see what they do.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.080]   And by the way, Apple, to its credit, it shwags stores open to the public.
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:13.960]   Googles, you have to get an S-court in there.
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:18.960]   I think these companies are all missing on a beat not having public shwagging stores.
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.600]   So I want to go to the wall.
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:22.760]   Well, Apple knows how to do retail, that's for sure.
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:23.760]   Yes, that's true.
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:26.360]   They do secrecy, but they also do retail.
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.720]   And that's the difference.
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:31.080]   Their campus is actually going to let them up the secrecy because right now, there are
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:34.880]   all these leaks that are caused by people taking pictures of the banners that they put
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:37.960]   up at Moscone in San Francisco before they do an event.
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:40.600]   Future events are going to take place on the campus underground.
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:41.600]   And so, really?
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:42.600]   Yes.
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:43.920]   So they know that piece.
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:46.960]   And that will also enable them to have events that are unscheduled.
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:50.520]   Right now, you have to book Moscone like two years in advance or something like that.
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:53.680]   In the future, they'll be able to basically put out a press release and say we're announcing
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:55.200]   something at two o'clock.
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:59.040]   And of course, the Silicon Valley press will come rushing in and they'll announce in surprise.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:02.040]   That's a huge amount of floor space to just have in case.
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:03.040]   Wow.
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:04.040]   Yep.
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:05.040]   Yep.
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.040]   Underground parking, lots of stuff.
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:07.400]   That's going to be a really cool campus.
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:11.280]   Everybody focuses in on the fact that there's a big gigantic circular building with these
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:14.120]   crazy opening and closing windows and stuff like that.
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:18.600]   The coolest stuff is this kind of underground, they have a whole underground freeway under
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:19.600]   this thing.
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:22.320]   So it's going to be a really great campus.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:24.640]   Well, that is Twig.
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:29.480]   I want to thank everyone for coming on this show today and joining us today.
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:33.080]   Jeff Jarvis, professional of journalism at the City University of New York, author of

[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.080]   Thank you so much, Jeff.
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.280]   And thanks for sharing your mark into your office.
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:45.280]   I think you had to break into your office with a crowbar, right?
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:48.280]   No, I had to break into the network with a crowbar, but that's another story.
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:49.280]   All right.
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:53.840]   And Gene at your panty creator of thinkup.com, host of Twits, all about Android and the founding
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:54.840]   editor of Life Hacker.
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:56.960]   And we got a little bit of Life Hacker trivia today.
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:59.000]   That was cool.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000]   We did.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000]   We did.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   Thank you so much, Mike.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000]   This was a lot of fun.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.320]   Well, thank you for covering while he has been out.
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:05.320]   Thank you so much.
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:06.480]   It's been my pleasure.
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:12.280]   I said this about Twit the other day, but Leo makes this look so easy and it's not.
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:16.160]   And it's a testament to how well he does the show and all of his shows.
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:18.520]   So can't we till he comes back?
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:19.520]   And I thank you all.
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:20.560]   Thank you all for listening.
