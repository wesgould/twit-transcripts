[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.600]   It's time for Twig this week in Google with a man in the hat.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.760]   He looked like a confused shiner, Jeff Jarvis, who--
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.600]   that's your Twitter hat.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.200]   I like it.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.600]   I love it.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.360]   It's very handsome.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.320]   It's very attractive.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.840]   It's very attractive.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.560]   Gina, I'm sorry that you don't have yours with you.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.520]   I feel like going to a convention with other party people
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.360]   and having a lot of drinks and having secret handshakes.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.400]   Well, if you did, I would be the grand poo-boo,
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.840]   because as you can see mine is taller than all the rest.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.680]   I have the super twit-fez.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.720]   You know, it's so big we're going to have to zoom out.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.520]   Zoom out a little bit.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.280]   There we go.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.280]   There you go.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.400]   Tap on the author.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.160]   What would Google do?
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.880]   He also blogs at buzzmachine.com to his left, hat less.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.120]   But nonetheless, we're so glad to have her Gina Trapani.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.320]   So sad I'm a fuzzless.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.720]   I didn't take it on the road.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.840]   I'm on the road for vacation to see the family.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.760]   But 2011, I'm rocking the fuzz.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.800]   We'll take it off now.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.520]   We can feel comfortable.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.320]   Yeah, we'll take it off.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.120]   No, Fez is a--
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.080]   No, which one of these is not like the other?
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.000]   Fez-free episode.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.400]   Well, for many reasons, I--
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.960]   Fair enough.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.400]   Yes.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.640]   Great to have you both.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.960]   The last episode of the year, next week,
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.960]   we are going to do a best-of episode.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.960]   Our viewers voted on their favorite bits
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.080]   from previous episodes, including some gleeking out.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.720]   Awesome.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.200]   Some chipotle.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.640]   I can't wait to see that.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.840]   And more, yes, it'd be a lot of fun.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.040]   Let's get to the end news.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.920]   And there's quite a bit of news.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.080]   I guess the biggest story-- and I'd
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.120]   love to get your opinion on it.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.560]   I know everybody listening would too.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.880]   Yesterday, the FCC approved a net neutrality regulation
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.080]   that made no one happy.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.880]   I mean, literally.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.520]   I don't think-- [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.880]   I don't think-- I don't think--
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.320]   anybody liked it.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.120]   Republicans hated it because it was regulation of the internet.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.440]   Democrats hated it because it wasn't enough regulation
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.680]   of the internet.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.240]   Actually, I'll tell you who liked it.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.560]   Google and Verizon.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.840]   No, even Verizon is talking about--
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.880]   this is bloody Verizon's plan, and Verizon's whining about it.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.520]   What?
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.280]   Well, no, that's just-- that's just poor sports.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.640]   They are talking about Sweden.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.200]   Isn't it?
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.960]   On what grounds?
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.880]   Just because it hurts them.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.120]   Hey, we can't like it.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.120]   No.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.640]   No.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.240]   No, we can't.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.120]   We would everyone to do--
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.960]   or we'll take our ball and our wire and we'll go home.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.840]   We knew, we knew, we knew.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.840]   Well, now-- why did I start that?
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.760]   Doopie dog moment.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.680]   Just to my understanding of what this proposed regulation is,
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.400]   is that there would be so-called net neutrality
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.480]   enforced on landline internet service providers,
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.600]   like Comcast, but not on mobile providers.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.120]   Did I get that wrong?
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.640]   Isn't Verizon a mobile provider?
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.160]   That's what's so disgusting about this.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.400]   But yeah, that was the Sudan land split
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.440]   that Verizon and Google did.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.960]   Right.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.040]   And in fact, I would say--
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.680]   you know, somebody pointed out, I think it was MG
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.160]   Seagler on TechCrunch that language that must have come
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.280]   from the Google Verizon proposed agreement
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.200]   was in there saying, well, Android's open,
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.400]   so you don't have to worry about net neutrality, which makes
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.600]   no sense at all.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.920]   No.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.420]   No.
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.920]   No.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.920]   No.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.420]   No.
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.920]   That's whatsoever.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.760]   It's crazy.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.240]   And what's so--
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.480]   So this is basically what they proposed, right?
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.160]   I mean, this is--
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.680]   This is the Google-- this is the Google Verizon deal, is it not?
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.320]   Yep.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.680]   Yep.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.960]   Google's hands are dirty.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.640]   Dirty, dirty, dirty.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.800]   And I'm very ashamed of you, Google.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.360]   And I'm more ashamed--
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.520]   I've also ashamed of the FCC that they didn't make any of this
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.400]   process open.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.920]   Oh, yes, we could go and yield Ash, your colleague,
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.640]   Skollabewell.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.240]   Did you give suggestions on the site?
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.080]   I don't care.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.960]   They didn't give us the stuff that we could have argued about
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.600]   and dealt with as it went.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.280]   Even when they approved the thing yesterday,
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.120]   they didn't make it public what they approved.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.040]   It's now up online.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.960]   And I put that up on the--
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.040]   You have to read it, though.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.040]   I mean, you know.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.440]   Yeah, we got to do this long thing.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.720]   It's particularly a while.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.040]   But it's just transparent.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.200]   A lot of people commented on the website.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.520]   And Woz, remember, wrote them an 1800 page--
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.400]   1800 word email.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.920]   Public knowledge caught him after the vote.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.240]   I think he was actually there in the chambers to watch this.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.520]   Happened Steve Woznick, the founder of Apple
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.960]   and the original geek.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.440]   We're here with Steve Woznick, who's a co-founder of Apple.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.440]   And we heard from Commissioner Cops
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.280]   that the order didn't go nearly far enough.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.520]   We heard from Commissioner McDowell that it went much too far.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.640]   What are your thoughts?
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.920]   I think it's nice to see people standing up
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.120]   for the people, the consumers.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.840]   And given them protections against a lot of big business,
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.640]   I don't think you're going to find hardly any American,
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.160]   aside from a lawyer or somebody who's
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.280]   got a political side, who would ever
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.880]   say that they could trust the actions of the major carriers,
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.360]   the phone companies, the cable companies that we have today.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.040]   I think pretty much whenever those companies are given some leeway,
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.280]   we wind up feeling kind of taken advantage of,
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.840]   screwed, given misinformation, deceived
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.200]   about what we're getting versus what we could have gotten.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.640]   I think that all the comments of the minority side
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.480]   could have been made just as effectively back when AT&T
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.480]   was just awful, monopoly that kept us
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.720]   from any innovation in the telephone world,
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.400]   kept anybody from connecting to their lines up to the card
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.800]   vision.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.160]   He could have made those exact statements in that time frame.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.040]   It works.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.720]   We got a real success.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.360]   Well, he's got a point, but we didn't get quite what we wanted,
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.080]   either.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.960]   And I don't think we have a Carter Vision case,
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.160]   although maybe Verizon sues.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.880]   And Lucy, we'll have the courts behind us.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.880]   Well, I don't understand here politically why the FCC,
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.640]   the Democratic Commissioners, new the Republicans,
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.920]   were going to go along.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.720]   They knew this is going to end up in court anyway.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.280]   Why didn't they go ahead and push this
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.880]   to its proper definition?
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.520]   They said it was a compromise with whom were they compromising?
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.240]   Not us.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.480]   I hate to say it, but this is how the Obama administration
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.640]   has worked the entire two years.
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.560]   They're compromising with strawmen who still vote no.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.280]   It doesn't make any sense at all.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.000]   Gina, you were going to say something?
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.720]   I'm confused about why Verizon's suing,
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.320]   if this is basically what they proposed.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.640]   Because they're gree sons of bitches.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.600]   I also-- can we talk about the Android connection?
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.160]   What is that?
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:47.480]   I am right now--
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.480]   By the way, it's Nile Patel.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.880]   It's Nile Patel in Engadget.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.920]   I want to give credit where credit's due.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.560]   The paragraph he's talking about,
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.440]   further, this is in the FCC's decision.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.880]   We recognize there have been meaningful recent moves
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.640]   toward openness, including the introduction
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.920]   of open operating systems like Android.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.000]   In addition, we anticipate soon seeing the effects
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.680]   on the market of openness conditions
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.200]   we imposed on mobile providers that operate in the upper 700
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.440]   megahertz C-block spectrum.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.280]   We, by the way, was Google, who insisted on those, which
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.880]   includes Verizon Wireless, one of the largest mobile carriers
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:19.800]   in the US.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.520]   In light of these considerations, we conclude
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.600]   it's appropriate to take measured steps at this time
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.800]   to protect the openness of the internet
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.480]   when access through mobile broadband.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.680]   When they say measured, they mean none at all.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.280]   Measure-- right.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.200]   It measures them all.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.320]   So they're defining openness as absolutely no rules at all.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.800]   So carriers can do whatever they want.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.320]   Well, and Android has nothing to do with it.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.400]   It makes no sense at all.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.840]   It doesn't make any sense at all.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.840]   There's no parallel there.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.160]   I'm still trying to understand what they mean by that.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.320]   Do they mean that any manufacturer can do whatever they
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.240]   want with Android?
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.800]   So when it's take the same approach with the network
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.920]   to see what happens, I'm confused.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.440]   You're not alone.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:08:59.920]   OK.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.640]   Well, in fact, I mean, I think that maybe it was MG who said,
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.760]   this means basically they took the Verizon Google
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.640]   proposal and cut and paste did.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.520]   Yet, here's not just found the reference
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:17.160]   that I think comes from National Journal through a link here
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.960]   that Verizon is basically questioning
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.400]   whether the FCC has any authority over broadband.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.520]   So they're going to use this as a chance to sue and say,
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.520]   you can't do anything to us.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.440]   Nothing.
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.400]   Well, thank you, Jeff.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:34.720]   Jeff filed a Freedom of Information Act petition saying,
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.920]   we want to see the correspondence between the FCC,
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.200]   Google, and Verizon.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.960]   And any correspondence relating to this,
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.200]   and meeting notes, and meeting schedules between the FCC
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.680]   and any company, including but not limited to technology
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.840]   companies, Google, and telecommunications companies,
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.200]   Verizon.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.560]   And we want to open this to this.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.720]   I filed it for you a few years ago with the FCC
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.920]   when it came to them going after so-called indecent programming,
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.640]   finding out that it was very, very few people who complained.
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.400]   And so we'll see what happens here.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.040]   The government is very good at not responding to the FCC.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.360]   For you, this is ridiculous that we have no transparency
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.320]   in this process.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.480]   And by the way, you say, I'm willing to pay up to $250,
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.080]   whatever it takes.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.280]   Whatever it takes.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.280]   We'll do a fundraiser on the--
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.360]   I think you get enough--
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.680]   I'll promise you, whatever amount--
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.120]   I guess they charge $25 per search item or something.
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.240]   It should cost nothing because it's for press.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.440]   We are press.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.240]   It should cost nothing.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.080]   It's right.
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.360]   Yep.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.360]   Oh, I guess so you get a waiver.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.880]   That's why you put it in the map,
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.240]   but you also have to a waiver.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:50.920]   Good.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.800]   Well, I hope that I know that the FCC will pay close attention
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.720]   to this and respond immediately.
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.320]   So what do we get?
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.160]   Did we get true-- let me ask.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.480]   And I know we're still reviewing this document, which
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.720]   is now just now up.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.080]   Did we get true net neutrality, at least for Comcast
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.440]   and the land-based internet service providers?
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.840]   I can't tell it has words like no unreasonable
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.360]   discrimination, but what's the definition of unreasonable?
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.680]   Yes, that's kind of a problem, isn't it?
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.040]   So it says below that pay for priority
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.400]   unlikely to satisfy the no reasonable discrimination rule.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.360]   I don't know what that means.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.120]   The double and triple negatives are confusing me
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.080]   in a terrible way.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.400]   I need my says back on this.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:38.840]   So if they go to a provider like level three and say,
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.960]   you will have to pay us for priority access to our customers,
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.000]   that, according to this regulation,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.120]   is a violation of net neutrality.
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.400]   Here's the sentence.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.760]   A commercial arrangement between a broadband provider
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.440]   and a third party to directly or indirectly favor
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.920]   some traffic over other traffic, dot dot dot,
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.720]   would raise significant cause for concern.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.040]   Yes.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.120]   That's a very odd way to write a law.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.400]   So now the courts can say, well, it's struck down
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.520]   for being vague.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.440]   We're concerned.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.280]   We're concerned.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.440]   We're wringing our hands.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.560]   We're concerned.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.440]   Doesn't mean we're going to stop you.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.000]   We're concerned.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.960]   Priority would represent a significant departure
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.320]   from historical and current practice.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.320]   Let me, though, point out that John Perry Barlow and others,
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.840]   libertarians most, say, well, fine.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.240]   We don't want any internet regulation.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.160]   I mean, it's true that I mean, I hate--
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.280]   If we had competition, I would absolutely agree.
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.080]   The problem is that this is in lieu of competition.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.240]   We're stuck with monopolies and do monopolies.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.280]   And when they do violate the market, we have nowhere to go.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.600]   And there is no competition.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.000]   No.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.840]   And there is no recourse.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.640]   And this is the specter that is now
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.880]   raised by this is a company like Verizon might very well say,
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.120]   well, we'll charge you $0.10 a megabyte if you watch
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.880]   YouTube videos or Twit.
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.400]   But we won't charge you at all if you
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.200]   watch our own VCAST product.
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.320]   Right.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.400]   Or we could even block YouTube because, well, we
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.640]   have to protect our networks.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.600]   And people are watching an awful lot of YouTube videos.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.840]   We know that, in fact, AT&T asked Apple
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.800]   to restrict YouTube videos to 10--
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.640]   what was it?
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.640]   10 or 30 seconds on the iPhone, Apple said,
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.600]   but Apple is in a rare position of power with AT&T.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.720]   I don't think Motorola or HTC is going
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.080]   to be able to say anything if Verizon goes to them and says,
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.240]   yeah, by the way, no YouTube videos.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:46.760]   No Twit.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.640]   None of this Twit crap.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.280]   Those guys, we don't like those guys.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.640]   And that's the real problem, is this raises.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.400]   So I just got this from somebody sent this to me,
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:03.160]   Fadrinhort on Twitter, the reaction of the telecos.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:07.520]   I'll retweet that right now via Engadget.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.360]   Retweet.
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.800]   And so the Verizon's funny.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.560]   It says, although we share with the FCC
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.400]   the overarching goals of an open internet,
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.760]   we are deeply concerned by today's 3-2 decision.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.040]   Everybody's concerned.
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.880]   We are the one who's going to be concerned.
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.880]   We are the one who's going to be concerned.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.880]   This is a smokescreen.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.640]   They're in secret, opening the bubbly,
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.280]   jumping up and down, wearing funny hats.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.120]   But they have pretending that they're deeply concerned.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.040]   Ha ha ha ha!
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.240]   We won, we won, we won!
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:37.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.080]   But you know, it's all tied in, not to get too meta here,
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.200]   but it is tied in WikiLeaks.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.600]   It is tied into the idea on climate-
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.000]   Yes, the climate-
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:48.920]   Enclosed networks.
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.800]   The climate has changed thanks to Julius Assange.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.720]   And government now is a little bit more,
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.440]   it's a terrorist-win kind of thing.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.920]   They're a little bit more likely to assert control
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.600]   over the internet.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.960]   They don't, you know?
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.520]   Yeah, that internet, you know, it could be a bad thing.
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.320]   It is our greatest tool of disruption.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.280]   Thus, the disruptors will disrupt it.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.360]   They won't let us use it.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.240]   And I sound like I'm about to start
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.640]   singing the international and go to Woodstock.
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.960]   I know.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.320]   But you start to believe this, that it is powerful.
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.760]   Institutions are going to be against this disruptor of power.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.720]   And you know, here's the thing, and this is why it really
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.240]   is appropriate meat for this show,
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:36.880]   is I had high hopes that Google, because of their deep,
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.400]   rooted interest in net neutrality,
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.680]   would be fighting on the side of the angels on this.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.080]   And there was a powerful ally for us,
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.480]   and now they've abandoned us.
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.920]   If anyone was going to do it, right?
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:48.640]   That would be that.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.160]   That would be good.
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.200]   That was it.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.680]   So we have no institution we can rely on,
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.760]   and we have no organization of the people of the internet
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.840]   to rely on.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.000]   And so that's somewhat our own fault.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   And we're going to get hammered.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:03.880]   Happy holidays.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:07.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Well, I was the Grinch.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   You know, I--
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.560]   Should we do a version of "Sues the Grinch" with Google's
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.560]   "The Grinch"?
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.560]   Yes, we should.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.560]   One, "Sues the Grinch."
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.080]   She looked good in green, by the way.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:20.600]   She did.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.600]   She did.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.520]   People are going, wait a minute, what?
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.520]   All we need is a bit of Chipotle.
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.080]   Full circle.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.240]   I am mad at you guys, because I've
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.520]   been craving Chipotle for an entire week.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.120]   It will work.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.120]   Chris, yo!
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.800]   Our plan.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.000]   I'm not kidding.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.440]   There's something in there.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.240]   They coat those chips with crack or something.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.880]   This is a story that we actually had last week.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.200]   And I think it's still going on.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.080]   YouTube said to be in talks to buy Next New Networks, which
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.800]   is the video--
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.200]   kind of like a video aggregator, except that they produce
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:01.720]   some content.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.800]   So they're actually a producer.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.080]   Yeah, they're actually a producer.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.640]   Which I think is-- and Fred Seibert, who started it,
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.560]   is a great guy.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.800]   And the other staff there is great.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:10.800]   And so I'm not--
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.920]   I'm all in favor of them getting a good deal.
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.040]   But I think it puts Google in a terrible position
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.520]   of now creating its own content.
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:22.480]   And they will get accused of favoring their own stuff,
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.400]   which they get accused of anyway.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.560]   And it can help them in discussions with media.
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:30.560]   When asked--
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.080]   That's true.
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:35.080]   When asked last month if YouTube would consider acquisitions
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.480]   of web video production companies,
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.480]   Eric Schmidt said, quote, you never say never.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.320]   We've tried not to cross that line.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.440]   But he said, he noted that YouTube had helped finance web
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.760]   video production in the past.
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.080]   But quote, to actually own the content
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.760]   is an important decision.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.480]   He didn't say no.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.960]   We're always debating these things.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.520]   He said, the good news right now is there's
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.160]   enough of these little digital studios that can raise capital.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.640]   And they say YouTube is a viable distribution point,
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.680]   by the way, that's what we do.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:11.880]   I'm not sure why would they even want to buy next new networks?
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:17.040]   Do they do--
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.640]   Auto Tune The News was out of the Gregory Brothers.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.800]   Yeah, they do--
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.440]   Ben and Truder's song.
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.600]   That was the number one video of the year.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.600]   It's--
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.560]   They do the political jokes.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.400]   And they do the do-it-yourself fashion stuff.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.480]   So they do all their content next new networks,
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.040]   or do they aggregate some?
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.680]   They hire people to do it.
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:37.680]   They hire.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.600]   So they are a production, basically, a production company.
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.280]   Yeah.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:43.280]   Yeah, indie mogul, Fastlane Daily.
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.200]   What's the one that's so great?
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.760]   I'm forgetting that.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.280]   Darn.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.200]   I forget the name of it.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:48.880]   They do a great--
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.000]   Angry Orange, is that theirs?
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:50.500]   No.
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.520]   So they do a fashion one that's a lot of fun,
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.960]   not that I would know anything about that.
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:54.920]   Threadbanger.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:55.760]   Threadbanger.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.200]   I just like the--
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.200]   Threadbanger.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.440]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.400]   It's how to make stuff yourself.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.200]   You can tell that's what I do.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.840]   So what about this notion that Google
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.480]   does favor its own content?
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:11.080]   When you do a Google search for a lot of products,
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:14.000]   what you get is a list of Google stuff first,
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.880]   whether it's YouTube or places.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.480]   Isn't that favoring your own content?
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.520]   How is that OK?
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.360]   Every website links to its own content.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.160]   And if Google knows that its content,
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.440]   knows most about its content.
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:29.320]   If it thinks that it's the best result, then it should show it.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.160]   I don't have a problem with that.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.920]   Well, Google's not the New York Times, though.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.640]   Google's not the Post.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.840]   Isn't it a search engine?
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:35.960]   Isn't it different than--
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:36.880]   Is that what Yahoo was?
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.320]   Yahoo, Yahoo, since it's firehose,
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.480]   as they proudly call it, to their own stuff?
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.840]   Well, but I think that's the question.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.080]   Is Google a content creator or a search engine?
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.240]   If it's a search engine, it needs to be content agnostic.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.560]   Yes, Leo, but let's remember that they
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.480]   not to become the Google defender here.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.560]   I've just been kicking them.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:59.200]   But that's the rule they came up with.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.520]   If you look back to what Bill Gross created and Yahoo
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:09.520]   bought in-- what's the name of their placed ad structure?
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.400]   Back in the day, search was for sale.
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.400]   Google came along and changed that precedent
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.760]   to decide that it wasn't.
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.240]   The main question for Google, I don't
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.880]   think is a matter of unfairness to companies.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.240]   It's a question of their credibility with their users.
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.480]   Absolutely.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.440]   I mean, Google's tried to launch-- like, null, right?
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.800]   That's always the thing that I think of when I think of Google
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.240]   trying to create or host content.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.800]   And if they were truly being biased,
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.800]   you'd be seeing null pages above Wikipedia pages.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.240]   But you don't, right?
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:42.080]   I mean, it's like they-- I trust that they make good decisions
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.240]   about what are the best things to show at the top of results.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.080]   And you know what I see?
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.520]   Google ads and those benefit Google at the top of search results.
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.360]   And I accept that.
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.240]   I mean, those are clearly marked.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.400]   And that's a different story.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.560]   But for the most part, I'm not worried about Google favoring.
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.480]   I'm not worried about Google favoring its own content.
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.960]   As someone who's run a website for many years
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.160]   and has had great Google placement because it had good content.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:01.680]   Right.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.120]   They've treated me fairly.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.960]   You wouldn't be so happy if Google started a life hacker site.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.080]   And then every time somebody searched for the best way
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:13.200]   to take text notes and their site came up first, though, would you?
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.360]   Yeah, that would bum me out.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.520]   If I-- I suppose I'd be up in arms if I felt like they're--
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.440]   the page that they were-- their own page, if it was worse than
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.120]   then life hackers are my own blog.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.120]   I guess that would upset me.
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:25.640]   I don't know.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.800]   I never spent-- I never spent too much time trying to figure out
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.120]   what the SEO algorithms is.
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:32.120]   But I've had great success with Eureka content.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.680]   It shows up in search results period.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.800]   Webby in our chat room said, yeah, when you do those fords ads,
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.520]   Leo, you should also say Chevy's not so bad either.
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:46.280]   And we do-- I mean, we're a content creator.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.520]   So we're a content creator.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.440]   And we do-- I mean, we're a content creator.
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.960]   So of course, we plug our stuff.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.160]   And we refer to our stuff.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.600]   But we're not trying to be somehow content agnostic.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.720]   I guess that's really-- that's that next new networks
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:01.480]   issue exactly, which is if they're a content creator,
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.360]   then they no longer can be a reliable search engine
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.880]   because they have a dog in that hunt.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.680]   You know, they still could be, but they'll always
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:10.960]   be on a suspicion.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.280]   That's the issue.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.440]   If they say, well, really, Threadbanger
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.760]   is the best DIY fashion site.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.520]   And somebody else says, no, I think mine's better.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.400]   They find themselves in a qualitative discussion
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.400]   they can't really have.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:26.400]   Well, but they're not putting it in the actual normal search
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:26.800]   results.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:27.960]   They're putting it above them.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.440]   They put the place-- you search for a dentist.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:34.160]   They put the places stuff first.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.800]   It is separated a little bit from the search results, isn't it?
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.280]   I mean, it's some cases, right?
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:42.800]   Go ahead.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:43.280]   It's some cases.
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.800]   I mean, if you do weather and your zip code,
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.960]   Google's going to answer you, right?
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.520]   Google's going to just try and give you
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.080]   the best content.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.560]   And that's appropriate.
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:50.840]   Right.
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.240]   And that is absolutely appropriate.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:56.280]   I mean, am I upset that-- or definitions, that kind of thing.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.360]   I'm upset that I don't have to do another click
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.200]   to get a definition.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.400]   No.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.040]   I mean, I guess it depends on--
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.080]   On the other hand, if Google started
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.640]   doing a dictionary in American Heritage didn't show up,
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.240]   but Google did, then you were American Heritage,
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.640]   you'd be upset.
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.080]   It put you out of business.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.880]   I mean, they grab-- you know, they aggregate definitions
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.680]   from all different online dictionaries, right?
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.760]   And kind of come up with the best one.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.760]   And that seems to be kind of the best one, right?
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.960]   When you do define, let's try it.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.200]   What if-- here's a great one from our chat room again,
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.640]   the 17R3W, which I think is his tire size.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.160]   He says, you're looking for the new Lady Gaga video.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.240]   There are two versions, one on Vimeo, one on YouTube.
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.520]   YouTube shows up first.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.440]   Identical videos.
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.080]   Is that OK?
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:45.400]   It is if you're not-- if you're Vimeo, it's not OK.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.440]   Wouldn't you be upset?
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.520]   So the argument is they're already in this position.
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:49.320]   So why not?
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:49.680]   They are already.
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.800]   Yeah, they already are.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:52.520]   Yeah.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:57.000]   And it's true that YouTube videos do show up first, don't they?
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.360]   YouTube is a-- I mean, YouTube has to be a more link
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.960]   to site than Vimeo.
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.040]   It's a much bigger video site.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.080]   Well, here's the question.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.480]   It's true.
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.680]   Here's a good one.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.000]   Knowing how much smaller buzz is-- remember buzz?
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.240]   And Twitter.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.240]   There's a good one.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:16.040]   What if the buzz results should have showed up higher than Twitter?
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.600]   Or showed up at all.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.120]   That's a good one.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.520]   That's a good one.
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.760]   That's a very good one.
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:23.280]   But do they?
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:24.320]   I don't know.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.520]   I don't know.
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.880]   And the social searches that lay out your results
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.520]   from your social circle, I think that maybe buzz shows up.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.760]   But it's primarily its Twitter.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.240]   Are you still using buzz?
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.640]   No.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.920]   There's nobody there.
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.960]   And by the way, as soon as I say that the five people who
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.600]   were there are going to flame me.
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.600]   Yeah, the buzz fans are a--
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.240]   You do not want to mess with them.
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.440]   You don't want to mess with them.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.000]   A couple of-- about a month ago, when I left Buzz
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.480]   in a fairly loud fashion as I am wants to do,
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.560]   they said, we're going to invade your chat room
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.320]   and take it over and ruin things.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.760]   And there was like three people.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:05.840]   It's not an-- it's not exactly anonymous.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:09.480]   Stephen Pearlstein writing in the Washington Post's time
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:13.680]   to loosen Google's grip in case you hadn't noticed.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.880]   Google isn't just a web search company anymore.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.760]   In addition to online advertising,
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:22.200]   it's moving into operating systems, application software,
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.160]   mobile telephone software, email, web browsers, maps, video
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.800]   aggregation, also in the process of assembling
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.360]   the world's biggest digital library of books
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.520]   and visual materials.
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.040]   Google portrays each line of new business
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.160]   as a logical extension of its core mission
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.320]   to expand-- if you define it broadly enough,
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.160]   I guess everything is-- to expand digital horizons
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.920]   in ways that allow people to use the internet
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.680]   to improve their lives, et cetera.
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.160]   I added the et cetera.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.120]   It's a noble goal.
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.440]   Google does it very well.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.240]   But how much bigger and more dominant
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:57.000]   do we want this innovative and ambitious company to become?
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.120]   There's nothing improper or illegal about Google's monopoly.
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.640]   It earned that dominance fair and square
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:05.840]   as IBM and Microsoft did before it, where I have a problem,
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.960]   however, is-- and this is, again, Stephen Perlstein,
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.200]   writing in the Washington Post, where I have a problem,
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.240]   however, is in allowing Google to buy its way
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.720]   into new markets and new technologies,
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.640]   particularly when the firms being bought already
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:21.600]   have dominant positions in their respective market niches.
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:25.840]   This is the case with the YouTube double-click and AdMob.
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.840]   ITA software, which is really being fought right now.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:32.560]   This is the travel software that Google spent 700 million
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.360]   for under review by the Justice Department.
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.640]   Would have been the case with Groupon.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.840]   Google apparently looking for a mini Groupon.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.280]   I still think Groupon is--
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.080]   We don't get it, but we're guys.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.560]   No.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.480]   Well, OK, so I don't need my hair removed and my nails done.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.720]   I talked to-- who did I talk to?
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.080]   Was it Veronica?
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.440]   I think it was Veronica Belmont, who said I use it every day.
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.240]   Wow.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.720]   Yeah, I'm just not a-- I'm a tomboy.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.240]   I'm just not a shopper, honestly.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.160]   I checked it out recently.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.760]   And I was just like, I don't know.
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.040]   I don't want to do a spa day with like 10 of my girlfriend.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.360]   You know, it's just not my thing.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.200]   Google responded--
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.440]   Don Harrison, Google's Deputy General Counsel,
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.800]   responded to the Prostine argument.
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.760]   He says, as companies make build versus buy decisions,
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.640]   sometimes it's possible to develop a new product in house.
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.040]   But other times, a company decides
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:29.160]   it can bring in a new product to market faster by acquiring.
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.880]   He says, consumers benefit from these acquisitions,
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.280]   like the acquisition of Keyhole, which
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.040]   led to the development of Google Earth, which
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:41.800]   was the first free satellite imagery application.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.120]   He says, look, we're not the only one.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:46.800]   Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook are also spending and buying
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:47.640]   and acquiring.
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:52.600]   Yeah, I don't know if I agree that there's an issue
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.680]   with Google making acquisitions here.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:55.640]   I think there is.
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.160]   I've had a shocking that a guy from the business section
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.520]   of "Watching the Post" is writing that.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.680]   Come on, what do you want them to do?
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.760]   They got billions in cash.
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.880]   Look at his own company.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.560]   How is the Washington Post still afloat?
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:08.440]   Because they went beyond their business and bought Kepler.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.280]   And they were a monopoly in Washington DC.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.920]   It's just absurd argument.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.720]   Well, let's take--
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.840]   It's this anti-Google thing now that pops up.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.600]   And now it's spreading in the US, I think.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:23.360]   The terrorists are winning.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.680]   But I don't want to defend Google today.
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.520]   I want to be pissed at gold today because of the FCC.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.000]   OK.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:29.960]   What do I have to be?
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.040]   OK, you figure out what you want to be.
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:35.640]   While you're doing that, let me mention Squirtspace.com.
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.680]   Actually, when we come back, I want
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.680]   to get you angry again, Jeff Jarvis,
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:44.480]   because the Wall Street Journal is back with more privacy
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.240]   allegations.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.600]   But we'll talk about that.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.840]   Oh, Jeff, we're just warming you up.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.760]   I just are winding you up, I guess I should say.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:57.400]   We need him to be green for the "Be the Grinch."
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.160]   Great.
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:28:59.600]   Look at this.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:00.640]   We're all dressed in black.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.640]   What is that all about?
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.080]   We're all wearing black.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.800]   It's the most depressing twig of the year.
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:04.320]   It is.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:04.800]   It is.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:08.240]   It's the most saddest twig of the year.
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.240]   I'll play some Glee music.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.440]   It'll cheer us up.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:16.240]   Boy, Sue really trashed that tree.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:16.920]   Aww.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.680]   Man, that she just--
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.160]   He did.
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.160]   But then-- and this was a little weird.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.920]   All of a sudden, she gets nice at the end.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.000]   Like--
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:25.880]   Yeah.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.040]   Yeah, time constraints.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.520]   There was a much longer script.
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.040]   I believe a block.
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.120]   Yeah, there was a much longer yard somewhere.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:33.640]   But it did.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.200]   We ran out of time.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.720]   Squarespace.com, my friends, the fast and easy way
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.560]   to publish a high quality website or block.
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:43.120]   Go there right now, squarespace.com/twig and take a look.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.080]   It is.
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:44.760]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.120]   This is such a great company.
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:53.760]   Both hosting and software unparalleled quality.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.640]   And you know, I have to confess, I'm a little prejudiced
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.440]   because they're so nice.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.760]   I love Anthony and Dane in the gang at Squarespace.
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.840]   They're just nice.
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:05.840]   You kind of-- you know, you love patronizing a company
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.600]   with people who are smart and care deeply
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.680]   and do the best work they can for you as a customer.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.880]   And that's really where Squarespace is itself.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.560]   Just take a look at the iPhone app.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.400]   Gosh, it's gorgeous.
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.200]   With the stats, it allows you to post,
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:23.840]   but it also allows you to review comments and block spam
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.760]   and so forth.
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:26.920]   Take a look at the template.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:30.160]   Oh, and by the way, just came out for the iPad.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.360]   Have you seen the new Squarespace for the iPad?
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.360]   It is.
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:34.880]   Oh, man.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.880]   Now this is a blogging platform.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.240]   I have to say, just fantastic.
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:44.200]   Well, you know, this is so cool.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.800]   While you're there, go to the examples
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.120]   and take a look at what people are doing
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.320]   with those incredible templates.
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:53.520]   There are 60 plus designer templates, really gorgeous templates.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.800]   But then on top of that, you can do
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:01.720]   anything you want with just drag and drop using Ajax.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.080]   So you don't have to be a designer
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.920]   to get a unique professionally designed site.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.520]   And if you are a designer, if you're good with CSS
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.680]   and JavaScript and all that, you're in the sky's the limit.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.800]   Nothing you can't do with this.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.040]   Here's my favorite.
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:18.800]   I know I'm not a shopper, but this is my favorite place
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.640]   to get lotions and notions, keels.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.600]   They have-- they use Squarespace for their site.
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.880]   And they're able to give it a unique style.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.320]   This is a massive retailer.
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.320]   And they use it.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.240]   You know, by the way, I saw them in Paris.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.240]   They were also in Paris, so we can do it in French.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.240]   Look at that, translated.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:44.480]   If you are interested in getting a space for yourself,
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.440]   your first web page or maybe a new idea,
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.400]   take a look at the secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.840]   Prices start low at $12 a month,
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.240]   then you could take 10% off right away by just using Twig
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.520]   as the offer code.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.680]   And that'll cut the price 10% for the life of your site.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.800]   Everything you're looking for in hosting and software
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:03.280]   and more.
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:08.600]   Squarespace.com, use the offer code Twig.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.040]   All right, let me see here.
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.880]   How can we get Jeff upset?
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:20.240]   So the Wall Street Journal-- this one seems reasonable to me,
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.440]   but I'll let you puncture it.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.480]   [MUMBLING]
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.360]   Wall Street Journal now admittedly in this privacy series,
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.760]   some of the stuff that they've come up with is just ridiculous.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:31.760]   But they point out that a number of apps,
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.320]   whether it's on Android or the iPhone, like Pandora,
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.640]   send information that really-- there's
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:39.600]   no reason for that app to send about you
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.600]   back to their advertisers.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:46.320]   Pandora, apparently, sends not only your unique identifier,
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.240]   but information, demographic information,
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:51.000]   too, to five different advertisers.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.560]   Your apps are watching you, says the Wall Street Journal.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:55.920]   Why is that OK, Jeff?
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.760]   Number one, they're not sending your phone number.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.520]   And they've never made that clear in the entire article.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.200]   They're freaking out thinking they know exactly.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.920]   They can call you and know your phone number.
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.320]   They're sending the phone's unique identifier, correct?
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.560]   The UDID, exactly, right.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:07.960]   Right.
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:08.320]   That's the one--
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.360]   Not a phone number.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.800]   As goes with this entire series in the journal,
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:15.240]   they're trying to lead people, let me in like down the--
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:18.080]   Yeah, but text plus for the iPhone.
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.440]   This iPhone sends your UDID.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:25.040]   But also, the phone's zip code, users age and gender.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.040]   OK.
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:26.520]   Guess what?
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.640]   It's ad targeting.
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.440]   You're going to target the ads better.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.360]   And if you can, you're going to get higher value.
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.600]   And we get more free stuff.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:38.120]   And I keep saying, go offline.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.520]   And you'll find this far worse.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:45.000]   Go to Axiom, Axiom, and try to buy names.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.920]   And I can go to Gina's zip code.
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:52.160]   And I can ask for every woman single between the ages of 18
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.280]   and 29 who have X income and X education.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.720]   And I can then get their names and addresses
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.760]   and send them things.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:02.040]   Compare that to what goes on here.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.440]   What's the real harm?
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.760]   We've got to get past this notion of merely--
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.800]   I don't like that creepiness.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.520]   Because it's actually less targeted to PII
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.160]   than it was in the past.
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:15.400]   And all it's really doing is giving the signals
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:19.520]   for targeted, thus higher value advertising.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:20.200]   Well, fine.
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:23.560]   If we want to turn on, do not browse on every possible thing,
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.320]   then we're going to make phone companies happy.
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:28.240]   Because you're going to be paying up the ying yang for stuff.
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:31.640]   You're getting this stuff free because of advertising.
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.840]   But if it's low value, all you're
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.520]   going to get is dancing monkeys and no value.
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.120]   Listen to this quote from the Chipper
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:42.000]   Meghan O'Hollering of Traffic Marketplace.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.080]   The great thing about mobile is you can't clear a UDID
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.560]   like you can, a cookie.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.320]   That's how we track everything.
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.640]   Ms. O'Hollering says traffic marketplace, which
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.800]   is a unit of Epic Media Group, monitors smartphone users
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.240]   whenever it can.
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:58.120]   Quote, we watch what apps you download,
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.600]   how frequently you use them, how much time you spend on them,
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.200]   how deep into the app you go.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:03.880]   Idiots.
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.560]   But you know, the other problem is--
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:09.400]   It isn't LinkedIn.
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.240]   She says the data is aggregated, not
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.200]   links to an individual.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:12.800]   Yeah, that.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:17.200]   And I do complain loudly, and I've done this with the industry,
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.620]   that they've done a god-awful job of being
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:20.880]   transparent about this stuff.
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:24.160]   And so that's what does freak people out, and that's a problem.
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.800]   Now, I was just writing up the section of the book
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.960]   when I talked to Philip Kaplan of Blippi,
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.760]   and he told a story of--
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.320]   everybody comes to him and says, well, what
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.720]   do people can see that you bought porn?
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:39.280]   And he said probably, A, who needs to anymore?
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.040]   That just shows how stupid you are.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.760]   Right, exactly.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.840]   B, I love pirating porn, because I know both.
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.280]   I'm doing good things for exploited women
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:52.520]   by undermining pornographers, and I'm getting my porn for free.
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:53.520]   There you go.
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:54.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:57.520]   It's a pitch estimation with the app.
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:58.520]   So he says--
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.080]   Protecting those women.
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:03.440]   You can say I'm screwing them both ways.
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:04.360]   But I wouldn't.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.040]   Oof, oof, oof.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:05.880]   I'm so sorry.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:07.280]   I'm so sorry.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:11.040]   So Pard decided to play with us as is his want,
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.720]   and he went to the Castro, which is the main street of gay
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.040]   America for the West Coast, right?
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.960]   And he went to the most sexual story
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:23.000]   you can find a store called Your Mother Doesn't Know.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.160]   Oh, dear.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.040]   And he bought stuff.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:28.000]   And so because he wanted to talk about--
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.040]   people said, so you went to a porn store.
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.120]   Woohoo.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:32.280]   You know why?
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.200]   What's the big deal?
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.360]   Everybody does.
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.520]   In fact, this is, I think, I would guess a big point
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:40.720]   in public parts is that this kind of transparency
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.560]   just reminds us we're all the same.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:48.640]   And it's a phony, it's a very faux kind of righteousness
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:51.440]   that says, oh, porn.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:55.200]   You know, it's the preacher who's got three boys in his closet.
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.200]   Yeah, you're not going to be using Blippi if you're going
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.440]   there, and you've got a problem with this.
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:01.200]   You're not going to be putting your tiffany's purchases up
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.640]   if you're buying something for your mistress.
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:07.520]   Although I have to admit that I forgot that I'm on Blippi.
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.800]   Oh, Leo.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.960]   So I actually, I probably shouldn't go over there
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.840]   at this point because I got only nose--
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:15.760]   40 fez's.
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.520]   Why would you have that on your credit card?
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:21.440]   He knows what my Blippi--
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:25.000]   I actually like Blippi because it is fun to see what people buy.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.280]   Yeah, and it now defaults to--
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.560]   if you look for the old one, it now
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.760]   defaults to approving every purchase.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:31.840]   Oh, it does.
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:32.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.680]   Well, I'll see that shows that there was some sensitivity.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.560]   Well, I also know.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:38.240]   But Missy Pod also said the reason that it works out for him
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.440]   is he discovered that if you had to review every purchase,
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:43.480]   you are more likely to put in reviews, which gives you more data.
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:45.760]   They've really focused on that.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.600]   In fact, they have a little game.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:48.720]   You get to the next level.
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.720]   If you review it and you say, well, I like this and blah, blah,
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:54.240]   blah, and then you can also publish it.
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:57.120]   So yeah, I think that they're actually getting quite--
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.200]   this is a free app.
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.560]   Do you think I'm not supposed to talk about this?
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.920]   You know, just to go back to the Wall Street Journal article,
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:06.120]   I'll admit that for a hot minute, it freaked me out.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.600]   Because I would install apps on my Android phone,
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:11.040]   and I see the list of things that it needs access to,
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.440]   my contacts, my location.
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:16.080]   It's not always clear why and what those apps are doing
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.200]   with that information.
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.960]   I wish that there was an explanation.
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:22.600]   I wish that Pandora would say, hey, we need access to your contacts,
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.400]   so you can share a playlist so that I would know.
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.560]   I mean, often I just agree and assume that it's first.
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.040]   So this is that I know.
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.040]   But then again, do we ever really know
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.640]   what a website is doing with our data?
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:37.280]   Forget the data that travels from your phone to the advertisers.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:40.760]   Once the web app has that data, what are they sharing with advertisers?
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.000]   So there's that issue.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.320]   And the other issue is all the stuff that advertisers know about you
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:49.040]   when you browse from your desktop computer, I mean, it's a lot of information.
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:52.280]   I don't know if you guys have seen the EFF project, Penopt-a-Click,
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:56.640]   where you think you're kind of footprint your browser based on a lot of information.
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.440]   Not only the user agent and the IP address,
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.000]   but your browser plug-in details, your screen resolution,
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.120]   your fonts installed.
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:03.600]   And if you look, I just ran it.
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:07.800]   My browser footprint right now is unique among 1.3 million.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:08.360]   Absolutely.
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:11.960]   So they really can track someone.
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:16.000]   I mean, this woman was sort of saying that she was so happy you couldn't delete your cookies so easily,
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.240]   because people couldn't delete their cookies on their browser.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:21.000]   But really, it's not that hard to track usage,
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.640]   given some sort of unique footprint on a regular browser.
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:26.720]   So I see, I'm really with you, Jeff.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:30.280]   Although I have to say, when I first saw that article, I was like, oh, crap.
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.680]   Do you want an interesting counter viewpoint?
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:36.040]   I thought this was-- the chatroom passed along a link to me
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:41.520]   to a blog by a guy named Don Marti, who is a longtime ad guy.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.680]   And he said, actually, targeting is not a good thing for advertisers.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.080]   It's a very interesting logic.
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:48.920]   I don't know if I can express this completely.
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:53.520]   But the point he makes is that by advertising, a company is saying,
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.320]   we do well enough.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:58.200]   We're signaling to consumers that we do well enough
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.480]   that our advertising costs can be recovered.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.400]   We are a high quality firm.
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.880]   Low quality firms don't advertise.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:10.120]   He says, the problem with targeted advertising is less expensive,
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:15.800]   so it doesn't signal as clearly as, say, a full page ad in The New York Times,
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.960]   which is not targeted.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.120]   Well, that's kind of backwards to me.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:23.800]   That's under that logic, then you would never do direct mail.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.000]   You'd do nothing but billboards on the street.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.680]   Yes.
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:28.680]   I don't think about that.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:29.680]   I don't think about it by that.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:30.680]   I don't think about it by that.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:31.680]   I don't think about it by that.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:32.680]   I don't think about it by that.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:33.680]   I don't think about it by that.
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:34.680]   I don't think about it by that.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:35.680]   I don't think about it by that.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:36.680]   I don't think about it by that.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:37.680]   I don't think about it by that.
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:38.680]   I don't think about it by that.

[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:16.680]   Let's talk about that in a second.
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:20.680]   Before I do that, I want to tell you what to do with your stuff.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.680]   The holidays are upon us.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:28.880]   You're probably going to get a whole new pile of good stuff and you have a lot of old stuff
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:30.080]   that you don't use anymore.
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.080]   What do you do with it?
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.080]   Well, don't sell it.
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:35.840]   Well, you could, but it's a lot easier to gazelle it.
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:38.480]   Get cash for your gadgets at gazelle.com.
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:43.040]   It's the fastest and easiest way to sell your electronics.
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:47.680]   If it's too old to get any money, well, they'll recycle it responsibly.
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.560]   No parts go in the landfill.
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:50.720]   None of it goes overseas.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:53.120]   It's all fully recycled.
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:54.200]   I just like going to the website.
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:57.640]   You can see, look, now being sold a gazelle customer from West Monroe, Louisiana just
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.800]   got $48 for her cell phone.
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.640]   I just love it.
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:04.880]   The category, products in many, many, many different categories.
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:10.880]   20 categories, 200,000 unique items, everything from Blu-ray players to PDAs to video games
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:11.880]   to tablets.
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:16.920]   I wonder if you had an old slate or something if you could sell that.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.160]   Who makes your item?
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.160]   Apple.
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:23.160]   Oh, these are, it'd be fun if you could, I wonder what my Newton's worth.
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:27.960]   Let's say I have a 16 gigabyte Wi-Fi iPad and I'm going to sell it because I'm getting
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:28.960]   ready for the new one.
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.800]   Yeah, they ask you a few basic questions.
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.400]   Nope, it works fine.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.200]   Nope, it works well.
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:36.440]   Yeah, some squares.
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:37.440]   No noticeable flaws.
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:38.720]   Looks like it's never been used.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.240]   Do you have the original goodies?
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.440]   By the way, I don't know if you've noticed, but they've redesigned this.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.440]   Look, $268 for that 16.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.440]   That's great.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.440]   Geez.
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:48.440]   I can recover a lot of that.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.680]   I'm going to cover my marriage.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:52.920]   You should have done this.
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:53.920]   So here's what you do.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.080]   Here's what you do.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:58.000]   You go through all your stuff and they send you a mailing labor.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.080]   You throw it all into a box.
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:01.240]   They pay the postage.
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:03.040]   They're product experts, rule of view it.
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.520]   They will remove all your data.
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.360]   They know how and they will remove all your data.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:09.000]   So you don't have to worry about that.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.600]   And then they send you a check.
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.080]   It's great for a charity too.
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:19.000]   Gazelle has nonprofit pages, which I think is a great idea.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.720]   They call it Gazelle for good.
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:26.320]   If you have a nonprofit or a charity, you can set up a page and have a gadget drive.
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.080]   Don't you love that idea?
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:29.080]   That's great.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:30.080]   Yeah.
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.280]   I think Gazelle is a really neat company.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.760]   We've been really happy to partner with them.
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:34.760]   I was skeptical.
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:37.480]   I admit it when they first came to us, I said, "Well, let me try this."
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:41.800]   I thought it might be like one of those cash for gold type of things.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:43.160]   So we sent a bunch of stuff back.
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:46.560]   And without telling them, it was secret.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:48.120]   We got the check with a lot of works.
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:52.720]   And now I got email from people all the time, tweets saying, "They sent me a bigger check."
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.080]   And they said they were going to when they saw it.
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:55.560]   I mean, this is a really neat company.
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:45:00.280]   You can have an intern do a Gazelle inventory of the cottage.
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.720]   Oh, thousands and thousands.
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:06.800]   Thousands and thousands of dollars worth of goodies in this cabinet alone.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:09.080]   Oh, and wait until you see my house.
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.400]   I've got drawers for what we all do.
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.760]   Do you have one of those wire drawers where you just throw?
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:14.760]   Yeah.
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:15.760]   The wire drawer, the hardware drawer.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:18.000]   Yeah, just throw crap in there.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.800]   And then there's like, it's like stratified.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.920]   So you can see like, oh, I can go back 10 years.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:22.920]   Look at that.
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:23.920]   Wow.
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.880]   That's really sad.
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:29.120]   I got to get an intern in Gazelle.
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:30.160]   gaz.e.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.160]   double le.com.
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:34.520]   And by the way, I'm going to give you a little heads up here.
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:40.400]   gaz.e.lle.com and you can get a 5% bonus over and above the amount of money they promise
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.400]   you.
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:48.640]   So just go through the whole thing and use the offer code at the end when you check out
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:52.960]   Twig TWIG and they'll give you 5% plus.
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:58.400]   Just a little thank you for coming to them from this week in Google.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.400]   Don't sell it.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.400]   Gazelle it.
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.600]   Nice new website too, by the way.
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:03.680]   All right, Gina.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.160]   Tell us what this shared spaces is.
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:09.120]   I saw this in the Google Wave blog, which is still around.
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:10.520]   We're just still going.
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:11.520]   Still around.
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:12.520]   Sharedspaces.googlelabs.com.
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:16.400]   So the thing about Wave is that it was a platform, right?
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.360]   Well, you could build gadgets on top of it, kind of little mini apps.
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:23.600]   The problem was, I think the barrier entry to Wave was so high that a lot of people just
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:25.160]   totally missed the gadgets.
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:27.760]   So shared spaces, you know, and it was a third party.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.200]   The third party developers could make these gadgets.
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:34.880]   So shared spaces is now kind of freeing, separating decouples the gadgets from Wave and just put
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:39.480]   some on a regular web page and you just, you know, you hit this button, create space
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:44.880]   and it's things like polls or, you know, let's plan an event together, pick the dates that
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:51.400]   you're free or mind mapping, but it's all real time with a real time chat, chat log kind
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:55.520]   of kind of enabled so people can sign in with their Google account and chat and list, that
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:56.520]   kind of thing.
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:58.400]   So look, I can use a shopping list.
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:00.400]   And so it's just a plug-in on this page.
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:03.760]   Right, it's just a plug-in on that page and you can share it with other people that other
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:08.480]   people can log on and you'll see their Google profile kind of icon at the top of the page
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:12.640]   and they can edit the list at the same time and it's got that, all that real time Wave,
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:15.360]   a goodness and there's chat that goes on.
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:19.480]   So you can very easily kind of post a tweet or post a blog post and say, you know, yes
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:21.360]   no maybe gadget was one of my favorites.
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.680]   Just ask a question and get a yes no maybe answer.
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:30.080]   That's just a simple poll, the Waffle gadget lets you plan an event, say hey, can you make
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:34.080]   it the 10th, the 12th or the 17th, you know, and then people just say these are the days
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:38.400]   I can make it so it makes it easy to choose a date and time.
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:44.360]   Map gadget, you can, you know, mark off places on a map if you're creating an event and multiple
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:45.520]   people can do this at the same time.
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.960]   So really decoupling the gadgets from Wave is a really, really good idea.
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.800]   It kind of, it still lets these gadgets live on and people use them because you know a
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.880]   lot of developers put a lot of work into Wave extension.
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.440]   So I'm really happy about this.
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.160]   I think it was a really good idea.
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:02.920]   And when you're done delete your space, I got like 800 shared spaces now I got to delete
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:03.920]   them.
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:06.920]   So there's quite a few.
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:11.360]   So is this every gadget done for Google Wave or how does this?
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:12.360]   No, not actually.
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:13.360]   There's quite a few.
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:16.680]   There is quite a few and actually, yeah, I was just looking at the featured page.
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:18.920]   You can see there's there's productivity game.
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:23.680]   So I'm not sure how they made decision which ones to do, but it looks like they really
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.200]   hit on the most popular ones.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:28.320]   These are certainly most of the ones that we wrote up in the book.
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:33.240]   Oh, so maybe we should put the book back on the market.
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:40.000]   Yeah, I mean, really, it's much easier to say go click create space rather than go into
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.560]   Wave and hit the boss.
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:43.200]   This is kind of a way you should have been, huh?
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:45.400]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:46.400]   So let's see.
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:47.400]   I'm going to.
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:48.400]   So there's some games.
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.400]   Roll some dice.
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:50.400]   This is good.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:52.720]   We could do Dungeons and Dragons.
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:54.080]   This is really neat.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:56.600]   And I noticed it links into buzz when you do it.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:49:00.560]   So I guess that's where the, I don't know, maybe the tweet goes or something.
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.160]   Yeah, you can share it on buzz.
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:03.160]   Right.
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:04.160]   So it's a really good.
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:07.960]   So yesterday I tweeted, hey, do you think that shared spaces is good for Wave gadgets?
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:14.000]   And I had 25 people come into my yes, no, maybe gadget and vote and then chat about
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   what they thought.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.800]   Which was a really nice like impromptu kind of get together live space.
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:21.800]   So yeah, I think it was a nice, nice reincarnation.
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:22.800]   What do you have?
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:27.000]   Gina, I know you need to, I know you need to take off Gina.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.360]   I hate to do this to you.
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:29.360]   Oh, no, that's okay.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.760]   Why don't you give us before you go give us your tip?
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:33.200]   Because actually it's very timely.
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.240]   It's really because almost a news story.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.000]   And then and then we'll let you go.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.840]   So, okay, two quick tips.
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:40.840]   Okay.
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:44.840]   Gmail has had free calling to the US and Canada from the US through 2010.
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:46.600]   They've extended that through 2011.
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:50.960]   So yeah, in Gmail, if you click on call phone in your chat window, you can dial.
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:52.800]   That's basically permanent, isn't it?
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:56.640]   I mean, don't you think they'll extend it to 2012 and then on and on and on?
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.800]   Possibly, but it's through 2011 for now.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:49:59.800]   So that's that's pretty cool.
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:02.640]   And that's only for us Gmail users.
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:04.280]   Second tip is really quick one.
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:05.800]   This happened the day after last week's show.
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:07.360]   So we didn't get a chance to talk about it.
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:09.760]   Google Maps 50 for Android.
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.400]   If you haven't gotten the update, get it.
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.080]   If you did get the update, check it out.
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:14.280]   It's a really great update.
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:16.920]   Super fast 3D buildings.
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:18.280]   I'm here in New York this week.
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.280]   It's amazing.
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.560]   You can two finger tilt to zoom and drag if you're online.
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:23.520]   Do I need to satellite to get the 3D buildings?
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:24.520]   How do I do that?
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:25.840]   No, no, you don't need satellite.
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:29.640]   It's just you need to be in one of the 100 plus cities that they have for you.
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.640]   So New York is one of them.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:32.640]   Yeah, New York is one of them.
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:33.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:36.360]   So if I search for New York, I'm now in New York and I zoom in.
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:41.000]   Zoom in and if you go zoom in and down into Manhattan, you will start seeing 3D buildings.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   Wow.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.800]   And if you use a-- and it's super fast.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:46.040]   These are vector drawings now.
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:47.360]   Look how fast it is.
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:48.360]   Those tiles.
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:49.360]   Right.
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:50.360]   Oh, there we go.
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:51.360]   There's 3D.
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:52.360]   There you go.
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:53.360]   And so now do the two finger drag to tilt.
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:54.360]   You can see kind of a--
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:55.360]   There you go.
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:57.360]   It's pretty neat.
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:58.360]   Pretty neat.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:01.000]   So-- and that works offline as well.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.800]   If your phone is offline, it works.
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:03.800]   Wow.
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:04.800]   It's amazing.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:05.800]   If it's cached them.
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.400]   I imagine at some point it has to cache them.
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:08.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:09.400]   If it's cached.
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.480]   But you know, it used to be that Google Maps was these tiles.
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:14.720]   These little images that were kind of tiled together and download as you scroll.
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:15.720]   It's not that anymore.
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:18.680]   Just these vector images which are much smaller.
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:19.680]   It's amazing.
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:21.400]   Look at-- look, it's making Leo so happy.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:22.400]   As I go through--
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.400]   As I go through--
[00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:24.400]   As I go through--
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:26.400]   These buildings pop up.
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:30.680]   Well, they must-- somebody-- they put a lot of sketch up artists to work doing this.
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:31.680]   Wow.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:32.680]   Yeah, seriously.
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:33.680]   Holy--
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:34.680]   It's true.
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:35.680]   Isn't that neat?
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:36.680]   It's true.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:37.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:38.680]   Marissa showed this in the web.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:39.680]   But it didn't work for Paris, unfortunately.
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:42.480]   It roots, which is a wonderful thing for us.
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.960]   Real people who have to take some ways and trains and things.
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:45.960]   Yeah.
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:46.960]   Unlike you.
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:47.960]   Yes.
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:48.960]   California.
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:49.960]   What's a train?
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:53.800]   So this is-- that's really-- that is absolutely-- it's free.
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:56.640]   Not yet on the iPhone, but I think they said pretty soon, right?
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:57.640]   Soon.
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:58.640]   Soon.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:51:59.640]   Yep.
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:00.640]   And I'm still waiting for Gingerbread.
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:02.640]   Us Nexus One users are a low-level Nexus.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:05.880]   Oh, I love the Nexus S. I love the Nexus S.
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:08.080]   Big four inch screen.
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:09.080]   Amalad.
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:10.080]   Ah.
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.080]   You can upgrade?
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.080]   I know.
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:14.720]   I should just do it, right?
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:15.720]   You can upgrade.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:17.480]   I found a couple of my friends.
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:21.120]   There's some things missing that are kind of weird on this phone.
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:24.520]   There's no notification light, which is kind of strange, and you can't put an SD card
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:25.520]   in it.
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:26.520]   But it does have a--
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:27.520]   And they switched the home and the search button.
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:28.520]   Yeah.
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:32.000]   That drives me nuts that nobody's figured out the order here.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.760]   So yeah, home is now on the far right in searches in the middle.
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:35.760]   Oh, jeez.
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:37.760]   I was in Best Buy.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:38.760]   I kept tapping the search button.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:39.760]   It's like no one home.
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:40.960]   It's taken me a while to get used to it.
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:41.960]   On the other hand, boy--
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:43.960]   And I think this is mostly Gingerbread.
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:45.440]   Gingerbread is a lot faster.
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:48.240]   Once you get Gingerbread on your Nexus One, you may not care.
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:50.000]   I mean, it's so much faster.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   It's just great.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   All right, Gina.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   Thank you so much.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   Gina Trapani is at--
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   Very good.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   --some marverware.org.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.440]   She also has a great program called ThinkUp.
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:01.600]   ThinkUpApp.com.
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:02.600]   ThinkUpApp.com.
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:03.600]   And--
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:05.560]   Have fantastic fantastic holidays.
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:06.960]   And I'll see you both next year.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:07.960]   Yay.
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.560]   And I can't wait to watch the best of.
[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:10.560]   That's going to be fun.
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:11.560]   It should be fun.
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:13.840]   I think, as I mentioned, a little glee, a little chipotle.
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:15.280]   It should be awesome.
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:16.280]   Bye, Gina.
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:17.280]   Take care, guys.
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:20.280]   Gina Trapani, everybody.
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:21.720]   Elivorche.
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:27.160]   Oh, and by the way, I should mention that we have been using Google Talk for this,
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:30.560]   because Skype has been on all day.
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:31.840]   And Google Talk's doing a great job.
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:34.640]   Now, I can add Kevin Marks, I think.
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:36.240]   Let me see if I can add Kevin Marks.
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:37.240]   Oh, good.
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:38.240]   Kevin was treating.
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:39.240]   Yeah.
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:43.520]   And I think now the G, because I only had one machine that had Google Talk ready to run
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:44.520]   on it.
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:47.160]   So I'm going to call him right now and see if he'll come on and replace Terry.
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:48.160]   There he is.
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:49.160]   Look at that.
[00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:50.160]   Am I there?
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:51.160]   Excellent.
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:52.160]   Hi there.
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:53.160]   Hey, Kevin.
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:54.160]   Thank you for doing this.
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:55.400]   I'm sorry we couldn't get you on sooner.
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:58.800]   I only upgraded two machines to use G-Talk.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.760]   I have to say this is working pretty well.
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:06.040]   Kevin works for British Telecom, Ribbit.com.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:08.960]   I wonder what your thoughts are on this Skype outage.
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:11.360]   Well, it's fascinating.
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:16.120]   We've had this thing over the last week where we've seen a lot more single points of failure
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:17.640]   in the internet than we were expecting.
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:19.680]   Yes, all in one week.
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:26.920]   The WikiLeaks thing exposed that where suddenly they were using Amazon and their DNS provider
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:29.520]   to shut them down.
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:30.520]   Seeing Skype full over like this.
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:33.920]   I think what Skype said was some of the supernodes were failing.
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:39.960]   The way the Skype is a peer-to-peer thing and some clients end up becoming supernodes
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:42.120]   as switching points for each other.
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:45.920]   You'll notice if you Skype on a fact connection, suddenly it's using a lot of CPU because it's
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:48.600]   rooting other people's calls for them.
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:53.120]   And what they said was they had a bargain, one of their releases that meant they stopped
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:56.600]   working as supernodes and so therefore the network came fragmented.
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:55:02.720]   And they've been creating mega supernodes rapidly to kind of take up the slack.
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:04.720]   Well, thank goodness.
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:07.680]   This is the first time we've actually used a G-Talk video and actually I think it looks
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:08.680]   pretty good.
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:10.520]   Yeah, it is appropriate.
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:11.520]   I know you've been watching.
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.040]   In fact, you've been sending links along.
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:14.040]   Thank you, Kevin.
[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:15.040]   I appreciate it.
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:20.520]   For those who don't know, Kevin is a former Googler himself and former Apple.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:25.360]   A guy now at British Telecom, as I mentioned, at Ribbit.com and we just love having Kevin
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:26.360]   on whenever we can.
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:28.680]   So I'm very glad that you could step in the breach.
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:30.800]   Any thoughts on anything we've talked about so far included?
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:32.040]   The net neutrality thing.
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:38.080]   The net neutrality thing, I think, as Jeff said, the fundamental principle here is what
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:40.080]   you need is structural separation.
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:41.240]   So there's actual competition.
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:43.640]   That's the way it's regulated in the UK.
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:49.360]   The piece of BT that provides the fundamental connectivity sells to the rest of BT and to
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:51.520]   every other company at the exact same price.
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:54.520]   And there's a sort of Chinese, there's a firewall between them.
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:56.280]   They're a separate company.
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:56:03.080]   And as a BT employee, I'm not allowed to talk to them in any way that amounts to collusion.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:10.360]   So the way that set up, that means that the actual ISP part is very competitive.
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:17.360]   And this was the BT had most of the ground plant in the UK when it was privatized.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:21.200]   And so they set it up in this way so that it was easier for competitors to work with
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:22.200]   that.
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:24.080]   And there were some of that in the previous telecom act.
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:27.360]   And that basically got sort of smushed away by regulation.
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:32.840]   So it used to be used to be able to, in the DSL day, be able to have multiple ISPs that
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:34.680]   were rooting for the same tech.
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:39.120]   But then they changed the regulation basis for the internet and the US so that that was
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:40.120]   no longer true.
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:42.040]   And we now have these local monopolies.
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:47.000]   And that, so the net neutrality rules are sort of a patch on the fact that there is a
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:52.960]   there are local monopolies and we'd be better off enabling more competition at that level.
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:58.280]   Either by doing the enforcing structure separation, if there is monopoly or by not grinding
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:02.800]   monopolies, but allowing more competition, allowing more people to run cables and more
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:06.040]   rights to run fiber and ducks to the home.
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:09.200]   So that's the sort of deep problem.
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:13.200]   So the net neutrality rules are in attempt to work around that.
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:19.160]   So in short, are you, you think that these rules are adequate?
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:21.320]   I mean, you work for a mobile carrier.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:22.320]   So I'm not.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.200]   No, no, no, well, we're not actually a mobile carrier.
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:25.200]   All right.
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:26.200]   Interesting.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:27.200]   That's a good point.
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:28.200]   Okay.
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:34.240]   Do you feel that mobile carriers have a reasonable complaint that they're different in terms
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:37.000]   of their infrastructure than land based ISPs?
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.040]   Well, you know, they are different.
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:40.040]   Sure.
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:44.800]   But that doesn't necessarily mean that they need to, you know, they need to be favored.
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:47.640]   Again, you know, the builder is tends to be more expensive.
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:53.120]   But again, there is slightly more competition there in that there are multiple carriers
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:56.680]   at any given point in a given point where it can be.
[00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:59.800]   But competition solves all of this, of course.
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:01.440]   Competition solves it, solves it broadly.
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:05.040]   But you know, the real problem that the mobile carriers have is that their model was a call
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:07.240]   based model, not a database model.
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:12.320]   And what we've seen in the largest cities in San Francisco and New York is that there's
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:16.960]   there, they weren't expecting that much data and they've got a scramble to build new.
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:19.640]   They're actually telling people to use Wi-Fi instead.
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:20.640]   Right.
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:22.440]   You know, in my head, that's a good thing.
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:24.760]   I think more Wi-Fi is good.
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:28.160]   And Wi-Fi is actually a universal standard that does work.
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:31.480]   This is the sort of fascinating thing.
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:38.760]   But it's displacing a lot of the mobile use because it's actually higher bandwidth and
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:41.240]   much more targeted because it is very distributed.
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:42.240]   We've all deployed it ourselves.
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:45.520]   We've all bought base stations and scattered them around the place where we happen to
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:46.920]   be.
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:49.400]   So, go ahead.
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:54.960]   So, you know, I don't think, you know, I don't think they should be distinguishing between
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:55.960]   the two.
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:59:00.160]   I think we do want to have neutrality on the mobile as well.
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:05.200]   Especially since we're using it more and more and more as our primary innovation is
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:06.200]   going to be.
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:12.200]   And even if you look at the stuff you're doing with the Android, with the mapping staff,
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:18.120]   that is enormously useful and very valuable, you know, to some extent, when Google built
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:22.280]   Android, they built the assumption in that you would always be connected because that's
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:23.280]   the way Google works.
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:29.480]   By the way, if you want to know about that, just and you have latitude turned on, and
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:33.760]   I know you both do, go look at your latitude of history.
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:34.920]   It's a little terrifying.
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:35.920]   They've been...
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:38.320]   They've turned history on.
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:43.160]   Yeah, you might want to turn it off if you have anything to hide anyway.
[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:44.440]   I was kind of shocked.
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:48.400]   It knows everywhere I've been and keeps stats on it.
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:51.160]   And it says, "Oh, you know, over the last year, this is where you've been.
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:52.160]   This is where..."
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:58.120]   It's kind of shocking, frankly.
[00:59:58.120 --> 00:59:59.280]   So yes, you're right.
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:03.840]   They intend for this always to be on and watching at all times.
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.160]   Because they want you to be able to search all the time.
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:07.160]   That's the value for that.
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.160]   Right.
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:11.920]   If you're walking around using your device and it's not connected, that's not as valuable
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.120]   to them as if it is.
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.120]   Right.
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:15.120]   It's...
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:16.120]   By the way, that dashboard thing is great.
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:19.000]   That's how I found out about this by reading my dashboard.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.800]   There you are.
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:21.800]   Yeah, that's me.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.400]   And by the way, you want to know where I've been?
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:27.720]   Here is everything for...
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:32.840]   We can only display the most recent 500 locations.
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:34.480]   And they will give you a graph.
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:37.720]   They will give you all sorts of interesting information.
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:40.800]   It's kind of amazing about where you've been and when.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:41.800]   And I...
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:43.840]   You know, at first I thought, "This is great.
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:47.520]   If I ever get busted for murder..."
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:48.520]   I could say...
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:51.480]   And then they say, "Where were you on the evening of December 22nd?"
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:53.160]   I can say, "Well, just check with my latitude."
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:56.720]   But then I realized it really isn't where I was, is where my phone was.
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.520]   But you think it was.
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:02.760]   Well, also, I mean, you know, there's a distinction here.
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:06.040]   I like to make that the Harry Potter analogy is that...
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:08.720]   Harry Potter, there are two geolocation metaphors.
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:12.360]   There's the Marauders map, which they use in the sculpture where everyone is.
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.440]   And you see little dots moving around.
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:18.080]   And then there's the Weasley's clock, which is the clock they have in their house that
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:24.520]   says they're at work, they're at home, they're in Mortal Peril, they're at Hogwarts or whatever.
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:29.280]   So it's a sort of a known location indicator.
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:33.120]   And the problem is that latitude is way closer to the Marauders map, which is this creepy
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:37.720]   we can see everywhere you are a thing, than it is to that, are they at home?
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:38.720]   Are they at work?
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.560]   Are they somewhere safe?
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:41.560]   And that's...
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:47.200]   If you think about the difference between those two worldviews, is the difference between
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:50.280]   geostuff that you feel comfortable with and geostuff that makes you nervous.
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:53.520]   And what we're seeing with, you know, Four Square and the ones that explicitly let you
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:58.640]   check in is you're basically saying, "I'm at work, I'm at home, I'm at the bar, I'm somewhere
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:03.640]   safe," which is much closer to that sort of comfort model than this will track you all
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:05.040]   the time and pin you down.
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:09.480]   By the way, it's like the difference between Beacon and Blippi.
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:12.320]   Beacon kind of snuck up on you and Blippi, you know exactly what's up everywhere, so
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:14.560]   for Leo knows exactly what you're doing.
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:17.560]   Look at this, it says, "Here's a pie chart.
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:18.920]   How do I spend my time?
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:20.120]   Work home spent out."
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:21.120]   And they're...
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:23.840]   I mean, this is an amazing...
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.480]   These are all the places I've spent.
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:27.840]   I spent 29 hours at home last week.
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.920]   I don't see a Dr. Paltley there.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.680]   This is...
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:36.840]   I mean, if you have latitude turned on, go to your dashboard.
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:39.440]   You might want to just think about what you've got, what you're telling...
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:41.080]   I have a look at that after this year.
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:42.080]   You didn't know, did you?
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.080]   No, I think I turned on.
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:44.080]   I think I did too.
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:45.080]   You were smart to turn it off.
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.080]   You were smart to turn it off.
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.080]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.080]   Actually, it's fascinating.
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:51.320]   I first, I went, "Oh, I want to turn this off," and then this is a tribute to Jeff.
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:54.320]   Then I turned it on, I said, "No, I think this is kind of cool.
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.320]   I got nothing to hide."
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:03:00.320]   Well, this is... the tension is who has access to this?
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:01.320]   Right.
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.320]   This is the sort of the core of this.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.760]   And they say very specifically, only you have access to this aggregated information.
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:06.760]   Right.
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:09.760]   You and Google and whoever you are, you use it.
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:12.040]   Well, and a cop with a subpoena.
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.040]   Right.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.040]   Oh, never mind.
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.040]   You're a muck, a muck.
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:23.280]   Yeah, this is the tricky part of this, which is what we're seeing is that people are starting
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:26.880]   to realize that they want to have... they want it, they want it, they want it, intro
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:31.040]   specks, they want to see where they've been, they want to see the stuff for themselves.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:37.320]   But making sure that someone else has that is the way to do it is a problem.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:40.000]   The thing that Flap last week was around delicious closing down.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   Right.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   And so the people were saying, "Wait, I'm going to leave on my links.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   I was trusting you."
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   I was invested in that.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   Right.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   And Yahoo has now said they're not going to close.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.560]   They want to sell it or whatever.
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:52.360]   They were suddenly this like, "Oh, I mean, this is all my stuff in that place, that thing
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:53.360]   in that."
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:59.600]   And this is the same, this is a similar challenge with when Google shut down dodgeball or, you
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:03.640]   know, if I've got everything in Twitter or if we get everything in Facebook and then
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:06.400]   they suddenly shut down my account, then you've got a problem.
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.640]   And that's how we've heard stories that happen to people.
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:15.320]   Paul Buhight, who of course tweeted that he didn't think Chrome OS was going anywhere.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.320]   Right.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.880]   People are starting to say, "Oh, you're anti-Google.
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:18.880]   He posted a blog post.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:20.480]   I thought it was an excellent blog post.
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:21.480]   Four reasons.
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:23.080]   It's still awesome."
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:24.360]   And you know, we don't say this enough.
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:27.120]   And I know Jeff, we were a little upset with Google at the beginning of the show because
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.760]   of their stance in net neutrality.
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:31.320]   But let's not forget, Google, this is number one, point number one.
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:33.560]   They take big risks.
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:36.920]   People say, he says, "People point to projects like Wave as evidence that Google's lost
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:37.920]   its magic or something.
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:41.680]   To me, it's evidence they're still willing to take risks on new ideas and new ways of
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:43.440]   doing things.
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:47.800]   They're willing to build new technology seemingly unrelated to the core business, things like
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.960]   autonomous cars."
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:54.600]   And boy, thank goodness that there's somebody out there who's willing to do blue sky research,
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:57.840]   just because they're interested in that.
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:01.440]   He said, "From an employee perspective, these non-core projects are also an opportunity
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.480]   for greater autonomy.
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:07.760]   Part of what made the Gmail project so fun, Paul was one of the creators of Gmail, is
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:10.800]   that we had a lot of independence and could pursue ideas that other people inside Google
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:13.920]   thought were, quote, "the wrong way to do it."
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:16.160]   Most other tech companies don't offer that kind of freedom.
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.880]   Number three, they compete in positive ways.
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:25.600]   Google's weapon of choice is more often open source and open standards, not closed standards.
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.080]   They don't try to weaken open.
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:32.920]   In fact, the criticism they get for Android, I'm adding this, really comes from the fact
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:37.000]   that they were kind of said, "We're going to make it open."
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.680]   And finally, they don't seem to mind honest criticism.
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:43.720]   And I will say that because I tell you, we went to Google and we're oftentimes critical
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:48.840]   of Google on this show and they embraced us as if we were never critical.
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:49.840]   They understand.
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:51.320]   That's really true.
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:56.480]   Eric Schmidt, when I interviewed him for the book, he'd just gone through the Times Square
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:59.000]   Hell and what he calls death by Twitter.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.400]   And he says, "Listen, we want criticism.
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:04.240]   We just want to paragraph not a sentence.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:09.840]   We want it to be throw in support and then that's valuable to us and they mean it.
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:10.840]   They really do."
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:11.840]   Good for Paul for writing that.
[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:14.600]   You agree with his analysis, Kevin, because you worked there.
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:15.600]   Yeah, no.
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.720]   I think he sums that up well.
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:22.640]   If OpenSanner's focus is very important there and they've said that in public.
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:27.640]   Someone in chat was saying Android isn't open and Android has two halves to it.
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:33.160]   I've said this before on the show, but there's the fully open source piece of Android, which
[01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:36.640]   means it can be deployed to everything, which is fascinating.
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:41.000]   And then there's the other half, which is the with Google part, which is the apps that
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.280]   are proprietary to Google and are included with the phone, like the navigation stuff,
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:46.400]   the maps that you were showing off.
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:50.640]   And so they've got two pieces to this very deliberately.
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:51.640]   Yeah.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.080]   And there's good reasons why that's proprietary.
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:54.080]   There's all sorts of proprietary technology.
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:55.800]   Well, there's a mixture of reasons.
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:07:01.000]   But what it means is that they can provide some kind of, we will only put the with Google
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.800]   on it if it satisfies these criteria and they can set those criteria, but they're not
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:07.040]   actually preventing people from doing other devices.
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:11.600]   So I've got my wacky Chinese $50.
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:12.800]   And it's running Android.
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:13.800]   Because it's--
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:14.800]   And it's running Android.
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:15.800]   Open.
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:16.800]   It's running Android.
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:21.600]   And I bought this random thing in the-- this was $10.
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:23.400]   It's an MP3 player.
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:24.400]   And before player.
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:25.400]   $10.
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:27.720]   It's not running Android yet.
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:29.720]   Next year, these things will be.
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.200]   It was in the hardware store.
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.320]   They had a box on it that went up.
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:38.880]   So the thing-- Android is this sort of very-- the open piece of Android is this very powerful
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:42.880]   force that is going to permeate consumer electronics next year, even more than it already
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.880]   has.
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:44.880]   We're already seeing it.
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:46.680]   Building on it in that way.
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:51.280]   Not just permeated, Kevin, but I also connect things that weren't connected before.
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:52.280]   Yes.
[01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:53.280]   Yes.
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.280]   Exactly.
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:57.000]   That's the other piece is that this thing doesn't-- this thing is 10 bug thing doesn't
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.200]   have an internet connection, but it has a USB so it can be in that way.
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:04.720]   But you can imagine them adding Wi-Fi and things to these as they go.
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:11.960]   But the other thing is that-- my prediction is we will see someone else replace the closed
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.880]   half of Android.
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:23.240]   So they will provide replacements for the contact management, the mapping, the other
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:25.880]   specific Google specific apps that are baked into that.
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:29.760]   And there are a bunch of companies that might do this and could do this.
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:32.240]   Facebook is an obvious one.
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:33.240]   Twitter is another one.
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:41.160]   But you could see somebody like Yahoo or Microsoft even doing this saying, "Okay, we'll take the
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:43.800]   open source piece, we'll swap out the bits on the top."
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:49.080]   And we've had hints of that already with the Verizon androids that search being instead
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:51.520]   of Google because they are able to do that.
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:52.480]   That's going to be fascinating.
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:57.080]   And that's something that's going to get more interesting over time.
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:59.560]   There were hints of that in the Chrome announcement as well.
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:04.280]   When they launched Chrome, they said, "We only have to log in with the Google account, but
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:08.120]   we could potentially log in with other things in the future."
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.600]   That's another sort of potential market there.
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:13.880]   If they hold true to the openness of their staff, they could be able to--
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:14.880]   That's interesting.
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:17.600]   It could be the Facebook OS at some point.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:18.600]   In some ways.
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:21.960]   It could have the Facebook set of apps on top of that OS.
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:23.960]   That's possible.
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:27.120]   And if we get the open standard pieces right, that will be viable.
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.120]   And that would be useful.
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:32.880]   That would mean that we're not blocked to one source in future.
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:34.600]   You'd certainly find you have a single point of failure.
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.840]   Like Skype going down on you.
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:40.480]   You were able to connect through different systems that are closer to the original vision
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:42.640]   of the internet.
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:45.400]   That's the big challenge we're seeing at the moment.
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:52.120]   We're seeing that there are all these points of control in the internet that have grown
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:56.240]   up because through Habit and through programmer Habit as well.
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:02.320]   We're now used to the idea of things not running directly on the edges, but always having to
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:04.280]   talk to a server to communicate.
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:09.240]   The model of I've got a web browser and I've got-- but the real stuff happens on a server
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:13.640]   because the servers have real IP addresses and your client only has pretend ones.
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:18.520]   That architecture has now sort of permeated the net because we were short of real IP addresses
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:24.440]   and because laptops and phones changed the IP addresses depending on where they are.
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:28.880]   But I suspect we're going to start seeing some pushback on that over the next year where
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:33.680]   we rearchitect so that you can actually run stuff directly from your edge clients to other
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:37.960]   edge clients without having to route through central servers.
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:42.840]   We're seeing markers from this in some of the things that have been going on and failing
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:47.480]   this week and that will trigger the engineers to go, "Wait, why don't you search to fix that
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:48.480]   a long time ago?
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:50.760]   Why does everything have to be centralized?"
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:54.520]   This is a self-healing thing, which is a good thing.
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:57.160]   At least as long as humans pay attention.
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.680]   I'm so glad you joined us, Camo.
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:10:59.680]   We're actually running out of time.
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:01.400]   We're running a little bit late here.
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:07.560]   Let me get to our final words here, which start with Jeff Jarvis and his numbers of the
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:08.560]   week.
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:09.560]   I had numbers.
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:10.560]   I had numbers.
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:11.560]   Numbers.
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:12.560]   We got numbers.
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.560]   Well, some quick ones.
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:18.480]   Gina contributed this one, which is the tabs for charity, which I fully understand, but
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:21.240]   they got 60 million tabs for charity on Chrome.
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:22.240]   You can look that up at Chrome.log.com.
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:23.240]   60 million chat.
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:24.160]   I don't understand.
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:25.640]   I don't understand.
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:26.640]   I don't either.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.480]   I tried to read it, but I just actually paid attention to you guys.
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:31.480]   A big mistake.
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:34.680]   There's your problem right now.
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:43.720]   They've actually raised essentially equivalent of a million dollars by opening tabs in Chrome.
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:46.360]   I don't get how that connects, but that's fun.
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:48.120]   I'm glad they raised a million dollars.
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:49.120]   They get fantastic.
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:50.880]   Then we have 300,000.
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:55.160]   San Francisco has 300,000 Facebook fans more than LA and New York.
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:56.160]   Of course.
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.160]   Okay, okay, okay.
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:58.160]   Of course.
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:11:59.160]   Stop, Bob.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:04.760]   LA has 200,000 poor New York because we don't play along like this has 10,000.
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:06.560]   Hey, what do you want?
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:09.560]   I don't get no like button for you.
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:12.960]   Hey, if you had a button.
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:13.960]   Yeah.
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:14.960]   Yeah.
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:17.480]   You got a problem with that?
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:20.240]   And then we got a million Apple TVs sold.
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:21.240]   Yeah.
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:24.160]   And a million Roku boxes, they say, but before the end of the year.
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:25.160]   That's great.
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:26.800]   Just shows we're really connecting to the Internet.
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.320]   However, now the net neutrality has changed.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:29.600]   We'll be able to use any of them.
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:36.160]   We played with my tool on, that didn't come out right at all.
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:40.440]   We played with this on Twitter this week and we had a lot of fun.
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:46.280]   This is a joint project, I think with Harvard and Google Books to take and analyze all the
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:53.360]   contents of the Google books and create N grams, arbitrary N grams from data in Google
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:57.440]   Books and you can do your own if you want.
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:03.560]   Just take any number of arbitrary comma separated phrases.
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:14.720]   Let's say Chipotle, Taco Bell, comma Taco Bell and McDonald's.
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:16.080]   I don't know how good this is going to be.
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:17.360]   Remember, these are from Google Books.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:20.320]   I don't think there were a lot of mentions of Chipotle before 1990.
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:22.680]   But anyway, and yes, it certainly went through the roof.
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:24.880]   But look at that Chipotle number.
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:30.040]   Whoa, compared to McDonald's, which is green and Taco Bell, which is way down there.
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:37.280]   So obviously, at least in the Google Books N gram viewer, Chipotle is a big winner.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:44.600]   And our readers, our listeners, viewers are starting to lobby Chipotle tweets for sponsoring
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:45.600]   the show.
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.600]   They don't have to sponsor the show.
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:49.240]   They just have to cater it.
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:54.760]   We wanted Chipotle bold delivered to each host right at one o'clock every Wednesday afternoon.
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:57.160]   One o'clock Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern.
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:00.560]   You can watch us at live.twit.tv.
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:04.080]   Jeff Jarvis is buzzing at buzzmachine.com.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:08.520]   Also the author of a great book called What Would Google Do and his new book Public Parks.
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:09.520]   He's working on it right now.
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.920]   Kevin Marks is at rivet.com.
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:13.360]   Thank you for joining in at Kevin.
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.440]   It's always great to hear from you.
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.160]   We're going to get you on a full show soon.
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:17.160]   Yeah.
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.160]   Thank you very much, Kevin.
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:22.880]   And we will end with something Matt cuts put together with his team.
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:26.720]   They call it the 12 days of Google mess.
