[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:57.440]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Google. The show where we cover not just Google, but the cloud, the Twitter, the Facebook, all of that stuff, the South Buy.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.440]   From her basement, her mother's basement has all good bloggers to Gina Trapani.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.960]   Nice PJs Gina.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.440]   Hello. You know, I actually do have pajama bottoms on. This is a legitimate show.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.440]   But I actually do have pajama bottoms on because, you know, that's what you do when you're only the top-have is only on the top.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.440]   I work from home today. Okay, look, I'm just embracing the stereotype here.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.040]   Are they Mickey Mouse pajama bottoms? Are they?
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.440]   Oh, no, they're just sprayed up plaid. They're pretty good.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.440]   They're delicious.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.240]   I can't believe I told you guys this. The whole point was that they were off camera.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.440]   That you couldn't see them. There's something about people who aren't wearing pants.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.440]   They feel compelled to tell the world. I don't know what it is.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.440]   I don't know. To be clear, I am wearing pants. They're just pajama pants.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.440]   Yeah, well, there's no confusion here about that.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:03.440]   Gina is in charge of ThinkUp.com. She's also the author of To Do Text and a regular host on all about Android every Tuesday right here on this network.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.440]   It's a 25-p.m. Pacific, 8 p.m. Eastern. Thank you for being here, Gina.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.440]   Great to be here.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.440]   Jeff Jarvis, Professor of Journalism at City University of New York.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.440]   I'm wearing pants.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.440]   He is wearing pants. He's also the author of What Would Google Do in His Latest Public Parts and Blogs@Buzzmachine.com.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:30.440]   25 years old today. Well, you know, I think that's miscounting because it was the twinkle in Tim Berners-Lee's eye on March 12, 25 years ago.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.440]   It took him another year before the World Wide Web existed.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.440]   And it was not until October 1994 that the commercial browser was released.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.440]   Right.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.440]   But still, let's give Mr. Tim his birthday greetings.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.440]   By the way, if you go to Google.com, you'll see a little birthday cake with the numbers 25.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.440]   I thought that was because Josh Windish was born today, but actually it's happy 25th birthday World Wide Web.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:03.440]   And he links to a guest post on the Google blog by Sir Tim Berners-Lee.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.440]   He distributed a proposal.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.440]   And this is the original proposal. Information management.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:18.440]   This, my friends, is a diagram describing the World Wide Web.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.440]   Okay. Now you know what happened.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:30.440]   This led to a bunch of people in their jammies in their mother's basement making a living.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:37.440]   This, I mean, that, you know, when I first saw that I thought, oh, you know, to think what amazing things can happen from a sketch.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.440]   But that's actually a computer-generated flow chart.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.440]   Like, that's, that actually, he puts a working at that at the time.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.440]   At the time, that was a pretty avant-garde.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.440]   And it isn't exactly what the Web became.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.440]   He says, "This proposal concerns the management of general information about accelerators.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.440]   He's at CERN at the time in Geneva, which is the particle, nuclear particle accelerator,
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:05.440]   and experiments at CERN. It discusses the problems of loss of information about complex evolving systems
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.440]   and derives a solution based on a distributed hypertext system.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:18.440]   So the concept of hypertext is not new. In fact, it was first described by Ted.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.440]   What's his name?
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.440]   Oh, where's that next guy?
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.440]   Oh, you know, you know, chat room.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.440]   Ted Nelson, thank you.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.440]   Nelson, thank you.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.440]   Ted Nelson. I think he, thank you. I think he was the first to describe hypertext.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.440]   So, and clearly from this memo that Tim Berners-Lee put out,
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.440]   that was a term that meant some sense to somebody.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.440]   The idea of a linked information system.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.440]   Did he call it the World Wide Web here?
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.440]   Yeah, he said that he used the word "web."
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.440]   He used the word "web."
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.440]   The actual observed working structure of the organization is a multiply connected web.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.440]   He put that in quotes, whose interconnections evolved with time.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.440]   It wasn't the world wide web until later.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.440]   We're going to talk about this in his AMA today.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.440]   Sir Tim said that when asked whether there are other names for the web, he listed three.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.440]   Mine of information, the information mine and the mesh.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.440]   But he decided web was best.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.440]   I think web's good.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:26.440]   And web led to a lot of analogies like spidering the web as you crawl the web.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:32.440]   So I love Reddit, ask me anything.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.440]   Ask me anything because they surface the best questions because they get up voted.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.920]   The number one question, what was one of the things you never thought the internet would
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.440]   be used for would actually become one of the main reasons people use the internet.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.440]   Sir Tim Berners-Lee says, "Kittens."
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.440]   There are a couple possibilities for that response.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.440]   I like that he chose kittens.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.440]   "Kittens."
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.440]   You should have asked if he put up a picture of his cat.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.440]   He's a cat no dog, yes.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.440]   That's a dog, I.
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.440]   In the not too distant future, we'll look back and think ourselves lucky to have witnessed
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.440]   a neutral, free and uncensored worldwide web.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.440]   He responds, "I think it's up to us.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.440]   I'm not guessing.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.440]   I'm hoping."
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.440]   Yes, I can imagine to all that all too easily.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.440]   If ordinary web users are not sufficiently aware of threats and get involved, and if necessary,
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.440]   take to the streets like for SOPA and PIPA and ACTA on balance.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.440]   I'm optimistic, but he's right.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:37.440]   It's up to us to preserve the free and open internet.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:44.440]   Tim is an amazing fella, very unassuming.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.440]   He got knighted for this, but he doesn't act as if, "Oh, yeah, I invented it."
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.440]   This web browser, "Do you use?"
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:59.440]   "Don't know," says Java Beans, but his GitHub account says he commits to some Firefox plugins.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.440]   That's pretty impressive.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.440]   He's a Firefox committer.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.440]   Then, I'm sorrels, says, "Dude, it's Tim Berners-Lee.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.440]   He doesn't even need a computer."
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.440]   He puffs the end of an ethernet cable like a hookah.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.440]   Now, that's something that needs to be photoshopped.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.440]   I'm sitting on a mushroom.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.440]   Edward Snowden, hero or villain?
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:27.440]   Tim writes, "Because he had no other alternative, engaged as a journalist, with a journalist,
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:33.440]   to be careful of how he was released and provided an important net overall benefit to the world.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.440]   I think he should be protected, and we should have ways of protecting people like him,
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.440]   because we can try to design perfect systems of government and they will never be perfect.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.440]   When they fail, then the whistle blower may be all that saves society right on."
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.440]   Excellent answer.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.440]   Which Glenn re-walled immediately retweeted.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.440]   Good.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:59.440]   Tim Berners-Lee, I think deserves the honor.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:07.440]   Today is the day his eye twinkled, but the worldwide web was born actually more than a year later,
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.440]   after he first wrote about it.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:15.440]   We're all celebrating.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:22.440]   He was asked whether the 404 came from the fact that he was in a room 404 where he did this.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.440]   He just said, "No, that's nonsense."
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.440]   Where did those error numbers go from?
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.440]   I don't know.
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.440]   He probably didn't write those.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:36.440]   Probably the folks who did Apache, I would guess, wrote those error messages, right?
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.440]   Well, it's the HTTP spec, right?
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.440]   Oh, it's the spec, okay.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:48.440]   HTTP protocol spec, all those error numbers, 401, 500, or that are at 503.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.440]   Those are all just part of the protocol.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.040]   I'm sure that a lot of people at Apache were probably involved, but it was probably a different
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.440]   standards organization.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.440]   Right.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:02.440]   The IETF or the W3C, which Tim now works at.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.440]   The worldwide web consortium, I believe.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.440]   Does he not?
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.440]   And MIT.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.440]   And MIT?
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.440]   Really?
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.440]   What does he do over there?
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.440]   He teaches.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.440]   That's cool.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:15.440]   In fact, I'm working with a company called Infinite Analytics that came out of his class.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.440]   Wow, that's neat.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.440]   It is neat.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.440]   It's very neat.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.440]   He did write the first HTTP server.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.440]   That's right.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.440]   So he had to in order.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.440]   On a next cube.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.440]   On a next cube.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.440]   Wow.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.840]   Well, you know, it was, the next was kind of designed to make it easy to write scientific
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.440]   software and other software.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:40.440]   I'm looking at all of the summer of code open for application.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.440]   I'm looking at all of our stories.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.440]   The 10th summer of code.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.040]   This is, you've been involved in the summer of code, Jean.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.040]   Tell us about it.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.040]   I have.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.240]   And I'm really excited to think I've got accepted as a mentoring organization this
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.240]   year.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.480]   This is a Google summer of code, which is their 10th year.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.200]   This is a program that Google runs to support open source projects.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.720]   So what happens is open source organizations like ThinkUp or like Firefox or Apache or
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.240]   WordPress, they all apply to be mentoring organizations.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.840]   And then the ones that get accepted, then they open up an application project period
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:16.680]   for students who want to get it to get experience contributing to open source and who also can
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.880]   earn a stipend from Google.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.880]   So students apply and then they get paired up with mentors in the mentoring organization.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.080]   So I'm going to mentor a student this summer.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.880]   And I've, we've done it two other summers.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.720]   So I've mentored students in the past.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.360]   And if the student passes, they propose a project and if they get a passing grade from
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.520]   the mentor, the student earns, I think it's a $5,000 stipend for the summer.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.640]   This is a summer job, basically working remotely on an open source project.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.640]   So you get incredible experience.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.640]   You make some money.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.640]   The mentor gets a little stipend.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.480]   I think it's like 500 bucks or whatever.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.720]   And Google organizes this and they fund this.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.840]   And it's an amazing program.
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:59.160]   And in Google, I think really kind of uses this program to recruit developers as well.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:04.360]   Because at least a couple of students who have been through GSOC, even through ThinkUp,
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.640]   have gone on to at least interviews at Google, if not jobs.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.760]   And one of my students actually got a job at Facebook.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.760]   Wow.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:11.760]   That's congratulated as well.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.120]   So yeah, it's a really, it's a pretty prestigious thing.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.080]   And in fact, Google's, sorry, ThinkUp's developer mailing list is just overrun with students
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:23.400]   right now kind of clamoring to put in their project proposals and asking questions.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.080]   So it's great for the organization.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.080]   It's great for Google.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.080]   It's great for students.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.640]   We're really excited about it.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:33.160]   Is it more, I mean, do you really get a lot out of it or is it more a bit fed to the world
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.360]   of the future?
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.360]   I love it.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.360]   I love my doing new students.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:42.680]   I mean, you know, one of my things is like I really want to bring young people into contributing
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:43.680]   to open source.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.280]   I feel like open source is still really hard to penetrate.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:50.800]   I think that there's a certain kind of developer, you know, the neck beard that kind of, you
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.560]   know, can find their way in.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.240]   But I think there are a lot of young people who are intimidated or don't really don't
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.440]   know how to get in there.
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.680]   So when you get paired up with a mentor, you have some kind of hold in your hand and show
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.600]   any of the ropes and working with the one on one.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:07.160]   I think that that's the thing that gets someone to do this kind of thing.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.960]   That's how it happened for me.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:14.400]   So I really love it because we think up gets often long time contributors, you know, students
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.560]   stick around.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.120]   We actually wound up hiring a student who we mentored last summer to do contract work
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.080]   for ThinkUp as we prepare to open up sign up.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.560]   So it creates jobs.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.720]   It creates relationships.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.720]   It makes connections.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.800]   And I really like helping students, particularly students who maybe wouldn't have gotten into
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:35.760]   open source on their own kind of non usual suspects, particularly young women for me,
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.000]   you know, just kind of like, because I like the idea of bringing more women into open
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.680]   source than sorely needed.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.680]   So it's great.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.680]   Everybody gets something out of it.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.680]   It's a lot of work.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.080]   It's a lot of hours, but it's totally worth it.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:51.080]   You obviously would need to be a computer science student or know how to code anyway, right?
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:57.000]   You know, I think it depends on the project and on the project proposal.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.520]   I mean, I think if we try to make it as general as possible, you know, if you have an interest
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.400]   in learning how to code and you have a really great product idea, I mean, if you're a great
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.440]   designer, if you're a great copywriter, you could rewriter documentation.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.680]   So it could be technical writing?
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:11.680]   It could be technical writing.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.720]   Yeah, I mean, whatever the contribution is, as long as it moves the project forward.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.520]   And I really, you know, I've been trying, and we talked about this on this show, I've
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.520]   been trying to really get out of that developer-only mindset.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.720]   You know, I think that product development and technical development, you know, making
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.880]   technical products isn't just about writing code.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.120]   I think it's also about writing copy and writing documentation and user experience and
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.120]   design.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.960]   And I really want to encourage that as well.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.680]   I don't think that, and a lot of these projects are extremely technical, but you know, think
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.800]   up is a consumer product.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.520]   It's very much user experience focused.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:45.520]   I mean, the code certainly runs it, but I don't think that that's necessarily the
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.520]   more part of the topic.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:47.520]   What are the skills that you need?
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:52.200]   Are you having problems finding any skills, just as an educator or a masking?
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.920]   So what are we training people to do?
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:15:00.960]   You know, we tend to, this program in particular tends to attract students who are extremely
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.600]   technical and who are comp sign majors.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.040]   That makes a lot of sense, right?
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.920]   And you know, we think up particularly, and I think this is true of most consumer products,
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:14.920]   you need somebody who can write and can code and has a very good sense of user experience,
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:15.920]   right?
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.480]   So, and that's rare.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.800]   It's rare to find that combination.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.040]   So you know, and we think up particularly, I mean, think up is about social insights.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.880]   So we're looking for people who blog, who tweet, who do Facebook, who use these social
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.560]   tools, have, you know, who are very experienced, who understand the different cultures of these
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.560]   different communities.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:35.600]   I mean, we had a student build a YouTube plugin, for example, for us last summer, and I'm not
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.760]   that active on YouTube.
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.880]   I don't really know the culture of the comments in YouTube or what is liking versus favoriting
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.120]   versus sharing mean, right?
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.400]   So we're looking for someone who is really embedded in that community and who wants those
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.600]   insights and, you know, kind of wants to scratch the scratch their own itch.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.600]   So understanding that community is itself a skill?
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.760]   Yeah, I mean, for us, definitely.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:58.320]   I mean, for us, because we're about social insights about cultures and communities, we
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.160]   do want people who who understand those.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.840]   But I think every product has different needs.
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:09.840]   So the summer of code, go to google.com/gsoc, I guess.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:10.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.160]   Which is Google Summer.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.880]   Look, if you can't find it, you probably should apply.
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.880]   Yeah, either.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.200]   Yeah, the student applications are open, I think, until like March 21.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:24.000]   So if you're looking for a summer job and you're qualifying student and, you know, in
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.840]   a qualifying program, you should definitely apply.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.440]   And can you a mentor in jammies or is that not?
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.960]   All of my mentees have been in different countries.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:40.440]   So yes, I was often my pajamas while I was mentoring.
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.320]   But you can't get down with technology in your hand.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.120]   That's what the purple one tells us.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.120]   Prince.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.960]   He doesn't like technology.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.800]   It's a masculine too.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.560]   You can't get down and you're emasculated.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.560]   Yeah.
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.360]   Got to go for some questions.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.760]   But my co-founder, Anil Daz, he's a huge Prince fan.
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.200]   And I shared this link with him earlier.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:05.680]   And I said, "Cue the Jeff Jarvis like rant about how technophobes are destroying culture."
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:11.400]   And he was just like, "He's always been on this thing about not taking photos at shows
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.400]   and whatever."
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.600]   But I thought it was funny because, you know, it's--
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.440]   Prince does not like technology.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:22.240]   Remember, he briefly sued his own fans for posting on YouTube.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.920]   He tells people at the door, "No photos.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.720]   Patrons taking photos are subject to ejection."
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.800]   And he's saying, "Put your phone down.
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.160]   You can't get down with technology in your hand."
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.880]   But you know, he's right.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.960]   I just think he's a little bit of a Luddite.
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.760]   But this is the guy I've been in and out.
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.360]   He put up CD-ROMs 20 years ago.
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.360]   Right.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.360]   Tell us what to think.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.360]   Right.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:49.360]   When asked last year whether he owned an iPhone, he replied, "Hell no."
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.360]   "Hell no."
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.360]   "Hell no."
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.360]   "Hell no."
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.200]   "Hell no."
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.240]   But he has people who phone for him.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.560]   I bet you many in his entourage have an iPhone.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:06.320]   He did use a phone apparently to help on our senior hall help a fan break up.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.280]   Did you see this?
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.280]   I didn't see this.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.280]   I didn't see it.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.280]   I didn't see this.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.280]   He used a smartphone.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.280]   Well, let's see.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.280]   "Hell no.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.280]   Things you might like Prince to solve."
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:21.320]   And there's a gentleman who told my producer a story.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.480]   Prince always looks like a Prince impersonator to me.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.480]   I don't know.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.480]   This is a stealer.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.320]   He just doesn't look like he really is there.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.680]   Anyway, this guy asks Prince.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:34.520]   He doesn't look like he's looking at you.
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.920]   Well, big glasses.
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:37.920]   Yeah.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:38.920]   Okay, Steve.
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:39.920]   All right.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.800]   We don't have to watch this.
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.840]   He apparently helps Steve break up with his girlfriend.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:52.200]   Google discloses pathetic $9.5 million in bonuses.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.440]   That's okay.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:59.600]   Now Eric Schmidt got $6 million all by himself.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:05.960]   The chief financial officer Patrick Pachett, $3 million in yearly bonus, chief business
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:11.760]   officer Nakesh Rora, $3.5 million bonus, chief legal officer David Drummond, $3 million
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:12.760]   bonus.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.000]   That's down a little bit.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.600]   These all be paid in a couple of days.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.600]   So get ready.
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:20.120]   Silicon Valley for a big, big party.
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.960]   No cash bonuses for Larry or Sergey.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.480]   They didn't get the cash bonuses last year.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:29.480]   But I think when you're the owners, you don't get, I don't bonus myself at the end of the
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.480]   year.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:36.880]   $100 million in restricted stock though to Eric Schmidt along with his $6 million bonus.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:41.280]   See, that kind of tells you a little bit more.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:49.320]   In recognition of his contributions to Google's performance in fiscal year 2013, that's just
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.320]   purion.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.640]   That's just purion interest.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.920]   People want to know how much money they make.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:58.040]   Yeah, I mean on one hand, it's like a $3 million bonus had changed my life on the other
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.040]   hand.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.040]   It's not very much for Google.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.040]   No.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.040]   And actually it's down.
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.240]   Those $3 million bonuses were down to $3, $3, $3 million a year.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.240]   Some are down.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.240]   Some are down.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:11.200]   Some people, you know, bonuses are awarded based on merit on contribution.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:16.400]   Now I think there's some interesting stuff going on with the wearable technology here.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:21.280]   Some interesting comments.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:26.720]   Google's head of Android Chrome and Apps at South by Southwest talked about wearable tech
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:32.320]   and implied really what Google was going to do is make an SDK or some sort of low level,
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.640]   maybe an operating system for people who make wearable tech.
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:40.360]   And I wonder, he said in two weeks we're launching the first developer SDK for Android
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.360]   wearables.
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.600]   They will lay out the vision for developers and how we see this market working.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:49.320]   When we think of wearables, we think of it as a platform.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.880]   We see a world of sensors.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:51.880]   Sensors can be small and powerful.
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.360]   There are a lot of information that can be useful.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.640]   We want to build the right APIs for this world of sensors.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.760]   I wonder if Google isn't thinking of glass as more of a, and I've said this before, a
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.560]   learning experience and an actual product.
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:07.320]   And that ultimately they don't want to make all the, they want others to make the products,
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.960]   just as they want others to make Android phones.
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.800]   And if Google's on them, then they will be happy.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:18.440]   If Android is the OS of wearables and sensors, then that's an individual position, which
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:23.120]   also to me informs the interesting decision that Samsung made that their new watches are
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.120]   not Android.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.120]   Right.
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.120]   Right.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:29.520]   They're running ties in because they were saying that Android's too slow.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.400]   Few companies have the resources of Samsung to develop their own operating system.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:38.360]   Most companies will want to use it off the shelf.
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.920]   And that's either, I mean, there aren't that many choices.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.560]   There's QNX, I guess.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.840]   There's a few things you could use.
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:48.720]   But I think if Google says, look, we've got an wearable specific SDK with our Android
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:53.080]   operating system, it's small enough and powerful enough to do what you want.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:57.800]   And look, people using Google Glass got all this benefit out of it.
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.880]   I think that's pretty compelling.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:05.840]   And to me, it kind of underscores what I always thought, which is that they didn't really
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.640]   intend to make Glass be a product.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.640]   It was a learning experience.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.640]   It was a learning experience.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.320]   It was to stimulate the market.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:19.040]   Maybe it was like their Nexus phones and tablets, an example of what could be done.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.520]   But I think that they don't want to be a competitor to the people who might be using
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:23.520]   it.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.280]   That is an interesting question, because I've always said that Glass is the newton of whatever
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.280]   follows.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.280]   Right.
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.600]   But newton tried to be a product.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:30.600]   Right.
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:35.600]   Are there other examples you can think of before Google, before the Chromebook Pixel, before
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:43.440]   Glass, before these specula and any original Chromebook for that matter, that were what's
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:50.240]   the phrase you use for how good a product could be and we want to show you the way and
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.720]   actually release something in the public but not making it a product.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.120]   I mean, Apple has never did that.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.240]   Microsoft never did that.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:02.960]   Are there cases where companies have done that in the past that you can think of?
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.120]   Well, Microsoft.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.000]   Well, they released that way.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.800]   Well they didn't make computers until very, very recently.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.200]   They made the operating system.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:18.360]   Yeah, but they didn't make a computer to show you other computer makers how to make computers.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.000]   They didn't need, well, they do, Intel does that.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.760]   They did prototypes.
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.440]   Intel has been making concept PCs.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.000]   Yeah, there were concepts.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.440]   They're like, so I see what you're saying.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:33.440]   Do exactly like Glass, which is make something, release it, learn from it with the public.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.440]   Right.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.440]   That's a good thing.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.440]   I was thinking about it.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.440]   I was thinking about it.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.800]   It was real commercial products.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.120]   They were commercial products, but everybody laughed at them, right?
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.120]   I mean, right?
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.120]   Or the people just laughed at retrospect.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.400]   But Newton, everybody laughed at Newton too, but it was, they wanted it to be a commercial
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.400]   product.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.720]   I mean, this, the Segway was a commercial product.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.920]   Oh, it was supposed to change the world.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.920]   Right.
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:01.040]   But certainly with the note, I mean, they knew that the Segway would have to change culture
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.640]   in a way and change, you know, like people would have to change their idea of what they
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.640]   thought was dorky.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.640]   Of course, it didn't work.
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.640]   But...
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.400]   Segway was always intended to be a product.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.600]   It wasn't a test for a platform.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.480]   I mean, they never open sourced it or anything.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.640]   I think it's interesting to use this power that they have at Google to put out a product
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.480]   that sets the bar.
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:25.920]   Microsoft always did concept PCs, but you're right, they never made a PC.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:26.920]   But I don't think they needed to.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.920]   There were so many people making PCs.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.760]   They didn't have to do the research.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:36.200]   The Intel, hold on a second, Microsoft put the telemetry into...
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:41.280]   If you see behind me, there's an Intel box, I would go get it of a tablet right there.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.280]   Right.
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:43.280]   That Intel was going to release...
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.280]   Intel did it a lot.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:47.040]   They didn't release it to the market, but it reached that prototype stage.
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.440]   I worked on that product.
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.440]   Right.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:54.320]   And so that, you know, they put a large team on it, a lot of money.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.320]   It's a big R&D expert.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:25:02.080]   As somebody saying, to do as R&D to release a product publicly, of course, they got people
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.800]   to pay $1,500 for it, so I don't think they lost money.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.040]   Shmuck's like me.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.760]   But why do you say that?
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.280]   Don't you love it?
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:14.920]   No, I'm not trying to be mean to it anymore, but no.
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:15.920]   It's not.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.080]   All right, so look what I got.
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.520]   You didn't even notice, because I'm wearing this all day.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.680]   I've been wearing it for a couple of weeks now.
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.680]   Oh.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.560]   This is much more offensive.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.440]   This is the narrative clip.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.960]   If you go to getnarrative.com, you can...
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:35.040]   It was a Kickstarter project under the name of Moto.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.040]   All right.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.040]   Remember that?
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:41.320]   And I bought it as a Kickstarter project, I think, or maybe right after it went out
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.680]   of Kickstarter.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.720]   So I just got in mind, they're going out now.
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:51.800]   The idea is it's a clip you wear on your clothing.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:56.640]   It records a picture, not a great picture, five megapixel picture.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.640]   This is not it.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.840]   Let me go ahead.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:25:59.840]   See, this is...
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:00.840]   There you go.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.800]   Every 30 seconds.
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:07.240]   It has a capacity for 4,000 images.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.240]   It's USB connection.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.880]   Yeah, it's expensive.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.200]   It has two-day battery life.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.760]   So what you do is every day or so, you connect it up to a computer, the software downloads
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:22.800]   the images, puts them on narrative servers.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.840]   As far as I can tell, they don't have a web-based interface.
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:31.800]   You have to look or view your pictures on your smartphone.
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:37.400]   So there's a narrative app for iOS and for Android.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.920]   And I should put it on here so you can see the...
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:43.520]   Does it just make like stop-motion videos of your day or what?
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.520]   No.
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.520]   No, it's kind of weird.
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.520]   Well, I can show you, I think.
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.280]   The problem is, of course, it's everything.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.680]   So I have to be a little careful about it.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.120]   I'm going to show you.
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.120]   It's private.
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.920]   I mean, the whole idea is this is going to be private.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:57.920]   It's not...
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:04.960]   Yeah, well, I got to tell you, I don't recommend it for people with a large belly because it
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:05.960]   tipped my...
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.120]   I got a lot of pictures of the ceiling because it tips the...
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:15.360]   My belly tips the thing up just enough so that I'm really not getting pictures of anything
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.360]   interesting.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.200]   I'm going to try different ways of mounting.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.280]   It's loading these up now.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:23.440]   This is the other weird thing is that the pictures don't live on the phone.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.880]   There's a nice shot at the ceiling.
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.720]   They also don't live on...
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.120]   Well, here's a walk.
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.960]   Here I am walking in to work, I think.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:31.960]   So a lot of...
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.360]   And that's just because of how I'm wearing it.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.480]   It seems to take pictures up.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:39.120]   So I have to figure out a way to wear this that's not quite so.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.120]   But every 30 seconds...
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.160]   Now, this is trimmed.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:46.840]   So somehow they're looking for good pictures just like G+ does down to 71 photos.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:50.600]   If I turn off the trim, it's actually twice as many pictures, but they've taken some
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:51.600]   out.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.120]   If you put it face down or you're in a darkened room, it just stops.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.120]   Not very compelling.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.280]   Yeah, I mean, it's not supposed to be...
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.840]   It's supposed to be everything you did.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.720]   It's not like you're actively taking pictures.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.600]   You go back through it.
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.560]   I guess what I should show is something like...
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.880]   The first day I wore it, we had a dinner party.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:12.600]   So let me scroll through here.
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:13.600]   Trying to avoid...
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.240]   Do we get photos of the Japanese toilet in there?
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.240]   Do you mind if I showed them to you?
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.400]   I'm not asking.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.400]   I'm just asking.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.040]   Well, it shoots straight forward.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.040]   It doesn't shoot down.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:27.200]   So you're not going to get any of these on Paris.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.240]   So these are the first images I took.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.240]   I'll tell you, I spent a lot...
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:37.000]   Oh, if you double tap it as I did here, it stars it and says this is a start image.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   So you could tell.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.160]   I look at the computer screen a lot.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.280]   Here's our kitchen.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.280]   It isn't compelling.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:47.560]   It's supposed to be compelling in the sense that, oh, you want to save these pictures.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.160]   It's literally a record of what you did, what you looked at.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.640]   Right?
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.640]   All day.
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.640]   Okay.
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.680]   I don't know.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:03.400]   But you know, what I look at, for instance, Mike Elgin now used something for glass.
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:07.360]   I don't know if you guys already know about this, but it takes...
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.680]   It does it...
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.680]   It takes snapshots.
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.200]   Let me see if I can find his post.
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:17.600]   Take snapshots with your glass.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.600]   Not on order.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.760]   That actually even bothers me.
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:21.760]   Right.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:22.760]   Right.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:28.000]   Because I like that on glass I can tell people, listen, no, I'm...
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.560]   No, this is recording all the time.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.640]   Let me see if I can find it.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:37.360]   You know, at some point, this was years ago, but when Yahoo started to do some of their
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:42.960]   geolocation stuff with Flickr, they sent me a bike with a phone.
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.560]   It was a Symbian phone at that time.
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:48.440]   It kind of mounted into the handlebars.
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.920]   And there was accelerometer, GPS.
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.760]   So when the bike was in motion, it would do this.
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:55.040]   It would take a photo every five seconds or ten seconds or whatever.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.800]   It would automatically upload to Flickr, and then it would map it, right?
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:58.800]   So you'd have this like...
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:29:59.800]   That's more interesting.
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:03.160]   Which was really neat and really, really cool.
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.600]   And I enjoyed looking at them, but I found that...
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:09.040]   And I took some nice bike rides down by the ocean in San Diego, but I found that most
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.480]   of the pictures were not that usable, right?
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:17.160]   It was just sky or there wasn't anybody in it or whatever.
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:21.640]   And rather, other than jogging my memory about what a nice day that was down by the
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:26.160]   ocean, they were low quality or whatever, I didn't see a whole lot of...
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:31.120]   It felt like a lot of data and a lot of processing power for something that I didn't
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.720]   quite get the use for.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:36.480]   Now, for something like mapping, Google Maps or something like that, that makes a lot of
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.480]   sense.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.480]   Did you guys ever see...
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.720]   The program Mike used is called Moment Camera.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:46.360]   It's for the Google Glass.
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:53.520]   So I don't know what's happening with this movie, but it made a movie out of his day
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:57.400]   and took some stuff out and took some 48 minutes, four seconds.
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.200]   And this is from Glass.
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.280]   The movie's not playing, unfortunately.
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:03.520]   So there's something wrong with that.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:04.520]   It took a hike.
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.920]   It was beautiful images, but it's not all that interesting, frankly.
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:08.920]   No, it's not.
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:13.520]   I mean, one of my students has an effort to do this for people with Alzheimer's.
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.400]   So they can try to recall their day.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.400]   Well, that's what this...
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.720]   Okay, so that's where this came from.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.880]   So that was Gordon Bell wrote a book about this.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.760]   His wife, Brian Bell, had the Alzheimer's.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.560]   And Gordon was a guy who pioneered this.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.840]   He wore one of these cameras years ago.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:32.640]   And it was exactly it so that your life...
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:39.280]   For your personal benefit, so that your life would have total recall, that was the name
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.280]   of the book.
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.920]   Did you guys ever see the whale hunt?
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.520]   Jonathan Harris is the whale hunt?
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.520]   No.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:51.880]   Go to thewhalehunt.org and then click on the Begin Whale Hunt.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:56.200]   Jonathan is a magnificent and amazing artist.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.880]   So click on Begin Whale Hunt night.
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:04.200]   Now, he took a picture at least once every five minutes, more often if something was happening.
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:07.840]   Through Will and now, on the bottom right there, Leo, you can see that there's a mosaic
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.840]   and next to that there's a timeline.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:13.920]   You click on that, if you go to the right and see where there's a lot of photos, that's
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:14.920]   where stuff was happening.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:15.920]   Well, guess what they were getting?
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:16.920]   Right.
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:17.920]   Get out of whale.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:18.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.560]   And you can see the timeline, the kind of heartbeat of this there.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.560]   Wow.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:29.080]   And you're taking a picture, but this goes far beyond in terms of seeing what a day is
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.080]   like.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.080]   Yeah.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.520]   And getting some sense of using a camera.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.520]   And he's using a camera.
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:40.400]   But it shows you what's possible with this idea of collecting a day.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.400]   Right.
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:47.280]   And then a source by people, by colors, by how many photos there are.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.080]   And it's really absolutely fascinating.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:56.800]   So, so there's something to this, but just putting that clip on you.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:00.960]   Well, it's not for you're right.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.960]   It doesn't have any resonance if you're not me.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:08.800]   On the other hand, if I'm there, I think that I think it's early yet.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:09.800]   And this is very incriminating.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:10.880]   Yes, I agree.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.320]   But on the other hand, if so, a couple of things I would change, I'd make it a much
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:18.400]   more wide angle image so that even though it's pointing the wrong way, it would get
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.400]   the whole thing.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:22.160]   If it's a little fished eye because I want to see the faces.
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.960]   And then I'd love to be able to have some sort of interface where I could go in each
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:28.520]   night and say, Oh, that was Mike.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.520]   That was Joe.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:30.520]   That was Sally.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.520]   We were doing this.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:35.040]   And now I'd have kind of a record of the day that I could go back and search for and
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.040]   so forth.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:41.840]   And and that might be of use for somebody with memory disorders.
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:47.080]   Or maybe 20 years from now, if I want to kind of relive my day.
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:48.080]   I don't know.
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.360]   There's some obviously there's some interest in this notion.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:54.760]   The main reason I bring this up is because this is so much more offensive than Google
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:55.760]   Glass.
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:56.760]   It is.
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:59.080]   I was wearing it at the gym the other day.
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:02.280]   And I realized, you know, I'm taking pictures of all these people at the gym.
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:03.880]   They don't even know it.
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:08.960]   Yeah, but the gym cameras are doing the same, right?
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.960]   Right.
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.040]   And this is just for me.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.600]   I mean, I'm not sharing it.
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:18.240]   Yeah, I think I think it's a very simple modification of that device that makes it work that you
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:21.640]   have a camera you're constantly wearing and you can do a motion to take a picture when
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:22.640]   you want to.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.640]   I can.
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:24.640]   I can double tap this.
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:28.880]   Then I think that's if you take off the constantly on, you just have the ability to record
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.880]   something and it's always right there.
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.880]   Right.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:32.880]   Either there as simple as that.
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:33.880]   You don't pull out your phone.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.880]   You don't do anything else.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:41.920]   That has utility and it also is a last is a signal that says I'm, you know, a starship.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.480]   You know, I know I'm doing this.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.160]   So Dr. Morbius, I love it, says this is dumb.
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:50.240]   There's a reason you don't remember mundane things.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:55.320]   You're not supposed to brain noise.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.320]   It's just it.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:01.960]   And it boy, you really realize how much of your day is unmemorable and doesn't deserve
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:02.960]   to be remembered.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:03.960]   Totally unremarkable.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:07.440]   Other than times when I'm like, Oh, remember that old apartment we lived in?
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:08.440]   How did we have that set?
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:09.440]   Right.
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.440]   I would love that.
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.880]   I love to walk through the apartment I lived in 15 years ago.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.160]   You know, that kind of thing.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:18.720]   I guess we'll have that though because we take so many damn pictures now with our smart
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.720]   phones.
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:20.720]   Right.
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.720]   That's true.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:26.240]   If I go back through my Google plus image library, that that is actually a pretty good
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:30.600]   record of all the interesting stuff I did anyway.
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.840]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:33.840]   Yeah.
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.040]   Anyway, just I think it's interesting.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:41.200]   Yeah, two 79, I can't really recommend it because it's pretty pricey.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.920]   Is this before you buy?
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.600]   No, I bought it.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.600]   But I'll review.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.960]   I bought it when they first when they first announced it.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:49.800]   So I just it was almost a year ago.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:50.800]   So just came the other day.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:56.600]   I'll definitely review it on before you buy it on Tuesday.
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:00.640]   I think it's something that's has some interest and for some people might be.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.960]   But I really talk about privacy issues.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.360]   I mean, okay, so what so what is different?
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.160]   I mean, I'm seeing everything.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.160]   Well, it's different.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.720]   I recorded for my later review.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:11.720]   Is that somehow?
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.880]   Well, the difference is very simple.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:20.960]   On glass as designed, I have to hit a button or say Google take a picture.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.240]   And so it's an explicit act that I'm choosing to do.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:28.000]   And that one assumes that I have some measure permission to do this and that there are some
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.880]   transparency that I'm doing it.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.880]   And that's the difference.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.280]   That's why that same device.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:37.040]   With an obvious movement, I'd be absolutely cool with it.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.320]   I said, no problem with it.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.520]   Somebody would know you're taking a picture.
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.520]   Fine.
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:49.320]   Bianca Bosker writing about it for the Huffington Post, the sub the title was nice to meet you.
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.120]   I've already taken your picture.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:55.160]   And by the way, this is completely typical of the kind of picture that you get.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:58.720]   This is a picture of her putting on her eye makeup from below.
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.000]   Because that's the problem.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.200]   I mean, this thing is, you know, it's not it's nobody's aiming it.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:07.120]   At least with glass, you know what you're kind of what you're going to get, right?
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:08.120]   Right.
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.120]   There's no viewfinder and you're not.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:11.680]   Yeah, you're not even if you just double tap it.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:12.680]   You don't know.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:13.680]   You really don't know what you're going to get.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.680]   Right.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.880]   If you're sure it's rumbold or if I wear this no bar in San Francisco is it completely
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.560]   reasonable that I would get beaten up.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:24.440]   Well, the difference between that and glass is that it's a much less, you know, or much
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.800]   less conspicuous, right?
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:26.800]   It's a speaker.
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:27.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:32.560]   I think it's less it think it's less offensive because of that to people.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:35.640]   Like, yeah, like it's glasses like in your face.
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:38.360]   No, but even if they know, I don't think it bothers them.
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:40.520]   I don't think I don't think they were complaining about being recorded.
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.880]   I think they were complaining about about Google.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:43.880]   Attitude.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:44.880]   Capitalism and.
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.280]   That's what I kind of think.
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.280]   But I don't know.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.800]   You tell me, are you really annoying?
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:52.800]   Is it really annoying?
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.200]   Are you really annoyed by the fact that I'm taking your picture at all?
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:58.240]   You know, twice a minute while I talk to you.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.360]   I mean, the truth is you can you can.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.240]   I mean, the spies do it.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.680]   You can put a camera in a button.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:04.680]   Right.
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.680]   Nobody deal.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:07.680]   Right.
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:08.680]   But you kind of know you're doing something bad.
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.280]   Put a lapel pin on.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:11.280]   Right.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.280]   And you want it.
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.280]   Right.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:16.280]   Yeah, this at least is kind of a kind of looks like a camera.
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.880]   Well, but it doesn't say what is that.
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:21.920]   I mean, unless you are really geeky and watch the show, you're not going to know what that
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:22.920]   is.
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:23.920]   No.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:24.920]   You think it's a pacemaker or something?
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:25.920]   Well, you can see a lens.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:26.920]   You could see the.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.920]   You're giving a lot of.
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.920]   Yeah, I'm going to put a lot of fun into that.
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.720]   Yeah, when I just looked at it, I hadn't heard of it.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.360]   I thought it was some sort of fit that fit better.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.880]   Yeah, that's one of a tell people.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.280]   That's just my heart rate monitor.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.280]   Don't pay no.
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.040]   Pay no attention to that.
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:43.040]   But smile.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:48.320]   Hey, you're on Leo's chest.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.720]   You're on my camera.
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.920]   Hey, Prince, can I get down with this on my lapel?
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.920]   Huh?
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:54.920]   Huh?
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:55.920]   Huh?
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.880]   I wonder if he'd I get thrown out of Prince concert.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:38:59.880]   That's the question.
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:03.280]   Well, that now makes me want to go to a Prince concert with hidden cameras and just have
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.280]   fun.
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.760]   Yeah, just to mess with him.
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.040]   It's troll Prince.
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:10.760]   That's troll Prince.
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:16.000]   So I think the Android based SDK is a very for wearables is a very smart move on Google's
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   part.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.320]   Nobody else is doing this, right?
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:22.800]   They want to know they want to be in the Android strategy worked, right?
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:26.480]   The strategy was always to have this free operating system out there.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:29.760]   The more it's installed, the more developers were right for it, the more customers will
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.320]   have it, the more power they have.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:32.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.320]   Yep.
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.320]   That's it.
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:39.120]   Hey, good, good news for you guys in Manhattan.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:43.160]   You know, Microsoft still doesn't have a store in Manhattan.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:50.080]   Apple does and next Google Google apparently searching for retail space in New York City.
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.280]   I'll be there.
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:55.440]   I think that didn't they they put some money down on a on a place not far from the Apple
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.440]   coordinate cranes.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.480]   They're close to signing a lease for an eight thousand square foot, which is pretty small.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:04.320]   Eight thousand square foot down facility at 131 Green Street in Soho.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.320]   Just a block.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:09.360]   Just a block from Apple's own Soho store, which is nice.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:16.360]   So hoes with is like art galleries and a very fancy expensive shopping.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.120]   Well, actually now it's become so touristy.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.360]   It's got it's basically every brand you already know.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:26.440]   And it's like a crew and H&M and and Uniqlo and all that.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:29.280]   It's it's it's it's on a few galleries and right.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.680]   It's where I used to go to get my Oliver people's glasses.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:33.680]   Exactly.
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:40.280]   You know, I'm fascinated what was happening best by best by his hand over huge boutique
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:43.920]   space to Samsung and Microsoft less so Google.
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.200]   I know that Google.
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:48.840]   I mean, I sent best by to Google years ago and they were doing on their own.
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:52.160]   They were actually they were they didn't send them they were on their own anyway, but but
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.560]   there was talk about about Google space and best by stores.
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:59.160]   I think Google could go beyond just saying, here's an excess because you can see it everywhere.
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:04.520]   I think, you know, Google can can can wow us with the Google lifestyle.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:07.680]   That's when it strikes me is that Google doesn't restore some applies that they're there to
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:08.680]   sell something.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:11.800]   There's a counter and yeah, I don't think that's really what these things are when I look.
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:17.280]   I mean, they have Chromebook things in the airport and it's really more about just yeah,
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:22.880]   look at all the things you can do with Chromebooks and Nexus's and maps and and you know what
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:26.120]   people go into that and when we're I owe right everybody goes into the G.O.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:33.120]   desk dome to play with the map thing and say, Google's cool and then Google is do more
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.120]   of that.
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:38.080]   It'll be situated in between Tiffany and Louis Vuitton.
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:41.360]   It tells you something, doesn't it?
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.720]   And maybe there'll be a line around the corner of people who've been locked out of their
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:44.720]   Gmail account.
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:51.200]   I get support for Gmail because I'm just I forgot my password.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:57.600]   I want to see if they do a genius bar support area, you know, I think that's a game show.
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.760]   The Google geniuses versus the the Apple geniuses.
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.960]   That'd be fun, wouldn't it?
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:08.200]   Well, I mean, that movie the internship would have you believe that there's a fleet of,
[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:12.640]   you know, Google customer support folks who want to help you out with.
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.640]   You're a son.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:14.640]   I've had on an issue.
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.240]   I mean, they're there.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.400]   Okay, Google now.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.400]   What's up?
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.400]   Good afternoon.

[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.640]   It's part of the Moto X.
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:03.640]   Oh, oh wait.
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:04.640]   Oh, so that's the.

[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:27.000]   I'm getting tech news stories about what's that.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.800]   What's that?
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:29.800]   My.
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:35.800]   That Moto X really still.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:36.800]   What's up?
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.480]   Yeah, I won't do it.
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:41.920]   It's part of their touchless control.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.920]   What's that home?
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:47.320]   Yeah, I got what's.
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:50.440]   It's pretty is pretty cool.
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:55.400]   I have to say this is the touchless stuff on the Moto X is pretty amazing.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.560]   Apparently, what is that cyanogen mod phone?
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:02.000]   The one on one or whatever it's called?
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.640]   They're going to I don't know if you talked about this last night on all about Android,
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:11.600]   but they're going to have some sort of touchless control as well in the they say.
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:16.560]   In fact, they're asking on their website now people to vote on what the phrase will
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:21.200]   be because it has to be something easy to say easy to remember.
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:24.080]   But cyanogen mod, ain't it?
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.080]   Yeah.
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:30.080]   They have to have something.
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.080]   Yeah.
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.440]   And well, the apple, the N one and one.
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.480]   Santa one edition, right?
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.880]   Yeah.
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.600]   I think you should ask Tim.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.840]   In tribute to the obvious ask Tim.
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:45.200]   Okay, we're asked Jarvis.
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:49.880]   I'd take it or better yet, Gina.
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:55.320]   Isn't Microsoft has like a help thing that's going to be called Cortana?
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:57.360]   Cortana, yeah, which is a character.
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:58.360]   Halo, yeah.
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:44:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.280]   The one plus, that's it.
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:05.280]   One plus I was trying to remember the name one plus phone and the there.
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:07.600]   Let me see what the what the they're going to have.
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:10.200]   Moto X style commands.
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:15.480]   The op-o is making some very interesting hardware and I like the idea, I guess, that
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.440]   it's based on cyanogen mod, which is the the the.
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:21.760]   The op-o is yeah, the new one plus.
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:22.760]   Okay.
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:29.440]   I don't know if they're going to have the capability that the Moto X does of having listening without
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.840]   using a lot of power.
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:37.040]   So the vote vote currently, how would you like to wake up your one plus one is okay,
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:39.240]   one plus is number one.
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:42.000]   Wake up one plus is number two.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.040]   Alakazam in third place.
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.040]   I like Alakazam.
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:49.040]   That's something you say in regular life.
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:50.040]   Right.
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:54.240]   Because you don't want it to be like, Hey, hey, anytime you say that, hey, one plus.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:46:00.040]   Hey, one plus there was a great Google plus post last week that somebody listens to us
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:02.240]   in their car with their Moto X there.
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.840]   And every time any one of us says Google.
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.640]   Oh, yeah, it's driving crazy.
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:08.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.840]   Plus, let's all do it.
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:12.640]   Was it okay, Google?
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:15.640]   Okay, Google or okay, Google now.
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:18.640]   I like it.
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.240]   Okay, Google.
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.240]   What's up?
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:29.240]   Same thing happens with the Xbox.
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.240]   Watch this.
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:35.640]   Anybody watching us in the Xbox, if I say Xbox, turn off.
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:39.640]   This is the problem we're going to have with speech recognition.
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:41.440]   It's going to be a problem.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:45.040]   It's going to hit podcasters, especially hard.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:48.840]   You're going to get, you know, okay car turn left is going to be a problem when you say
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:49.840]   that.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:50.840]   Yeah.
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.640]   Yeah, I'm not looking forward to that.
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:58.240]   All right, we're going to take a break when we come back the Google change log.
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.140]   Yeah.
[00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:01.040]   Our show today brought to you.
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.440]   I'm good ones this week.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:03.440]   You stay tuned.
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:06.440]   Yeah, you will want to miss it.
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:13.320]   Our show today brought to you by 286,999 designers who want to create designs for you
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:16.320]   at 99designs.com.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.520]   It is a great place to go.
[00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:24.800]   If you have an app, a business, you want some beautiful design, you're not a designer
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:27.680]   yourself, which is most of you don't think you are.
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:33.960]   If you are not trained, whether it's a new logo or website, a stationary t-shirt, there's
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:39.440]   a designer at 99designs.com that could bring your idea to life.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:43.280]   Wouldn't it be cool if you could start a design contest today, get dozens of designers?
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:47.560]   It's submitting ideas to you within the next few days you could pick and pay as little
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:51.800]   as $199 with a 100% money back guarantee.
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:52.800]   We love 99designs.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:53.800]   We use it all the time.
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:54.800]   We just got our new hoodies.
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:55.800]   Let me show you.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:48:00.280]   If you go to teespring.com/twits, you can see the new hoodie.
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:04.040]   We got this design by a designer at 99designs.
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.840]   And they really did a lovely job with the logo.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:09.400]   But I have to say, we had a contest.
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:10.880]   We have a 40 submissions.
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:13.560]   We liked five of the designs so much we bought all five of them.
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:19.120]   I think we paid $299 each because they're just great.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:24.680]   We have a ladies style Bella hooded sweatshirt too.
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:26.240]   And don't buy one, Jeff Regina.
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.600]   Just want to say do not get one.
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:30.800]   You'll find out why later.
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:31.800]   So 99--
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:34.400]   I'll be getting one for you to get for someone else.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.400]   Oh, that's OK.
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:36.400]   Yeah, come here.
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.560]   Burke's wearing his right now.
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:40.200]   99designs.com, that's where we got this.
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:43.320]   That's where you're going to get great designs.
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:46.200]   Burke says, that's what Burke's working on.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.120]   Can you do a little turn on the catwalk?
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.560]   You ought to sexy for your hoodie.
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:53.320]   To sexy for your hoodie.
[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:54.320]   I like the logo on the arm.
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:54.840]   It's cool.
[00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:55.280]   Isn't that cool?
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.280]   Yeah.
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:57.560]   99designs.com.
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:03.400]   If you go to 99designs.com/twig, you'll get a $99 power pack of services, absolutely
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:04.400]   free.
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.240]   That'll give you more designer time and attention.
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:11.200]   You'll build, highlight, and feature your design in the 99designs marketplace.
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:14.240]   You'll get twice as many designs as a result.
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:19.320]   Everybody go to 99designs.com/twig.
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:24.440]   And now break out the trumpets because my friends, it is time for the Google change
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:26.960]   log.
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:32.440]   The Google change log.
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:38.480]   And of course, who better than Gina Trapani to give us the latest from Google?
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:42.360]   The big item, new item this week is Google Drive add-ons.
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:45.760]   Think about these like Gmail Labs features.
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:50.840]   They're add-ons, extensions to Google Drive, not to Chrome the browser, but in Google Drive.
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:56.600]   So in Google Docs and the new version of Google Sheets, there is a new add-ons menu.
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:58.160]   This is actually rolling out right now.
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.160]   And I'm not seeing it in my Google Apps.
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.160]   I got it.
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.160]   Oh, you got it.
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.160]   Great, Jeff.
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:04.400]   There's a new add-ons menu.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:08.800]   So you click on the add-ons menu, you select get add-ons, and that's where you can install
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:09.800]   add-ons.
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:14.960]   And these are basically just little new features that are developed, some developed by Google,
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:19.160]   some developed by partners that add functionality to Google Drive.
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:24.360]   They've got add-ons that translate the selective text, find synonyms, create a table of contents
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.640]   and certain maps.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.640]   Basically, add a lot of different kinds of fun.
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.400]   So where will we see this again?
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:35.080]   How do we see if we have it on the top of Docs?
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:39.720]   Yes, you have to be in Docs or Sheets, the new version of Sheets.
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:42.000]   There will be a menu item add-ons.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.840]   Next to tools, right, Jeff?
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:45.880]   Yeah, up top.
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.360]   So how am I getting Docs?
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:49.080]   Yeah, like creating a new Doc.
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.080]   Just created, huh?
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.080]   Right.
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:52.080]   Oh, I don't have to be in Docs.
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:54.280]   I don't have to be specifically in Docs.
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:55.280]   Hold on.
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:57.080]   Yeah, you don't have to be like in a Doc.
[00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:58.080]   Okay, I'm in a Doc.
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:50:59.080]   There's the menu.
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:00.080]   Add-ons.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:01.080]   It's right there.
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:02.080]   Look at it.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.080]   It's how exciting.
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:06.440]   The best, the best, the best, the best, the best, the best, the best.
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:08.440]   What are the best?
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:10.080]   Drive has trace changes.
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:12.080]   Oh, that's huge.
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:13.080]   Which you see, this-
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:15.080]   I'm having to have that in Wave.
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:16.080]   Right.
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:17.080]   And we never added in here.
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.720]   Finally, it's through an add-on.
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:19.720]   Wow.
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:22.720]   Now, these are free or some of them are-
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:26.640]   Yeah, so I think that some of these services actually may be paid for, but I believe these
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:27.640]   add-ons are free.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:30.800]   I think the fax one, for example, charges you.
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:31.800]   Yeah.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:36.360]   But this is like putting, you know what, this is directly competitive with Word.
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:40.280]   Track changes is a feature Microsoft Word has had for years, but was always missing for
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:41.280]   Docs.
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:42.280]   That's great.
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:44.080]   It's a translate right within Docs.
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:45.960]   You can add a map within Docs.
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:48.680]   You can do a conference call around a Doc.
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:50.280]   Oh, this is great.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:51.440]   Very cool.
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:55.960]   You could have a Google Sheet, for example, of names and addresses and select all the addresses
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:58.680]   in generated Google Map with an add-on.
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:01.480]   And then they enter the add-ons menu, so they'll be there-
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:02.480]   Right.
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:03.480]   Wow, this is really great.
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:04.480]   This is really great.
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:05.480]   Right, they'll be there as they get released.
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:09.400]   Life Hacker did a rundown of the best add-ons that are available right now.
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:11.840]   Hello Facts is one of them that Jeff just mentioned.
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:15.320]   You can send a fax directly from Drive with the Hello Facts.
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:19.680]   Mapping Sheets, which was just saying, you can select a bunch of addresses and make a
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:20.680]   map.
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:25.800]   Easy Bib, which creates bib biographies using MLA, APA or Chicago style.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:29.320]   You just select your sources and citations and it makes it.
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:33.440]   There's an Uber conference, MindMister, Track Changes, tons of stuff here.
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:35.400]   So this is a really, really big change.
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:36.760]   And I love this.
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:41.360]   I love the way Google has this history of providing these hosted apps, but then creating
[00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:46.400]   hooks for developers to create extensions to them, much like labs.
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:51.000]   But what I like about this is that it's open obviously to external developers, at least
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   our partners.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.920]   What do you write these in?
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:55.760]   Yeah, well, that's the thing.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:56.760]   That's a good question.
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:00.760]   They haven't exposed, as far as I know, they haven't exposed an API or an SDK for these.
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:02.480]   I think they reached out to partners.
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:06.800]   And now on this initial release to see what they can get.
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:08.440]   And hopefully they are going to make it.
[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:13.120]   I would love to see a store for this kind of thing, much like the Chrome store or the
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:14.120]   web store.
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:17.200]   But right now it's just like the partners in Google creating these features.
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:22.000]   And that was always my gripe with Gmail Labs is that those lab features only came from
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.560]   inside Google.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:30.720]   But it's complicated to make extensions to a hosted app like that.
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:31.840]   So yeah, really cool stuff.
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:34.080]   That was a big new thing this week.
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:35.080]   Look at this.
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:42.360]   You can sign docs with HelloSign, which gives you legally binding signatures in docs.
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.840]   Well, if I accept it, but yeah, you can just put a signature on.
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:50.720]   And because I have a fax machine somewhere and I have to plug it in and plug it into
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:55.040]   the phone line, it's only one phone line now, and it's a pain in the butt.
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:56.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:57.840]   So now I don't even have to fax.
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:00.120]   I don't have to, I don't have to print out and scan the document.
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:01.120]   All that stuff.
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:02.120]   I can just sign the document online with this.
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:03.120]   And it's great.
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:04.120]   This is really neat.
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:05.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:09.640]   I mean, I send the fax maybe once or twice a year and that kind of thing is so.
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:10.640]   So.
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:11.640]   HelloSign is the same.
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:12.640]   People do HelloFacts.
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:14.640]   I have to add that too.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:15.640]   Wow.
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:16.640]   Charts.
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:18.240]   I like the pro writing aid.
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:26.080]   It'll detect plagiarism as well as errors, grammatical mistakes in your writing, consistency
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.080]   check.
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:28.080]   This is really neat.
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:29.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:30.080]   Avery has a male merge feature.
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:32.080]   A male merge.
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:33.080]   That's cool.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:34.080]   Yep.
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:35.080]   Charts.
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:39.880]   So I could see you could, you could not only get to, you know, this is what Microsoft Office
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:40.880]   should do.
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:45.840]   You could get to all of the power of Microsoft Office, but the user controls the complexity
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:49.440]   by just adding the add-ons they need and adding it to the menu.
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:54.920]   So now imagine, for example, that screenwriters could do an add-on for formatting scripts.
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:55.920]   Right.
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:59.680]   Well, I'm sure they will.
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:00.680]   All kinds of things.
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:02.720]   This is really neat.
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:03.720]   It's very neat.
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:04.720]   And it's so quiet.
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:05.720]   They read Gina.
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:06.720]   It just came out with a whisper.
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:07.720]   Yeah.
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:08.720]   Yeah, it did.
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:09.720]   It did.
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:10.720]   It's actually, it's pretty incredible.
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:12.120]   And it was pretty quiet.
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:15.040]   And this goes so far beyond things just like templates.
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:20.040]   Like I'm thinking, I'd love to see something like, you know, something that connected help
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:21.840]   outs, for example, to drive.
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:24.360]   Like, you know, you have some of those, those review.
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:27.120]   There's one add-on that lets you get approval from your team.
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:28.560]   Like, yeah, this document's good to go.
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:29.560]   The check mark.
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:32.560]   But I'm just thinking about like, say, writing your resume, you know, that, that kind of
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:33.560]   thing.
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:36.600]   You can start off with a template, but then to have others review it or translations.
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.000]   Also, you know, translation review.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.480]   I mean, in so many, so many situations you want to collaborate with trusted advisors or
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:46.080]   friends or maybe even strangers just to get, you know, get help with something that you're
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.080]   writing.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:49.160]   And I feel like this feel like a step toward that.
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:51.960]   Create a conference call within a document.
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:55.240]   Here's code pretty formats code blocks is a pretty printer.
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:56.480]   Oh, man.
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:58.080]   This is so nice.
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:01.800]   I actually had made the connection that this was very wave-like, but this is like the
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:05.360]   widgets and add-ons that you could build into a paper.
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:07.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:08.360]   Memories.
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:10.360]   Mmm.
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:11.360]   All right.
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:12.360]   So created doc.
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:16.000]   They've come up with the new add-ons menu since I first saw it.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.240]   And I saw it like, you know, yesterday.
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:19.240]   Yeah.
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:20.240]   Huge list.
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:22.760]   You can manage your add-ons here, rate them.
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:24.760]   This is good.
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:26.080]   The music notation.
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.080]   That's new.
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:28.720]   Yeah, I love that.
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:29.720]   Jesus.
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:30.720]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:31.720]   Mailchimp merge.
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:32.720]   Yeah.
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:34.920]   You could merge your mail with chips.
[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:35.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:40.360]   They'll keep writing and writing until you finally turn out.
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:45.000]   Thousands of monkeys, 10,000 monkeys.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.160]   You can do that any now.
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:50.000]   So but they didn't publish an API for this?
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.840]   Not as far as I know.
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:53.120]   And this is typical of them, right?
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:57.120]   I mean, it seems like that they would, that this is, you know, the initial launch is just
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:58.360]   to see what people can do.
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:56:59.800]   They'll see how popular it is.
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:00.800]   And then--
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:06.640]   Here's a blog lab-null, L-A-B-N-O-L.org post that says how to write an ad on for Google
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:07.640]   docs.
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:12.800]   You use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, kind of like any traditional web app.
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:17.240]   Open a new document inside Google Drive, choose tools, script editor.
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:20.720]   This is the apps, script IDE.
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:23.440]   And then you could paste in this code.
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:28.320]   That's going to give you this kind of a generic add-on.
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:33.720]   And then you can write the server side script.
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:38.200]   And then so this actually looks like something you could do pretty easily.
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:40.000]   I stand correct.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.480]   It's able to change this, choose a alarm.
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:43.120]   This is from a Meet Argo-All.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:44.760]   Uh-huh, yeah, it meets great.
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:45.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:47.840]   And then you can share it with other users.
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:51.400]   You just have to share to document if I didn't even view.
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:52.400]   That's pretty neat.
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:56.600]   Okay, so this isn't sort of the, you know, you can't get placed next to the folks like
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:59.720]   MailChub and Hello Facts, but yeah, this is a way to script that.
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:09.240]   You could put yourself, it says you can add yourself to the Chrome extension store.
[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:15.800]   So it sounds like it's like a Chrome extension.
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:21.840]   Yeah, this is, I forgot that the apps has the script IDE where you can create scripts
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:27.000]   much like macros, you know, in Microsoft Office.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.160]   But this is based on HTML.
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.160]   Yeah, this is great.
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:30.160]   It meets great.
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:31.600]   So I do guys stand correct that there is a way to do this.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:32.600]   I love it.
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:36.000]   With apps script, you can create add-ons for Google Sheets, docs or forms, automate your
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:39.440]   workflow, integrate with external APIs and more.
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:42.520]   And Google does document this at developers.google.com.
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:44.360]   So search for apps script.
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:51.240]   And there, it totally tells you how to create a docs add-on, custom menu in Google Sheets.
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:52.240]   That's sweet.
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:54.440]   I'm glad I was wrong about that.
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:55.440]   That's good.
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:56.440]   Sweet.
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:57.440]   So sweet.
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:59:01.680]   Now, yeah, how do you get in that menu of items?
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:02.680]   I don't know.
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:04.160]   I guess Google curates that.
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.320]   The track changes is looking a little bit awkward.
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:09.160]   So I want people to compete and to compete and to help the best track.
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:10.600]   Yeah, let's make a better one.
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:11.600]   Right.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:13.360]   I'm going to write a word count.
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:14.360]   It's going to be so good.
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:17.520]   It's going to do spaces, words, paragraphs.
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:18.720]   You're going to love it.
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:21.280]   I use that more than you would.
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:23.840]   Germans assign you by characters.
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:24.840]   Oh.
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:27.360]   The Americans by words.
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:28.360]   Huh?
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:29.360]   Character.
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:30.360]   Wow.
[00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:31.360]   Character.
[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:32.360]   I get character assignments from Germany.
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:38.280]   So you can use fewer but larger words and still make your best account.
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:39.280]   German.
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:40.280]   That defines German.
[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:42.280]   Figure spits in confusion.
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:48.360]   I feel like, am I having a stroke?
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:50.000]   I don't understand what he's talking about.
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.640]   Does it make any sense at all to everybody?
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:54.440]   Gina, you understand this?
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:59.880]   Well, in a situation where you've got only so much space to print characters, right?
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:02.800]   Okay, I guess I'm just out of it.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:07.920]   I stayed up last night playing your chest and you were over this bubble.
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:08.920]   Oh.
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:12.920]   Hey, I wish the day.
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:16.840]   I think Jeff Jarvis invented the World Wide Web that day.
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:18.440]   That's my memory of it anyway.
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:19.440]   Sir Jeff to you.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.440]   Sir Jeff.
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:26.840]   Anyway, big add on.
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.560]   That was just the first of the Google change log.
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:29.560]   Go ahead.
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:30.560]   That was the first in the biggest.
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.480]   Got a couple of other minor items.
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:34.680]   Gmail iOS app got an update.
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:35.680]   Yeah.

[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:40.600]   and synced.
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:41.600]   So they're right there.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:45.680]   When you open up the app, no more pauses while you wait for inbox refresh.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:49.440]   This is dependent on iOS seven and you'll have to turn on background app refresh and
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:53.080]   notifications for the Gmail app to work like this.
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:57.960]   And the Gmail app for iOS also supports sign in across Google iOS apps, including maps,
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:59.600]   drives, drive YouTube and Chrome.
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.960]   So you sign into one, you sign into all.
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:02.960]   Same thing for sign out.
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:06.520]   So nice, nice update there for the Google iOS apps.
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:07.520]   Yeah.
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:13.760]   Google quietly redesigns their newspaper archive, which I didn't even know that they had makes
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.080]   make searching through them easier.
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:21.600]   So you get a news.google.com/newspaper and you'll see this archive paper that this archive
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:25.240]   page that shows hundreds of newspapers organized by title.
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:28.360]   You can search within those papers or look through other news sources.
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:30.360]   You can look at issues from specific dates.
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:32.160]   I played around a little bit.
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.160]   I didn't know about this either.
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.160]   I had no idea.
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:38.240]   I love go to the inland empire.

[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:46.640]   First edition.
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.640]   Oh, look at that.
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:48.720]   And just look at the first two columns.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.720]   Like the first third columns.
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:50.720]   I love this.
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:55.760]   I use this as a background for if you can zoom in on the first column, the second column
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.040]   on the first page.
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:59.800]   It just has this great small newspaper stuff.
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:05.480]   Trouble in Tokyo, the Japanese resent terms of peace treaty with violence.
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:09.640]   The late Joseph Jefferson advised one of his friends as soon as he passed 70 to cultivate
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:10.640]   a garden.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:16.480]   The saddest thing in old age, he said with a smile as if nothing were holy sad is the
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:18.480]   absence of expectation.
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.560]   Oh, Dr. C.H.
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:26.040]   McComb, a dentist of Missoula stopped off here Saturday to look over the country and consider
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:31.600]   the feasibility of locating for the practice of his possession profession.
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:32.600]   He's pleased with the community.
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:33.600]   I'm glad to report.
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.680]   I just love this.
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:42.320]   Wendy Parchar makes daily trips between Moore and Rockford a distance of six miles being
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:45.360]   in the service of Uncle Sam as male carrier.

[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:54.880]   jump from morning until night, literally painting the town all colors.
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:55.880]   What?
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:58.120]   What's a different world?
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:02.880]   Hey, here's a barber who cuts hair with a neatness and dispatch guaranteed.
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:08.400]   Here's my favorite J. David of Utica, a son of Dr. O.F. David drove in from that place
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:14.640]   Tuesday of last week, bringing with him Mrs. H.G. Phillips and Mrs. J. G. Hontun.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:20.840]   These ladies were returning to Louis Town from a 10 days visit with Utica friends.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.600]   Film at 11.
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:26.040]   Here is a physician and surgeon whom does house calls.

[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:37.840]   I'm going to do a house call before you buy, get our prices.
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:41.240]   This is really, really fun.
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:47.600]   That is the Inland Empire, which I guess is a Montana newspaper from 1905.
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.320]   Look at all the newspapers.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.760]   Look at the density of the text.
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.600]   Lots of newspapers, but I have to tell you, the first thing I reach for was the New York
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:55.600]   Times.
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:58.800]   I want to get some classic New York Times going on there and I couldn't find them.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:01.760]   It's a limited collection, but as you can see, there's something really great.
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:03.520]   You can search for the New York Times at the New York Times.
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:09.360]   That's how I, when I did all my stuff about the fiendish Kodakkers line and weight in the
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:13.360]   1890s about privacy and cameras, it was from the New York Times equivalent.
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:16.880]   It's just great to read these things in the original piece.
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:18.120]   So Google scanned these?
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.120]   Is that where they came from?
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:21.040]   Yeah, there's a limited sample of them.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:25.800]   I don't know how they got them or what the deal is.
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:26.880]   I don't know.
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:27.880]   This was totally new to me.
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:30.280]   Oh, they redesigned this thing and I had no idea.
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:31.920]   No, there was another one.
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:33.800]   We've been covering Google for five years.
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.800]   Didn't know.
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:38.200]   One of the surprise Google products.
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:42.160]   Yeah, and so it's not papers that are trying to sell their archives like the New York Times
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.160]   Act.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.160]   Those have real value.
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:48.480]   And it seems like it's very old stuff for the most part.
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:50.960]   Yeah.
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:53.400]   Although here's the Bluffton Chronicle.
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:57.880]   Blackfoot Valley Dispatch from 2009.
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:03.760]   So you could see what's going on in Blackfoot Valley.
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:05.880]   Lincoln Rodeo draws a patriotic crowd.
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:06.880]   Yeah.
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:07.880]   Yeah.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:12.400]   The Forest Service offers thinning demo.
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:13.800]   There's nothing like small town papers.
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:17.960]   You know, I bet the crime, I bet the crime files fabulous here.
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:20.440]   Lordy, Lordy, guess who's 40?
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:21.440]   Who could it be?
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:23.440]   Must be Annie.
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:24.440]   Congratulations, Annie.
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:25.440]   Aw.
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:26.440]   Aw, yeah.
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:30.720]   Lordy, Lordy, guess who's 40?
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:31.720]   That's great.
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:32.720]   So great.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.120]   Now you talk about communities.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.560]   You know, this was communities.
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:37.160]   Yeah, this is amazing.
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:38.960]   This was what it was, folks.
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:39.960]   Small town papers.
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:43.960]   We got all haughty and snotty and thought we were changing the world.
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:46.800]   We were telling you that ladies came back from Utica after a long time.
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:49.440]   I'd say the pedal of my Argus career.
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:50.440]   Oh, I wonder.
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:52.440]   I bet you could search for it, Leo.
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:53.440]   Oh, it'll be fun.

[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.520]   What was going on is right.
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.920]   Light problem with the old microfiche there.
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:22.920]   Yeah, yeah, unfortunately.
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:27.160]   We got a big black section.
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.160]   This is great.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:29.520]   I'm going to have to go through some of this stuff.
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.520]   Oh, give us a sample.
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:34.160]   A complaint of exceptional bitterness.
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:39.520]   See, I was a bit a little bit even back then.
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:43.920]   Was filed in the Superior Court of San Francisco Saturday afternoon.
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:49.520]   The suit brought by Walter Dinmore against his father-in-law, his sister-in-law, his
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:57.120]   brother-in-law, and his wife's attorney-at-law asking for damages in the sum of $50,000
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:01.800]   for malicious and pernicious influence in which the said defendants still continue to
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:06.920]   exert over a nanny Dinmore, the plaintiff's wife.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:12.320]   He has been wrongfully deprived of the affection, society, and services of his said wife and
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:15.280]   children and suffered great distress of mind.
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.280]   What is that?
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:18.320]   Does that say the druids picnic?
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:19.960]   Oh, well, we still do that.

[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:26.360]   of the Petaluma and Cypress Groves.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:31.600]   The dance hall was packed from morning into the last strains of music died away.
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:35.440]   The processions of the member of the order headed by the band and Marshall Collins left
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:40.120]   Grose Hall at 10.30 and marched to the park where they danced naked for hours.
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:43.480]   The most exciting, wait a minute, field sports.
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:47.840]   The most exciting of the racing was the Fat Man's Race.
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:50.480]   To which Frank Cornwall, E. Josie and E.D.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:53.280]   Bernardi competed.
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:57.160]   The Fat Man's Race, there's something for all of us.
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.160]   This is wonderful.
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:00.240]   Isn't that incredible?
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.240]   Wonderful.

[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:10.000]   furniture company that was in our building.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.920]   But only the ads have any sort of graphics or big text, right?
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.960]   The news is just wall of text.
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:19.960]   Well, but right.
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:23.880]   Wasn't this Jeff, tell us Mr. Professor of Journalism, the whole point of newspapers
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:24.880]   in the, yes.
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:28.280]   It was just they put the content in there as a something to separate the ads.
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:29.280]   Right.
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:32.280]   Originally, it was shipping notices and that kind of stuff.
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:33.280]   Right.
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:35.240]   He's the best good enough for you.
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.480]   I don't know.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:38.800]   Wow.
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:45.280]   If so, you cannot do better than a call on us when in need of groceries.
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:46.280]   Aww.
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:50.280]   Advertising's come a long way.
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:53.520]   A long way.

[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.040]   Like this was community.
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:14.720]   You can patent anything you can invent.
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:15.720]   It says wait a minute.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:16.720]   No, it disappeared.

[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:20.720]   Oh, you did the ad for patents.
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:24.240]   Also get caveat trademark and copywriter design protection.
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:29.920]   God, if I'd been back then and I invented podcasting, I could be rich today.
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.960]   Fire alarm boxes.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.400]   This was a great squirrel for us.
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:36.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:38.000]   We really did get sucked into this.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   Continue.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   I knew this would be Leo.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.160]   If you, do you want to be up to date?
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:48.560]   If you do put in a home telephone, no party lines with eavesdroppers to annoy you.
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:51.000]   Only a dollar a month for residences.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:56.680]   Call it our office and give your order for a phone from the home telephone company.
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:57.680]   Wow.
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:58.680]   Wow.
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:09:59.680]   Wow.
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:02.680]   This is 1899.
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:07.440]   They had phones back then.
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.440]   It's chicken news.
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:13.600]   Oh, I'm sure, but I'll save that for another day because there's still more in the changelock.
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.440]   That was just item two.
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.960]   This is going to be a long show.
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:19.960]   Continue.
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:20.960]   One more.
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:21.960]   One more.
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:22.960]   One last item.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:27.480]   The Google Wallet Android app is adding a new feature for orders.
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:33.160]   This tracks your online purchases using your receipts from Gmail much the way the Google
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:34.880]   now does.
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.840]   So I haven't actually got this now yet.
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:41.360]   This is rolling out to the Wallet app, but there'll be an orders section in the Google
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:46.120]   Wallet app and it'll send you a push notification when an order has been shipped.
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:50.880]   If you're waiting for something from Amazon or Zappos or wherever.
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.920]   You do have to update it inside the Wallet app.
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:59.320]   I think that you have to turn it on when you get the update.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:00.320]   But handy feature.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:06.640]   A little redundant because I do see that in Google now and you will too.
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:07.640]   But nice.
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:11.600]   Nice to see that Google is trying to make wallet your place where you buy stuff and place
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:16.360]   where to know whether or not the stuff that you bought is on its way.
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.080]   That's all I got.
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:20.560]   That's the Google change law.
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:23.000]   A lot of change between here in '89.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   No kidding.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   No kidding.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   Suits.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   Suits from $7 and up pants $2.50.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000]   Vests $3.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   Serviceable suits.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000]   Serviceable.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.600]   Here's the guy I want to go see to the unfortunate from a Dr. Gibbon.
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:42.280]   This old reliable and most successful specialist at San Francisco still continues to cure all
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:45.680]   sexual and seminal diseases.
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:48.720]   Gone area something I can't read.
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:51.240]   Strictures syphilis in all its forms.
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.240]   Is that a bad word?
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:53.240]   Loss of manhood.
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:54.880]   No, I just can't read it.
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:55.880]   Bleat.
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:56.880]   Bleat.
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:57.880]   I don't know what that is.
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:05.560]   The consequence of self abuse and excesses producing the following symptoms.
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:06.560]   Sallow countenance.
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.360]   Dark spots under the eyes.
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:09.840]   Pain in the head.
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:11.120]   Ringing in the ears.
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:12.120]   Loss of confidence.
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:14.200]   Diffidence in approaching strangers.
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:17.040]   Palpitations of the heart's weakness of the limbs and back.
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.040]   Loss of memory.
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:19.040]   Pimples on the face.
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:20.040]   Coughs.
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.040]   Consumptions, etc.
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:22.040]   Bleat.
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:23.040]   You'll be glad to know.
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:29.080]   Is a watery discharge from the euretha caused by gonorrheal in that?
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.080]   Oh, it's the clap.
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.080]   [laughter]
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:35.760]   I don't know.
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:36.960]   Would you go to this guy though?
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:38.520]   He looks scary.
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:44.120]   So he basically blamed everything from pimples to headaches on self abuse.
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:48.560]   Loss of, yeah, the consequence of self abuse.
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:51.560]   Persons cured at home.
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:54.480]   From that to the internet, folks.
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:58.760]   But thank goodness the internet exists because we can see this.
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:01.120]   This is amazing.
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:06.520]   So these are just all really obscure little newspapers that somehow Google.
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:09.080]   Some of these have, say, library on them.
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:12.200]   These are scans from, or maybe it is microfiche.
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:13.640]   It might be microfiche.
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:16.080]   Maybe they bought some database somewhere.
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:18.960]   Wow, that's wild.
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:19.960]   All right.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:20.960]   Squirrel.
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:21.960]   Squirrel.
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:24.480]   Big squirrel on that one.
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:29.160]   Thank you, Jeff, Gina.
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:30.160]   What should we do here?
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:31.160]   Take a break.
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:32.160]   Come back with more.
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:33.160]   We've got more news.
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:34.160]   That was so exhausted.
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:35.160]   We've got to have a break.
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:36.160]   I am drained.
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:39.160]   Maybe I should see that Dr. Gibbon.
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:45.160]   How much information will you?
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:50.680]   I think Saucid, Dr. Gibbon, I got circles under my eyes.
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:53.120]   Our show today brought to you by Shutterstock.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:56.640]   They could have used some good stock images in those newspapers.
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:00.080]   Don't you think if they only had Shutterstock back then they could have brought
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:04.120]   them vividly to life?
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:09.200]   With over 30 million stock images, vectors and footages, just no lack of great stuff.
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:12.840]   Great apps for Android and iOS, Webby award-winning apps.
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:19.840]   Currently, 34,671,266 royalty-free stock images at Shutterstock.com.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:25.880]   And a quarter of a million were added this week, which is pretty amazing.
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:26.960]   They're all gorgeous, too.
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:31.320]   They're all curated images for everything you need, including editorial.
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:34.160]   You need Angelina Jolie for your blog post.
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:35.880]   There you go.
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:37.360]   There you go.
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:40.320]   They've got all kinds of images.
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:41.640]   And all you have to do is search.
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:43.360]   You can search as with most search.
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:46.040]   By the way, this is the thing that makes Shutterstock unique.
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:50.120]   Not only as many images it has, but the best search engine so you can very quickly find
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:51.220]   what you want.
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:15:00.180]   Not only search by nouns, but also adjectives.
[01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:03.100]   It really is the best search tool ever.
[01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:07.740]   And then as you're browsing through images, you'll also be able to share those images
[01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:11.980]   with colleagues and clients by creating a free account.
[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:13.500]   This doesn't, you don't have to give them a credit card.
[01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:14.500]   It's absolutely free.
[01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:16.860]   The account gives you a couple of nice benefits.
[01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:18.660]   You get free images.
[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:24.140]   Each week they feature a free photo on free vector image for you free for the taking,
[01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:25.980]   no watermark or anything.
[01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:30.700]   You'll also be able to use light boxes to save images, to share them with friends or
[01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:33.020]   colleagues.
[01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:35.900]   Once you've gotten the account, if you see an image you want to buy and invite you to
[01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:42.540]   use our offer code Twig 314, and you'll get 20% off any package.
[01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:44.820]   Look at all this great stuff.
[01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:50.300]   We should search for glepth.
[01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:52.300]   No, maybe be better.
[01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:53.300]   Shutters.
[01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:59.060]   But maybe, you know, if I get a good image of a doctor, we could use for doctor.
[01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:03.100]   You see, wouldn't you rather go to that doctor than Dr. Gibbon?
[01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:05.140]   That was a scary picture of him.
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:06.140]   It was.
[01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:09.420]   Scary guy looked like Rasputin, the mad bunk.
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:12.180]   Don't forget when you go to Shutterstock, click the footage tab because there's great
[01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:13.340]   video too.
[01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:14.740]   I love it.
[01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:17.140]   Shutterstock.com.
[01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:18.620]   We thank them for their support.
[01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:23.260]   And when you decide to buy, save a lot by using the offer code Twig 314.
[01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:24.260]   There you go.
[01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:25.260]   Are those from Shutterstock?
[01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:31.860]   Those are video images of the Facebook like, thumbs down and something.
[01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:33.820]   And a hand gesture.
[01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:36.660]   Yeah, hand gesture.
[01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:38.660]   And gesture.
[01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:41.900]   Facebook by the way, said a new all time high this morning.
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:44.900]   $22 a share.
[01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:48.940]   Boy, they got to spend $16 billion on apps more often.
[01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:49.940]   Yeah.
[01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:53.500]   So how much equity do they gain back?
[01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:56.300]   Well, I bet you they gain almost all of it back.
[01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:58.100]   That's the thing.
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:03.500]   When you're paying and funny money, it doesn't really cost you anything.
[01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.260]   Wow.
[01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:07.020]   Facebook was as well.
[01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:09.740]   Well, let's go look because I can just do this in Google.
[01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:11.660]   FB00K, right?
[01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:12.660]   And then Google Finance.
[01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:14.540]   FB, is that what it is?
[01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:15.540]   FB.
[01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:16.700]   FB.
[01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:21.860]   And then Facebook and then Google Finance will give me the stock summary.
[01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:24.780]   Market cap of $180 billion.
[01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:28.100]   Chimney, Nimney, Grimney, Bimney.
[01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:33.340]   Their low was $17.
[01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:37.060]   And now they've gone down from the $72 high this morning.
[01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:39.020]   They're now down to almost $70.
[01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:45.060]   But a month ago, they were at $67.
[01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:46.060]   That's pretty amazing.
[01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:48.660]   I don't know how to calculate the difference in the price.
[01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:50.500]   And look how it jumped in February.
[01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:55.700]   I mean, I think when they announced WhatsApp, it's been going up ever since.
[01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:57.900]   So the market believes it.
[01:17:57.900 --> 01:18:02.060]   I think that February jump is when their quarterly results came out and it showed that they
[01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:04.220]   were doing very well indeed in mobile.
[01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:05.980]   Because that was the big question mark, wasn't it?
[01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:06.980]   That was a huge thing.
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:07.980]   And mobile was no way.
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:08.980]   I mean, it was brilliant.
[01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:09.980]   But mobile was nowhere for them.
[01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:10.980]   And now it's huge for them.
[01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:11.980]   Yeah.
[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:12.980]   Yeah.
[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:18.980]   And I think you made the most important point, which is that of the $16 billion they paid
[01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:22.100]   for, WhatsApp 12 was stock.
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:27.820]   And so that's, you know, as the stock goes up, I don't think that means they put more
[01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:28.820]   money into it.
[01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:29.820]   Maybe it does.
[01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:30.820]   I don't know.
[01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:32.980]   Well, indeed, you wonder, I don't know when the deal closes and all that.
[01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:36.420]   Because maybe they just had a certain number of shares and that was valued at 12 at the
[01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:37.420]   time.
[01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:38.500]   But they still end up with more.
[01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:39.500]   We don't talk.
[01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:40.500]   All right.
[01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:42.900]   No, we don't know.
[01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:50.420]   Samsung, one in court, Apple was asking that 35 Android devices from Samsung be blocked
[01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:51.740]   at the border.
[01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:54.780]   Judge Lucy coz it now.
[01:18:54.780 --> 01:19:05.540]   No, but the the Galaxy S5 could still be in trouble because there is a ban right now
[01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:10.420]   in South Korea that keeps carriers from adding new customers or allowing their customers
[01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:15.180]   to upgrade phones because there were reports they were subsidizing.
[01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:16.180]   45 day ban.
[01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:18.180]   It's ordered $50.
[01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:19.180]   Wow.
[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:23.340]   It wasn't specifically Samsung, but like carriers.
[01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:25.100]   Nobody could take a new account.
[01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:26.100]   Yeah.
[01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:27.100]   It's wacky.
[01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:30.060]   The carriers were illegally subsidizing smartphones.
[01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:36.540]   The law in South Korea is that only $250 can be subsidized and they were they were apparently
[01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:42.020]   giving I mean, gosh, when you get an iPhone or a Galaxy S4 in the US, you're talking
[01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:45.420]   a four or $500 subsidy in some cases, right?
[01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:50.580]   Because they've given you 200 bucks.
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:59.660]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:00.660]   Twitter is testing.
[01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:04.020]   By the way, speaking of tests, the Google big giant ad at the top of the search engines,
[01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:05.020]   that's not going to happen.
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:06.500]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:07.820]   It didn't work, I guess.
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:13.300]   Anyway, they've decided not to do it, but Twitter is testing a click to call button,
[01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:18.620]   which allows mobile users to call advertisers directly.
[01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:25.420]   So if you're looking at a tweet or that's an ad, you could press a button and you would
[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:27.540]   do your, would you ever do that?
[01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:30.660]   You know, we've had, we've had that on web pages for ages and ages and ages.
[01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:31.660]   I don't know.
[01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:32.660]   I don't think it works.
[01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:34.580]   Really, we're going to do that.
[01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:37.580]   But remember, this is now on your phone, right?
[01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:38.580]   That's a point.
[01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:39.580]   That's a good point.
[01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:40.580]   Yeah.
[01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:43.500]   So you are holding a phone in your hand.
[01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:44.500]   Yeah.
[01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:45.500]   Yeah.
[01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:46.500]   Yeah.
[01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:47.500]   Yeah.
[01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:48.500]   Good point.
[01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:54.060]   I mean, really, like I, it's just not, yeah, it's not the action.
[01:20:54.060 --> 01:21:02.700]   A New York woman whose child spent $65.95 on digital crystals has sued Google on behalf
[01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:08.820]   of all parents everywhere, claiming the Google Play Store is full of games and apps that lure
[01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:11.260]   children into spending money.
[01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:17.860]   The lawsuit was filed in San Francisco on Friday, her five year old son spent the money while
[01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:22.860]   playing Marvel run jumps smash on a galaxy tablet.
[01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:27.980]   It accuses Google of unjust enrichment.
[01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:29.180]   Apple lost a case like that.
[01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:31.900]   I actually had to pay quite a bit to parents.
[01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:37.060]   I got a little $5 gift card for this.
[01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:38.700]   But apparently the problem is,
[01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:40.700]   it was like $65 million.
[01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:43.300]   Yeah, it was a big deal.
[01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:48.740]   They've just paid a $32.5 million fine this earlier this year to the FTC.
[01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:53.020]   So Apple, the way it works is once your password's edited, it even says this is a warning on
[01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:54.020]   the screen now.
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:57.140]   They just started doing this for 15 minutes.
[01:21:57.140 --> 01:21:58.340]   You don't have to enter your password.
[01:21:58.340 --> 01:22:07.140]   So in Google, there's a 30 minute window following the initial purchase.
[01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:10.940]   And in which you can offer stuff for sale without asking for a password.
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:15.740]   So I guess the trick kids use and a five year old isn't too young to do this.
[01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:17.740]   It's mommy, mommy, mommy.
[01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:19.300]   And you don't need to do it.
[01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:20.340]   I'm not this.
[01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:22.940]   She unlocks it and then they buy stuff for half an hour.
[01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:27.420]   Yeah, like she bought the app handed to your kid and then he didn't purchase.
[01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:30.700]   But you know, Android, we talked about this quite a bit on all about Android last night.
[01:22:30.700 --> 01:22:36.020]   Android offers restricted profiles, which can restrict in app purchases.
[01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:37.780]   And I thought that there was a choice.
[01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:39.700]   I just didn't know in that purchase yesterday.
[01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:42.380]   And I thought there was a choice that said, you know, don't ask me for my password ever
[01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:45.020]   again, which was, which was unchecked.
[01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:48.260]   So there's ways to change this.
[01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:53.460]   It just seems like if, you know, in court, how is Google going to defend itself?
[01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:57.060]   I think the Google has a strong case to say, look, we've, you know, we provided restricted
[01:22:57.060 --> 01:22:58.060]   profiles.
[01:22:58.060 --> 01:22:59.740]   We have some parental, you know, parental controls.
[01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:03.580]   We have a setting to disable this.
[01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:08.300]   So, you know, we have made an effort to prevent this from happening.
[01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:10.940]   Next time you see Kevin Tolf will give him a hard time.
[01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:17.940]   His kids spent $375 on digital fish.
[01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:19.940]   Oh man.
[01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:22.540]   Kevin should know better.
[01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:28.460]   Anyway, and the responsibility is we were talking about this last night on the show.
[01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:33.420]   You'll really kind of spread across parents, the developers, the apps and Google, you know,
[01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:34.420]   the platform, right?
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:35.420]   Yeah.
[01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:40.580]   But Apple also something about, you know, selling digital fish is ethically challenging.
[01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:41.580]   Well, yeah.
[01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:42.700]   So yeah, ready for this.
[01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:45.860]   Because now we know this is how you, how you, if you want to make money in apps, you
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:47.180]   do in app purchases.
[01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:48.180]   That's it.
[01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:49.180]   Period.
[01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:50.180]   It's a schmuck tax.
[01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:51.180]   Right.
[01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:52.180]   Just like the lottery.
[01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:53.180]   It's a schmuck tax.
[01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:54.180]   Yeah.
[01:23:54.180 --> 01:23:55.180]   There's a lot of them.
[01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:56.180]   Yep.
[01:23:56.180 --> 01:24:03.860]   Under Marissa Meyer, 31 of Yahoo's 38 acquisitions of startups have been shuttered.
[01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:07.140]   Well, I didn't see that story because they didn't look hard enough.
[01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:08.140]   That's my fault.
[01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:10.020]   But are those ones, those aren't ones that she bought.
[01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:11.980]   Those are ones that were bought or right.
[01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:15.100]   So well, prior mistakes.
[01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:19.740]   And it doesn't mean that they're, this is an article that read right web.
[01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:20.740]   Yahoo.
[01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:23.060]   Destroyer of startups.
[01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:28.660]   So we don't, it, you know, Facebook does the same thing too because they're often acquires
[01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:31.060]   where they're not, they don't buy the product.
[01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:32.460]   They're buying the team.
[01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:33.460]   Right.
[01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:34.460]   Right.
[01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:35.460]   And this is about talent.
[01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:36.460]   Right.
[01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:41.340]   And the first two months of 2014, Marissa Meyer acquired eight companies, including AV8.
[01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:43.180]   Remember that?
[01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:49.900]   Incredible Labs, makers of the digital mobile assistant, Donna Spark, a mobile marketing
[01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:53.900]   company in Tom Foolery, an enterprise application studio.
[01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:56.020]   All of which I guess have disappeared.
[01:24:56.020 --> 01:24:57.500]   I don't use AV8.
[01:24:57.500 --> 01:24:59.340]   Is it still around?
[01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:05.400]   31 of the 38 acquired startups have, have been shut down.
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:10.820]   If you use Visify, here comes Sunset.
[01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:14.780]   Donna ceased to exist one month after acquire.
[01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:19.100]   Spark, some of Spark's services are gone.
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:24.780]   Normally, you see some, that was the kid, the teenager who sold his company, the Yahoo.
[01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:27.700]   That's now in the Yahoo News app, which is great.
[01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:31.620]   Yahoo News Digest.
[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:34.940]   I think these are, I think this is not unusual, frankly.
[01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:37.860]   I think it's fair to call her a destroyer of startups.
[01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:39.580]   I think it is unfair.
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:41.220]   A monetizer.
[01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:46.300]   And she, and she always liked, I think it was Steven Levy's book about, or article about
[01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:49.660]   her about her, that manager program that she was ahead of at Google.
[01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:56.900]   And there was a point at which he asked about the Googlers that she was training to be in
[01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:57.900]   management.
[01:25:57.900 --> 01:26:01.900]   So many of them often wanted to go off and be entrepreneurs and start their own companies.
[01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:04.900]   And her response to that was, yeah, those are the people that we want.
[01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:08.060]   We want people who want to be entrepreneurs and who are going to take charge and lead
[01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:11.260]   and innovate in a way that, who have that kind of desire.
[01:26:11.260 --> 01:26:15.660]   So it makes a lot of sense that she would want to acquire startups that not only had
[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:18.980]   innovative technology, but also had leaders within them that might help change the culture
[01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:21.140]   inside of Yahoo.
[01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:27.380]   Instagram, big update today on Android.
[01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:34.620]   It launches faster, doubles the speed of profile loading, and a redesigned camera.
[01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:40.780]   I thought it looked a little weird, but I, I, yeah, I'm watching it right now.
[01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:42.780]   Yeah.
[01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:44.260]   Yeah.
[01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:49.460]   So I know Instagram 5.1 doesn't, it doesn't, it's all flat.
[01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:50.460]   Yeah.
[01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:54.620]   It's new, the new flat Instagram.
[01:26:54.620 --> 01:26:59.300]   And according to this article at the Verge, this is all about global.
[01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:04.460]   I don't know why it would be, but apparently they're going after Brazil and other countries
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:09.940]   that are showing some real smartphone growth.
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:14.300]   You set up global expansion, oh, because it looks better on low, low resolution.
[01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:15.300]   Low resolution.
[01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:17.220]   Red funds, cheaper Android funds.
[01:27:17.220 --> 01:27:22.100]   That's the illustration of a cheap Android phone.
[01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:24.860]   I get it.
[01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:26.700]   Uh huh.
[01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:28.700]   Uh huh.
[01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:31.940]   That's an Instagram is a Facebook company.
[01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:32.940]   Mm.
[01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:38.060]   But apparently there is a critical flaw in WhatsApp, another Instagram, another Facebook
[01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:46.340]   company that for Android, but we'll be, you know, big deal.
[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:50.860]   Facebook campus was locked down last night due to an unsubstantiated threat.
[01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:52.340]   Don't do that, kids.
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:54.340]   That's not nice.
[01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:55.340]   Hmm.
[01:27:55.340 --> 01:28:00.180]   It was a bomb threat.
[01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:01.180]   Yeah.
[01:28:01.180 --> 01:28:02.180]   It sucks.
[01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:03.180]   Yeah, it's terrible.
[01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:07.300]   I was, I was very impressed with the campus because you drive around it just looks like,
[01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:12.540]   as I mentioned, when we were, we were there, just some, you know, boring, son office buildings,
[01:28:12.540 --> 01:28:15.820]   but in the side, it's Disneyland, right?
[01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:18.260]   And but you can't get in there unless you go through one of the buildings.
[01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:19.260]   Right.
[01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:20.260]   Interesting.
[01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:24.900]   As opposed to Google where you can wander around the campus and go get them at Facebook,
[01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:27.100]   you can only enter Disneyland.
[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:28.100]   That's good.
[01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:29.100]   Through there.
[01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:30.100]   It is.
[01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:31.100]   Yeah.
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:32.860]   That's a good idea.
[01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:38.540]   The BBC has released its 30th anniversary edition of the hitchhiker hitchhiker's guide to the
[01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:40.700]   galaxy text adventure.
[01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:42.780]   Oh, geeky.
[01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:43.780]   Can you get it?
[01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:48.620]   It's the info com text adventure being re-released.
[01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:49.620]   That's cool.
[01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:53.580]   Apparently, they commissioned a remake of it 10 years ago.
[01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:57.060]   And this is a reworking of the original game.
[01:28:57.060 --> 01:28:59.660]   So there's a, let's see where we can find this.
[01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:03.100]   I want to get it now.
[01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:04.660]   Probably have to be in Britain.
[01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:07.780]   Oh, that would be really terrible.
[01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:12.900]   There's a walk through the, you know, you can get these info com games.
[01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:16.540]   There are a number of players that will play the text.
[01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:17.540]   Here you go.
[01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:18.900]   And here's all the games.
[01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:20.500]   These were great games.
[01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:22.500]   Very difficult.
[01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:23.500]   Yeah.
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:25.740]   Look at that.
[01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:29.600]   Zork one, two, three and Chander, sea stalker, sorcerer, spellbreaker, wish-bringer,
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:31.300]   star criss suspended planet far.
[01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:32.660]   I played almost all of these.
[01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:33.660]   Don't laugh.
[01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:37.260]   Reminding me, reminding me of wasted time in my, you know, I wish I wasted a little
[01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:39.460]   bit better than that.
[01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:40.460]   Yeah.
[01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:41.460]   Yeah.
[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:46.100]   Apparently somebody just eBay'd the new, the new H2C one.
[01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:50.820]   Yeah, I saw that $500 on eBay, Verizon packaging.
[01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:51.820]   Yeah.
[01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:52.820]   That's a good deal.
[01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:54.660]   That is a good deal.
[01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:55.660]   Yeah.
[01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:56.860]   Oh, here it is.
[01:29:56.860 --> 01:29:57.860]   Okay.
[01:29:57.860 --> 01:30:02.400]   This is, I guess it's in flash and you can play it.
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:03.400]   There we go.
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:04.400]   Oh, look, it's even.
[01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:05.400]   Okay.
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:06.400]   The hiccup here.
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:07.400]   Okay.
[01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:08.400]   You wake up the room is spent.
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:09.400]   Okay.
[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:10.400]   Well, let's play the little bit of this.
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:11.400]   We wasted enough time.
[01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:12.400]   Oh, no.
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:15.200]   You wake up the woman's room is spinning very gently around your head or at least it would
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:16.560]   be if you could see what you can't.
[01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:17.560]   It is pitch black.
[01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:19.440]   What do you want to do, Gina?
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:22.920]   Uh, hmm.
[01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:23.920]   Turn on light.
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:24.920]   How about that?
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:25.920]   Turn on light.
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:26.920]   There you go.
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:27.920]   Good day.
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:28.920]   Good start to the day.
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:29.920]   Pity.
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:30.920]   It's going to be the worst one of your life.
[01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:35.100]   The light is now on in your in the bedroom in the bed.
[01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:36.100]   The bedroom is a mess.
[01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:38.380]   It is a small bedroom with a faded carpet and old wallpaper.
[01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:43.980]   There's a wash patient, a chair with tatty dressing gowns slung over it.
[01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:45.740]   Let's put on the gown.
[01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:46.740]   42.
[01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:49.180]   Somebody just whispered to me.
[01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:50.580]   You're not holding out.
[01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:51.580]   Take gown.
[01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:54.340]   You can't reach it.
[01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:56.420]   Get out of bed.
[01:30:56.420 --> 01:31:00.660]   Very difficult, but you manage it.
[01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:01.660]   The room is still spinning.
[01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:04.320]   It dips and sways a little bit.
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:07.020]   Take gown.
[01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:08.020]   Got the gown.
[01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:09.560]   Luckily this is large enough for you to get a hold of.
[01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:11.760]   You notice something in the pocket.
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:13.760]   Examine pocket.
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:15.260]   Okay.
[01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:18.860]   Open pocket.
[01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:19.860]   You get the idea here.
[01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:23.120]   What I like is there's some little, it's a little bit more graphic.
[01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:24.500]   It's hard to open or close the pocket.
[01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:27.100]   You put on gown.
[01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:28.100]   Okay.
[01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:29.540]   You're now wearing your gown.
[01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:32.260]   Open pocket.
[01:31:32.260 --> 01:31:33.260]   Opening your gown.
[01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:37.460]   The thing reveals a thing your aunt gave you, which you don't know what it is, a buffered
[01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:39.700]   analgesic and pocket fluff.
[01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:45.940]   Take anal gesic.
[01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:47.660]   You swallow the tablet.
[01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:51.740]   After a few seconds, the room begins to calm down and behave in an orderly manner.
[01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:54.820]   Your terrible headache goes.
[01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:59.060]   And from there, the end of the world, you continue on.
[01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:00.060]   This is good.
[01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:01.060]   This is fun.
[01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:02.060]   Cool.
[01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:03.060]   Yeah.
[01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:04.060]   It is fun.
[01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:07.820]   It all came rushing back to me 30 years ago.
[01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:14.780]   See, the Hitchhiker's Guide is actually older than the World Wide Web.
[01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:17.820]   New York Bands, Tesla Direct Sales.
[01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:19.980]   You can't buy a Tesla in Texas either.
[01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:23.580]   In New York, New Jersey, New Jersey, New Jersey.
[01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:27.460]   My corrupt ridiculous state, the governor hates drivers.
[01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:30.140]   He closes bridge tolls and he does this.
[01:32:30.140 --> 01:32:32.300]   We don't like car salesman people.
[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:33.500]   You know what the deal is?
[01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:40.620]   And it's the auto dealers associations that raise a lot of money for state legislators.
[01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:43.380]   This is pure corruption.
[01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:49.900]   So in Arizona and Texas and New Jersey, you cannot go to Tesla.com and buy a Tesla.
[01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:55.940]   The Short Hills Mall, the Ritzy Mall in Northern New Jersey has a Tesla showroom and two Teslas
[01:32:55.940 --> 01:32:57.260]   in it and all kinds of neat stuff.
[01:32:57.260 --> 01:33:00.900]   And you can buy Tesla shirts and all that.
[01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:03.500]   And I can stand there and dream.
[01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:04.500]   And it's closed.
[01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:05.500]   They're closing it.
[01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:06.500]   Gone.
[01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:07.500]   It's ridiculous.
[01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:11.740]   The whole system of franchised car dealers is ridiculously inefficient.
[01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:14.940]   No, nobody wants to buy cars that way.
[01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:16.540]   No one, we hate it.
[01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:18.060]   We hate it.
[01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:22.100]   On the Tesla blog, they read, unfortunately, Monday, we received news that governor Christie's
[01:33:22.100 --> 01:33:25.420]   administration had gone back on its word.
[01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:29.860]   Corrupt Christie, another example of corrupt Christie.
[01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:30.860]   Yeah.
[01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:31.860]   Wow.
[01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:35.780]   I just, I just, it just makes me, it embarrasses me from my state.
[01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:41.100]   Backward corrupt anti-consumer, the FU governor.
[01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:42.100]   Nice.
[01:33:42.100 --> 01:33:47.100]   And next he's going to say, and Teslas can't go over the George Washington Bridge.
[01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:48.540]   This is the man who wants to be president.
[01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:52.140]   It's just not safe.
[01:33:52.140 --> 01:33:56.620]   Do you have a link to that eBay sale of the HTC one?
[01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:57.620]   Yes.
[01:33:57.620 --> 01:33:59.420]   Chatroom, give it to me.
[01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:02.940]   At the verge, it's right below the Tesla story.
[01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:03.940]   Okay.
[01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:08.060]   Because I want to see what that thing looks like.
[01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:09.060]   Hit return or so.
[01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:10.060]   There it is.
[01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:11.060]   Is that it?
[01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:12.060]   No.
[01:34:12.060 --> 01:34:14.460]   Yeah, that's the Engadget piece and that's the direct eBay link is right below it.
[01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:15.460]   All right.
[01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:16.460]   Let's see here.
[01:34:16.460 --> 01:34:18.860]   Because you have an HTC one.
[01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:20.940]   So this is the new one.
[01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:22.180]   The all new one.
[01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:23.940]   The all new one or the one two.
[01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:24.940]   The second one.
[01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:25.940]   Yeah.
[01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:27.820]   I see it right there.
[01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:29.180]   From droid life and here's the eep.
[01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:30.860]   Oh, look, there's a lot of them.
[01:34:30.860 --> 01:34:31.860]   Well, yeah.
[01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:34.580]   So it got that by now, if you scroll down, you'll see the original listing it got, because
[01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:35.580]   it got, it got purchased.
[01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:38.700]   It is the one we have been waiting for.
[01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:39.860]   Only got five bids.
[01:34:39.860 --> 01:34:43.540]   Now I think it could very well be bogus.
[01:34:43.540 --> 01:34:45.820]   It's not like eBay's always perfect, is it?
[01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:46.820]   Does right.
[01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:47.820]   Right.
[01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:49.740]   It was the, the foreign guy was the buy at now price.
[01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:51.260]   I would have done that.
[01:34:51.260 --> 01:34:52.260]   Yeah.
[01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:53.260]   Just to see.
[01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:54.260]   Yeah.
[01:34:54.260 --> 01:34:55.740]   Oh, well, didn't see it sooner.
[01:34:55.740 --> 01:34:56.740]   It's pretty cool.
[01:34:56.740 --> 01:34:58.660]   I love the one and the new one looks pretty cool.
[01:34:58.660 --> 01:35:01.460]   The dual cameras also has, it has my interest at this point.
[01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:02.820]   Dual cameras on the back?
[01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:03.820]   Yeah.
[01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:04.820]   Dual cameras on the back.
[01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:05.820]   Hmm.
[01:35:05.820 --> 01:35:06.820]   Why?
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:10.180]   Kind of like, like the LITRO camera so that you can do, you know, depth of field editing
[01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:11.180]   and choosing.
[01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:12.180]   Yeah.
[01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:13.180]   Yeah, better editing.
[01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:14.180]   Mm hmm.
[01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:16.060]   It's a good deal if that's real.
[01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:17.220]   Uh, purportedly.
[01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:18.220]   Yeah, allegedly.
[01:35:18.220 --> 01:35:19.300]   Could be just the box.
[01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:21.220]   You don't actually see the phone anywhere.
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:22.220]   Right.
[01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:24.900]   I'm always nervous about that kind of stuff.
[01:35:24.900 --> 01:35:30.380]   It was that the dual cameras though, there was a Telestra brochure was leaked and it's
[01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:31.380]   pretty, pretty for sure.
[01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:32.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:32.380 --> 01:35:34.300]   But again, in that listing, they only showed a box.
[01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:35.300]   Right.
[01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:36.300]   Right.
[01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:37.780]   You might have just bought a very expensive box.
[01:35:37.780 --> 01:35:38.780]   Expensive box.
[01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:39.780]   Yes.
[01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:40.780]   Right.
[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:41.780]   Or a picture of a box.
[01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:42.780]   Or a picture of a box.
[01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:43.780]   Right.
[01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:46.100]   It's like those people who thought they bought iPads.
[01:35:46.100 --> 01:35:49.580]   Instead, they got boxes with apples inside actual apples.
[01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:51.580]   These things happen.
[01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:52.580]   All right.
[01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:53.580]   We're going to take-
[01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:54.580]   This seller has pretty good feedback.
[01:35:54.580 --> 01:35:55.580]   Yeah.
[01:35:55.580 --> 01:35:57.220]   Well, you know, is that how you do that on eBay?
[01:35:57.220 --> 01:35:58.220]   You check the seller.
[01:35:58.220 --> 01:35:59.220]   Yeah.
[01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:00.220]   See the feedback.
[01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:01.220]   Is it 100%?
[01:36:01.220 --> 01:36:02.220]   Yeah, 100% positive.
[01:36:02.220 --> 01:36:04.820]   Well, that's pretty good.
[01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:05.820]   How many?
[01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:06.820]   Yeah, how many?
[01:36:06.820 --> 01:36:07.820]   55.
[01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:08.820]   That's enough.
[01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:09.820]   That's enough.
[01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:11.820]   That's enough.
[01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:13.220]   5500% positive.
[01:36:13.220 --> 01:36:16.620]   I think you can assume this person knows what they're doing.
[01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:17.620]   Hmm.
[01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:19.260]   Yeah, it makes it one.
[01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:20.260]   I mean, this is probably-
[01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:21.260]   But where did they get it?
[01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:22.260]   Where did they get it?
[01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:25.020]   You know, that they're willing to sell it and not get it.
[01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:32.060]   32 gigabyte, which, so 500 bucks for the 32 gigabyte brand new one from Verizon Wireless.
[01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:41.700]   When you probably be able to get it for two or two 50 subsidized eBay money, I don't
[01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:42.700]   know.
[01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:43.700]   That's interesting.
[01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:49.340]   I don't know how we got that.
[01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:50.820]   Huh?
[01:36:50.820 --> 01:36:51.820]   Hmm.
[01:36:51.820 --> 01:36:59.180]   A brand new unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging.
[01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:04.860]   We're going to take a break, come back with our tool, our tip, and our number of the week.
[01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:06.620]   But first, a word from personal capital.
[01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:08.420]   This is, I got a tip for you.
[01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:12.980]   If you are not yet planning for your old age, you better get going.
[01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:15.100]   I don't care if you're 21 years old.
[01:37:15.100 --> 01:37:18.580]   It's really important to start taking a look at what you've got.
[01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:21.100]   Conserving capital, building your investments.
[01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:22.740]   Problem is, it's tough.
[01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:23.740]   It's tough.
[01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:25.820]   You've got lots of stuff to keep track of.
[01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:26.820]   Your stocks.
[01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:28.020]   Maybe you have a 401k at work.
[01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:32.940]   Your bank accounts, your credit cards, your loans, your mortgage.
[01:37:32.940 --> 01:37:36.260]   They're all on different sites, different usernames and passwords.
[01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:41.300]   And then of course, and this is unfortunate, but a lot of times you're paying too much
[01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:42.980]   to get investment advice.
[01:37:42.980 --> 01:37:47.660]   This is the next generation, the modern financial advisor.
[01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:50.340]   It's called personal capital.
[01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:55.460]   Within minutes, you'll have all your accounts in one place in a beautiful dashboard real
[01:37:55.460 --> 01:37:58.620]   time so you can see exactly where you are, how you stand.
[01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:01.900]   You can see if you're overpaying in fees and how to reduce those fees.
[01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:07.060]   They also give you advice that's tailored to your situation so that you can optimize
[01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:09.780]   your investments so that you can retire.
[01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:12.620]   Lots of people will never be able to retire.
[01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:20.220]   Don't expect the Social Security System to survive until you're 50 or 60 years old.
[01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:21.220]   Set it up right now.
[01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:28.020]   personal capital.com/twig takes just a minute to sign up and it's absolutely free.
[01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:29.100]   Absolutely free.
[01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:31.860]   Personal capital is smart way to grow your money.
[01:38:31.860 --> 01:38:35.180]   Personalcapital.com/twig.
[01:38:35.180 --> 01:38:39.420]   If you don't see the greetings, twid listeners, then you've gone to the wrong place.
[01:38:39.420 --> 01:38:41.660]   Personalcapital.com/twig.
[01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:51.180]   I guess, according to the Android police, receiving Google Maps version 7.7 for Android.
[01:38:51.180 --> 01:38:54.260]   I have to check and see if it's come out.
[01:38:54.260 --> 01:38:57.420]   It adds public upcoming events to place cards.
[01:38:57.420 --> 01:39:02.260]   Oh, in Maps, interesting.
[01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:06.020]   Yeah, so you'll have a place card and it'll have upcoming events.
[01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:08.420]   So if you look at a venue, I guess it'll show you what's...
[01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:13.100]   Hey, you can add the Twitch schedule to a Twitch page.
[01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:14.100]   Really?
[01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:15.100]   It's awesome.
[01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:16.100]   Right?
[01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:17.100]   Good news?
[01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:18.100]   I guess.
[01:39:18.100 --> 01:39:20.180]   If we were smart enough to put it there.
[01:39:20.180 --> 01:39:22.980]   We'll have to work on that.
[01:39:22.980 --> 01:39:25.060]   Gina, what is your tip of the week?
[01:39:25.060 --> 01:39:31.540]   Tip of the week is for Android users who have KitKat who may have been experiencing some
[01:39:31.540 --> 01:39:35.620]   battery drain lately, losing battery.
[01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:40.340]   There's apparently a bug that Google's aware of where some apps that get a hold of your
[01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:45.380]   camera, apps like Skype, will run this game in the background and it'll just... it will
[01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:46.380]   kill your battery.
[01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:51.820]   There's a long bug report on it in the Android open source project and one of the Android
[01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:55.180]   open source contributors said Skype triggers this bug.
[01:39:55.180 --> 01:40:00.780]   So if you're seeing sudden and bad battery drain on your KitKat Android phone, uninstall
[01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:03.100]   Skype until the fix is on its way out.
[01:40:03.100 --> 01:40:04.420]   The fix is on its way out.
[01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:07.660]   Google's aware of it and they're working on it now.
[01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:11.900]   And I actually haven't seen this, but Jason, last night on Jason Howell on all of the Android,
[01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:14.580]   said that he was having that problem.
[01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:16.780]   So yeah, just something to keep in mind.
[01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:20.140]   And kind of funny to see someone in Android saying, "Hey, uninstall Skype.
[01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:21.140]   It's not just Skype.
[01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:26.500]   It's any app that accesses your camera in a certain way that actually runs the camera,
[01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:29.860]   this camera process in the background, even when you're not running the app, which Skype
[01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:30.860]   apparently does."
[01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:35.100]   It makes me feel like it's a Google bug.
[01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:36.940]   It does feel like an Android bug, right?
[01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:39.700]   It does feel like Android shouldn't let this happen.
[01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:40.700]   And it is, right?
[01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:43.580]   Google said that they know about this and they're issuing a fix.
[01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:47.860]   So it's a process called MMQ Camera Daemon.
[01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:49.460]   And that's what it is.
[01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:53.940]   So you can restart, you can kill that process, or you can try uninstalling Skype if that's
[01:40:53.940 --> 01:40:55.940]   an option for you.
[01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:56.940]   Okay.
[01:40:56.940 --> 01:40:58.420]   Save some battery.
[01:40:58.420 --> 01:40:59.420]   Good deal.
[01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:01.660]   Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.
[01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:02.660]   My number is three.
[01:41:02.660 --> 01:41:03.660]   Three.
[01:41:03.660 --> 01:41:04.660]   That's how many seasons.
[01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:07.740]   That's how many seasons Big Bang Theory just got renewed for.
[01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:08.740]   What?
[01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:10.900]   You can't renew a show for three seasons?
[01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:11.900]   They did.
[01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:12.900]   They did.
[01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:14.780]   I hope there's no shark on the horizon.
[01:41:14.780 --> 01:41:15.780]   I don't watch that show.
[01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:18.420]   I find it insulting.
[01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:19.820]   I love that show.
[01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:20.820]   I do too.
[01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:21.820]   I feel guilty about it.
[01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:23.220]   You should feel guilty.
[01:41:23.220 --> 01:41:24.220]   I should.
[01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:29.020]   Well, look, I feel better about it now that there are actually smart women on it.
[01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:32.620]   When it was in the beginning, it was just Penny being an airhead that used to bug me.
[01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:36.460]   But now that there's Amy and Bernadette, I feel good about it.
[01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:37.460]   Great.
[01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:42.340]   I know I'm going to lose my geek card, but I just feel like it's insulting to geeks.
[01:41:42.340 --> 01:41:44.500]   I think a lot of geeks feel the same way.
[01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:51.180]   I've gotten some very, some derisive stares when I mentioned I like Big Bang.
[01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:54.460]   You want to get some sense of how bad that show is?
[01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:55.460]   Oh, no.
[01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:56.460]   Uh-oh.
[01:41:56.460 --> 01:41:57.460]   Uh-oh.
[01:41:57.460 --> 01:41:58.820]   You're going to have a Jeff Leel fight here.
[01:41:58.820 --> 01:41:59.820]   You love this show, Jeff?
[01:41:59.820 --> 01:42:03.500]   I can't believe they've renewed it for three more seasons.
[01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:05.580]   It's block bust.
[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:07.740]   I mean, it's been so successful.
[01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:12.340]   So there are YouTube videos of Big Bang Theory without the laugh track.
[01:42:12.340 --> 01:42:13.340]   Aww.
[01:42:13.340 --> 01:42:17.580]   Because the laugh track makes you think this is funny.
[01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:24.340]   But when you watch it without a laugh track, you realize there are no actual jokes in the
[01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:25.340]   show.
[01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:26.980]   It is in front of a live audience, though.
[01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:28.660]   They do film in front of a live audience.
[01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:29.660]   Okay.
[01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:36.660]   Well, let's just see what it sounds like when there are no laughs.
[01:42:36.660 --> 01:42:41.220]   Nothing makes beer taste better than cool, clear Rocky Mountains spring water.
[01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:46.020]   We're not the Rocky Mountains anyway.
[01:42:46.020 --> 01:42:47.020]   Philadelphia.
[01:42:47.020 --> 01:42:50.500]   Holy, I thought there were no jokes.
[01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:51.500]   Think about it, Raj.
[01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:52.500]   Where did the movie rock?
[01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:54.020]   There are characters, Leel.
[01:42:54.020 --> 01:42:57.060]   There are beloved, lovable characters.
[01:42:57.060 --> 01:42:58.060]   Geeks are lovable.
[01:42:58.060 --> 01:43:01.140]   Okay, now I'll get it.
[01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:02.140]   This is really painful, wow.
[01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:06.540]   From now on, we're just going to hide out in here to avoid the shamey.
[01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:08.340]   I'm very comfortable here.
[01:43:08.340 --> 01:43:12.220]   Benidio, why don't you shoot another silver bullet my way?
[01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:14.220]   I want yourself.
[01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:16.780]   Ooh, somebody's been taking bimchi pills.
[01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:19.580]   Okay, I've had enough, have you?
[01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:22.580]   Terrible show, they should not renew it for even one more season.
[01:43:22.580 --> 01:43:23.580]   Oh my.
[01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:24.580]   Oh my.
[01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:25.580]   Oh geez.
[01:43:25.580 --> 01:43:30.380]   Oh geez, what is the chat room saying?
[01:43:30.380 --> 01:43:32.300]   Try playing Game of Thrones without the laugh track.
[01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:33.860]   Then see how you feel.
[01:43:33.860 --> 01:43:34.860]   All right.
[01:43:34.860 --> 01:43:36.780]   No, I don't know why.
[01:43:36.780 --> 01:43:40.140]   That show does not grab me.
[01:43:40.140 --> 01:43:42.540]   And I do feel like it's a little insulting to women.
[01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:43.540]   Maybe it's better now, but...
[01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:45.740]   Well, the better now.
[01:43:45.740 --> 01:43:46.740]   It's a sitcom.
[01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:47.740]   It's a sitcom.
[01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:48.740]   It is dumb.
[01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:52.100]   Well, I hate all sitcoms, right?
[01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:53.100]   That's fair.
[01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:54.100]   I'll accept that.
[01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:57.220]   I mean, although there are a few good ones like episodes on Showtime.
[01:43:57.220 --> 01:43:59.820]   Very funny, very good, very talented.
[01:43:59.820 --> 01:44:01.380]   Boy, people hate me now.
[01:44:01.380 --> 01:44:04.220]   You're full of it, Leo.
[01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:05.220]   You are so wrong.
[01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:08.300]   Yeah, the 30 Rock was great.
[01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:10.460]   I mean, you know, there are some great...
[01:44:10.460 --> 01:44:16.460]   Oh, they're at the door with their pitchforks and their torches.
[01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:20.580]   An army of nerds.
[01:44:20.580 --> 01:44:23.260]   But see, if you're a...
[01:44:23.260 --> 01:44:27.180]   To me, if you're a geek, you shouldn't like it because it's so insulting to geeks.
[01:44:27.180 --> 01:44:28.180]   Oh.
[01:44:28.180 --> 01:44:29.420]   That's so precious.
[01:44:29.420 --> 01:44:31.500]   That's just so, so.
[01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:36.500]   I do want to watch, there's going to be on HBO, a new show done by Mike Judge who did Beavis
[01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:39.820]   and Butthead in office space about Silicon Valley.
[01:44:39.820 --> 01:44:42.220]   And what I've seen so far looks pretty good.
[01:44:42.220 --> 01:44:45.460]   The Amazon Silicon Valley show went nowhere, right?
[01:44:45.460 --> 01:44:46.460]   What was it called?
[01:44:46.460 --> 01:44:47.460]   The...
[01:44:47.460 --> 01:44:49.420]   Yeah, I can't remember the name of that.
[01:44:49.420 --> 01:44:53.140]   I thought that was supposed to be good, but...
[01:44:53.140 --> 01:44:54.140]   I also...
[01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:59.020]   Okay, just so now you can get it all out of your system, I really hated the new cosmos.
[01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:01.460]   Oh, I didn't see it.
[01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:02.460]   Yep.
[01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:05.180]   Shouldn't see it.
[01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:07.460]   That was just the intro I should wait and see another one.
[01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:10.860]   Well, now that I know Leo's taste, maybe I should run or watch it.
[01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:12.700]   It was all special effect.
[01:45:12.700 --> 01:45:18.140]   It felt like the Disney version of the universe, like a Disney ride version of the universe.
[01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:23.020]   Like it was any different from billion millions of things used.
[01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:24.020]   I just...
[01:45:24.020 --> 01:45:25.020]   I don't...
[01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:26.020]   You know, I didn't...
[01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:30.180]   I wasn't of the right age to be influenced by Carl Sagan's cosmos.
[01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:31.180]   But this...
[01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:32.180]   I just was not...
[01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:33.180]   I was underwhelmed by it.
[01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:34.180]   Now I'll watch the next episode.
[01:45:34.180 --> 01:45:36.820]   Maybe this was just because it was the intro.
[01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:37.820]   And I was very insulted that...
[01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:39.380]   Oh, I don't want to go on.
[01:45:39.380 --> 01:45:40.380]   I'm sorry.
[01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:41.860]   TV insults you all the time.
[01:45:41.860 --> 01:45:45.860]   You know, it's like you're sitting there at home watching your TV just saying, "How dare
[01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:46.860]   you tell the truth?"
[01:45:46.860 --> 01:45:47.860]   I do.
[01:45:47.860 --> 01:45:49.020]   I talk to the TV a lot.
[01:45:49.020 --> 01:45:52.140]   I talk back to the TV a lot.
[01:45:52.140 --> 01:45:56.500]   I'm really angry about True Detective, which started out really great and led us all down.
[01:45:56.500 --> 01:45:59.100]   I thought significantly.
[01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:00.100]   But I won't...
[01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:01.100]   Enough TV reviews.
[01:46:01.100 --> 01:46:03.220]   Do you have any other numbers to take our...
[01:46:03.220 --> 01:46:04.780]   To take this bad taste out of our house?
[01:46:04.780 --> 01:46:05.780]   Hey, I'll take it.
[01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:06.780]   Give me another number.
[01:46:06.780 --> 01:46:07.780]   Yeah, I never...
[01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:09.780]   It's the first time in all the entire show my number has been rejected.
[01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:10.780]   I didn't reject it.
[01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:11.780]   I was going to say...
[01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:12.980]   No, it's a good number.
[01:46:12.980 --> 01:46:13.980]   I said...
[01:46:13.980 --> 01:46:14.980]   Have you ever...
[01:46:14.980 --> 01:46:18.740]   Have you ever heard of a TV show being renewed for three seasons that's unheard of?
[01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:20.260]   I will give you this instead.
[01:46:20.260 --> 01:46:21.260]   All right.
[01:46:21.260 --> 01:46:25.020]   Tony Hale, who is the brilliant CEO of Chart Beat, Chart Beat Tracks Pages and what we do.
[01:46:25.020 --> 01:46:26.020]   I love this thing.
[01:46:26.020 --> 01:46:27.020]   Oh, my pixel.
[01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:28.020]   Yeah.
[01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:29.020]   This is great.
[01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:30.780]   I've been worried that native advertising, right?
[01:46:30.780 --> 01:46:34.220]   Native advertising is the stuff that tries to fool you into thinking this is really content
[01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:37.140]   when it's just a goddamn long, texty boring advertisement.
[01:46:37.140 --> 01:46:38.140]   I agree.
[01:46:38.140 --> 01:46:39.700]   And I've been worried people are fooled by this.
[01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:41.660]   But I should have more faith in humanity.
[01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:42.660]   People are smart.
[01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:50.500]   Chart Beat has found that when people go to a page with normal content, 71% scroll.
[01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:51.500]   Okay?
[01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:53.740]   That is, they're committed and they look for more.
[01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:58.340]   People who go to native ad content, only 24% scroll.
[01:46:58.340 --> 01:47:01.020]   That means they don't continue to read because they know it's bogus.
[01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:04.260]   They know this is crap, right?
[01:47:04.260 --> 01:47:06.260]   And I think that's important.
[01:47:06.260 --> 01:47:08.860]   And then he had another number in here.
[01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:16.340]   A stunning 55% of people spent fewer than 15 seconds actively on a page.
[01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:18.660]   They looked at 2 billion visits.
[01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:25.180]   So more than half the time, we've glanced off the page like an asteroid off Mars in 15 seconds.
[01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:26.340]   Boom, gone.
[01:47:26.340 --> 01:47:29.860]   Which is to say, most of the time we go to something that's irrelevant to us and crap.
[01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:32.060]   Now, how do we get to that crap?
[01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:34.940]   Often we get to it from links.
[01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:38.580]   And the other thing that Chart Beat has said is that most people, we've talked about this
[01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:44.340]   in the show before, most people share or like before they read.
[01:47:44.340 --> 01:47:49.100]   This before or they never, yeah, this was really an interesting graph.
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:51.060]   Do we read the articles we share?
[01:47:51.060 --> 01:47:53.940]   So there's four quadrants.
[01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:57.300]   The bottom half is low social activity.
[01:47:57.300 --> 01:47:58.620]   In other words, lots of sharing.
[01:47:58.620 --> 01:47:59.620]   No sharing.
[01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:01.180]   The top is lots of sharing.
[01:48:01.180 --> 01:48:05.140]   The left half is low read time, high read time is the right half.
[01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:11.420]   So if you look at the high read time, high sharing, there's nothing.
[01:48:11.420 --> 01:48:14.580]   If you spend time reading something, you just don't share it.
[01:48:14.580 --> 01:48:17.420]   And where's the most sharing?
[01:48:17.420 --> 01:48:18.420]   Well, of course, we're--
[01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:19.500]   All of the things we don't read.
[01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:20.540]   The least read time.
[01:48:20.540 --> 01:48:23.980]   And we talked about this on iPad Today on Monday.
[01:48:23.980 --> 01:48:29.980]   It either indicates that people share to show how smart they are, or I think that they
[01:48:29.980 --> 01:48:32.420]   I think people just they share headlines.
[01:48:32.420 --> 01:48:33.580]   They're not sharing the article.
[01:48:33.580 --> 01:48:34.580]   That's exactly it.
[01:48:34.580 --> 01:48:35.580]   That's exactly it.
[01:48:35.580 --> 01:48:38.620]   And I think we share-- the motive to share is to-- is social capital, is look how smart
[01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:40.340]   I am on the first one who shared this.
[01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:41.940]   And we just bug people with it.
[01:48:41.940 --> 01:48:45.380]   And so I wrote a blog post about what the proper metrics are then.
[01:48:45.380 --> 01:48:47.140]   So Tony tears down some metrics.
[01:48:47.140 --> 01:48:49.300]   But I think we have to look at other metrics.
[01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:51.100]   And it varies, right?
[01:48:51.100 --> 01:48:54.460]   At circa, the main metric they use is follow.
[01:48:54.460 --> 01:48:58.820]   If you follow a story, it says, please bug me when something happens here.
[01:48:58.820 --> 01:49:00.300]   That's a good metric.
[01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:06.420]   At medium, they track what they call TTR, total time reading.
[01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:09.380]   And they're even going to start-- they're looking to around text.
[01:49:09.380 --> 01:49:12.900]   I was with one of the executives there just yesterday.
[01:49:12.900 --> 01:49:18.660]   And they're looking around text to basically charge on time, like broadcast, which is
[01:49:18.660 --> 01:49:20.980]   where Tony Hills also backed up in some other research.
[01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:24.700]   And so the idea that you could spend on time now, attention is a good-- and time spent
[01:49:24.700 --> 01:49:26.660]   is a good metric for things that are like that.
[01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:30.860]   But I think it's also an admin metric for things like, just tell me the fact that you
[01:49:30.860 --> 01:49:31.860]   get me out of here.
[01:49:31.860 --> 01:49:36.980]   And I met with Jerry Yang many, many, many, many years ago in a conference room meeting.
[01:49:36.980 --> 01:49:40.660]   And he said, our job at Yahoo is to get you in and out of here as quickly as possible.
[01:49:40.660 --> 01:49:42.980]   Well, that didn't last long, did it?
[01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:46.540]   Because they went with the old media model of trying to shove as many eyeballs in front
[01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:48.300]   of your-- or ads in front of your eyeballs.
[01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:49.300]   And they could.
[01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:52.940]   They tried to drag you down and give you friction and hold you there.
[01:49:52.940 --> 01:49:55.180]   But that's not the best metric if you just want to get a fact.
[01:49:55.180 --> 01:49:56.180]   You want to get in and out.
[01:49:56.180 --> 01:49:58.020]   So efficiency is an important metric.
[01:49:58.020 --> 01:50:01.820]   So anyway, I wanted to point you to Tony Hills, very good piece.
[01:50:01.820 --> 01:50:06.220]   And this is evidently now erased the memory of three more years of Big Bang Theory from
[01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:07.220]   you.
[01:50:07.220 --> 01:50:08.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:08.220 --> 01:50:09.220]   The more--
[01:50:09.220 --> 01:50:10.220]   I didn't tell you brought that up again.
[01:50:10.220 --> 01:50:14.740]   The most click time, but least deeply engaged with articles, had generic topics.
[01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:19.100]   In August, the worst performers included top, best, biggest fictional.
[01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:22.340]   In January, the worst performers, hairstyles, positions, nude.
[01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:24.900]   And for some reason, the word Virginia.
[01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:25.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:30.740]   Lots of clicks, not so much engagement.
[01:50:30.740 --> 01:50:31.740]   I think that's true.
[01:50:31.740 --> 01:50:33.660]   I think we know that here.
[01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:37.260]   For a long time, I felt bad that we weren't getting as many shares as I thought we should
[01:50:37.260 --> 01:50:38.260]   on social media.
[01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:41.220]   And partly, that's because we're long-form video shows.
[01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:43.180]   Not easy to share us.
[01:50:43.180 --> 01:50:45.260]   But I think people get engaged with our content.
[01:50:45.260 --> 01:50:48.860]   So I'm not going to worry so much about whether we're getting shared or not.
[01:50:48.860 --> 01:50:51.620]   Although I bet you, there's a few people tweeting that I'm an idiot for not liking
[01:50:51.620 --> 01:50:53.900]   Big Bang Theory right now.
[01:50:53.900 --> 01:50:56.820]   All right, you will like this, though.
[01:50:56.820 --> 01:50:58.100]   Two Android apps.
[01:50:58.100 --> 01:51:00.420]   This is a Chromecast app.
[01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:03.860]   Did you ever play cards against humanity?
[01:51:03.860 --> 01:51:05.100]   Somebody in the chatroom told me about this.
[01:51:05.100 --> 01:51:08.540]   I just installed it-- casts against civility.
[01:51:08.540 --> 01:51:14.740]   It's a Chromecast app that lets you and one or two or three other people play this amazingly
[01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:17.980]   horrid but fun card game.
[01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:21.900]   It's not the same company or same people who do cards against humanity.
[01:51:21.900 --> 01:51:24.700]   It's a party game for horrible people.
[01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:27.900]   The object of the game is to respond to a question or statement that has a certain word
[01:51:27.900 --> 01:51:32.220]   or phrase censored by playing one of the 10 cards in your hands.
[01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:39.140]   It's going to get a lot of groans and titters from your audience, from your playmates in
[01:51:39.140 --> 01:51:40.580]   this, but you play it on a big screen.
[01:51:40.580 --> 01:51:43.380]   I think this is a great way to do a party game.
[01:51:43.380 --> 01:51:45.740]   And it's free casts against humanity.
[01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:48.700]   And then the other one is you're never going to stop playing this.
[01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:55.260]   So I got to warn you, it's came out first for iOS, but QuizUp is now available on Android.
[01:51:55.260 --> 01:51:57.420]   Have you ever played this game?
[01:51:57.420 --> 01:52:04.060]   This is a trivia quiz game that has an infinite, huge number of topics.
[01:52:04.060 --> 01:52:06.660]   In fact, I'll go to the topics page and you'll see.
[01:52:06.660 --> 01:52:12.260]   So there's something you can be an expert in in almost any category, not just geography,
[01:52:12.260 --> 01:52:16.780]   but drill down in Africa, African countries, Asia, Asian countries, Australia, Canada,
[01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:21.300]   cities of the world, European countries, landmarks, name the flag, name the country,
[01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:22.300]   name the landmark.
[01:52:22.300 --> 01:52:23.300]   And that's just geography.
[01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:25.460]   I mean, there's tons of topics.
[01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:26.460]   You want to play one?
[01:52:26.460 --> 01:52:28.260]   I have probably some challenges.
[01:52:28.260 --> 01:52:30.940]   People are challenging me a lot on this one.
[01:52:30.940 --> 01:52:31.940]   Which one do you want to play?
[01:52:31.940 --> 01:52:32.940]   Dog breeds.
[01:52:32.940 --> 01:52:34.180]   Dr. Mom wants to play dog breeds.
[01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:36.620]   Let's see how good you are at dog breeds.
[01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:38.220]   So it'll play in real time.
[01:52:38.220 --> 01:52:40.980]   It'll automatically pick an opponent somewhere in the world.
[01:52:40.980 --> 01:52:42.860]   There's always somebody to play against.
[01:52:42.860 --> 01:52:45.140]   Or you can asynchronously play against your friends.
[01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:49.100]   So Dr. Mom's already played this and gotten her score.
[01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:50.420]   Now I'm going to play at the same time.
[01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:52.740]   It's got very dramatic music.
[01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:57.220]   What is the breed which among the most common of pet breeds knows it's diligent?
[01:52:57.220 --> 01:52:59.060]   Well that's a doberman, is it?
[01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:00.260]   Yes, all right.
[01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:02.780]   So you see you can test your knowledge of dog breeds.
[01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:04.380]   It's really a lot of fun to play.
[01:53:04.380 --> 01:53:08.260]   You also get dinged for taking too long.
[01:53:08.260 --> 01:53:11.660]   Preferred breed for search and rescue has to be, this is too easy.
[01:53:11.660 --> 01:53:14.140]   This is not a good test of this game.
[01:53:14.140 --> 01:53:15.700]   It can get pretty tough.
[01:53:15.700 --> 01:53:19.540]   If I play the, whoops, I just went out of it.
[01:53:19.540 --> 01:53:26.460]   If I play the, by the way, here's a new quiz up challenge.
[01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:27.580]   You guys aren't saying anything.
[01:53:27.580 --> 01:53:31.660]   Are you just really, Karsten who is a resident of your, I'm not a game guy.
[01:53:31.660 --> 01:53:32.660]   I like trivia.
[01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:33.660]   Don't you like trivia?
[01:53:33.660 --> 01:53:34.660]   No.
[01:53:34.660 --> 01:53:42.300]   I've started a big bang theory quiz.
[01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:43.300]   You know what?
[01:53:43.300 --> 01:53:46.140]   There is, you want to play the big bang theory quiz?
[01:53:46.140 --> 01:53:47.140]   You want to?
[01:53:47.140 --> 01:53:48.300]   I'm seriously.
[01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:49.300]   You want to play it?
[01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:50.300]   All right.
[01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:51.300]   Let's see.
[01:53:51.300 --> 01:53:53.500]   I want to see if you guys really watch that show.
[01:53:53.500 --> 01:53:54.500]   Okay.
[01:53:54.500 --> 01:53:56.780]   We'll go to topics television.
[01:53:56.780 --> 01:54:01.140]   You claim to watch that show.
[01:54:01.140 --> 01:54:04.260]   TV, all the TV shows.
[01:54:04.260 --> 01:54:07.540]   Oh, no, I didn't want to do that.
[01:54:07.540 --> 01:54:08.860]   Oh, crud.
[01:54:08.860 --> 01:54:10.580]   All the TV, big bang theory.
[01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:12.860]   Now, I'm just going to play somebody randomly.
[01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:14.340]   All right.
[01:54:14.340 --> 01:54:17.220]   I could challenge people I know, but I'm just going to play somebody randomly.
[01:54:17.220 --> 01:54:18.460]   I'm playing Roberto.
[01:54:18.460 --> 01:54:19.460]   He's playing from the US.
[01:54:19.460 --> 01:54:20.460]   He's pretty good at this.
[01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:21.460]   He's one 21 times.
[01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:24.540]   I don't think I was shot at this big bang theory.
[01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:25.540]   Round one.
[01:54:25.540 --> 01:54:26.540]   Get ready.
[01:54:26.540 --> 01:54:32.460]   What did Penny try to pay her electric bill with Leonard's letter Starbucks gift card?
[01:54:32.460 --> 01:54:33.460]   That's what I would have guessed.
[01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:34.460]   Good.
[01:54:34.460 --> 01:54:35.460]   Was that a guess?
[01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:37.820]   Or did you know Roberto got it right away?
[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:38.820]   He's pretty predictable.
[01:54:38.820 --> 01:54:40.740]   What is Sheldon's IQ?
[01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:41.740]   Oh, 194.
[01:54:41.740 --> 01:54:43.740]   Yeah, I copy.
[01:54:43.740 --> 01:54:44.740]   Not 187.
[01:54:44.740 --> 01:54:48.300]   Oh, and then if you.
[01:54:48.300 --> 01:54:53.580]   Sheldon attempts to train Penny using what kind of food cake chocolate fruit or crisps?
[01:54:53.580 --> 01:54:54.580]   Chocolate.
[01:54:54.580 --> 01:54:55.580]   Chocolate.
[01:54:55.580 --> 01:54:57.340]   Very good.
[01:54:57.340 --> 01:54:58.340]   Very good.
[01:54:58.340 --> 01:54:59.340]   Thank you.
[01:54:59.340 --> 01:55:00.340]   Thank you very much.
[01:55:00.340 --> 01:55:01.340]   Round four.
[01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:02.340]   There are only seven questions.
[01:55:02.340 --> 01:55:05.180]   Which episode is Stephanie Barnett make her debut appearance?
[01:55:05.180 --> 01:55:08.660]   Is it the dumpling paradox, the Lissures Spock expansion, the Euclide alternative or
[01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:09.660]   the friendship algorithm?
[01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:11.860]   No, it's the lizard Spock expansion.
[01:55:11.860 --> 01:55:15.380]   Roberto's gotten everyone right so far.
[01:55:15.380 --> 01:55:18.220]   Why did Amy Ferra Fowler leave the scouts?
[01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:19.620]   She didn't like the uniform.
[01:55:19.620 --> 01:55:22.860]   No, they discovered she was a girl.
[01:55:22.860 --> 01:55:25.260]   These are hard.
[01:55:25.260 --> 01:55:30.260]   In which episode is Leonard proposed to Penny the cushion saturation, the launch acceleration,
[01:55:30.260 --> 01:55:31.900]   the gothawitz deviation?
[01:55:31.900 --> 01:55:35.540]   I don't even like the names of this show.
[01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:39.780]   Twice double bonus.
[01:55:39.780 --> 01:55:43.220]   What is the name of the agent sent to interviewed Leonard Sheldon and Raj as part of a background
[01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:45.020]   check on Howard?
[01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:48.420]   I think it's Patty Pearson, but it was actually Angela Page.
[01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:50.820]   Ladies and gentlemen, congratulations to Roberto.
[01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:53.420]   Why is it douche-coup, by the way?
[01:55:53.420 --> 01:55:54.420]   Oh, really?
[01:55:54.420 --> 01:55:55.420]   I will see.
[01:55:55.420 --> 01:55:56.420]   I love her.
[01:55:56.420 --> 01:55:57.420]   All right.
[01:55:57.420 --> 01:55:58.420]   So I lose.
[01:55:58.420 --> 01:55:59.420]   I failed you, Leo.
[01:55:59.420 --> 01:56:00.420]   That was terrible.
[01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:01.420]   I did terrible.
[01:56:01.420 --> 01:56:02.420]   You don't even watch that show, do you?
[01:56:02.420 --> 01:56:03.420]   I do.
[01:56:03.420 --> 01:56:04.420]   I do.
[01:56:04.420 --> 01:56:06.220]   That's a fun game.
[01:56:06.220 --> 01:56:09.060]   I curse you for making me in the song.
[01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:11.820]   It's really, if you like trivia, it's really great.
[01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:12.820]   Yeah.
[01:56:12.820 --> 01:56:13.820]   Really, really.
[01:56:13.820 --> 01:56:14.820]   You talked about it last night?
[01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:18.300]   And I installed it last night while we were talking about it on all about Android, and
[01:56:18.300 --> 01:56:23.900]   I hadn't actually launched it until now, and now I can see that I've lost my night.
[01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:24.900]   It's really fun.
[01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:31.780]   And then people start to beat you by one point, and then you get upset, and it's really good.
[01:56:31.780 --> 01:56:33.420]   But I want to play this cast against civility.
[01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:35.460]   I think that's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:56:35.460 --> 01:56:36.940]   I wonder if they're-- yeah.
[01:56:36.940 --> 01:56:41.980]   I mean, they don't-- I don't think they use the same questions as cards against humanity,
[01:56:41.980 --> 01:56:42.980]   but--
[01:56:42.980 --> 01:56:45.220]   Kind of a neat use case for the cast.
[01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:46.220]   For cast, yeah.
[01:56:46.220 --> 01:56:47.220]   All right.
[01:56:47.220 --> 01:56:48.220]   Yeah.
[01:56:48.220 --> 01:56:49.220]   Yeah.
[01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:50.220]   Yeah.
[01:56:50.220 --> 01:56:51.220]   Where are you?
[01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:52.220]   Quiz up, cast against civility.
[01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:53.220]   A couple of picks there.
[01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:55.860]   Thank you very much, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:56:55.860 --> 01:56:59.020]   Did you see the last episode of True Detective yet?
[01:56:59.020 --> 01:57:00.020]   Yeah.
[01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:01.020]   What'd you think?
[01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:02.020]   Mm-hmm.
[01:57:02.020 --> 01:57:04.220]   Yeah, I'm a little disappointed.
[01:57:04.220 --> 01:57:07.220]   I'm not a fan of McConaughey.
[01:57:07.220 --> 01:57:08.220]   Oh, I am.
[01:57:08.220 --> 01:57:10.220]   I don't like him as a human.
[01:57:10.220 --> 01:57:11.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:57:11.220 --> 01:57:12.220]   I love him as an actor.
[01:57:12.220 --> 01:57:14.660]   He's the most awesomeest actor ever.
[01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:15.660]   Yeah.
[01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:16.660]   And what do you hear?
[01:57:16.660 --> 01:57:17.660]   This is a last one.
[01:57:17.660 --> 01:57:18.660]   Yeah, I think what I think about him.
[01:57:18.660 --> 01:57:19.660]   I'm not a big one.
[01:57:19.660 --> 01:57:20.660]   Yeah.
[01:57:20.660 --> 01:57:21.660]   Yeah.
[01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:22.660]   But yeah, I'm kind of with you.
[01:57:22.660 --> 01:57:25.420]   What's the show you're most excited about these days?
[01:57:25.420 --> 01:57:27.660]   Big Bang Theory, of course.
[01:57:27.660 --> 01:57:28.660]   Shut up.
[01:57:28.660 --> 01:57:30.220]   You know you're lying.
[01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:31.540]   I know you're lying.
[01:57:31.540 --> 01:57:36.540]   I just-- nothing matters until the new season of Our Engine is a new black.
[01:57:36.540 --> 01:57:37.780]   I love that show.
[01:57:37.780 --> 01:57:39.420]   That's a good one.
[01:57:39.420 --> 01:57:43.460]   As long as I'm giving you games that are going to kill your rest of your life, "3s" is also
[01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:47.340]   now available on the Android app store.
[01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:48.340]   Have you ever played that?
[01:57:48.340 --> 01:57:49.340]   Mm-hmm.
[01:57:49.340 --> 01:57:50.340]   "3s"?
[01:57:50.340 --> 01:57:51.900]   I don't like games.
[01:57:51.900 --> 01:57:53.900]   You will like this one.
[01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:57.740]   One of the best games ever, but you've got to get the right one.
[01:57:57.740 --> 01:58:06.140]   And I see-- because "3s" is so popular on iOS, I see a lot of fake "3s."
[01:58:06.140 --> 01:58:07.140]   That's not it.
[01:58:07.140 --> 01:58:11.540]   "8" for the icon is definitely wrong.
[01:58:11.540 --> 01:58:15.700]   But somebody said the real one is available, so I have to look and see if I can find it.
[01:58:15.700 --> 01:58:16.700]   Huh.
[01:58:16.700 --> 01:58:18.180]   Look at all the fake ones.
[01:58:18.180 --> 01:58:20.980]   It's like the flappy bird clones.
[01:58:20.980 --> 01:58:22.460]   Yeah.
[01:58:22.460 --> 01:58:24.180]   [SIGH]
[01:58:24.180 --> 01:58:25.700]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[01:58:25.700 --> 01:58:28.580]   I'm sorry if I have offended you.
[01:58:28.580 --> 01:58:31.140]   I heartily sorry.
[01:58:31.140 --> 01:58:33.700]   Gina Trapani is at smarterware.org.
[01:58:33.700 --> 01:58:36.300]   She probably doesn't get much time to block these days.
[01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:40.500]   No, not blocking too much, but just about to launch.
[01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:42.780]   Sign up to our waiting list members on ThinkUp.
[01:58:42.780 --> 01:58:43.780]   So think up.com.
[01:58:43.780 --> 01:58:44.780]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:58:44.780 --> 01:58:45.780]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:58:45.780 --> 01:58:46.780]   This week, yeah.
[01:58:46.780 --> 01:58:47.780]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:58:47.780 --> 01:58:48.780]   Put popular email in there and you'll be one of the first to know.
[01:58:48.780 --> 01:58:53.220]   And we will be live to the public very soon, probably next week.
[01:58:53.220 --> 01:58:54.220]   Prawls.
[01:58:54.220 --> 01:58:55.860]   All those popular kids.
[01:58:55.860 --> 01:58:56.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:58:56.860 --> 01:59:00.500]   I'm going to just show you real quickly because you really can't get a sense of what it can
[01:59:00.500 --> 01:59:03.100]   do until you see somebody's think up.
[01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:04.100]   I'll just show you my think up.
[01:59:04.100 --> 01:59:08.220]   So it shows you popular retweets.
[01:59:08.220 --> 01:59:11.700]   Oh, people like the petition to end daylight saving time.
[01:59:11.700 --> 01:59:13.500]   Yeah, nice job on that.
[01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:14.500]   Highly retweeted.
[01:59:14.500 --> 01:59:18.300]   187 retweets, 34 replies.
[01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:19.780]   These are the people who followed me.
[01:59:19.780 --> 01:59:21.060]   The list some on.
[01:59:21.060 --> 01:59:23.140]   Key stats for my tweets.
[01:59:23.140 --> 01:59:26.060]   My favorite is how much-- how many times I said I, me.
[01:59:26.060 --> 01:59:30.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:59:30.460 --> 01:59:31.660]   What do you call that one?
[01:59:31.660 --> 01:59:33.460]   Talk about yourself much or something?
[01:59:33.460 --> 01:59:34.460]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:59:34.460 --> 01:59:35.460]   Enough about me.
[01:59:35.460 --> 01:59:36.460]   Enough about me.
[01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:37.460]   Yeah.
[01:59:37.460 --> 01:59:38.460]   I get that one a lot.
[01:59:38.460 --> 01:59:39.460]   Yeah.
[01:59:39.460 --> 01:59:40.460]   Yeah.
[01:59:40.460 --> 01:59:44.940]   We've got quite a few new insights rolling out soon in a couple of weeks too.
[01:59:44.940 --> 01:59:46.860]   So I'm pretty excited.
[01:59:46.860 --> 01:59:48.900]   You have a good insight stream, Leo.
[01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:51.340]   I love-- you've got a great-- you've got a very engaged audience.
[01:59:51.340 --> 01:59:52.340]   I love it.
[01:59:52.340 --> 01:59:54.700]   It's-- it makes Twitter better.
[01:59:54.700 --> 01:59:55.700]   Lots more fun.
[01:59:55.700 --> 01:59:56.700]   Thank you.
[01:59:56.700 --> 01:59:57.700]   I love best.
[01:59:57.700 --> 02:00:01.980]   I love best when it says how many people I added to somebody else's tweet.
[02:00:01.980 --> 02:00:05.380]   Oh, yeah, because you retweeted it at half a million more people saw it.
[02:00:05.380 --> 02:00:06.380]   And that's such a nice feeling.
[02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:07.380]   Yeah, I like that.
[02:00:07.380 --> 02:00:08.380]   Cool.
[02:00:08.380 --> 02:00:10.060]   I really did something good for somebody today.
[02:00:10.060 --> 02:00:11.540]   That's Jeff Jarvis.
[02:00:11.540 --> 02:00:16.740]   He is the professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:18.660]   Just a jolly fellow.
[02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:24.100]   He also, of course, blogs at buzzmachine.com and his latest book is Public Parts Available
[02:00:24.100 --> 02:00:25.100]   Everywhere.
[02:00:25.100 --> 02:00:26.980]   Are you mad at me?
[02:00:26.980 --> 02:00:28.220]   I like.
[02:00:28.220 --> 02:00:29.940]   I like Big Bang Theory.
[02:00:29.940 --> 02:00:32.900]   Are you mad at me for saying anything about that?
[02:00:32.900 --> 02:00:33.900]   Nice.
[02:00:33.900 --> 02:00:34.900]   Are you mad?
[02:00:34.900 --> 02:00:35.900]   I'm easy going.
[02:00:35.900 --> 02:00:36.900]   I have a sense of humor.
[02:00:36.900 --> 02:00:37.900]   Are you hangry?
[02:00:37.900 --> 02:00:38.980]   Did I hurt your feelings?
[02:00:38.980 --> 02:00:39.980]   I'm just amazed.
[02:00:39.980 --> 02:00:41.940]   I'm just amazed.
[02:00:41.940 --> 02:00:42.940]   I know.
[02:00:42.940 --> 02:00:43.940]   I'm not in the sitcom.
[02:00:43.940 --> 02:00:44.940]   I haven't watched the sitcom in years.
[02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:47.940]   I can't-- you know, the truth is I can't watch your television network television.
[02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:50.660]   You watch your life with games, I waste my life with sitcoms.
[02:00:50.660 --> 02:00:51.660]   That's what we are.
[02:00:51.660 --> 02:00:52.660]   Oh, no, I watch a lot of TV.
[02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:53.820]   In fact, Lisa observed that last night.
[02:00:53.820 --> 02:00:55.660]   You watch way too much TV.
[02:00:55.660 --> 02:00:57.860]   I like TV.
[02:00:57.860 --> 02:01:01.100]   But I tend to watch this stuff, the cable dramas.
[02:01:01.100 --> 02:01:04.420]   I'm a big fan of cable dramas.
[02:01:04.420 --> 02:01:05.420]   Thank you, lady.
[02:01:05.420 --> 02:01:07.020]   Thank you, gentlemen.
[02:01:07.020 --> 02:01:09.980]   Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for watching.
[02:01:09.980 --> 02:01:14.460]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday, 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:01:14.460 --> 02:01:18.380]   Note, we are now on summertime in the United States, a little earlier than a lot of the
[02:01:18.380 --> 02:01:20.260]   rest of you.
[02:01:20.260 --> 02:01:22.100]   So 1 p.m.
[02:01:22.100 --> 02:01:23.100]   Our time.
[02:01:23.100 --> 02:01:24.740]   Just really pissing off Leo.
[02:01:24.740 --> 02:01:26.900]   Yeah, I don't want it anymore.
[02:01:26.900 --> 02:01:29.300]   We should not kill daylight saving time.
[02:01:29.300 --> 02:01:30.300]   Just kill it.
[02:01:30.300 --> 02:01:31.620]   I think we should stay at it.
[02:01:31.620 --> 02:01:32.980]   Let's not change ever again.
[02:01:32.980 --> 02:01:34.620]   Let's just stay right here where we are.
[02:01:34.620 --> 02:01:38.220]   It would make life with a baby a lot easier.
[02:01:38.220 --> 02:01:39.220]   Wouldn't it?
[02:01:39.220 --> 02:01:40.220]   Yeah.
[02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:44.140]   You know, there's 17% more fatalities the Monday after daylight saving time begins.
[02:01:44.140 --> 02:01:45.380]   Because everyone's exhausted.
[02:01:45.380 --> 02:01:47.940]   Yeah, because you're one hour off and you're groggy.
[02:01:47.940 --> 02:01:51.340]   And these are fatal traffic accidents in the US.
[02:01:51.340 --> 02:01:53.660]   17% more on that Monday.
[02:01:53.660 --> 02:01:56.740]   I was talking to a doctor the other day who got more people coming in, feeling bad,
[02:01:56.740 --> 02:01:59.540]   and depressed because of the last time I was done.
[02:01:59.540 --> 02:02:01.180]   Why do we do this to ourselves?
[02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:02.180]   What is the advantage?
[02:02:02.180 --> 02:02:07.620]   But all they have to do on daylight saving time is just watch a rerun of big bang.
[02:02:07.620 --> 02:02:08.620]   It's sure you write up.
[02:02:08.620 --> 02:02:09.620]   It's sure you write up.
[02:02:09.620 --> 02:02:11.100]   You'll feel so much better.
[02:02:11.100 --> 02:02:12.500]   Who's your favorite character?
[02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:13.500]   She's Sheldon.
[02:02:13.500 --> 02:02:14.500]   Everybody loves Sheldon.
[02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:15.500]   I love Sheldon.
[02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:16.500]   Yeah.
[02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:17.500]   Yeah.
[02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:18.500]   Well, Jim Parsons is amazing.
[02:02:18.500 --> 02:02:20.180]   Amy Fowler Fowler is pretty amazing.
[02:02:20.180 --> 02:02:23.940]   And she did a great interview, long, great interview on Howard Stern.
[02:02:23.940 --> 02:02:24.940]   She was just wonderful.
[02:02:24.940 --> 02:02:25.940]   Really?
[02:02:25.940 --> 02:02:27.940]   Oh, I was awesome.
[02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:28.940]   Blossom.
[02:02:28.940 --> 02:02:30.260]   Yeah.
[02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:31.260]   She was blossom.
[02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:32.260]   Yeah.
[02:02:32.260 --> 02:02:36.860]   I didn't like that show either.
[02:02:36.860 --> 02:02:41.500]   She's a Ph.
[02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:43.060]   She's an honest to God.
[02:02:43.060 --> 02:02:44.060]   Ph.D.
[02:02:44.060 --> 02:02:45.060]   What?
[02:02:45.060 --> 02:02:46.060]   Yeah.
[02:02:46.060 --> 02:02:47.060]   Oh, yeah.
[02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:48.060]   She was your doctorate in.
[02:02:48.060 --> 02:02:50.060]   I think like a neurology or something like that.
[02:02:50.060 --> 02:02:53.940]   And how does she justify paying such a nitwit on the show?
[02:02:53.940 --> 02:02:55.460]   She's not a nitwit on the show.
[02:02:55.460 --> 02:02:57.460]   She's one of the show pennies not the neighbor.
[02:02:57.460 --> 02:02:58.460]   Oh, yeah.
[02:02:58.460 --> 02:02:59.460]   Right, right, right.
[02:02:59.460 --> 02:03:00.460]   Amy Fowler.
[02:03:00.460 --> 02:03:02.060]   She was not blossom.
[02:03:02.060 --> 02:03:03.060]   Leave me, Leo.
[02:03:03.060 --> 02:03:04.060]   See, I know.
[02:03:04.060 --> 02:03:05.060]   Yeah.
[02:03:05.060 --> 02:03:08.660]   You really, you really, you are clearly a communist.
[02:03:08.660 --> 02:03:10.860]   The show of the Americans, it's about Leo.
[02:03:10.860 --> 02:03:12.860]   Actually, I like the Americans.
[02:03:12.860 --> 02:03:13.860]   Okay.
[02:03:13.860 --> 02:03:14.860]   For network television.
[02:03:14.860 --> 02:03:15.860]   Yeah.
[02:03:15.860 --> 02:03:16.860]   How about Orphan Black?
[02:03:16.860 --> 02:03:17.860]   Can we talk about that?
[02:03:17.860 --> 02:03:18.860]   Yeah, I like that a lot.
[02:03:18.860 --> 02:03:19.860]   I like that a lot.
[02:03:19.860 --> 02:03:20.860]   It's coming back.
[02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:21.860]   Okay.
[02:03:21.860 --> 02:03:22.860]   April.
[02:03:22.860 --> 02:03:23.860]   Yeah.
[02:03:23.860 --> 02:03:24.860]   Good.
[02:03:24.860 --> 02:03:25.860]   You're a scientist.
[02:03:25.860 --> 02:03:26.860]   Yes.
[02:03:26.860 --> 02:03:29.460]   I thought she was the neighbor, but she's not the neighbor.
[02:03:29.460 --> 02:03:30.860]   No, no, no, no, no.
[02:03:30.860 --> 02:03:33.660]   The neighbor is as far as I know, just an actress.
[02:03:33.660 --> 02:03:35.460]   She definitely doesn't have a PhD.
[02:03:35.460 --> 02:03:39.220]   She probably doesn't have a bachelor's.
[02:03:39.220 --> 02:03:40.540]   Are we out of it out of here yet?
[02:03:40.540 --> 02:03:41.540]   Oh, I haven't said goodbye.
[02:03:41.540 --> 02:03:42.540]   I think you have.
[02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:43.540]   I have not finished the show.
[02:03:43.540 --> 02:03:45.500]   I'm still digging a deeper hole for myself.
[02:03:45.500 --> 02:03:46.500]   You are, Leo.
[02:03:46.500 --> 02:03:50.700]   You're getting quite seriously close to equating beauty with dumbness here.
[02:03:50.700 --> 02:03:52.700]   No, not at all.
[02:03:52.700 --> 02:03:54.060]   I don't know what Penny looks like.
[02:03:54.060 --> 02:03:55.060]   I'm not saying that.
[02:03:55.060 --> 02:03:56.260]   Just the neighbor is ditzy.
[02:03:56.260 --> 02:03:57.260]   Is she not?
[02:03:57.260 --> 02:04:00.020]   She's intentionally, it's very sexist.
[02:04:00.020 --> 02:04:01.860]   They play her as some bimbo.
[02:04:01.860 --> 02:04:04.820]   Particularly in the beginning, they totally cast her as well.
[02:04:04.820 --> 02:04:05.820]   I have never seen it.
[02:04:05.820 --> 02:04:06.820]   I've only seen it earlier.
[02:04:06.820 --> 02:04:07.820]   What they were making was one of them.
[02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:08.820]   Has the show went on?
[02:04:08.820 --> 02:04:09.820]   She became more geeky.
[02:04:09.820 --> 02:04:10.820]   Okay.
[02:04:10.820 --> 02:04:11.820]   Geeks.
[02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:13.060]   I've been the crush on her.
[02:04:13.060 --> 02:04:14.060]   Right.
[02:04:14.060 --> 02:04:15.060]   Yeah.
[02:04:15.060 --> 02:04:16.460]   Well, yeah.
[02:04:16.460 --> 02:04:18.380]   Okay.
[02:04:18.380 --> 02:04:23.940]   This show is on a 2000 UTC forever.
[02:04:23.940 --> 02:04:26.300]   But the thing is you never mind.
[02:04:26.300 --> 02:04:27.700]   Thank you for joining us.
[02:04:27.700 --> 02:04:30.500]   And we will see you next time on Twig.
[02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:40.500]   [MUSIC]
