[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   It's time for Twig this week in Google's Stacey Higginbotham's back at Pruitt's here.
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.040]   So as Jeff Jarvis will talk about how technology is changing the face of war in Ukraine, the
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.120]   future of hardware is its subscriptions, Spotify's card dongle, yes, there's probably a subscription
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:24.880]   there, and how Brandon Sanderson raised $15 million for four new books.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:40.440]   So I'll come up next on Twig.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.640]   This is Twig, this week in Google, Episode 653, recorded Wednesday, March 2nd, 2022.

[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.560]   week on Google.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.240]   I don't know if that's any better.
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.240]   We covered.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.240]   I will not work for Twog.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.840]   Hey, it's Stacey Higginbotham, she's back.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.840]   Stacey Ira, Stacey.com.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.320]   I'm so glad to be back.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.320]   We miss you.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.040]   We are happy to have you.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.640]   Everybody's in the house.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.520]   In fact, literally in the house sitting next to you.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.520]   In the house.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.520]   Yeah, hi.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.520]   Hands off the target.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.520]   Hi, I'm Stacey.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.520]   Maven, Aunt Pruitt, Looking Sharp.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.520]   I try.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.520]   Yep.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.520]   And I was always doing a great job with a club.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.120]   We'll talk a little bit about some of the club specials you put together.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.120]   Yep.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.120]   It's been fun so far.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.120]   Yep.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.840]   And I'm still enjoying these.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.560]   Stacey Higginbotham book club.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.560]   And I'm about halfway through this month's book.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.560]   Corey's book.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.800]   Corey's going to be on Twitter on Sunday.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.760]   I have to tell them that you're doing the book club special.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.360]   Tell them we're doing a book club with unauthorized bread.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.760]   I bought the Kindle version and I struggled with it as usual.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.240]   So I ended up buying the audio version.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.240]   And I bought the audio version.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.040]   The audio version is awesome.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.040]   Audio books are great.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.040]   They are great.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.040]   They're great.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.840]   I'm going to start picking audio books just for you.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.840]   No, don't do that.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.840]   Because I know.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.840]   Because I'm still trying.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.840]   I'm still trying.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.520]   But I think that's when I actually have eight.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.200]   D.D. is when I try to read books that aren't like instructional books.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.240]   You know, something about reading for leisure just doesn't do it for me.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.240]   I was.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.360]   Shall we know just this moment that the man who popularized audio books, Duval Hecht,
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.800]   has died at the age of 91.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.240]   That is by the way, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.240]   Everybody knows.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.240]   He has died.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.080]   Everyone loves him as the Leonard Taill professor for journalistic innovation at the.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.040]   Great, great, great, new month.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.040]   Comes with his own choral group.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.960]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.480]   Who invented audio books?
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.480]   I never heard this guy.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.480]   But didn't invent them.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.320]   They popularized me as founder of books on tape.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.120]   Books, audio books.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.320]   I used to be on the board of reading for the blind.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.560]   And dyslexic, which changes name learning ally.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.440]   But it was started after World War I because of mustard gas and other things that made
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.960]   veterans blind.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.520]   And so volunteers came together to read books for them.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.280]   And that was the form.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.440]   But Duval Hecht started books on tape as a company.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.680]   And I'm trying to see the year here that he's 75.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.920]   So much, much, much later, but really led to the popularization of them as a.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.800]   Until, of course, one company took them all over as happens to everything good.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.760]   And now it's all audible, but I like audible.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.560]   Audible is okay so far.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.960]   So I was a books on tape user.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:20.680]   I had a long commute two hours, sometimes each way to tech TV, starting in '98.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:28.760]   And I would get, you know, a box would come in the mail with 38 audio cassettes in it.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.400]   Remember that?
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.320]   And you put them in your cassette player.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.640]   And if one cassette, and if one of them got damaged, you know, you were stuck at that
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.640]   point.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.480]   You did tell them and they would send you a new cassette.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.960]   And then, but you only had a month to get through the book because you had to send it
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.280]   back to the library.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.240]   And when audible came around, I subscribed in 2000, 22 years ago, that was a lifesaver
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.360]   because you didn't have to send them back.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.360]   Right.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.360]   You didn't have broken cassettes.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.480]   You didn't have to worry about file corruption.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.480]   No.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.320]   Well, you know, you know Libra Vox?
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.320]   Which is, which is the, you know, the open podcast.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.960]   It's the volunteer version.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.720]   There was a book I needed to read.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.240]   I didn't have time.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.640]   And so I went on Libra Vox and found it.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:21.160]   It was William Dean Howell's book from the Golden Age.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.320]   And the narrator was great.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.320]   He was phenomenal.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.320]   Which is cool.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.320]   He's one of the tears.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.320]   So, you know, you're all public domain.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.920]   It's going to be kept.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.400]   Probably when I retire, that's what I'll do is I'll read for these guys.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.400]   That would be kind of fun.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.120]   I could do that for free.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.680]   And fill my like audio narrative.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.680]   Exactly.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.680]   Dreams.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.680]   Really great.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.680]   You, I would get a, you know what you should do Stacey?
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.960]   You should do Edith Wharton.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.960]   Accents.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.200]   No, Edith Wharton novels would be.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.480]   Yeah, you could do the accents.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.240]   That would be so great if, you know, you did Age of Innocence and House of Mirth.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.920]   You would be perfect for that.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.880]   I do love a good Edith Wharton.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.440]   I know they're great.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.680]   I have, I have an audio audible version of House of Mirth.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.120]   I've been listening to fantastic.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.720]   I could hear you reading those.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.280]   That'd be, that'd be wonderful.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.000]   Anyway, anyway, anyway, let's mention though.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.480]   I mean, I am glad you mentioned it because he was a pioneer and books on tape was for
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.840]   many of us kind of the entry, entry gateway drug Duvall hacked.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.600]   The war and peace ran 45 tapes.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:32.400]   I remember I, yes, I was listening to the Aubrey Matcher in series and I get these big
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.080]   boxes of tapes and you'd kind of have to hustle because you only had a month to listen.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:44.000]   My grandmother, she used to run a flower shop in Greenville, South Carolina and our commute
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.520]   was from Clemson to Greenville.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.040]   So it was a little long for her and we would get in the car with her in the summers to
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.800]   go work at the flower shop and she would always pop these tapes in and like, oh man,
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.720]   why are we listening to this stuff?
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:02.360]   We wanted to hear music and she was always playing these books on tape and I'm like,
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.360]   oh, grandma, give us some music, please.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.960]   Hackers was working as a broker in Los Angeles in the late 60s.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.520]   He had, as everybody does in LA, a long awful commute.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.880]   He told the LA Times he became frantic to escape his daily misery on the road.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.520]   Radio, he said, offered little more than bad music and worse news.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.560]   He founded a degree of solace and recorded books for the blind, which he played on a
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.720]   real to real machine that wrote along like a passenger in his Porsche.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:43.040]   But in 1975, with a seed money from the sale of his Porsche, he started books on tape.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.000]   And really books on tape was a lifesaver for me.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   I love it.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.760]   Well, all right, you know what?
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.520]   I'm glad you brought that up.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.360]   We're big fans of audiobooks here.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.440]   Audible has really kind of democratized it and simplified it.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.200]   By the way, they have a lot of books on tapes recordings on Audible.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.600]   I guess they licensed them over.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.880]   So I'm reading the Washington Post op-ed quote, listening is just returning literature
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.600]   to its original form before Gutenberg.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.600]   There it is.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:15.480]   He once told the journal referring to the 15th century craftsman regarded as a father
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.480]   of Marty and Prittin.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.920]   Do they really think people don't know who Gutenberg is?
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.280]   Well, not if they listen to this show.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.840]   They are experts on Gutenberg on this show.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.840]   I didn't know that.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.160]   Let us know last week.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:35.360]   You were whining and moaning and mewling about how we had no news and good Lord, the fates
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.360]   answered you.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.920]   Yeah, well, a war is bad for humans and other living things.
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.960]   But it happens to be good for news, the news business.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:49.840]   I remember working in TV news and it's kind of embarrassing and sad.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:54.720]   But day in, day out, it's really boring, man bites dog.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:00.160]   But when something, when there's a big story, you kind of jump into it.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.560]   Go find the closest Ukrainian citizen and ask them what they think.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.560]   Exactly.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.960]   Who has suppliers from Ukraine?
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.960]   So Azeroth.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.640]   And the other thing that's different in this war is how technology has influenced it,
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:19.680]   changed it, become a part of the battleground is really even from, you know, after the
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.960]   Afghanistan and Iraq and other recent wars, it's changed dramatically.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:28.160]   No one has mentioned anything about oil or anything like that.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.160]   It's all cyber.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:37.760]   Actually, so from a technology perspective, there is both Helium and neon are supplies
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.000]   that actually are used in the semiconductor manufacturing process.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.840]   Are they all out of the run articles?
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.840]   Is Russia the primary source?
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.080]   They're out of Ukraine.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.080]   Ukraine.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:55.080]   65% of our supplies of ultra pure neon used in etching for chip manufacture comes from
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.080]   a town.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.080]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.240]   A plant in Odessa.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.400]   It's a chemical plant though.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.800]   So presumably you could, it's not like they're mining the neon.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.480]   They're not taking it out of the run.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.640]   You have to make it, no, or filtering it out of the air.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:13.760]   You do actually have, it's a clean room facility process.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.520]   So you have to have, I can't remember.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.920]   It's a complicated process.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.200]   You don't just like pop these up overnight, but yes, you don't, I don't think they might
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.600]   have, they just purify it.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.360]   Yeah, so, but you could have a neon factory built elsewhere in time.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:32.120]   It just might be one more of those shortages we've been suffering.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.120]   Wow, I didn't see.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.200]   Yeah, that's the point.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.680]   This is why we miss Stacy, what you doing here?
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.680]   Tada!
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.360]   Weird news about semiconductors.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.560]   There actually, I put some semiconductor news in here just for you, Stacy.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.560]   You'll be glad to know.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.560]   Aww.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:52.880]   But let's start with Ukraine and how tech is responding to it.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.160]   And there's so many stories.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.760]   Of course, the most interesting person in all of this is the Vice Prime Minister of
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:05.960]   Ukraine who has taken it upon himself, or maybe it's his portfolio, to tweet to all the tech
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.960]   companies.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:07.960]   Oh yeah.
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:13.200]   Michelo Fedorov, Washington Post just had a profile.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.200]   He's on him.
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:21.200]   He's the first president of the United States to be a president of the United States.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.200]   He's a president of the United States.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.200]   He's a president of the United States.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.200]   He's a president of the United States.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.200]   He's a president of the United States.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.200]   He's a president of the United States.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.200]   He's a president of the United States.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.200]   He's a president of the United States.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.200]   He's a president of the United States.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.200]   He's a president of the United States.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.200]   He's a president of the United States.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.520]   He shut down the App Store in Russia.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.720]   And on Tuesday, yesterday, Apple responded and did so.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:56.200]   Cut off all sales, paused all product sales, shut down the App Store, and shut down.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.600]   And this is partly due to the bank shutdowns in Russia.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:04.880]   The ability to use Apple Pay, Google did the same with Google Pay in Russia.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.760]   And I've seen pictures of people queuing, mass crowds queuing at the subway stations,
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.760]   because they couldn't get in with their touch to pay devices.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.760]   You didn't cash, and you can't get cash either.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.760]   Yeah, yeah, because the ATMs are run.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:22.760]   So he's 31 years old, and he's...
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.760]   It's been really interesting.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.760]   I shouldn't really even laugh at this, but his Twitter account has become, you know,
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:34.760]   the place, you know, where, you know, Ukraine comes to Silicon Valley and says,
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:35.760]   "Please help us.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.760]   Let's see what the latest are."
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.760]   Starlink, "Many thanks to Elon Musk.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:46.760]   Starlink keeps our cities connected and emergency saving services saving lives."
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:47.760]   And now we need generators.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.760]   I think Elon was doing that.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.760]   As a thank you.
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.760]   And her to Elon Musk and his ego part.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.760]   And like, Elon was like, "I will send Starlink things."
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.760]   Like, "Do they not have satellite communications?"
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.760]   I was trying to find a tweet from Brianna Wu.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.760]   She's been kind of the counter.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.760]   Yeah, the counter to this.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:14.760]   Some have pointed out that Russian military is very good at tag, using satellite links as
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.760]   targets so that the terminals for Starlink might not be the most...
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.760]   You've got to keep moving.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.760]   If that counts.
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:24.760]   I was supposed to confirm that yesterday on Macbreak Weekly because apparently he had been
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:31.760]   doing a stream in Turkey and using Starlink, and they did in fact have to move regularly
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:36.760]   to avoid being shut down.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:37.760]   Letters to the satellites.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.760]   Yes, because I'm a little bit of a good person.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.760]   "Congratulations, SAP and Oracle for their support again."
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:48.760]   This is Fedorov earlier thanking them for the blockade.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.760]   This is really an interesting way to...
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.760]   I mean, I can't remember this ever happening before.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:55.760]   Pressure.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:00.760]   Yeah, to put pressure on big business.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.760]   Use Twitter for it.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.760]   There also crypto.
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.760]   It's been a big thing for crypto, both on both sides.
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.760]   Some crypto exchanges have refused to shut down in Russia.
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.760]   That seems to be...
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:17.760]   Maybe it's one of the only ways you can move money in Russia these days.
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.760]   But others have sent...
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.760]   There's been I think 30 million in cryptocurrency sent to Ukraine.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.760]   So it's an interesting...
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.760]   I kind of understand how if your crypto exchange,
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.760]   the whole reason you do crypto is so that there's no centralised...
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.760]   No politics involved.
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.760]   But this puts you in an interesting position.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.760]   The world is turning against Russia.
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:51.760]   I'm really curious to hear what you all think about whether or not YouTube should take down RT as one example of...
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.760]   I don't think you should...
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:58.760]   Yes, RT is government propaganda, but it's also a huge source of news for people.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.760]   It's a huge source of news for people.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.760]   I don't think you should...
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.760]   They demonetise them.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.760]   Google has blocked RT and other official channels from earning ad money,
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.760]   which seems at least the least you could hear.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.760]   But yeah, YouTube's been getting some criticism.
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.760]   Well, they're taking it down and they're taking it down in Europe.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.760]   They took down RT and Sputnik in Europe, but it's still in the US.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:23.760]   And if you go to RT, which I do a couple times a day to see what insanity they're spreading,
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.760]   it's a YouTube player at RT.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:33.760]   Now RT could surely have a Russian-made player of some sort, but it's on YouTube.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.760]   It's on YouTube servers.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:36.760]   Oh, boy.
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:37.760]   That's interesting.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.760]   What does RT say?
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.760]   I mean, is it...
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.760]   Oh, so they had a couple things.
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:52.760]   They were playing a lot of documentaries, Eric quotes, about Ukrainian new atrocities in the Don Boston.
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.760]   Motivators didn't come in.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.760]   They were on pure Putin propaganda.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:58.760]   Oh, it's pure Putin propaganda.
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.760]   The big thing is this.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:04.760]   The big thing I just heard the argument before I came on the show that they make,
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:09.760]   which is that evil America, it's all evil America.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:18.760]   Evil America manipulated Ukraine into this position so that we could then fight with Russia.
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:19.760]   Oh, boy.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:20.760]   A proxy war.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.760]   A proxy fight.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.760]   That's how evil and awful this is.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:25.760]   It's our fault.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:26.760]   We did this.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.760]   It's an American war.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:29.760]   Even though we didn't...
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.760]   He was at the US.
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:31.760]   This is from the Hill.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:36.760]   Russia says, "Metta and Google should be held responsible for inciting the war."
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.760]   Oh, yeah, it's their fault.
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:45.760]   So everybody accuses them of doing everything on every side of every fight.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.760]   Russia State Communications also demanded tech companies stop discriminating against
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.760]   Russian media in Europe.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:53.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:54.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:55.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:56.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:58.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:59.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:00.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:01.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:02.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:03.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:04.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:06.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:07.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:13.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:15.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:19.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:25.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.760]   I'm not sure what it is.

[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:47.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:48.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:49.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:50.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:55.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:58.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:01.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:03.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:04.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:05.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:06.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:08.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:09.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:11.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:12.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:14.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:15.760]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:21.400]   Google has kind of modified Google Maps early on.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:26.080]   We talked about the professor who with his students predicted the invasion like 12 or
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:31.800]   13 hours earlier because Google Maps showed traffic blockages and road closures.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:35.080]   It was pretty clear that that was because of the invasion.
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:41.840]   Google is now blocking edits that it claims may have been used to coordinate Russian airstrikes.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.840]   So it goes both ways, doesn't it?
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.040]   It's also amazing.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.840]   Russia counts on Google Maps for an attack.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:50.840]   I mean, geez.
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:51.840]   These are free resources.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:52.840]   Why not?
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:54.840]   They've.
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:55.840]   We all.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:57.840]   I mean, think about it.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.840]   You can just send out your soldiers with their smartphones and it's already loaded.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.840]   You're like, boom.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.000]   Everybody log into this leak.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.720]   According to some, Russia's military is adding specific pins to Google Maps to keep track
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:16.760]   of where they're going to attack with missiles, where their trucks are.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:20.280]   It's like we're planning a vacation.
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.680]   They're planning an invasion.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:26.040]   I mean, it's literally the same process that you use with your buds.
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.400]   Google says we some of these edits go back a while.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:34.040]   So we can't say all of them are due to the Russian military, but out of an abundance of
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:39.600]   caution, we are removing user contributions like photos, videos, reviews and business information
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:44.560]   and all users submitted places from Google Maps in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus since
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:48.760]   the invasion began and are temporarily blocking new edits.
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:52.240]   So basically just presenting the facts of this is the map.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:23:01.720]   You're not going to let end users modify these maps for any good reason.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.440]   Wikipedia has also been a battle, Greg.
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.440]   Big article.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.280]   It's nice to see an article about Wikipedia every once in a while.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.840]   But forget how important Wikipedia is.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.400]   - Wikipedia donations, folks.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.800]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:20.200]   And of course, Wikipedia in Ukraine and Russia as well as in the US has been struggling with
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.480]   how to cover the invasion.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:28.520]   They want to, of course, one of the things Wikipedia does very well is cover at current
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:29.520]   news events.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.520]   I don't know if people know that.
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.280]   It's a really good news source.
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.280]   - Did not know that.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.280]   - Yeah.
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.280]   - Oh, man.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.760]   They know when someone famous has died before the internet happened.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.760]   - I know it is.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.040]   - This article from Slate, how the Russian invasion of Ukraine is playing out on English
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:47.160]   Ukrainian and what Russian Wikipedia talks about big editorial battles.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:53.000]   It started years ago when the decision to use the word "Kiev" instead of Kiev was hotly
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.720]   debated.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:24:01.040]   Back starting in 2003, Kiev is the Russian pronunciation of the capital of Ukraine.
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.040]   - It's actually Kiev.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.040]   It's still two syllables.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:07.200]   There's a pronounceer I put in the rundown there.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.200]   - Kiev, thank you.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:13.760]   - Kiev is the Ukrainian language version of it.
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.480]   And so a nationalist Ukrainian nationalist state, and I'll call us Kiev.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.320]   That's what the Ruskis call us.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.320]   There's...
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.320]   - Oh, wow.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:27.760]   - ... barely two decades, Wikipedia editors debated the changing of the spelling with 50,000
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:31.440]   words on arguments and discussions about the issue.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:38.400]   But it was in 2014 after the Russian invasion of Crimea, Kiev.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.400]   - Kiev.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.400]   - Kiev.
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.880]   Leo, seriously.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.400]   The audio is for fun, it's interesting.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.400]   I think.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.880]   Go to line 49.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:46.880]   - Okay.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.880]   - Kyi.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:48.880]   Kyi.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:49.880]   - Kyi.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.880]   Because an innocent cooper say Kiev.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.960]   - They're all saying Kyi.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.960]   - And then he said Kyi, the next day.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.960]   - Right.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.640]   - And here is how you say it according to...
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.640]   - Still two syllables for them.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:03.040]   - Kyi and on TikTok, I presume she's Ukrainian, yeah?
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.280]   How to say it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.120]   - How to spell Ukrainian's capital?
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.520]   Well, this is how you spell it.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:11.520]   - Kyi.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.520]   - And it's not Kiev.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.960]   Kiev is Russian spelling and pronunciation.
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:16.960]   - Koo-yew.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:17.960]   - Koo-yew.
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:18.960]   - That's how it's...
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.960]   - Koo-yew.
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:20.960]   - Koo-yew.
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:21.960]   - Koo-yew.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:22.960]   - Koo-yew.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:23.960]   - Koo-yew.
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:24.960]   - Koo-yew.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:25.960]   - Koo-yew.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:26.960]   - I got a lot of practice to do.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:27.960]   - Koo-yew.
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:28.960]   - Koo-yew.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.280]   - But you can see how you get there to an American here.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.280]   - Koo-yew.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.280]   - Koo-yew.
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.480]   - It was reduced to one syllable, so kiv.
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.480]   No, kiv.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.480]   - Of course.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.480]   - But wouldn't it be kiv?
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.480]   - Koo-yew.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.480]   - Koo-yew.
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.480]   - No wonder people say kiv.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.480]   - Kiv.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.480]   - Wow.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.480]   - Yeah.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.480]   - I need a lot of practice on that.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.480]   - Yeah, it's not easy.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.560]   - And if you say that, people don't go, "What are you talking about?"
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.120]   So you gotta choose one or the other.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.120]   Kiv or kiv.
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.120]   - No, I get it.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.120]   - No, kiv.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.120]   - Kiv.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.120]   - Kiv.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.120]   - Kiv.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.240]   - A position to educate people, do you?
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.140]   - Yeah, should we?
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:01.760]   Okay, we should be the people who say it, right?
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.580]   - Key youth.
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:03.420]   - Yeah, Key youth.
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.280]   - Yeah, that should be our goal.
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.220]   - Say it again.
[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:05.980]   - Key youth.
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:06.800]   - Key youth.
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:07.640]   - Key youth.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:08.440]   - Key youth.
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.480]   - Key youth.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.320]   - Key youth.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.240]   (both laughing)
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.880]   - Alright, I found our Super cut for the episode.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:14.780]   - Yeah, it is.
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.420]   (both laughing)
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:19.420]   - Instagram has responded.
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.240]   Met has responded in many different ways,
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:26.280]   but Met is rolling out encrypted DMs in Russia and Ukraine,
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.680]   and they're demoting Russian state media worldwide on Facebook.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.320]   So Nick Kleg announced the new features yesterday,
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.720]   saying Instagram will be giving users notices
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.160]   when they can switch to encrypted chats.
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.040]   Of course, what's app has already been encrypted
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:40.800]   as his Facebook messenger,
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.040]   but now it's available also on Instagram.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.480]   - For both Ukraine and Russia?
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.000]   'Cause the good, the dissidents there need it.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.560]   - Yes.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.480]   Well, honestly, more and more, I'm feeling like
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.360]   the only real way out of this is for
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.680]   Russians to rise up against Putin and depose him.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.240]   - Yeah, and that seems like a great strategy for them.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.160]   - Well, what else?
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.400]   - Just like, it's like saying,
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.560]   hey, you gotta get rid of Stalin and you're like,
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.960]   yeah, thanks, that'll help.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:12.360]   - I know, but well, I mean, otherwise, if he's untouchable,
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.600]   - I think the best, the best commentator by far
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.920]   in my view is Julie Ioffe,
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.040]   who I think is just, is a stunning mind.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.240]   - Are you glad you subscribed to the Fox now?
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.080]   - I did, I did.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.240]   - I was just saying it's on Puck.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.680]   - Yeah, it's on Puck.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.440]   - So she said,
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:30.360]   Moscow is the grand exception.
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.800]   In Moscow, Putin is surrounded by his,
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.680]   the people can't stand him, but you go outside,
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.080]   you go into the heartland of Russia.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:36.920]   - They love him.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.000]   - They're watching TV. - Oh, boy.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.480]   - They're watching RT, you know,
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.960]   the home grown equivalents, and it's different.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.040]   So Moscow, say, Petersburg, yeah,
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.520]   you could see protests against Putin.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.320]   You could see some angry oligarchs who were losing their
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:55.760]   yachts, one just got taken by Germany, a big one,
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.360]   but they know where their bread is buttered,
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.880]   so they're not gonna fight that much.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.800]   I agree, Leo, I'd like to see that,
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.120]   but Stacy's right too, that's us wishing somebody
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.840]   to put themselves in danger.
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.880]   Mothers and their children were jailed for holding signs
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.880]   that just said no war.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.720]   Children.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.240]   - They let the children out, I believe.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.360]   - But.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.320]   - 'Cause, you know, you don't wanna be,
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.720]   like, putting children in cages.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.040]   - Oh, no, that's so bad.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.280]   - That's right, yeah, we're done with it when you're that.
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.880]   - And that's just terrible.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.640]   - Even Putin wouldn't do that.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:34.040]   Let's see, what other stories here.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:39.360]   I wonder, now I might say this,
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.440]   the story about Birdwatch for later,
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:43.680]   'cause it's more than just about Ukraine,
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.320]   but it's interesting, this was about a year ago,
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.080]   Twitter announced this fact-checking,
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.000]   but done by users.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:51.840]   - Oh yeah.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.160]   - But I just got a Birdwatch,
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.600]   I just got a Birdwatch related to Ukraine.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.440]   - Did you?
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.440]   - Supposedly they were not doing it,
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.280]   and I think they were figuring it out, I just got one.
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.480]   - Part of the problem with Birdwatch
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.320]   is there aren't a whole lot of volunteers,
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.880]   only a few hundred.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.280]   - Yeah, I'm one, but.
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.760]   - Washington Post analysis of data
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.920]   that Twitter publishes on Birdwatch
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.960]   said that contributors were flagging about 43 tweets a day
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:19.440]   in 2022 before the invasion of Ukraine.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.280]   - That's nothing.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:25.640]   - Although the number went up to 156 last week.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.160]   So, but still that's nothing.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.440]   - Still a low number.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.440]   - Total flow.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.280]   - Yeah.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:34.760]   Yeah, 359 contributors, that's all.
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:39.760]   So, Birdwatch, maybe not the success Twitter was hoping
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.920]   it would be, but it's just one of a lot of things
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.720]   Twitter's trying out.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.080]   EA is eliminating Russian soccer teams from FIFA.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:52.040]   It's a soccer title and.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.800]   - That's a verse to Russia, you are dead to us.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.640]   - Wow, wow.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:02.920]   Yeah, so the tech community's responding in that way,
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.200]   which is really interesting.
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:10.880]   Reddit has shut down or quarantined
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.320]   the Russia subreddit/rrush.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.440]   - Russia, Russia, Russia. - @mssinformation.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:18.280]   DuckDuckGo, which used Yandex for some of its
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.960]   non-news searches.
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.240]   - Well, that's right.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.520]   - Has paused its relationship with Yandex.
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:25.520]   - Yeah, oops.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:29.680]   - Yandex is the Russian Google, basically.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:35.080]   - Well, there was a story, I got into a Twitter
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.040]   tussle about it, but it was the New York Times,
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.040]   the Washington Post, and the story.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:40.360]   I don't think we did it last week.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:44.280]   Where the quality of search results
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:45.800]   on a certain number of test things,
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.320]   I think it was the New York Times did it,
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.400]   was far, far, far better on Google,
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.120]   than both DuckDuckGo and Bing.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.360]   - Interesting.
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:56.080]   They had a lot of disinformation sites in there.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.160]   - I think Google leaps into action, don't they,
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.760]   when something like this happens,
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.240]   and they have the staff to do it.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.920]   - They also talk about it, I remember after 2016,
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.880]   they called a bunch of people, me included,
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.680]   with their search quality people just saying,
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.480]   "What do we do? What do you think we ought to do here?"
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.160]   Not that they were gonna listen necessarily,
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.160]   but they wanted to gain opinions from elsewhere,
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.440]   and they're smart, and they think it through.
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:21.600]   - That is, in more of a resource advantage,
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.400]   you look at what Google has from all of their staff
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.280]   that they can pull in and can pay fairly well,
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:30.160]   versus something like this Yandex or DuckDuckGo,
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.200]   that's usually just a bit of community volunteers,
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.280]   it's doing that amongst other things.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.680]   - Yeah, but I think, and it's interesting to me,
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.160]   that the MXB in Russian,
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:45.160]   if DuckDuckGo was using a Russian source,
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:48.560]   that's an issue, sourcing, so it's, yes.
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:49.400]   - Oh, oh.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.840]   - You're right, it's how much do you write things
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.480]   to try to get rid of bad stuff?
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.320]   - Yeah.
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:57.920]   - That's very intensive in resource,
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.800]   but whom you choose to use as sources,
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.560]   I'm about to fund full disclosure money from Facebook,
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:04.680]   but none of that comes to me,
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.480]   but it comes to school.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.800]   A project with Wikipedia,
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.280]   what you haven't talked about it yet,
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:13.920]   but Wikipedia has tremendous discussion
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:17.440]   and thus data on the credibility of sourcing.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:22.440]   So sourcing alone, I think, doesn't require the kind of
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.600]   write the UI to get rid of the bad stuff,
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:29.600]   but it does say, who should we trust to serve to our users?
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.520]   That doesn't require--
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.800]   - No, it's not just a question of trust,
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.800]   I mean, these are financial relationships,
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:40.360]   so DuckDuckGo can contract with certain other companies
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.560]   to bring in search results.
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:47.560]   And Yandex may be great at a large number of searches
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:51.200]   and we don't necessarily know how they use it.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.640]   I mean, it's theoretically possible
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:57.640]   that you could say any search involving math or physics,
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:01.720]   open it up to the following options,
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:05.600]   or you could shut that down in case of,
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:09.360]   I'm just theorizing here, but the point is,
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:12.480]   you can't, not all of your sources are gonna be golden.
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:15.000]   You know, even as a reporter, I talk to people
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.160]   and I'm like, after I talk to them, I'm like,
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.520]   "You know what, I don't think you're actually
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.760]   that smart about this topic.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.160]   This doesn't jive with anything else,
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.240]   so I'm gonna pull you out of this story."
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.440]   And I don't think it's crazy to think
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.080]   that they'll have these relationships
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.800]   and have to evaluate them when some--
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.040]   - Yandex was seen as an alternative source,
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.600]   you know, 20 or 15 years ago,
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.680]   but now I just searched for Ukraine on Yandex.
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.680]   Third site is RRT.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.960]   Looks like about the sixth site is TAS.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.320]   What do you expect?
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.240]   - That's why they pulled that.
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:51.000]   Yeah, that's why they pulled their search results.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.640]   - But what was being served up over the last,
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:57.520]   you know, since 2014 in the invasion of Crimea?
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:59.520]   - And you were saying it was non-news.
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:00.840]   They used it for non-news,
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:03.720]   so they were aware of this obviously, this particular--
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.880]   - Let me look up the geography of Eastern Europe.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.880]   You know, what was the name?
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.680]   - No, no, but they may not just use Yandex,
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:15.880]   they may consolidate those results with Bing and--
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:16.880]   - Well, Bing was trouble too.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.280]   - I was trying to change it and I can't think of it.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.200]   Well, yes.
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:22.560]   - Lot of tech companies, as we've mentioned before,
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.000]   in Ukraine, it was a big tech area.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.080]   A lot of companies hired tech staff in Ukraine.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.920]   And there are, of course, Ukrainian companies.
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.320]   One of our sponsors, Grammarly,
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.920]   is the Ukrainian company.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.440]   Yeah, I didn't know that.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.360]   They have headquarters in the US,
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:42.480]   but it was founded by two Ukraine's and Ukrainians
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.440]   and still has a lot of technical staff there.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.840]   I love Luminar, we talked about this.
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:49.680]   - Skylem.
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:51.280]   - Skylem is a Ukrainian company.
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.640]   In fact, if you go to skilom.com,
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:54.120]   they're a big banner at the top.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.200]   In support of Ukraine.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.560]   Wix, I didn't know this, Wix,
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.880]   which is an Israeli company,
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.080]   is of course the website building company,
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.840]   had a thousand Ukrainian employees.
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.240]   They've been-- - They mobilized--
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.160]   - And they've been more sales staff,
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.080]   'cause you sell Wix ads everywhere.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.840]   (laughing)
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:13.160]   - Actually, mostly developers.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.520]   We were able to give it a half a map,
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.960]   but of course, as you know,
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:19.280]   Ukraine has said, no one, military age,
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.520]   which goes all the way up to 60. - With mail, there'll be 60.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:24.040]   - Right? - Yeah, could leave
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:28.200]   the country, but they were able to get about 500
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.960]   of their employees and their families out.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.680]   Wix had about 30 of its Lithuanian employees
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.800]   volunteered to drive 600 miles
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.800]   to the border of Poland to collect people.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:41.680]   They picked up workers, set them up for the night
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:44.080]   to rest before the trip to Krakow,
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.720]   provided them with food and blankets and stuff.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.800]   Of the 500 employees who remain in Ukraine,
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:53.080]   195 are in areas considered to be dangerous,
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:58.080]   according to Wix, so they're still trying to get people out.
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.720]   Microsoft has a big tech team in Ukraine.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:05.040]   The video doorbell company Ring has a bunch of developers
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:08.360]   in Ukraine, Ubisoft, Snap,
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:12.160]   all doing what they can to protect workers in Ukraine.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.880]   Tampa-based software outsourcing company JetBridge
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.480]   said it has been struggling with the logistics of getting
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:20.880]   its 24 developers out of Kuev.
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.040]   - Kuev. - Kuev.
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.040]   - Kuev. - Kuev.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:27.400]   - Sorry, but we gotta put the U in there.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.160]   - It has also, this is interesting,
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:32.800]   started paying employees in Belarus in Bitcoin.
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:37.640]   So this is Ukraine's a birthplace.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.640]   - That's not gonna go well. - I know.
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:44.200]   You remember, what was it, face-replace?
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.960]   That face-replace software, face-redue?
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.600]   Anyway, that was in Ukraine.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.320]   Luxorri, which is a company Snap bought to help with
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:56.320]   the augmented reality stuff, 300 team members in Ukraine.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:59.680]   Snap would not say how many are still there,
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:01.680]   exciting safety concerns.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:05.280]   They have the dads running in Russia, Belarus, in Ukraine,
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.240]   and stop sales to all Russian entities.
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:12.240]   Ubisoft has provided Ukrainian team members additional funds
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:15.000]   to help cover the costs of travel and relocation.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.800]   So I guess you're probably lucky if you worked for
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:20.800]   a US tech company or a Western tech company in Ukraine.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.880]   Microsoft, which has employees in Ukraine and Russia,
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.960]   says it's monitoring the situation
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:28.160]   and focused on supporting its workers in the region.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:33.840]   That's the other thing that's different,
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.840]   is how global society is these days.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.160]   - Mm-hmm. - And so,
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:42.520]   this has really felt everywhere.
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:44.760]   It's just a really interesting story.
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.560]   I'm gonna move on unless there's any other,
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:50.000]   I mean, I have many, many, many more.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   - Can I just mention one thing? - Sure.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.800]   - I'd like to put an plug for the Kiv,
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.080]   Kiv, independent.com.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:00.840]   So there was a site called Kiv Post,
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.240]   where it was bought by an oligarch of sorts,
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.720]   a small, a mini oligarch,
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:07.760]   and he shut it down and the entire staff left
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.120]   and started Kiv Independent.
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:14.320]   And it is phenomenal, phenomenal brave journalism,
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:19.160]   including an alum from my school, Igor Kossov,
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.680]   whose class of 2009,
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:23.400]   is reporting there bravely.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.880]   I go in every morning now,
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:29.720]   and just that news feed on the left is an unbelievable
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:33.880]   collection of the journalism that they've done
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.600]   and curated as well.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.680]   They're brave, they're in the midst of this,
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.160]   they're reporting from around the country.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:42.160]   You can donate to them.
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:47.160]   I have through Patreon or whatever's the other one they have,
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:52.680]   go fund me, and they're doing phenomenal work.
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:55.400]   And so if you wanna know what's going on in Kiv
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:39:00.120]   and in Ukraine, I recommend them highly.
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.960]   There's other things too, there's Euromydon press.
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:06.600]   And by the way, the other thing that I wanna mention
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:10.000]   real quickly is the wonder of Google Translate.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.920]   So the day of the invasion, I went to Helsinki, Sonomat,
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.280]   the major newspaper in Finland,
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:20.280]   which thank bless them is open, we're not paywalled.
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:24.560]   And phenomenal coverage, just like they went to four historians
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.960]   to get perspective, something we don't do
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.680]   in American journalism.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:30.720]   And Google Translate is amazing
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.480]   with one of the most complicated languages on earth.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.600]   And it really gives you another perspective
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.080]   of what's happening to go around from Estonia
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:43.080]   to Finland to Hungary, well, Hungary, not so good,
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.480]   but elsewhere.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:47.480]   So changing your news diet around the whole
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:49.040]   of the web at a time like this,
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:52.280]   but getting from the source, I think is so important.
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:56.960]   - Just fascinating how technology changes all of this.
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:57.800]   - Oh.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.120]   - Dramatically.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.840]   In a way, I don't feel like we've seen this before.
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.240]   - Nope.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.560]   - It's also a little disconcerting
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:08.920]   because you go to a place like the Kiv Independent
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:12.480]   and they have fun things to do this weekend.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.320]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.280]   - It's like, what?
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.280]   (laughs)
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.040]   - They kind of didn't get rid of that part of the page.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:18.880]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.400]   - But I think that's what's so weird about it
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.400]   and what's so kind of disorienting about it.
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.040]   - Only a week ago, that's what they cared about.
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:26.960]   Only a week ago.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.440]   - Yeah.
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:29.360]   All right, let's take a little break.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.760]   We have lots more to talk about.
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:34.080]   It's great to have Stacey back and Pruitt's in the studio.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:37.400]   We actually tried to get people to come back to work.
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.640]   You know, the mask mandates are over in our area.
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:40.480]   - Yep.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.480]   - We had a pizza party and no one showed up.
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.320]   - And pizza missed Lisa.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:45.880]   - There was like, no, it was like,
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.400]   there's all these pizzas in the other room
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.240]   'cause no one--
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:49.240]   - No, there's not.
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.080]   - Oh, they're gone?
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.280]   (laughs)
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.880]   Oh, that was before Hank got here.
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:53.720]   - No, there are.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:54.640]   - It's like, stay home.
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.200]   I've got pizza for dinner tonight.
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.880]   - There are no pizzas here.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.560]   (laughs)
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.720]   - Okay, good to know.
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.880]   - Is the coffee machine there still after?
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.040]   - No comment on the coffee either.
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.400]   - And to his credit is one of the guys
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.360]   who's continually kind of come in.
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.440]   You do floss every Wednesday morning
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:13.480]   and you've been a presence around here,
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:14.320]   which is nice.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.160]   I always like seeing your face.
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.000]   - Likewise.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.800]   - No one that, you know, life goes on a little bit.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.520]   But, you know, in two weeks,
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.360]   this will be the second anniversary
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.720]   of when we shut the whole place down.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:23.840]   - It was a little weird though
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:27.120]   because I came in today and then realized,
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.760]   oh, I'm gonna be on Twig in studio.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.280]   Oh crap, I forgot my laptop.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.160]   - So to go back home.
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.520]   You can always borrow one of mine.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.880]   - Oh, I thought you'd forgotten your t-shirt.
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:37.720]   - Or your pants.
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.280]   - Or really you're not quite so dressed up.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.560]   - Well, I brought my shirt.
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:43.080]   I remember to bring the shirt, you know.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:43.920]   - You look great.
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:44.760]   - Thank you.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:45.920]   (laughs)
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.840]   - Jeff and I are both wearing like black sweats shirt.
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:50.640]   - So that's the way to go.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.200]   - I hope I'm not telling anything out of school,
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:56.040]   but yesterday before Mac break weekly,
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:59.200]   the camera, Andy's camera was on and he got up
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.640]   and I think he was, I don't know,
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.600]   unless he's taken up golf lately,
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.200]   I think he's wearing jammies.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:05.040]   (laughs)
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:09.440]   - He was a normal shirt, but you know,
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.640]   the very bright big plaid, I don't know.
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.480]   Maybe that's what he wears.
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.120]   - He rolls, that's his style.
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:16.120]   - Maybe it is, yeah.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:20.720]   Life has changed, it's changing so fast.
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.440]   It's very interesting.
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.800]   And the way that's kind of what we cover.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.800]   And so, this is our beat.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.000]   - I want video chat room.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:28.840]   I want video of that.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:29.880]   (laughs)
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.280]   - It's somewhere, you know,
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:33.120]   probably is on the Twipless feed in our Google Web.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:34.360]   - Yeah, just watch that.
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.720]   - That's definitely a preview.
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.640]   - Yeah, I don't love it.
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.400]   - This episode of This Week in Google today
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:44.360]   brought to you by HPE GreenLake,
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:49.040]   orchestrated by the experts at CDW.
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.440]   If you're in business, you know yesterday's infrastructure
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.320]   is not gonna help you meet the demands
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.720]   of tomorrow's innovation.
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.480]   And that now more than ever,
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:59.720]   you have to adapt quickly to change.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:03.120]   The consumption-oriented model of public cloud
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:05.360]   has revolutionized our organizations.
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.200]   Think about infrastructure.
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.120]   And organizations are now demanding the speed
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.440]   and agility of a public cloud experience.
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:14.720]   But many workloads remain on-prem
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.800]   due to complicated legacy applications
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:20.080]   and issues with data sovereignty and compliance.
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:21.960]   And of course, let's not forget,
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.640]   you know, the seriousness of migrating
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.040]   sensitive data to the cloud.
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.080]   IT is caught right in the middle of it,
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:29.080]   trying to satisfy the demand
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:30.760]   and the growth of the organization
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:33.960]   while struggling to manage disparate data.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:35.360]   And of course, as always,
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:37.200]   you gotta do it all within budget.
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.680]   Well, I got an answer for you.

[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:37.520]   for supporting this week in Google this week.
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:41.120]   I don't know if it's a big story or not,
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:45.400]   Epic Games just acquired Bandcamp.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:50.400]   It's a music...
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.960]   Alaino, a lot of people use it.
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:54.160]   It's like the home of all of the high-risk players.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:55.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:56.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:46:01.120]   So, Epic, of course, is a gaming company.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.640]   So it's kind of unclear.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:08.120]   Epic says they want to build a creator marketplace ecosystem
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:10.960]   based on fair and open platforms.
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:14.120]   Bandcamp will still run at Stanielon Store and Community,
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:17.880]   co-founder Ether.ethan Diamond will continue to lead the operations.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:22.000]   We don't know how much money changed hands,
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:28.280]   nor when the merger or acquisition will happen or be finalized.
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.600]   It's very interesting.
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:32.520]   Epic has been kind of buying up some interesting stuff.
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:35.600]   Epic is, of course, the home of Fortnite.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:38.160]   They made a lot of money on Fortnite.
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.720]   Tim Sweeney, their founder, I think,
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:42.920]   made $7 billion in 2020 on Fortnite alone.
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:45.320]   Does this make sense for them?
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:49.200]   Well, clearly, they're trying to do something new.
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:51.280]   I think one of the things they learned with Fortnite
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:55.720]   is there's a brisk economy,
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:56.920]   has nothing to do with buying the game.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:01.000]   The game was free, but in the creative stuff.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.720]   So they have bought art station,
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.880]   they bought cubic motion, they bought sketch fab.
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:11.720]   So they're buying these kind of tools for creators.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.240]   Epic does-- Yeah.
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:13.960]   It's interesting.
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:20.520]   I think it's a smart idea because I think a lot of the web has been--
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:22.440]   we see this kind of-- I don't even know what this is.
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:25.640]   So huge amounts of money are made on consumption.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:27.880]   So we start with consumption models.
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.400]   We start consuming things.
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:32.120]   And then people get comfortable with that
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:35.000]   and start building things and creating things around whatever
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.120]   they have been consuming.
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:38.280]   Think about it just like Fanvik, right?
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:42.360]   This is the equivalent for other types of Fanvik.
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:46.120]   So creating little videos or TikToks or songs
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:49.560]   for your around your favorite roles or characters.
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:52.040]   I mean-- They're not worried about the entire--
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:53.080]   They go on another route.
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:57.880]   Well, and historically, when companies--
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:01.960]   you know, when the railroads thought they were in the railroad business,
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:03.800]   they had trouble.
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:06.120]   They didn't understand they were in the transportation.
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:08.440]   Right? That's the old story.
[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:10.680]   So I think it's sensible for a tech company.
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:12.920]   You know, in this case, a gaming company to say,
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.200]   well, what really is our business?
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:19.080]   Is it making games or is it providing a marketplace for creators?
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:20.840]   And there are a lot of people saying, oh, that's it.
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:21.320]   I'm out of here.
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.960]   I'm a bandcamp user.
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:27.000]   But I noticed in the comments on this story,
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:32.200]   somebody pointing out in the past when Epic has purchased other companies,
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:36.040]   they've usually cut the commission in half or more.
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:36.760]   Oh boy.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:39.080]   Epic, remember, is the company that sued Apple
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:41.480]   over their 30% take in the app store.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:45.160]   So they have to walk the walk as well as talking the talk.
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:47.800]   So it could be very good for a bandcamp.
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.880]   Or at least creators on bandcamp.
[00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:50.360]   It could be a--
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:57.160]   Bandcamp says they've paid a billion more than a billion dollars to artists.
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:58.920]   So far.
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:48:59.800]   That's very interesting.
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.920]   I think it's also kind of a Gen Z strategy.
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:07.480]   I don't know if it's because they're young or because they've grown up digitally
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:09.000]   or they don't have real jobs.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:17.160]   But I mean, my daughter and her friends, they are way more creative or more interested in
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:22.440]   creating things and sharing them digitally in ways that, again, they're young.
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:25.480]   So maybe it hasn't been beaten out of them yet.
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:29.400]   But I do think it's a very interesting Gen Z play, as it were.
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:32.520]   I see the same thing with the kids in my home.
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:35.400]   They're all about wanting to create this or that.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:39.640]   The boy bought a dad gum sewing machine too.
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:40.200]   Really?
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:40.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:40.920]   I mean--
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:41.560]   That's awesome.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:42.360]   Come on, do it.
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:42.840]   You want to see some of that?
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:43.160]   Right.
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:47.960]   So stuff and make this make up his own little design and then a little weirdo,
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:49.880]   my little niece, that's what I call her.
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:55.400]   She's been getting into graphic design and making just little digital art and stuff.
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:58.600]   So it's clearly the generational thing.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:49:59.000]   Kids.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.400]   I mean, humans are normally naturally creative.
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:05.160]   But I think if you don't beat it out of them at an early age,
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:08.760]   you're at a risk that they're going to be artists their whole life, which is great.
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:14.920]   He talks about watching videos of some of our of his friends back in Carolina.
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:18.920]   And even they're just out with this iPhone, smartphone or whatever,
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:24.360]   and just making videos of random stuff and turning it into stories just because they can.
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:25.000]   That's so cool.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.160]   That's how Anna Delvie starts.
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:29.640]   She was cutting out stuff out of Vogue magazine.
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.080]   Actually, maybe that's not the best exam.
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:35.800]   I couldn't resist.
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.720]   Hey, it can go a lot of different ways.
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:38.680]   A lot of different ways.
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:41.000]   There's a lot of creativity in being a con artist.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:41.800]   It's not easy.
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:44.040]   Can't stop watching that show.
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:47.240]   Oh, I'm down to the last episode.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:50.040]   I've been hearing good stuff on it.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:50.680]   It's fun.
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:51.800]   You know, it's just fun.
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:54.840]   I don't, you know, I don't have much to say about it except it's fun.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.960]   Stacey actually wrote an interesting piece.
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:02.120]   I thought this is kind of along the same lines of rethinking what it is your business is and
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:03.400]   how you make money.
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:07.160]   And traditionally in hardware businesses, they think, well, we send you, sell you the hardware.
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:08.360]   And that's how we make money.
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:10.440]   We, we mark it up and we make money that way.
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:15.960]   Apple's kind of pointed the way to, you know, they've practically saturated the market for
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:16.440]   iPhones.
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:21.160]   And so they decided to stop counting how many iPhones they sell and still count,
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:24.920]   instead of how much revenue they make per customer services.
[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:26.120]   Yeah, with services.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:26.680]   Rpoo.
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:31.400]   And, and so, and, and same thing for Microsoft, you know, Microsoft
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:35.320]   decided they didn't want to sell Windows in the office anymore.
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:37.400]   They, they want to, you know, sell you a subscription.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:42.520]   So Stacey, I thought this was very interesting, said, you know, the same thing may happen with
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:43.560]   hardware.
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:47.080]   Subscription is happening with harder hardware and
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:53.560]   what's happening is they're maturing their model from being like, you will pay a huge upfront
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:57.960]   price for the device for a smart device and then an ongoing subscription.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:02.200]   And they're actually just starting to think about wrapping everything into a subscription.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:07.880]   Probably the most sophisticated of this would be something like the Woop band, which is,
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:09.320]   you can't buy the band individually.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:10.760]   You just pay 30 bucks a month for.
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:11.400]   Yep.
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:17.400]   You get, you get the band, but you have to pay for the service and all the metrics and stuff.
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:18.280]   Did you like Woop?
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.000]   I think I did.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:19.080]   I did.
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:20.280]   Yeah, I did.
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:22.200]   I lost my battery.
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:24.440]   Why didn't I?
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:29.720]   I did not because, okay, my, my Woop at it still stands or reviews still stand.
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:32.120]   I'm just not hardcore enough for Woop.
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:32.600]   I love it.
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:33.160]   You got it.
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:34.120]   He's a hardcore.
[00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:35.080]   He's pretty hardcore.
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:35.640]   Exactly.
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:38.680]   It gave me everything I needed to know.
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:39.320]   What is it?
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:40.920]   Wait, is it an exercise band?
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:43.720]   You know, what, it basically just tracks your activity in the day.
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:46.520]   And I think they measured as a strain.
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:51.640]   And what I found was the more that I did just
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:58.920]   even if it was just moving gear around in the studio or whatever, that was part of the activity.
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:01.560]   Not just walking, not just going to the gym.
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:04.760]   You know, they took into effect a little bit of everything.
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:09.880]   And the more that I stayed on top of it, I slept better and felt better.
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:14.040]   And when I noticed that little bar was down in the yellow or red.
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:15.880]   30 bucks is never a lot though.
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:17.480]   It wasn't a expensive service.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:17.800]   For a month.
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.080]   It wasn't a expensive service.
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:23.400]   So it doesn't measure steps because steps are not hardcore.
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:23.800]   Right.
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:26.040]   It measures heart rate.
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:29.800]   It measures heart rate variability.
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:31.720]   And the thesis is, so they measure it.
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:36.200]   They take what Ant was talking about with strain and they combine that with recovery.
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:42.200]   And the idea is they do, depending on how well you sleep, you will get something saying,
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:47.080]   "Hey, you should go to this level of strain today because you've led."
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:53.080]   So it's those two forces counterbalancing and it's all based on your heart rate variability.
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:59.960]   Which is a research back biometric or bio indicator rather.
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:01.320]   Everybody does that now though.
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:02.520]   My Aura Ring does that.
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:03.960]   My Apple Watch does that.
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:05.160]   My Samsung watch does that.
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:06.280]   Everybody does that now.
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:07.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:10.360]   But that Woop was one of the first companies that did it.
[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:13.080]   And they actually, they really do.
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:16.120]   I will say when I tracked my stuff using Woop,
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:19.400]   it did really match with what I felt in my body.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.120]   Exactly.
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:22.120]   In a way that others do not.
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:23.000]   Yeah, that's for instance.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.080]   So the Aura Ring is, I think, not accurate.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:28.840]   I stopped worrying it because it didn't match my experience.
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:32.680]   If I woke up feeling a little bit groggy and I could check the analytics,
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:35.560]   basically tell you, "Yeah, you're going to feel like crap today."
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:36.840]   And it was right.
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:38.360]   I loved it.
[00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:38.920]   Mm-hmm.
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:42.840]   And again, I like how it just sort of gave me tips to say,
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:47.560]   "Hey, you need to step up your strain a little bit more by 20% today,
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:51.720]   and you should feel better with the next day and get better sleep tonight."
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:52.360]   And so forth.
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:54.840]   And it was spot on.
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:56.920]   You speak in the past tense here, Ant.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:59.000]   So you literally lost your battery and then you canceled it.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.840]   I lost the battery and I quit paying for the service.
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:01.960]   Because this is expensive.
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:04.120]   I got a lot of other bills.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:05.800]   So you have 30 bucks.
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:07.320]   30?
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:11.000]   It looks like if you're an athlete or you want to,
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:16.440]   if you really have a lot of spare income and you really want to maximize your productivity
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:20.680]   in terms of working out, this is a really good thing to have.
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:23.480]   But that doesn't describe a lot of people.
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:24.600]   No, it's not for most.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:25.640]   And I think I said that.
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:26.440]   I think I said it.
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:29.640]   It's not necessarily for the weekend warrior.
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:33.080]   This is for the the wind two dows of all about Android.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:38.360]   It's out there just crushing it with high intensity workouts on a regular basis.
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:40.200]   And she's wanting to know, all right,
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:43.240]   what do I need to do to keep this level of fitness?
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:47.320]   Probably no good for a man over 60.
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:50.200]   Actually, it would be really good.
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:51.560]   Maybe not this man over 60.
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:52.520]   It's good excuse me.
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:53.800]   Maybe not this man over 60.
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:58.920]   No, I mean, I really, because they had a thing called strain coach,
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:02.600]   which I thought was really helpful because I work out when I work out,
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:05.320]   I used to just go super hard like a crazy person.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:06.040]   But you don't know.
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:07.640]   You need the strain coach to tell you.
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:10.360]   Exactly. Because then I'd get sick.
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:13.320]   Like I'd be like the next day I'd be like totally wiped.
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:15.800]   And I was like, clearly I suck at figuring out how to work out.
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:20.440]   And it was very good for being like, calm the heck down, Stacy.
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:21.800]   And I'd be like, oh, thank you.
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:30.200]   It's funny because I have no idea how I feel or what I should do or anything.
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:32.520]   So it would be nice if somebody told me.
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:37.400]   You should not do anything today or you should do a lot.
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:38.440]   So it's expensive.
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:41.560]   Well, you get the first month free.
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:44.360]   So they'll send you a thing and you can try it out and see if you like it.
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:46.440]   I mean, it might be great.
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:49.000]   Does it ever tell you like this would be good time to take a nap?
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.760]   It does actually.
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:51.240]   Does it?
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:53.080]   Well, it doesn't say it's a good time.
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:57.160]   It would tell you like when you're in the red, it's like, hey, today you chill.
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:59.160]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:56:59.800]   That's what I was saying.
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:03.640]   The whole color code and thing with the red and yellow is usually
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:08.920]   bad sign that you need to slow down just a little bit and recuperate.
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:11.160]   You travel a lot.
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:11.800]   It's good.
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:16.360]   Like whoop, all of these things, you still pay for the hardware.
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:18.760]   It's not like they send you.
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:21.240]   They don't say the whoop band.
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:22.920]   So really, it's double dipping.
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:25.960]   It's there's charging for the heart like the or a ring.
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:27.560]   Same thing used to be just by the ring.
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:31.800]   Now you got to buy the $5 month subscription to get the most value out of it.
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:33.560]   And I see that more and more.
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:40.360]   We got those red barcode bed cover that changes temperature and keeps you cool and then warm.
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:42.600]   And you can just buy it.
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:43.640]   It's expensive.
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:48.520]   Or you can get for an additional monthly fee, the super duper coach,
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:50.600]   my Peloton bike doesn't even work.
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:52.200]   Does it help you put it on the right way, Leo?
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:53.560]   Oh, you heard that story.
[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:54.440]   You put it on the right way.
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:56.200]   That's on the right way now.
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:02.600]   So I think the point, the transition that's going to happen is in what whoop is good at,
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:06.200]   because they actually tell you, look, it's 30 bucks a month.
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:07.240]   It's really more than that.
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:07.800]   For six months.
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:10.440]   Hold on, you don't buy the band at front.
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:13.800]   So it's 30 bucks a month for however long you have it as long as you have it.
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:14.600]   Okay.
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:20.120]   Peloton CEO talked to the New York Times and he was saying that maybe we do like a cheaper
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:23.080]   upfront price in a slightly higher monthly price.
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:28.360]   So instead of spending $2,000 on the bike and then $39 a month for the subscription,
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:32.120]   you buy the bike for $500, which puts its mind.
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:33.560]   Sounds like a offense.
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:40.200]   I mean, it is a lot like your phone, but the idea is you're getting continual value
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:43.720]   on a long enough basis because it's smart.
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:47.560]   And I think this is good because this is an evolution of connected products.
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:53.000]   And if you build a connected product, it needs to have value to the user every day.
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:55.880]   So enough that they would be willing to pay for it.
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:59:00.840]   And I think if you don't charge them the full upfront price and it's more comparable with
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:07.160]   normal dumb products, then I think people won't feel as ripped off when they look at
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:08.760]   they try to evaluate these deals.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:09.560]   Can I ask you a question?
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:09.960]   Stay safe.
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:15.320]   So we saw with a remarkable, right, that they said, oh, this is included.
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:17.960]   And then the suddenly later they add a subscription.
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:22.520]   How much are you seeing that where when you buy it, you don't know what the deal is
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:23.560]   and the deal changes?
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:29.800]   That's pretty common because the company, I think it will become less common going forward
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:34.280]   because companies now are more sophisticated about saying, oh crap, I've got to keep a cloud
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:34.920]   connection.
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:35.400]   Right.
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:42.040]   Or the other thing is, oh crap, I can't sell enough of these in basically this hardware Ponzi scheme,
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:47.000]   where there's enough new users in that you can pay the funds to keep the other ones operational.
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:51.320]   So we're going to keep seeing that.
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:57.320]   The other thing that's influencing this is no matter how good you get about predicting and
[00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:03.320]   building in your cloud costs, VCs are not funding companies if they don't have recurring
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:03.640]   prices.
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:06.680]   Oh, they look at this and they're like, that's where the money comes from.
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:07.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:11.000]   Let's take this SaaS model to hardware.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:11.960]   We love this stuff.
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.800]   It's money and margin.
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:19.320]   So that's the two trends driving it. One, it used to be required and people weren't sophisticated
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.320]   enough to price it in early on.
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:24.200]   And now it's VCs are like, don't you leave that.
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:28.680]   I think of my owl car camera, right?
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:34.040]   Where they didn't charge a monthly fee, they had LTE built in and all this stuff.
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:36.920]   And they went out of business because.
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:38.040]   Yeah, that was dumb.
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:42.200]   They had their cloud costs were high because they had video, they had LTE costs.
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:43.000]   What were they thinking?
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.240]   They didn't obviously do a business plan because it was expensive up front,
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:49.160]   but they'd nowhere near covered.
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:51.320]   I've obviously nowhere near covered their costs.
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:56.280]   They ended up getting sold in the new companies back, but they're charging a monthly fee as they should.
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:01:01.320]   I was thinking this would be something applicable to the studio life of things,
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:03.400]   as far as cameras and deep.
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:06.840]   Should we just charge a monthly fee for that?
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:09.000]   Well, that's what club Twitter is in a way.
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:15.160]   But at the same time, maybe studios are starting to go away because people are doing more things
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:15.720]   mobile.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.400]   Yeah, you don't really need it anymore.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:17.880]   Yeah.
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:20.600]   Well, they're talking about doing office subscriptions.
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:26.360]   So this is a really interesting thing where Leo, let's say you sign up 10 virtual people to be
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:26.920]   hosts, right?
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:27.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:32.760]   And you instead of sending us gear that y'all picked out and mailed to us, instead you pay
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:36.840]   some company $10 a month to keep us updated with the latest ring lights and micro.
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:37.880]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.160]   Think I know.
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:39.400]   Is that?
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:41.320]   I don't know.
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.920]   I mean, think about it.
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:44.680]   I mean, so those are kind of stuff.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:46.040]   I just terrible at this stuff.
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:48.360]   I'm like, I want to do the content.
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.920]   Yeah, I'm the guy who sold the owl camera for $3.99.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:51.960]   No, it'll work.
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:52.760]   He'll figure it out.
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:56.440]   Come on, man.
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:58.040]   I did something on the back of an envelope.
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:58.680]   It looked right.
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:04.200]   Yeah, it would be more than $10 a month to keep you in ring lights.
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:05.240]   I can tell you that right now.
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.840]   Am I like this evil ring light distro?
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:13.640]   Oh, no, I'm just saying, you know, it's 10 bucks a month.
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:15.080]   That's not that's not going to buy anything.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:15.640]   No, that does.
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:17.320]   We're going to have to charge 50 bucks a month.
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.960]   Well, okay.
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:23.160]   Yeah, I did not plan out a solid studio.
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:25.160]   Where's your business plan?
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:26.760]   I don't think.
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:27.160]   I don't know.
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.600]   I mean, look at my lighting.
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.360]   Do you think I know about ring lights?
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:30.600]   No.
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:32.280]   So get the whoop.
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.360]   Don't get the Fitbit Ionic.
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:36.280]   They're all being recalled.
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:37.240]   Oh, no.
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:42.200]   For causing burn injuries, apparently the battery gets really hot.
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:43.880]   You're supposed to do the burn.
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.400]   Do the burn feel the burn.
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:46.200]   Feel the burn.
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:46.760]   I said feel the burn.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:47.880]   They didn't mean on your wrist.
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.240]   Oh, no, I'm feeling the burn.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:55.160]   But, you know, good on Google because they're recalling 1.7 million watches,
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:03:01.400]   giving every owner a full refund and 40% off another Fitbit.
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:06.760]   Kevin and I were looking for old Fitbit Ionic still on Amazon for some
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:08.840]   recall arbitrage.
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:09.480]   Yeah, good deal.
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:11.400]   Good, a good deal.
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:14.040]   Pirates.
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.280]   Did anybody, any of you own the Ionic?
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:18.600]   It was an ice looking watch.
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.440]   I did not like it.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:21.560]   Oh, okay.
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:24.840]   I never got into the Fitbit life or ecosystem, I should say.
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:25.160]   All right.
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:26.120]   Well, if you have one.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:27.160]   I have a Fitbit ecosystem.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:28.200]   Oh, my Fitbit's going.
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:29.560]   Yeah.
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:33.880]   Fitbit received 174 reports of the battery overheating worldwide.
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:36.920]   78 reports of burn injuries in the US alone.
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:39.640]   Two reports of third degree burns.
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:42.600]   Four reports of second degree burns.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:43.560]   That's hot.
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:44.520]   Good.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.560]   That's a burn.
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:46.120]   All right.
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:48.360]   Well, you think you would have taken it off before that.
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:49.640]   You're not a frog in the morning.
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.400]   I think they must have been sleeping.
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:53.400]   Maybe that's the only thing I can think of.
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.600]   Maybe and they woke up suddenly.
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:55.320]   Oh, that's a point.
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.280]   Geez.
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:56.760]   That would suck.
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:59.080]   Wow.
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:03:59.480]   Grief.
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.160]   Did anybody sign up for Truth Social?
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:06.440]   Was anybody able to get in?
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:08.760]   It's not going to be if I tried.
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:09.960]   It's not on the web.
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:11.080]   It's not a web service.
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:11.960]   It's just the Renapp.
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:12.680]   It's an app.
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:13.640]   It's an iOS app.
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:14.680]   So it's still a no for me.
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:18.600]   It was the number one app on Apple briefly.
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:21.560]   It's now falling number 57 on the App Store.
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.600]   Just behind Tinder and Planet Fitness workouts.
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:25.480]   I don't know if that means anything.
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:26.680]   That's still pretty impressive.
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:27.320]   It's 57.
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:28.040]   It's still pretty good.
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:33.160]   This is the problem is that nobody's been able
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:33.960]   to get in.
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:36.280]   Apparently not even the former president.
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:39.400]   Trump has not yet posted on Truth Social.
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:40.520]   He doesn't know how to use it yet.
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.200]   He hasn't been coached.
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:45.880]   And in fact, this would be an opportune moment for him
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:48.840]   to get on there during the Ukraine thing.
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.520]   That's Buddy Putin.
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:54.760]   Yeah, he said he's going to radio and TV or CPAC.
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:05:02.120]   And part of the problem is that I think there must be a technical issue.
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:07.400]   This is the other issue is they have a SPAC.
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:14.360]   So they're raising a lot of money in this SPAC.
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:16.440]   I can't remember the amount, but it was a huge amount of money.
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:19.400]   Did the SPAC actually go through?
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:22.440]   Because there's a lot of skepticism right now about those.
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:25.240]   So a lot of the planned ones are probably not going to happen.
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:30.120]   And this sounds pretty dicey to begin with.
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:30.440]   Yeah.
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:31.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.960]   Well, yeah, I mean, a lot of people signed up, apparently,
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:36.760]   still are in the waiting queue.
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:38.760]   In fact, the queue hasn't moved in a week.
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:39.240]   Oh, wow.
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:40.920]   So I don't, I don't.
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:43.880]   Oh, it's like people waiting for their helium routers.
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:47.240]   Yeah, I don't want to say it's a grift.
[01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:53.240]   But the Truth Social SPAC is valued at three and a half billion dollars,
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:55.320]   which is just ridiculous.
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:55.960]   Yeah.
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:58.520]   I mean, even if it were a massive success,
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:02.520]   I don't think, I mean, Twitter can barely make it a penny.
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:03.560]   So.
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:09.400]   And the money doesn't go to the company, it goes somewhere else.
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:10.200]   I wonder where.
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.440]   I wonder where.
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:15.160]   Devin Nunes, right?
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:16.040]   That's who's running it.
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:18.120]   So is it $5 a month or?
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:22.120]   Well, that apparently somebody corrected me and went to Snopes.
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:25.400]   Because we were saying, as were many new outlets, that's where I got it,
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:26.600]   that it was $5 a week.
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.040]   A week, but apparently it's not.
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:28.600]   Okay.
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:31.400]   But on the air, we don't really know since nobody is actually.
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:32.040]   It's actually.
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:32.840]   They only get in.
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:33.160]   Yeah.
[01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:33.640]   Yeah.
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:36.440]   So, but apparently it's free, at least right now, it's free.
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:38.520]   So just an update on that.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:39.800]   If anybody gets in, let us know.
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:41.720]   I'd love to, you know, just find out more about it.
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:50.840]   I put this in here for you, Stacey, the first smart door lock to use Apple's home key.
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:55.160]   The Acara smart door lock A100 Zigbee.
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.680]   Unfortunately.
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:57.720]   We did talk about it on the show.
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:59.480]   It's not available in the US.
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:06:59.960]   Why not?
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:04.120]   Acara, they started.
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.400]   I think they're not a US-
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:06.360]   It must be Turkish.
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:07.720]   That sounds like a Turkish name.
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:10.600]   It'll be sold.
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:11.480]   They're Italian.
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:12.040]   Oh, Italian.
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:13.720]   It's sold in Asia first.
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:18.680]   Malaysia Singapore and then Russia and more southeast Asia in the coming months.
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:22.120]   No mention of European or North American launches or if ever.
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:26.280]   They do say it will be available worldwide.
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:29.000]   They just don't say when.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.680]   Home key is really a cool idea, right?
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:33.560]   Is it Bluetooth?
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:36.680]   Yeah, I know it's NFC actually.
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:39.800]   And they store the information on your wallet.
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:43.400]   They store your house key information on your wallet.
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:45.320]   Apple wallet, thank you.
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:50.600]   And so you can just open your door when your phone's near it, which is nice.
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:51.000]   Nice.
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:59.720]   It requires a Zigbee 3.0 Acara hub to function about $365 if you could buy it in the US,
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:00.280]   which you can't.
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:05.400]   And there is some speculation in this article on Apple Insider that it is
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:07.400]   really intended for commercial.
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:11.240]   It doesn't ask, it's just the stuff that hotels are using.
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:11.720]   Yeah.
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:14.200]   I thought it was all NFCs in hotels, right?
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.680]   It is based, yes.
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:17.080]   It is.
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:20.040]   Well, because Bluetooth really isn't as secure as NFC.
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:23.480]   I don't know.
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:27.880]   So Carkey uses NFC and UWP.
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:32.600]   But the locks for HomeKit don't use UWP yet,
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:35.400]   because we're not seeing those radios and a lot of products yet.
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:38.680]   This is quite a lock they have on this door.
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:41.480]   Yeah, it is a hell of a lock.
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:42.600]   Four deadbolts.
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:44.600]   So this must be in use in Russia.
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:46.200]   It's like a Manhattan apartment for the city.
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:47.080]   Maybe that's it.
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:49.640]   I love it.
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:51.160]   I'd love it if it unbolts.
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:51.720]   It's in sequence.
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:53.080]   So it goes,
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:54.520]   "Chonk, chonk, chonk."
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:58.840]   So I just wanted to update.
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:01.560]   Akhara is based in Shenzhen.
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:02.760]   Oh, they're Chinese.
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:03.320]   In New York.
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:03.880]   They're Chinese.
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:07.640]   And yeah, so they were created in 2016.
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:08.680]   And their name is Latin,
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:10.040]   which is where I got the Italian from.
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:10.360]   Sorry.
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:10.840]   Okay.
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:11.640]   I was like,
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:14.600]   just don't ask where my brain is.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:19.160]   So a lot of talk, and I'm sure you talk about this with Kevin
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:22.920]   about the deaths of the 3G networks on February 22nd.
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:23.880]   T-Mobile will be there.
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:24.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.400]   Down for Ryzen at the end of the year.
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:27.080]   It's affecting a lot of things.
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:29.160]   Home security systems.
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:30.040]   A lot of them are 3G.
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:31.080]   Is this affecting you?
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:32.280]   You need to update your-
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:35.800]   You probably didn't pay attention to the like 8 million emails
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:38.440]   from the company who's providing your service.
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:39.080]   That is all I-
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:40.600]   Like I've talked to these companies.
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:42.280]   We warned you.
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:44.200]   Over and over.
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:45.240]   Updates your hardware.
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:47.880]   They're like people.
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:50.360]   I know that the companies that I was talking to,
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:51.640]   they were sending out emails.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:54.040]   I mean, granted, there's probably some random stuff out there
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:55.080]   that yes, just died.
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.440]   And that's unfortunate.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:59.160]   But for most reputable companies,
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:00.600]   like especially on the alarm side.
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:00.920]   Yeah.
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:05.000]   They've been emailing people for like 18 months.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:05.240]   Right.
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:07.800]   But who reads their email?
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:08.280]   Not me.
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:10.840]   Well, yeah, we know you don't.
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:13.400]   I don't.
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:17.080]   Get ready since-
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:18.520]   What about the app notifications?
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.920]   Well, what about them?
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:21.640]   You get those.
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:22.440]   Oh, you get those?
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:23.160]   You-
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:24.120]   Well, you'll get those.
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.960]   They've used app notifications.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:29.480]   I got one letter from 18-
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:33.160]   one saying your phone's not going to work in a couple of weeks.
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:34.360]   So what do you want to do about it?
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:36.280]   That's one letter.
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:37.400]   Which phone?
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:38.040]   Interesting.
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:39.800]   Well, it's a phone I haven't used in years.
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:40.440]   I know that.
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:41.480]   I'm curious which one.
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:42.280]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:45.160]   I mean, they said that whatever the phone with the number
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:47.960]   ending in 9154 is not going to work anymore.
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:48.680]   Well, did you still-
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:49.080]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:50.920]   Were you still paying AT&T?
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:52.440]   Why would they-
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:54.520]   Why are you giving me-
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:55.000]   I mean-
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:55.320]   Yeah.
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:57.240]   I don't know.
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:58.440]   God.
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:10:59.240]   I don't know.
[01:10:59.240 --> 01:10:59.720]   I got-
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:00.520]   Okay.
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:02.760]   Do you know how many phones this dude has?
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:03.320]   Really?
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:03.720]   But how many-
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:04.200]   How many-
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:08.600]   Does he have 10-year-old flip phone service still paying for?
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:09.480]   So what happened?
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:10.280]   It was like a what?
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.480]   I get rid of the phone.
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:14.200]   And I have the sim and I think,
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:16.120]   well someday I'll put this in another phone.
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:18.040]   Hi, you're so bad.
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:18.520]   Oh no.
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:19.880]   Oh no.
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:20.280]   That's-
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:21.240]   You know-
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:21.560]   It's-
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:22.440]   But the problem is-
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:23.880]   Okay, I have Verizon.
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:24.680]   It's only 20-
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:25.160]   I have T-Mobile.
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:28.200]   I have AT&T.
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:28.760]   Phi.
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:30.280]   And the problem in Google Phi.
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:33.400]   And Mint Mobile and Ting.
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:34.440]   But the problem is-
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.440]   There's a few more.
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:36.840]   I don't-
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:38.280]   Sprint.
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:38.920]   I can't remember.
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:39.720]   Anyway,
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:42.200]   the problem is there's different people in all of them.
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:42.840]   Especially-
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:44.440]   You're probably still paying MCI.
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:45.560]   If you know me,
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.960]   I'm paying for your cell phone is how it works.
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:52.200]   So I have people all over on this AT&T plan.
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:54.040]   And I don't know who they are.
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:54.840]   Oh, me.
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:57.240]   You sent me the Samsung phone.
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:58.440]   Oh, hey, I forgot to send you-
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:11:59.240]   Everybody got it?
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.280]   Did you get my phone?
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:01.880]   Is there a sim card in here?
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:02.760]   No, I took it out.
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:06.680]   Yeah, I forgot to ask you.
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:07.320]   Not only did that,
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:08.600]   I threw in a little bonus.
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.520]   Yeah, I-
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:11.400]   Where did I put it?
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:12.600]   I was like, I opened it up to-
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:13.960]   She's so happy that she got it.
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:15.880]   Boy, she's exactly true to the side.
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:19.720]   I sent her the Galaxy Flip 3.
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:20.760]   Because she was-
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:21.960]   And then I thought,
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:24.680]   you know, I've got like 18 book readers.
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:25.240]   Oh my god.
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:26.840]   Kobo, the Kobo reader.
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:28.280]   I just bought the Kobo.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:28.760]   Oh, Kobo.
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:29.640]   I just bought the Kobo.
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:31.080]   Because that one, you'll like that one.
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.640]   Works with the library card.
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:34.120]   Nice.
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.000]   So you can buy-
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:35.240]   Now,
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:36.600]   books from the library.
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:37.960]   Oh, very cool, yes.
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:38.760]   So that's why I thought,
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:39.480]   oh, I'll send this-
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:40.760]   I didn't want to send a Kindle to you.
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:42.840]   I- Because I could have, but I thought,
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:43.240]   you know what?
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:44.440]   I bet she'd like this Kobo.
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:45.080]   That's cool.
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:47.640]   So because you can tie it to your library card account,
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:49.480]   and then borrow books, which is really cool.
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.800]   Is that one of the Kobo's where you can write stuff?
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.080]   It is, and unfortunately,
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:54.760]   it was the one that came out just before-
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:56.440]   I bought it like a week before they-
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:58.840]   announced this new feature.
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:00.600]   But it's nice.
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:01.240]   It's big, right?
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:02.360]   Stacey, it's not a little one.
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:02.840]   It is big.
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:03.400]   Yeah, it's nice.
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:06.280]   You haven't plugged it in, obviously.
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:06.920]   Yeah, you could-
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:08.200]   If you've cared about it, you could charge it.
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:09.240]   I-
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:10.120]   So, I-
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:10.840]   Well, okay.
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:13.720]   It came while I was out of town.
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:16.840]   So I didn't actually get the package until Monday afternoon.
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:17.320]   I don't-
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:18.760]   I'm not believing it.
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:20.840]   That was just sitting on itself somewhere.
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:24.120]   I just thought, well, I got a box going out.
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:26.120]   Let's throw some other crap in there somewhere.
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:29.000]   We're lucky you didn't get some Twit stickers in a Leo bobblehead.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.520]   I think you should have gotten some-
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:32.520]   What was the bread we were making with the machine?
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:33.640]   Oh, yeah, you could have got some-
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:34.120]   No, I missed it.
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:34.600]   Rodey-
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:35.320]   Rodey's in there.
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:36.520]   Yeah, I missed it.
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:36.760]   Yeah.
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:38.280]   Whatever happened to that machine, by the way?
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:39.240]   Still be-
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:42.200]   Um, a former employee kept it, I believe.
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:43.080]   Was it-
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:43.880]   Or do you have it?
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:45.000]   No, was it Miss Maggie?
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.800]   No, I think Colleen has it.
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:49.160]   Did she ever bring it back, John?
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.120]   No.
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:52.840]   So, she probably has a phone too.
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:59.240]   So, look at the e-books you could get
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:01.640]   from the Rakuten-Cobo,
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:03.720]   like this one from Ashley Zecharesky.
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:04.760]   Let's get naughty.
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:05.480]   What? It might-
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:05.720]   No.
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:06.600]   Yeah.
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:07.080]   Yeah.
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:09.000]   I pulled the side up and I'm like,
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:09.880]   "Oh crap, get this all out."
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:11.480]   They do a lot of romances.
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.400]   But if you look at the-
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.720]   I don't know which one you've got even-
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:17.480]   It's relatively recent.
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:18.360]   I bought it last year.
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:19.880]   Because I thought I should check out this.
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:22.120]   And I did sign up for Library Card
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:23.960]   and put books on it, which is really cool.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.720]   So, I thought you might enjoy it for that reason.
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:26.760]   But honestly-
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:28.280]   Is that from what pad?
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:30.040]   Is that from what pad?
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:30.600]   What pad?
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:32.040]   What pad?
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:37.080]   W-A-T-T-Y-D has 90 million users writing fan fiction.
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:38.040]   Oh.
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.640]   I looked up what pad.
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:42.120]   That cover actually was familiar from what pad.
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:43.080]   It could be fan fiction.
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:44.600]   Well, I wonder what he's looking at.
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:47.880]   Because Santa's looking down at something.
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:49.320]   This is-
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.120]   Really?
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:50.920]   Really?
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:51.560]   This isn't as-
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:52.120]   His policy.
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:52.760]   His policy.
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:53.320]   Yes.
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:53.800]   It says,
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:55.480]   "If you think it's too soon to get on,
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.400]   Santa's naughty list to think again.
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:02.520]   Cancel your plans and spend this holiday season with 26 romance authors
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:06.200]   who've teamed up to bring you a delicious holiday treat.
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:07.720]   This collection has it all.
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:09.080]   Fake relationships,
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:10.280]   second chances,
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:11.560]   enemies to lovers,
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:12.600]   friends to lovers,
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:13.960]   workplace romance,
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:15.160]   age gap,
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:16.120]   CEOs,
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:17.000]   bikers,
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.480]   and falling for the best friend's brother."
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:20.280]   And-
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:22.840]   And I go to the e-book store.
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:26.440]   I get highlighting the work of black authors.
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:27.480]   Thank you much better.
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:28.520]   And-
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:29.080]   So-
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:29.800]   And it's in there.
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.160]   I don't know what store you're in.
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:32.040]   Oh, well this is-
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:32.600]   This is a man's-
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:33.160]   This is women's-
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:34.200]   This is women's month.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.720]   A celebration of women's stories, stories they tell.
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:38.920]   I don't know.
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:40.120]   I like e-book readers.
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.400]   I read stuff on my Kindle.
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:42.680]   I-
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:44.600]   Mostly technical books because I-
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:46.600]   You don't want an audiobook that says-
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:50.760]   C++ equals 4 over 7.
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:53.240]   Parenthesis,
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:53.800]   open,
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:54.200]   close.
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:55.080]   So-
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:58.200]   But for-
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:15:58.920]   For technical books,
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:01.080]   the Kindle's a really good choice.
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:01.720]   And this is the-
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:02.280]   Oh, look!
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:04.920]   They have the most popular recommendations on books.
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:05.400]   Talk.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.440]   That's actually-
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:08.120]   I don't know why Amazon doesn't do that.
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:08.760]   There you go.
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:09.160]   See?
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:09.800]   That's actually quite nice.
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:11.560]   So just consider it a little bonus.
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:12.440]   For-
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:12.840]   For-
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:12.920]   For-
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:12.920]   For-
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:13.080]   For-
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:13.080]   For-
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:13.080]   For-
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:14.280]   Stasis book books-
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:14.600]   Yes.
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:17.080]   I forgot to ask you if you even got that.
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:17.400]   That's good.
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:18.120]   I'm glad it arrived.
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:18.280]   Yeah.
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:19.400]   In the arrived intact.
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:19.880]   Have you-
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:21.880]   Have you put your sim in the flip phone yet?
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:25.560]   I know I just started updating things last night.
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:25.880]   Because-
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:25.880]   Good.
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:26.360]   Again,
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:27.240]   Didn't get to it.
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:27.720]   Yeah, that's fine.
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:28.440]   I didn't get the mail.
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:29.160]   That's fine.
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:29.960]   I-
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:30.760]   I hope you like it.
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:32.200]   I hope you like it.
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:33.560]   I'm really excited about it.
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:34.440]   It looks neat.
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:35.400]   In my daughter's life.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:35.400]   Good.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:35.960]   Put it in the best buy.
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:37.240]   It's surprisingly-
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:38.520]   The line is not disturbing.
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:39.320]   It's surprisingly-
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:39.800]   Yeah.
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:40.360]   Nice.
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:40.600]   Yeah.
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:41.640]   And you know what?
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.000]   It's not too heavy.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:43.480]   No.
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:44.200]   Lopy hands.
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:44.680]   Lopy hands.
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:45.160]   Exactly.
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:46.520]   That's why I thought for you-
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:47.480]   Now put the case on-
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:48.040]   Whoa.
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:48.680]   That's strange.
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:49.720]   The case is in the box.
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:50.200]   That's strange.
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:52.040]   So the case is on the box in there.
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:55.560]   Because I had to take it off to fit it in to the original box.
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:56.600]   I just heard of Crash.
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:57.880]   I hope that wasn't a bad one.
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:16:58.360]   This is-
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:16:59.400]   This is Stasis.
[01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:01.800]   Put the case on it too to give it-
[01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:03.080]   I think it's a little better with the case.
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:03.720]   Give it-
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:03.880]   Yeah.
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:05.240]   Give it some substance.
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:07.080]   Yeah.
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:07.400]   Good.
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:07.720]   All right.
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:09.720]   Apple has-
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:10.840]   I feel like I've got a man's wallet.
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:11.720]   Announced its-
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:11.960]   Yeah.
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:12.440]   Look at that.
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:13.400]   It is kind of manly.
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:14.520]   I'm sorry if it's too manly.
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:15.320]   But you do have black-
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:15.880]   Oh, no, no.
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:16.680]   You're actually-
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:17.560]   Black fingernails,
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:18.440]   black journal neck.
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:19.160]   You're-
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:20.120]   In blue hair.
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:20.680]   In blue hair.
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:21.720]   You're kind of dressed for that.
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:21.960]   Yeah.
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:24.520]   My current case is camouflage.
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:25.080]   In camo.
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:28.360]   This is a little more feminine than that.
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:28.680]   Okay.
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:29.880]   Okay.
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:32.520]   It does look like a man's wallet though.
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:33.640]   I did not see that coming.
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:34.120]   That's some of the things-
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:35.080]   That's a little bit of a college.
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:37.400]   It was the case that came on the phone.
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:38.200]   And I'm not-
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:39.800]   I don't care what case is on my phone.
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:40.280]   There you go.
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:40.680]   See?
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:41.960]   That's why you sent you that one.
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:42.280]   Yeah.
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:44.600]   Apple's event is Tuesday.
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:45.880]   We will cover that live-
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:48.280]   Interesting name-
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:51.080]   Peak Performance.
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:51.880]   Which sounds like-
[01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:52.120]   You know,
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:53.480]   that's yet another thing for you,
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:53.560]   Ann.
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:54.920]   But it's faster iPad.
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:56.040]   P-W-E-K.
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:58.520]   Like we're going to take a peak.
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:03.320]   And the invite was an AR portal that you go into.
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:07.080]   So I think it's reasonable to think Apple might in fact
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:12.520]   at least give a peak at its rumored AR/VR hardware coming out later this year.
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:16.600]   So at least let us look at it but not give us something that we can order.
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:17.560]   Do they do that?
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:19.080]   Rarely.
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:20.040]   Because Apple has-
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:20.440]   Rarely.
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:20.920]   I was like-
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:24.200]   I don't recall Apple ever showing off a device before-
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:25.000]   Well they did.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:25.320]   And they-
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.040]   Even if they leave before-
[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:28.120]   With devices where they need developer support.
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:32.680]   So the Mac Pro, the last Mac Pro they announced six months ahead of its release.
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:35.560]   They did that with the previous Mac Pro as well.
[01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:36.360]   The trash can.
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:36.600]   The trash can.
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:36.920]   And the one right?
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:37.400]   Yeah.
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:38.360]   I think this is-
[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:43.080]   You know, they got to get developers writing stuff for whatever this is.
[01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:45.960]   So this will be interesting.
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:48.920]   I think you know it's probably going to be more prosaic stuff.
[01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:56.120]   Basically an iPad Air, an iPhone SE 5G.
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:56.920]   Oh yeah.
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:18:57.720]   We're hoping.
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:18:59.880]   Crossing our fingers for a new Mac Mini.
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:04.200]   And you know actually in the Russian FCC database
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:08.040]   there were I think four new devices from Apple a couple of weeks ago.
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:09.960]   Which usually happens right before an event.
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:12.680]   And at least two of them were Macs.
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:15.320]   So there may be a Mac Mini and a Mac laptop.
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:16.600]   Anyway something to watch.
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:19.480]   We'll be covering it live next Tuesday 10am.
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:21.160]   It'll be-
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:26.280]   I guess Michael probably will do iOS today early
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:27.240]   with Rosemary Orchard.
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:28.920]   Join me at 10am for that.
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:30.520]   And then right after Mac break weekly.
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:33.400]   So it'll be an Apple Day on Tuesday.
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:37.000]   Little program note peak performance.
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:37.720]   Let's take a little break.
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:38.120]   Come back.
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:40.200]   Still got to do a change log.
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:41.800]   I know you all can't wait for that.
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:43.720]   The highlight of the show.
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:46.200]   Coming up in just a little bit.
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:47.560]   The segment you just burned through.
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:50.920]   Look forward to it all week long.
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:54.200]   I say, oh man, I'm just so excited.
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:55.160]   So excited.
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:56.920]   Our show today brought to you by Hover.
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:59.640]   This is the place to go to get your domain names.
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:03.560]   I think Hover is the easiest, fastest way to get domain names.
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:04.280]   And I can tell you.
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:06.280]   Because it's so easy and fast.
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:09.800]   I have hundreds, hundreds of domain names at Hover.com.
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:11.320]   Why would you want your own domain name?
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:12.680]   Why wouldn't you want it?
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:14.040]   Whether you're a blogger,
[01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:17.800]   an artist creating a portfolio, building an online store,
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:21.000]   any business should absolutely own its own domain name.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.680]   It doesn't have to be for a website.
[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:24.040]   At least for email.
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:25.800]   At least for email.
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:28.520]   If you're a student starting out in the world,
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:32.600]   get a domain name that links to your LinkedIn page or your resume.
[01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:39.160]   Hover has the best domain names and email addresses just for you.
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:43.480]   I am a big believer in owning your domain name for email.
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:48.120]   Because then it doesn't matter who you use as your email provider.
[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:50.360]   You can move around as you want,
[01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:54.040]   but your address is kind of your permanent address for the rest of your life.
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:55.960]   Hover makes it very easy.
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:58.280]   In fact, you can sign up for email from Hover.
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:20:59.160]   It's very affordable.
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:03.000]   So you get the domain and the email at the same time,
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.520]   which is nice because when it's time to renew the domain name,
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:09.080]   your email renews automatically.
[01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:10.600]   Very easy to set up.
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:12.920]   You can get as many mailboxes as you need.
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:16.120]   The price is very, very affordable.
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:17.320]   They're most popular mailbox.
[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.720]   Basically, a no-brainer for business owners.
[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:21.720]   And again, it's your business name,
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:24.280]   which is, I think, so important.
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:25.880]   Plus, it's real email.
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:27.000]   You can access from anywhere.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.920]   You can use the email program you're already using.
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:31.160]   They have a web interface as well.
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:32.200]   That's fantastic.
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:37.480]   And they have so many interesting and fun and different names.
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:41.320]   .Ninja.art.
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:44.600]   My photography portfolio.
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:47.480]   I think there's .photo, but I got .camera.
[01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:49.080]   So I have Leo.camera.
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:50.200]   Don't you think that's good?
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:52.040]   Because you had to be different, sir.
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:52.520]   Yeah.
[01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:53.480]   Leo.camera.
[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:54.440]   I am a camera.
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:56.680]   And that points to my smug muk site, right?
[01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:56.920]   Smart.
[01:21:56.920 --> 01:22:00.120]   So I could be Leo Laport.smugmuk.com,
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:01.560]   but Leo.camera.
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:03.880]   So I think it just represents you a little bit better.
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:05.160]   If you're a professional,
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:07.560]   you absolutely ought to have your own domain name.
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:08.280]   Very easy.
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:13.400]   Now, I know, I like working with the DNS settings and all of that.
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:16.280]   And they have great, powerful pro-level tools
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:17.880]   that are very easy to use,
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:20.040]   but give you all the capabilities you want.
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:21.320]   But they also have,
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:24.200]   if you don't want to be like an expert geek,
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:25.240]   they have Hover Connect,
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:28.680]   which is one button to connect your website,
[01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:31.320]   whether it's Squarespace or WordPress or Wix,
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:33.160]   right to your domain name.
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:34.120]   Just a couple of clicks.
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:36.600]   It could not be easier.
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:39.640]   Of course, unlike other people,
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:43.160]   Hover includes who is privacy with your domain purchase.
[01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:46.120]   They know you want private information to remain private.
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:48.040]   That reduces spam,
[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:50.120]   protects yourself from unwanted solicitations,
[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:53.080]   attempts to steal your domain, things like that.
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:54.360]   That's built in.
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:57.480]   Other companies will upsell you like crazy, not Hover.
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:58.760]   It's fast, it's easy,
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:00.520]   and it's very affordable.
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:02.200]   Domains are very, very affordable.
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:03.480]   Hover, you're a customer,
[01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:05.400]   not a source of data.
[01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:09.640]   Take back control of your data with a reliable tracker-free email.
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:11.880]   Hover is trusted by hundreds of thousands of customers
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:13.320]   who use their domain names
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:15.240]   and email to turn their ideas into a reality.
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.240]   It's all we use here at Twit.
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:18.440]   I'm a big fan.
[01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:21.160]   Whether you're a developer, photographer, or small business,
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.960]   Hover has something for you to expand your projects
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:26.520]   and get the visibility you want.
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:27.560]   Think of a domain name.
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:29.080]   What domain name would you like?
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:31.720]   Just to match your interest, your passion.
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:32.520]   It's kind of cool.
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:34.520]   All the different names that are out there.
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:37.320]   Go to hover.com/twit
[01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:40.440]   to get 10% off your first purchase of any domain extension.
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:42.600]   For the entire first year, that's a good deal.
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:48.600]   10% off hover hovir.com/twit.
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:52.360]   I actually use .email for my email addresses.
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:55.160]   But I have Leo.fm, which is the shortest.
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:56.520]   I can get an email there.
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:00.040]   For my retirement podcast, Leo, on the line,
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:01.800]   I have Lottle.fun.
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:03.080]   L-O-T-L.fun.
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:04.840]   Get it? Lottle.fun?
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:06.200]   Lottle.fun?
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:07.880]   Anyway.
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:11.080]   You know, when my husband and I had our
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:15.880]   engagement party, they asked me how many domains did he own?
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:17.640]   That was one of my questions.
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:20.440]   I was like, "I have no idea what was 100."
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:22.280]   The newlywed game was-
[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:23.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:23.880]   Oh, cute.
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:25.400]   How many domains does each person own?
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:25.400]   I don't know.
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:26.520]   The mid-game is this.
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:27.400]   What was the answer?
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:29.320]   Well, Andrew's like-
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:30.680]   It's like 100 and 30-something.
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:31.240]   Yeah.
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:32.600]   That's his business.
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:33.160]   He's a domainer.
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:34.040]   He's a domainer.
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:35.000]   That's his business.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:35.960]   How many do you own, Leo?
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:36.440]   He was then.
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:37.480]   Did he-
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:38.120]   Oh, gosh.
[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:38.600]   Let me see.
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:39.000]   I don't know.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:39.640]   I should go to hover.
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:40.760]   Let me log in.
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:41.800]   I could tell you.
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:44.200]   100, it seems like a reasonable amount.
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:44.360]   Wow.
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:45.000]   Unbelievable.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:45.800]   Wow.
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:49.400]   That's how many phones bills you have.
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:51.400]   Oh, I have to have a domain for every phone, right?
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:57.720]   Well, for instance, when Michael wanted to run a Minecraft server,
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:24:58.280]   I said, "Okay."
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:01.320]   You know, it's 164.3.9.
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.240]   Wait, I'm not going to tell people that.
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:04.280]   So, what domain-
[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:05.240]   What do you want it to be?
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:07.240]   He says, "I want it to be..."
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:09.400]   And he was like eight or something.
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.480]   NitroMinecraft.com.
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:13.480]   And so I registered-
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:14.360]   Out of Hover, right?
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:14.760]   Got it.
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:15.800]   NitroMinecraft.
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:17.240]   That's where our servers are.
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:19.160]   And I made a big sign in his Minecraft.
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:20.920]   This is nitroMinecraft.
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:22.280]   So that's cute.
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:22.840]   Isn't that cute?
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:23.960]   Is that fun?
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:26.440]   That's good parenting.
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:27.160]   Yeah.
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:28.600]   Well, yeah, I don't know if he appreciates it.
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:29.000]   But anyway-
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.320]   Uncle Andrew could give us a good domain advice.
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:31.560]   Yeah.
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:33.240]   Well, Andrew's like-
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:34.280]   Oh, I'm going to answer your advice.
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:35.160]   Your stuff, right?
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:36.200]   I mean, he likes really weird.
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:40.120]   I just got to waffle with the text taken out.
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:41.240]   That's my delivery.
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:42.520]   With the what's taken out?
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:43.000]   The text?
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.040]   The text.
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:45.880]   Oh, they took a bite out of it?
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:48.360]   Well, I always told my kids-
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:50.120]   That's just a check if there's poison.
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:50.680]   There you go.
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:53.480]   So here's all my domains.

[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:30.200]   I feel like I could-
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:31.640]   There's something I could do with that, Jeff.
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:32.200]   I don't know what-
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:33.400]   It's going to happen when there is.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:33.880]   I think so.
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:34.680]   Leo Ist.
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:36.280]   Kim.

[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:41.400]   That's the Leois.
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:42.360]   There aren't that many folks-

[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:42.760]   Leo-

[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:46.200]   There aren't that many short names in the world.
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:47.480]   That's the problem, right?
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:48.920]   I love antproot.com.
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:49.720]   That's your next one.
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:50.760]   There you go.
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:52.200]   I got a lot of twit ones.
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:54.520]   Twit fan, twit show, twit news,
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:56.920]   twit studio, twit social, twit community.
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:58.920]   Twit socials are mass fun.
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:01.480]   Twit communities are forums or discourse.
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:02.040]   I don't know.
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:03.400]   I never used this one.
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:05.960]   Twittish, T-W-I-T-I-
[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:07.320]   Other than H.
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:08.520]   And I also have Leois.
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:10.920]   That's from down down from Leois.
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:11.960]   Leois.
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.480]   Yeah, Twittish and Leois.
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:16.120]   You got shells for your domain names, huh?
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:18.200]   Yeah. I got lip-locked that live when I thought
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:19.880]   what I was going to do at TikTok,
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:21.320]   comp-comp-compet-
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:21.640]   competitor.
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:24.840]   Somebody said you should get your name backwards.
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:26.840]   So I have etrapalleo.com.
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:31.320]   Oh, I do have lip-port.photo.
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:32.760]   I didn't even know I had that.
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:34.680]   Sometimes you're going to have too many domains.
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:36.120]   So I got Leo.camera and lip-port.
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:37.320]   But not what you have.
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:38.120]   Hover.
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:39.480]   Not when you got hover.
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:40.840]   So how do I count all these?
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:41.320]   I don't know.
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:42.120]   There's a lot.
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:43.400]   He goes to the terminal.
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:44.040]   He goes to the terminal.
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:45.240]   I need a terminal command.
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:46.200]   Twit.sh.
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:46.440]   Yeah.
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:49.480]   That's a story.
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:52.760]   I should be able to do something with twit.sh.
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:54.840]   So Andrew, when you were getting married,
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:55.640]   which--
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:57.560]   and you played, I've been working on the railroad
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:58.920]   as your theme song,
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:01.320]   Andrew had already hundreds of domain names.
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:03.720]   He was already buying--
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:05.960]   he's been in this business for like 22 years.
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:08.840]   Did he think it was going to be really,
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:11.160]   like money?
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:14.520]   Like he was going to--
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:15.160]   No, he--
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:17.560]   Sell, like, sell him like--
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:18.600]   He's constantly--
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:20.440]   No, he's like one of those entrepreneurs.
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:22.920]   He's constantly looking for things
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:25.080]   that he can make a business up.
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:28.120]   So he has like two or three things going on at any time.
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:28.840]   Yeah.
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:28.840]   Yeah.
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:29.880]   So this is just--
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:31.720]   this has just been the most constant one.
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:34.680]   At that time, he was also selling baseball cards.
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:35.320]   Oh, really?
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:36.840]   That's neat.
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:37.400]   Yep.
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:38.680]   Rhett kind of agrees with me.
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:39.160]   Yeah, selling--
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:42.360]   What does he say?
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:42.760]   Oh, no.
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:44.120]   I'm just looking in the chat room.
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:45.480]   Rhett kind of agrees with me.
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:49.080]   That twit.sh is a very powerful bash script.
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:49.320]   Yeah.
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:50.840]   I can't--
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:51.240]   Yeah.
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:51.960]   I was going to put it--
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:54.440]   I pasted it into a spreadsheet to count them,
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:56.520]   but it pasted the whole thing, so I don't know.
[01:28:56.520 --> 01:29:00.520]   [laughter]
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:01.960]   It pasted the whole page.
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:02.680]   I don't know.
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:04.280]   What do you do for a living?
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:05.480]   I don't know what I do for a living.
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:05.800]   Yeah.
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:06.920]   It's not a mess.
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:09.800]   Maybe you can ask cover to count it for you.
[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:10.280]   Which is--
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:11.960]   It could be like, you know what you should ask?
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:13.560]   That's a feature request.
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:15.720]   Hover should have like a number next week.
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:16.760]   Maybe they don't want you to know.
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:20.920]   Dude, you got thousands of--
[01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:22.440]   They can't would say not enough.
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:22.760]   Yeah.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:23.400]   That's what they'll say.
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:24.200]   Yeah.
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:25.560]   Anyway, you got to do it.
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:31.880]   Hover.com/tritfor10% off your first purchase for a whole year.
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:35.480]   [laughter]
[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:37.960]   You do not get an ad like that.
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:38.200]   No.
[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:39.800]   No.
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:41.240]   You might be grateful.
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:42.760]   [laughter]
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:43.160]   Nice.
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:45.880]   A lot of these are just like, laport.coffee.
[01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:47.000]   What do I need that for?
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000]   For your coffee machine.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.760]   Probably back when you're going to have coffee machine.
[01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:51.960]   For my coffee machine, you're right.
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:52.680]   Coffee machine.
[01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:53.240]   Really?
[01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:53.960]   Oh, brilliant.
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:54.280]   Yes.
[01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:57.640]   Our house has a domain.
[01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:00.280]   So we have a domain for every house that we move into.
[01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:01.320]   Do you see?
[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:03.160]   What happens when you go to that domain though?
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:04.120]   Does something show up?
[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:07.960]   We do it just in case.
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:09.560]   And then when we sell our house--
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:10.040]   Sell.
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:10.360]   Yeah.
[01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:11.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:12.040]   For the selling.
[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:14.120]   Oh, for the selling.
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:16.840]   But the selling gets so good.
[01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:17.960]   For the selling of the house.
[01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:19.720]   1, 2, 3, Main Street.com.
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:20.280]   Yes.
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:20.440]   Yeah.
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:27.000]   I have my purple air sensor, you know, the air quality measuring thing,
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.120]   have their own domain name.
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:31.720]   So I can go right there and find out what the weather is.
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:33.880]   Is that Leo's cough, Leo's wheeze and--
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:37.400]   [laughter]
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:40.600]   Let's do the Google change law.
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:41.160]   Ready.
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:42.120]   [music]
[01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:43.160]   Oh, ready.
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:44.280]   Change law.
[01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:51.000]   Oh, it's time for the Google change log.
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:57.400]   Thanks to Raygun 01, aka Jason Howell for putting this together.
[01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:59.960]   Because I never have anything to add to the change log.
[01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:07.640]   The Pixel 6 cannot install Android 12L after the latest update.
[01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:08.600]   What?
[01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:10.120]   Now I'm mad.
[01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:11.160]   I have a Pixel 6.
[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:12.040]   I have Pixel 6 Pro.
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:13.320]   I presume they mean the Pro as well.
[01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:19.080]   I've enrolled my device, but apparently they don't want you--
[01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:22.600]   so if you're enrolling a Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro that is on the latest
[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:26.440]   February official build, you cannot--
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:30.520]   will not receive an update to 12L, beta 3, but instead receive the next
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:34.360]   upcoming beta build released in March as long as you keep in device enrolled.
[01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:39.720]   And this is otherwise you would have a conflict, I guess.
[01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:45.320]   So anyway, I don't know if that's a change or something you should know about it.
[01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:49.560]   Did you know Google has something called the Fast Emergency Dialer?
[01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:53.480]   It's on your Pixel 6 lock screen.
[01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:58.680]   Yeah, see if you've got it on yours.
[01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:00.840]   It's not slowly rolling it out.
[01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:06.360]   It's a new Fast Emergency Dialer designed to help users travel internationally.
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:07.240]   This is what's cool.
[01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:08.360]   It's 9/11.
[01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:09.400]   It's international, right?
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:13.160]   You know 9/11, but if you're in some other country, it's not 9/11.
[01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:15.720]   So police fire medical services.
[01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:19.800]   The Dialer was first seen last year through the Pixel Emergency app,
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:25.320]   but Google confirmed Android Police that it's going to be rolling out to a wider release.
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:27.480]   It's designed for international travel.
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:29.560]   You can use it at any location.
[01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:31.480]   It will show options relevant to your location.
[01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:33.000]   So it knows where you are.
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.720]   Quick access to call an emergency number with one action.
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:36.920]   Use the slider.
[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:41.480]   There's automatic emergency numbers that are tied to your location.
[01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:43.320]   The phone does that automatically.
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:48.440]   Plus, you'll get numbers for your area like police, fire medical services,
[01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:50.440]   and use the slider for when you need.
[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:53.720]   I don't know if mine's set up because it just says no information.
[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:55.320]   Yeah, I don't think you have it yet.
[01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:58.280]   But it was pretty easy to just swipe up and hit that one button.
[01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:00.840]   Yeah, on the phone's lock screen, there's an emergency call button.
[01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:05.720]   But you'll have sliders for the numbers when that kind of rolls out.
[01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:11.720]   Also, if you hold the power menu, it'll show up there as emergency calls do as well.
[01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:14.600]   I think you just don't have that dialer thinking.
[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:16.280]   I don't have my Pixel 6 with me.
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:17.240]   Oh, yeah, there's one.
[01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:18.040]   Call 911.
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:19.080]   And it's just a slumber.
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:25.720]   But if I click on touch, the emergency button, is it going to clack the call?
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:26.760]   No, you can touch it.
[01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:27.640]   No, you can touch it.
[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:30.120]   And it takes you to the next screen to do the slider.
[01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:31.640]   And then you can see if it's the...
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:32.600]   But I'm not going to slide.
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:33.080]   I'm not going to slide.
[01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:35.000]   Sliders are smart because you're lying there.
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:35.560]   You're bleeding.
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:36.360]   You're feeling terrible.
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:37.480]   You broke your leg.
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:40.360]   You know, you got a headache and you don't want to die online.
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:41.400]   Didn't have enough coffee.
[01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:42.840]   You just slide didn't have enough coffee.
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:43.880]   So that's...
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:47.160]   So in other words, when I die on the show, as we have discussed...
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:49.720]   Please die on my number.
[01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:50.760]   Well, look beforehand.
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:51.080]   Call me and call.
[01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:52.440]   I can try to use that.
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:55.880]   So instead of you helping me, you're going to say, "No, Jeff, go on your phone.
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:56.760]   Swipe, Jeff.
[01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:57.480]   Swipe here.
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:59.400]   Oh, Jeff.
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:00.440]   Jeff.
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:01.240]   Oh, shoot.
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:04.040]   Jeff, don't use your fingerprints, Ken.
[01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:04.600]   No.
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:06.200]   Jeff, you hit the lock screen.
[01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:08.040]   Jeff, you and I are the same age.
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:09.960]   I was just thinking this the other day,
[01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:11.320]   I want to write a blog post.
[01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:14.920]   It used to be, you know, when I'm ruminating, you know,
[01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:16.520]   before I go to...
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:17.480]   Which fall asleep.
[01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:18.600]   You're rocking chair.
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:18.680]   Rocking chair.
[01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:19.240]   Rocking chair.
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:19.800]   Rocking chair.
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:21.480]   It used to be, I'd think about, you know,
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:23.480]   pleasant thoughts, you know, girls,
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:26.760]   football, bourbon.
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:29.960]   Almost exclusively now, it's death.
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:30.600]   Oh boy.
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:31.640]   Do you find that, Jeff?
[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:32.200]   Like you just...
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:32.840]   Yes.
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:33.400]   Yes.
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:35.000]   I think it's with age.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.480]   You go like I'm thinking, I just was thinking,
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:38.520]   I just lost two years,
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:40.120]   I don't have that many left,
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:42.600]   and I just gave away two years to COVID.
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:44.760]   Like I'm not going to have,
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:46.040]   I'm going to have 20 years,
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:51.240]   I got eight, my life expectancy is 18 years, 18.2 years.
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:52.680]   I just gave away two of them.
[01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:53.080]   Yeah.
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:53.720]   For nothing.
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:55.320]   Nothing to show.
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:56.120]   I just went through...
[01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:57.000]   I'm just wondering, something's happened.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.680]   A few things.
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:34:58.920]   Yeah.
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:34:59.720]   A few things.
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:34:59.960]   Yeah.
[01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:00.920]   Oh my god.
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:03.320]   I mean, life is not a good thing.
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:05.160]   We're not a constant party, we'd be exhausted.
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:06.360]   Why the hell not?
[01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:08.600]   Some people want...
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:10.920]   Oh, crochet that in a pillow.
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:12.600]   Life is not a constant party.
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:14.840]   It says Stacy, she can welcome you.
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:16.120]   It's not Hardy Cooper.
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:17.160]   All right, everybody.
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:19.000]   I got 600 hours.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:19.640]   What you think was going to be?
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:21.400]   600 hours in Alheim.
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:23.080]   About 400 hours in Andal.
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:24.600]   Crossing New Horizons.
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:25.240]   Alheim.
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:25.560]   Yeah.
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:26.840]   You were on a tear with that.
[01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:27.720]   I learned just so.
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:28.920]   In your underwear.
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:30.680]   I made a lot of sourdough.
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:32.120]   Okay, you're right, it wasn't completely wasted.
[01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:35.320]   See? You bought a thermo mix.
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:35.800]   I did.
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:37.320]   Yeah, your thermo mix, I knew you were going to be in a...
[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:37.880]   Yes.
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:40.120]   All is not lost.
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:41.160]   It's what you didn't gift.
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:44.760]   So they recently did an MRI,
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:46.600]   or an EEG of a dying person.
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:47.560]   Did you see this?
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:49.240]   Did not, because I don't think about that kind of thing.
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:50.200]   We're still in the changelog.
[01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:52.840]   This is just a detour, okay?
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:58.040]   So this, an elderly epilepsy patient
[01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:01.480]   who was in the middle of an EEG, suddenly died.
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:02.360]   Hmm.
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:05.880]   Burst of activity measured by the EEG
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:08.440]   associated with memory recall,
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:11.240]   meditation, and dreaming.
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:13.880]   The physician's monitoring,
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:16.280]   and this is an article published in Frontiers
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:17.560]   in Aging Neuroscience,
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:19.320]   which is my personal favorite magazine.
[01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:25.000]   They said this is in effect kind of matches
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.720]   what you'd expect if your life was flashing before your eyes.
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:28.200]   Oh.
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:29.160]   Oh.
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:34.440]   They say this is rare because you can't plan this.
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:37.080]   No healthy humans going to go and have an EEG
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:38.040]   while they're dying.
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:39.560]   And in a sick patient,
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:41.480]   you don't know whether they're going to die or not.
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:43.160]   So it was just kind of a chance
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:46.760]   for roughly 30 seconds before and after the man's heart stopped beating.
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:49.320]   The scans showed increased activity
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:51.880]   in parts of the brain associated with memory recall,
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:53.560]   meditation, and dreaming.
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:56.200]   High frequency gamma oscillations,
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:59.880]   slower frequency, theta, delta, alpha, and beta oscillations.
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:01.640]   Scientists say they were particularly intrigued
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:03.800]   by the presence of gamma waves,
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:06.680]   which suggests the man's brain may have been
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:09.720]   replaying memories from throughout his life.
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:11.400]   Wow.
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:12.920]   Pass him before your eyes.
[01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:14.600]   So maybe that's peaceful.
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:16.200]   Well, that's the old wives' tale.
[01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:17.080]   Is that what you'd see?
[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:17.560]   Yeah.
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:17.880]   Yeah.
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:18.840]   A little review.
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:22.200]   And it only, if we knew it was scored
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:24.040]   to the soundtrack for up,
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:26.120]   and then we'd know exactly where we were going.
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:27.480]   Oh man, that movie at home.
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:28.200]   Right before we die.
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:29.320]   That movie.
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:30.280]   Cry.
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:30.760]   That movie, and cry.
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:31.400]   Stupid movie.
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:31.880]   All right.
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:32.040]   So...
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:34.680]   You cried too.
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:35.560]   Get back to the juke.
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:36.280]   Cryed.
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:36.760]   I think it is.
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:37.560]   All cried.
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:38.040]   He cried.
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:39.560]   Stupid movie.
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:40.600]   You can't not cry.
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:41.240]   I know.
[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:42.040]   Oh geez.
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:46.440]   Speaking of genres, Google Phone is preparing material you-inspired
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:49.160]   dialer that looks like Android 12's lock screen.
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:52.200]   Here's a gallery from 9 to 5 Google.
[01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:53.720]   Ooh.
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:55.480]   Okay.
[01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:56.200]   This is where we-
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:59.480]   This is how pathetic it has become now with smartphones.
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:37:59.800]   Because it's-
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:00.920]   Well, there's just not much new.
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:01.880]   So much new.
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:04.600]   So now, look, the picture-
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:08.840]   The color, the background, kind of matches your wallpaper.
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:09.320]   Mm-hmm.
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:11.400]   Ooh.
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:11.800]   Okay.
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:13.960]   The color that I didn't want.
[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:16.120]   Yeah, because your OS is saying-
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:16.600]   The green.
[01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:19.240]   We have to lock it into this particular shade of orange.
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:21.480]   And I show you my wallpaper on the-
[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:22.360]   You would actually-
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:23.480]   I should lend you this phone.
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:23.800]   Yeah.
[01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:26.040]   I have to take the sim out though.
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:26.680]   That's the-
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:27.960]   The new note.
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:29.080]   I mean, not note CE.
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:29.560]   Ultra-
[01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:30.200]   This is-
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:30.680]   That's 20 Ultra.
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:31.480]   Look at the back-
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:32.840]   What the backdrop's on this.
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:33.880]   Oh, live wallpaper.
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:33.960]   Ooh.
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:34.360]   Yeah.
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:34.840]   Ooh.
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:35.320]   Isn't that cool?
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:36.200]   Those are back.
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:37.480]   Yeah, where is it?
[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:37.800]   There it is.
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:38.840]   I don't know.
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:40.440]   It's just a Samsung thing.
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:41.240]   Yeah.
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:42.040]   Um, but I-
[01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:43.000]   You know, the screen on this-
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:43.800]   Look at the screen on that.
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:45.960]   Give me an independent photographer's eye.
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:47.320]   It's a good screen.
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:48.760]   Samsung has always had beautiful-
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:49.640]   Yeah, really nice.
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:50.040]   Oh, right.
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:50.680]   20 hertz.
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:51.240]   Very smooth.
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:52.200]   Look how smooth that is.
[01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:52.920]   Yeah.
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:54.280]   I'll have to say though,
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:55.000]   in my experience,
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.360]   the fingerprint reader on that
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:56.840]   isn't-
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:58.280]   is the same as the Pixel 6.
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:38:59.400]   It doesn't work the same way.
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:01.080]   It's optical not infrared,
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:01.320]   but-
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:02.920]   Oh, this is so smooth.
[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:03.640]   Yeah.
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:04.920]   And isn't that screen beautiful?
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:05.960]   Oh, man.
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:06.280]   Yeah.
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:07.160]   Where's the camera?
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:07.640]   Hold on.
[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:08.520]   Yeah.
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:09.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:09.320]   I-
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:10.200]   You know what?
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:11.160]   I'm gonna wipe that and-
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:12.360]   You can borrow it if you want-
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:13.400]   How's the white balance?
[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:15.960]   Well, we will know after I snap a shot.
[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:17.000]   I can't find a bag of-
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.280]   Are you referring back to-
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:20.360]   I am.
[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:22.840]   It critiqued the one picture I took with-
[01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:23.720]   Pixel 6.
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:24.200]   Look.
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:25.560]   And said the white balance was off.
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:26.440]   Is that what you're referring to?
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:27.880]   Well, because it was off.
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:28.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:28.840]   This is-
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:29.800]   This looks great.
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:30.520]   Damn, I look good.
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:31.960]   Oh, sorry.
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:32.600]   Oh, sorry.
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:34.440]   Now we know how-
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:35.640]   And judges the camera.
[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:37.160]   It know it has a good selfie camera.
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:37.400]   Oh, man.
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:38.280]   Has a wide angle too.
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:39.240]   That is really nice.
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:42.360]   YouTube's music artist pages,
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:43.880]   now lists songs and albums
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:46.520]   from your library.
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:48.520]   This is a feature I actually really liked
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:49.720]   and play music.
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:52.120]   And it's now on YouTube music as well.
[01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:54.680]   This is how pathetic this change long is.
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:55.880]   This is the most minor.
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:56.440]   And these-
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:57.160]   How about this?
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:39:57.720]   It's not-
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:39:58.200]   It's not-
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:39:58.680]   It's not-
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:39:59.240]   No, it's not.
[01:39:59.240 --> 01:39:59.800]   It's not.
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:00.680]   It's all there is.
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:01.800]   Jason, you're amazing.
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:02.920]   We love you, Jason.
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:04.840]   It's your change log that sucks.
[01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:07.720]   It's not your fault.
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:09.880]   We can only do what Google does.
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:10.840]   And as you know,
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:11.880]   Google's on vacation.
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:15.640]   This is something that's been in Samsung phones forever.
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:17.560]   It's a little slider that goes with the flashlight.
[01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:18.600]   So you can adjust the dimness.
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:19.080]   Yeah.
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:21.000]   Android 13 is going to add it.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:21.640]   Oh, thank you.
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:25.080]   Thank you, Samsung, for telling Google to do something.
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:25.080]   Yeah.
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:28.680]   Actually, that Samsung is not bad.
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:30.680]   That Samsung is not bad.
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:31.640]   Yeah, I like to play with this.
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:32.120]   I like that.
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:33.480]   That's 22 Ultra.
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:34.040]   And that-
[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:37.560]   Plus a little more is the Google change log.
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:39.400]   Change log plus.
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:42.040]   It's a little top heavy too.
[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:42.760]   Wait.
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:43.560]   It's heavy.
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:44.200]   Doesn't it feel-
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:46.680]   I think heavy though makes it feel more valuable.
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:47.000]   Sorry.
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.040]   What are you saying?
[01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:50.760]   I said it feels creamier than when it's heavier.
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:51.880]   Yeah, there's more in it.
[01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:53.800]   No, no.
[01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:54.840]   Stop it with the heavy.
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:56.600]   You stop it, Miss Floppy Riss.
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:57.480]   Well, I gave you-
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:40:58.600]   When I got-
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:40:59.320]   Once I got this,
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:01.400]   that's why you got the flip phone.
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:03.320]   It's because I got the new S22 Ultra.
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:03.960]   I said,
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:05.800]   "Now, who do I know has floppy risks?"
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:07.480]   And it was-
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:08.040]   That's big.
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:08.520]   I have this vision.
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:09.800]   Just flopping around.
[01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:10.200]   It's easy.
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:12.360]   Lifts her phone up.
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:14.440]   She's just going to top over and fall over.
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:17.480]   She's a little wisp of a lass.
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:19.400]   And she can barely hold her phone up.
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:21.080]   Oh, so-
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:22.280]   I can't-
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:22.760]   I can't-
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:26.600]   So antithetical to my ear because I'm going over.
[01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:29.640]   This is really good.
[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:32.440]   I'm going to ask Corey Dr. about this.
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:33.960]   Because Corey has always been-
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:35.240]   He's a science fiction author.
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:36.120]   Very acclaimed.
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:40.440]   You're doing his unconstitutional bread.
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:41.800]   -I'm not the rise. -Unauthorized.
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:42.360]   Unauthorized.
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:43.960]   -It's fresh. -Crested.
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:45.880]   That's the sequel.
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:48.440]   -That's later. -Yeah, that's his next book.
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:49.480]   This later.
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:50.440]   His ancillary-
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:51.240]   It's about Section 230.
[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:54.040]   -Ancillary bread book in your book club.
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:59.800]   And he is a pioneer in open sourcing.
[01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:01.720]   His books, Creative Commons, his books.
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:03.160]   He gives him away.
[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:05.320]   He does the audiobooks with no DRM things like that.
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:07.320]   The audiobook, I bought it directly from him.
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:08.120]   Not through all that.
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:08.600]   Exactly.
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:09.640]   I think that's great.
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:13.240]   And honestly, Jeff knows this.
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:16.680]   You don't do write books to make money.
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:19.160]   Because you get the gigs.
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:20.920]   You write books to get the next book.
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:23.400]   It establishes your credibility and things like that.
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:26.840]   It's very few books make a lot of money for artists.
[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:31.480]   Well, Brandon Sanderson, who's a very well-known sci-fi author.
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:33.480]   In fact, he's the guy who finished Wheel of Time.
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:36.040]   -I was going to say he finished the Wheel of Time.
[01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:38.200]   -Yeah. -He did a good job.
[01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:39.160]   -He did a great job.
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:40.840]   -He's done several great fantasy-
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:42.040]   -He's beloved.
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:45.560]   So during COVID, he didn't want to waste those two years.
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:48.360]   He wrote not one, not two, not three, four.
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:49.880]   Secret novels.
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:51.400]   Didn't tell anybody it was writing them.
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:54.120]   He said originally it was a surprise for my wife.
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:59.400]   They're in his existing cost-mere setting.
[01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:02.920]   Decided instead of going to a publisher
[01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:04.920]   and getting in advance or selling them that way,
[01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:06.120]   he went to Kickstarter.
[01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:09.560]   In one day, $15 million.
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:18.200]   $15 million. It broke fundraising records on the platform.
[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:19.240]   -Unbelievable.
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:23.080]   -It helps that he's a very well-known and beloved author.
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:24.280]   -That also was the world.
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:28.280]   -But this really is a model for the future.
[01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:30.360]   Do it yourself.
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:31.960]   Do it yourself.
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:36.840]   -A lot of artists have been saying that on the music side of things.
[01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:37.240]   -Same.
[01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:39.400]   -In addition to people writing books.
[01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:39.720]   -Yep.
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:40.360]   -Yep.
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:44.040]   -I can't say anything yet because I don't know the contract,
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:47.320]   but I'm going to sell a book to an academic publisher.
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:52.040]   So the terms, $1,000 advance.
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:55.320]   And I think it's 10% of the net.
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:44:01.080]   -And they only take half of the cover price, right?
[01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:03.160]   The bookstore gets the other half.
[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:05.480]   -And you get 10% of half.
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:08.200]   10% is actually a decent royalty.
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:10.280]   -You're not alone.
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:12.920]   A lot of authors make more money on the Amazon associates fee
[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:14.280]   than they do on their royalties.
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:18.520]   Actually, Sanderson did a Kickstarter in 2021,
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:22.280]   funded a 10th anniversary leather-bound edition of his book,
[01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:26.280]   The Way of Kings, raised $6.8 million in that one.
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:26.760]   -Dang.
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:28.600]   -Does he?
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:29.960]   -I didn't take individuals.
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:30.760]   -I guess so.
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:31.000]   Yeah.
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.440]   -My expensive printing of--
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:34.920]   -Right.
[01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:35.160]   -To--
[01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:39.960]   But it just shows you.
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:43.480]   Actually up to $17 million now.
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:44.680]   $67,000.
[01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:46.280]   -Oh, it's going up fast.
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:47.000]   -Up to $7 million.
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.280]   -Even as we're looking at it.
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:50.360]   67,000 backers.
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:53.480]   It's only day two of the Kickstarter.
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:55.560]   -So you get all four books for how much?
[01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:56.600]   $10, $17.
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:44:57.240]   -$40.
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:44:59.080]   $10 without a reward.
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:03.720]   $40 to get e-books, quarterly e-books.
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:06.840]   $60 you get audiobooks and e-books.
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:10.680]   $160 you get a hardcover e-books and audiobooks.
[01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:12.520]   So, yeah.
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:19.560]   And $220 you get all three formats of all four books.
[01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:22.520]   -It's like when Disney used to sell their--
[01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:25.720]   for five bucks extra, they would sell you the DVD,
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:28.040]   the Blu-ray and the digital version.
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:29.320]   I bet they don't do that anymore.
[01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:31.720]   -Each book is about--
[01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:32.920]   -It was a golden era.
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:34.600]   -Because now they're like, "What's the DVD?"
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:39.800]   Each book is 400 pages long, so these aren't little short books.
[01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:40.520]   You also get--
[01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:44.680]   So, you get a swag box each month.
[01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:46.280]   So, he's putting a lot of effort into this.
[01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:48.760]   -That's really neat.
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:49.800]   In other words, he's giving--
[01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:51.400]   -No, I should get this for Kevin.
[01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:52.840]   He's a huge Sanderson.
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:53.960]   -Oh, there you go.
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:55.880]   There you go.
[01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:56.920]   -I'm getting Kevin.
[01:45:56.920 --> 01:45:57.640]   -Yeah.
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:45:59.160]   -The other thing was that if you've done this--
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:01.560]   -You could also send him that kobo e-book reader.
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:02.680]   -[laughter]
[01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:05.960]   -That's what you just sort of put to the side.
[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:07.000]   -Just-- I'm just saying.
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:07.640]   -Where's the phone?
[01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:08.520]   -Where's the phone?
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:09.080]   -There's a phone.
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:10.200]   -There's a card just somewhere.
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:12.120]   [laughter]
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:13.400]   -It was just confusing.
[01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:14.520]   I was like, "What is this?"
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:15.640]   -I should have written a note.
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:16.760]   -This is not a phone.
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:18.280]   -I didn't put a note in there.
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:19.320]   I didn't put a return in there.
[01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:19.960]   -No, the book later.
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:20.760]   -There's just a box.
[01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:25.960]   -I figured it out pretty quickly when I saw the phone,
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:28.040]   but the reader was a surprise.
[01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:29.320]   -Yeah, just a little extra.
[01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:30.360]   When I sat out of a box,
[01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:31.560]   you never know what you're going to get.
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:33.160]   You might get a surprise in there.
[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:34.200]   Just saying.
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:35.240]   -Yeah.
[01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:38.200]   -Ford has announced that it's splitting its auto business
[01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:41.000]   into gas vehicles and electric vehicles.
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.600]   -Who wants to be in the past?
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:43.400]   -Isn't that interesting?
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:44.680]   -Yeah, who's going to buy?
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:46.440]   [laughter]
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:50.040]   -Well, I mean, there'll still be a market for a long time.
[01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:52.040]   -Everybody can't afford the EVs.
[01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:52.680]   -Yeah.
[01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:55.080]   There'll be a market for gas vehicles, I guess.
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:56.520]   -It's like the people who want to work in print.
[01:46:56.520 --> 01:46:57.560]   -Yeah, they can't.
[01:46:57.560 --> 01:46:59.320]   -Yes, like what can it print?
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:03.880]   -50 is my artisanal cord.
[01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:07.240]   [laughter]
[01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:08.600]   It's so title.
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:11.480]   -The Mach-E, which I have, has done pretty well for Ford.
[01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:15.720]   Well enough that they're very bullish on that.
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:17.320]   But I mean, honestly.
[01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:18.680]   -Didn't they do the lightning pickup prep?
[01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:21.640]   -F-150 is a huge business for Ford.
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:22.600]   -That thing's, yeah.
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:24.520]   -The electric is probably going to do very well.
[01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:28.760]   The stock market went up 5% on news of the reorg,
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:30.680]   so clearly the market likes it.
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:32.680]   They'll still be both under the Ford.
[01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:34.440]   I mean, it's kind of like Alphabet,
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:36.760]   but they're going to have two different divisions they plan to spend.
[01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:37.400]   -Super dealers?
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:39.240]   -Oh, that's interesting.
[01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:43.480]   You know, dealers have been the kind of the weak point in this EV thing.
[01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:49.880]   There are quite a few EV owners who get quarterly mailings from their dealers offering them
[01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:51.960]   oil changes, things like that.
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:52.360]   -Oh, yeah.
[01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:57.400]   -Both Lisa and I have experienced issues with all three of our electric vehicles getting them
[01:47:57.400 --> 01:47:58.040]   repaired.
[01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:02.920]   The dealers don't really -- I have a recall on my Ford that's been going on since December that --
[01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:04.120]   -The leases over get fixed.
[01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:06.120]   -Yes, leases is fixed and working fine.
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:06.440]   -Yes.
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:07.080]   -Perfect.
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:08.520]   But it really took a lot of --
[01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:09.960]   -It was overhauled.
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:11.560]   -Yeah, it was -- yeah.
[01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:14.840]   -And the dealer we bought it from didn't know what to do with it.
[01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:16.360]   They actually sent it to another dealer.
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:19.800]   And that's kind of -- I think that's the weak link in the chain.
[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:22.360]   So maybe they should have separated the --
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:25.080]   -You don't want your car dealer to say, "Well, I have to escalate you."
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:26.280]   That's not good.
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:26.520]   -Yeah.
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:27.640]   -Well, they did.
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:30.440]   They had to write to Germany to get the pot
[01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:34.120]   because it turns out it's a BMW underneath that.
[01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:39.240]   Are you -- if you're a Spotify fan, are you going to buy the car thing?
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:41.080]   -I'm not buying it.
[01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:41.960]   -I actually thought of --
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:41.960]   -No.
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:42.440]   -Yeah.
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:43.160]   -Oh.
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:45.080]   -I'm not a fan anymore.
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:46.600]   -I'm not a fan.
[01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:53.480]   This is like a -- you know, kind of a phone-sized device that's just for playing music from Spotify.
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:54.520]   I mean, most people don't --
[01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:55.240]   -Yes.
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:48:56.280]   -New cars don't need this.
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:57.240]   It's for older cars.
[01:48:57.240 --> 01:48:57.960]   -Okay. Wait.
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:48:58.760]   Wait, though.
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:48:59.160]   -Wait.
[01:48:59.160 --> 01:48:59.800]   -Okay.
[01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:00.200]   Hold on.
[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:00.680]   -But wait.
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:01.640]   -It was from the hand --
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:02.040]   -It rolled over.
[01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:03.080]   -For 90 bucks.
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:07.080]   My Tesla now integrates with Spotify, but
[01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:12.840]   because you have to create a separate email address to work with a car's account,
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:15.080]   this helps get around.
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:18.360]   So one, before my Tesla allowed for Spotify,
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:20.040]   you know, kind of --
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:20.440]   -You couldn't.
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:21.080]   -Yeah.
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:21.560]   -Yeah.
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:22.040]   -Yeah.
[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:24.200]   So it would have been handy then,
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:26.200]   and then it would still be handy just so --
[01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:29.160]   because like, man, every now and then, you know, the token renews,
[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:30.600]   and then suddenly it gets signed out,
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:35.080]   and we've got to go look up the special email, the special password, and --
[01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:37.240]   -This looks like a pretty nice little piece of kit, too.
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:38.280]   It's got a nice title.
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:39.240]   -And it's a nice -- yeah.
[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:39.240]   -Yeah.
[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:40.440]   It's got a good screen on it.
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:41.160]   It looks pretty nice.
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:42.760]   89.99.
[01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:43.720]   -For the money, I --
[01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:43.960]   -Yeah.
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:44.440]   -Yeah.
[01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:45.400]   -Yeah, it's not that much.
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:45.960]   -You couldn't -- you couldn't --
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:46.280]   -And --
[01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:49.000]   -Help destroy podcasts when you buy it.
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:49.240]   -Yeah.
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:52.280]   -Oh, Jeff.
[01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:55.160]   -The world is so unique.
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:58.680]   -Jeff and I -- before the show, Jeff and I had a long conversation about --
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:02.120]   I think -- I think honestly, Spotify is trying to kind of
[01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:05.960]   get rid of independent podcasting and bring everything under its roots.
[01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:10.680]   You know, there's only -- there's four bigs at this point, podcasting companies,
[01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:14.120]   because Spotify bought Gimlet and Amazon bought Wonderie.
[01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:16.680]   So Spotify, it's Amazon, it's iHeart,
[01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:19.640]   that does my radio show, so I just claim where I work for them.
[01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:20.120]   -Mm-hmm.
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:21.400]   -And Apple.
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:26.680]   -And honestly, I think that these companies are so big, so dominant,
[01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:30.680]   and we'll eat up all the advertising that there won't be a lot for independent
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:31.320]   podcasters.
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:35.320]   And that's my concern, is companies like mine probably not exist in the years.
[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:37.960]   -So people join the Friggin Club.
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:38.360]   -Yeah.
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:39.400]   -You got Ant there.
[01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:41.160]   -Let's buy the Club TV/ Club.
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:41.720]   -That's what --
[01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:44.440]   -You're going to see hosts in their PJs.
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:44.920]   -Yes.
[01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:45.720]   -I'm telling you --
[01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:46.600]   -Yes, it's awesome.
[01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:48.360]   -...the "club" -- "club" --
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:48.760]   -To it.
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:49.560]   -That's evil/club.
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:51.800]   -A little rate of independence from Spotify.
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:52.440]   -Yeah.
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:53.800]   Well, that's one of the reasons we did it.
[01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:56.040]   We knew that this was coming, you know, is that --
[01:50:56.040 --> 01:51:00.520]   And, you know, when I started to it, I really wanted it to be just no ads and users supported.
[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:02.440]   But the infrastructure didn't exist.
[01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:08.760]   I didn't think -- I don't think we've gotten the size we've gotten without advertising support.
[01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:12.280]   And I still think that's going to be the case going forward, so I worry.
[01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:13.800]   -Mm-hmm.
[01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:14.680]   -I agree.
[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:15.240]   I feel you.
[01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:16.920]   -Uh, but --
[01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:19.320]   -But it -- it's lots of stories.
[01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:22.680]   You know, like Amazon just announced that they're closing all their physical stores.
[01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:23.000]   -Not --
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.200]   -Yeah, isn't that interesting?
[01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:27.000]   -They're closing some of their bookstores.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:27.560]   -Bookstores.
[01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:28.760]   -The stores stay open.
[01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:31.000]   And they're fashion stores that they're trying to launch.
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:31.480]   -They're all other book.
[01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:33.960]   -And -- and that -- that --
[01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:35.320]   -They're -- they're all of the other stuff.
[01:51:35.320 --> 01:51:37.320]   -The ghost -- this doesn't include the ghost stores, right?
[01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:38.040]   The grab-and-go --
[01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:39.720]   -It doesn't include groceries, no.
[01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:39.880]   -Okay.
[01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:40.200]   -No food.
[01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:40.920]   -No stuff.
[01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:41.560]   -No food.
[01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:43.560]   -But it is 68 stores.
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:46.280]   Amazon books physical stores, Amazon 4-star --
[01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:46.760]   -Not got much.
[01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:48.600]   -The Amazon pop-up shops,
[01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:50.760]   which sold a variety of electronics on their hot items.
[01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:52.040]   That was kind of weird, right?
[01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:54.040]   Instead of going to Amazon, you'd go to the --
[01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:58.120]   the pop-up shop and you could see, like, the most popular items and buy it directly.
[01:51:58.120 --> 01:52:00.360]   I think these are all experiments at -- anyway.
[01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:01.240]   And --
[01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:03.320]   -Yeah, but they did have them --
[01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:05.480]   they have them in very nice shopping centers.
[01:52:05.480 --> 01:52:05.720]   -Yeah.
[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:08.520]   -I mean, like, the higher-end shopping centers are where you find those.
[01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:10.360]   So it's a little interesting for that space.
[01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:10.600]   -Yeah.
[01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:14.520]   -Uh, although shopping centers aren't doing all that well, are they?
[01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:15.000]   -No, no.
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.800]   -Well, shopping centers, like the open-air malls.
[01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:19.640]   And those are doing actually pretty well.
[01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:21.720]   -It's the -- it's the big indoor ones that are --
[01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:22.680]   -Yeah, the old-school ones.
[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:23.000]   -Yeah.
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:24.680]   -So they're all graveyards, right?
[01:52:24.680 --> 01:52:24.920]   -Yeah.
[01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:24.920]   -Yeah.
[01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:25.480]   -Yeah.
[01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:25.960]   -Yeah.
[01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:26.200]   -Yeah.
[01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:35.480]   -That brings us to this comparison of online versus physical store sales for Amazon.
[01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:43.240]   Last year, the numbers for last year, $17 billion in the physical stores,
[01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:46.600]   $470 billion online.
[01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:49.080]   So -- or overall total.
[01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:53.000]   So you could see it's a small portion of their overall revenue.
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.360]   I think it was just an experimental thing they were trying, right?
[01:52:56.360 --> 01:52:58.840]   -Yeah, I think pretty much --
[01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:00.040]   -And it's easy to --
[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:00.600]   -You know, like --
[01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:09.240]   -Well, in -- I mean, how many times I've bought one thing in one of the Amazon bookstores?
[01:53:09.240 --> 01:53:10.680]   -I have for you, someone.
[01:53:10.680 --> 01:53:11.160]   -Yeah.
[01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:11.560]   -Yeah.
[01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:15.720]   -Although I like going to our bookstore, our local bookstore in browsing.
[01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:19.640]   Well, in the Amazon bookstore experience was terrible.
[01:53:19.640 --> 01:53:21.880]   They're ills -- they're packed with people.
[01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:23.720]   The ills were small.
[01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:25.720]   I've never been in one that wasn't crowded.
[01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:28.040]   And then there's just crap everywhere.
[01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:29.000]   -I've never seen them.
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.800]   I've just seen the few mom and pop stores here in Santa Rosa.
[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:35.640]   There's some neat stuff like -- you know, if you like this, you'll like that.
[01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:38.440]   The problem is you can't browse for books anymore.
[01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:41.480]   All we have is Barnes & Noble, which its new CEO has at least improved that,
[01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:43.640]   but there's books that aren't there.
[01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:45.320]   And there's nowhere else to browse.
[01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:47.560]   And book reviews don't review books anymore.
[01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:49.480]   They have to have thumbs, suckers, and hot takes.
[01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:54.760]   And so I welcomed another place to browse and discover books.
[01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:56.920]   But --
[01:53:56.920 --> 01:53:58.760]   -You don't have local bookstores?
[01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:03.240]   -Very few -- I'm at the Burbs.
[01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:05.160]   I'm way out here.
[01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:07.480]   -Yeah, we only have one in Petaloma.
[01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:08.520]   -Only one?
[01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:11.720]   -I mean, I live on an island and I have one local to the island.
[01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:12.520]   -That's good.
[01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:14.120]   -Then I have a couple local bookstores.
[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:15.720]   Every island should have a bookstore.
[01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:16.760]   That seems like --
[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:17.560]   -Well, yeah.
[01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:18.520]   -Table stakes, real.
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:19.240]   -Sanity joke.
[01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:22.520]   TikTok -- I don't know if this is going to work.
[01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:28.600]   TikTok, which went from 30 seconds to three minutes not so long ago,
[01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:33.560]   is now going to increase the length of their videos to up to 10 minutes.
[01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:37.000]   Would you sit and watch a 10-minute video on TikTok?
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000]   -I wouldn't, but a lot of people will.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:39.880]   -I mean, watch the three minutes.
[01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:40.520]   -Yeah.
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:41.320]   -Really?
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:42.040]   -Yeah.
[01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:43.560]   -The TikTok hardcore people?
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:47.320]   -The thing is, you spend that much time on TikTok just scrolling up.
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:48.440]   -It's not the time.
[01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:49.800]   It's just, I don't know if I want to --
[01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:52.600]   I honestly, if it goes on too long, even like a --
[01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:53.160]   -Yeah, I agree.
[01:54:53.160 --> 01:54:53.560]   -I agree.
[01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:54.760]   -But that's you, though.
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:54:56.120]   But do you think the young people --
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:56.600]   -Maybe young people.
[01:54:56.600 --> 01:54:58.600]   -You're a fan of that find something that they like.
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:00.280]   They watch the whole video anyway.
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:00.680]   -Right.
[01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:03.480]   -And if it's -- if salt underscore a hank --
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:04.680]   -I should ask you what he thinks about it.
[01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:05.800]   -It's like, "For one all the way through."
[01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:05.960]   -Yeah.
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:08.680]   -They're probably watching his all the way through.
[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:08.840]   -Not.
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:10.440]   -Heesh.
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:12.200]   -I think even when they got longer --
[01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:13.240]   -The hank's thick is efficiency.
[01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:13.560]   -Yeah.
[01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:17.160]   When they got longer, he was reluctant to make his longer.
[01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:17.960]   -Oh, yeah.
[01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:20.040]   Well, that's different for his -- his shtick.
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:20.280]   -Yeah.
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:20.760]   -This is the thing that's --
[01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:21.560]   -It's all about the people.
[01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:22.120]   -That's --
[01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:24.520]   You know, you have like these --
[01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:26.040]   -There's all kinds of stuff on TikTok.
[01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:26.520]   I agree.
[01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:26.760]   -Yeah.
[01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:29.720]   -Like a lot of the social justice people
[01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:30.920]   are all over TikTok.
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:33.800]   They would probably get a huge boost out of this.
[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:35.320]   -You know?
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:36.200]   -It'll -- I mean, it --
[01:55:36.200 --> 01:55:39.880]   It doesn't -- I mean, you don't have to watch all 10 minutes.
[01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:40.920]   -No, you don't.
[01:55:40.920 --> 01:55:41.720]   -Is it interesting?
[01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:43.320]   It's kind of saying, well,
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:44.760]   you know, maybe we should be more like YouTube.
[01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:45.400]   -Like YouTube.
[01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:46.120]   -Yeah.
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:46.760]   It's interesting.
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:48.600]   -I think it's a shot across about YouTube.
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:48.920]   -Yeah.
[01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:49.720]   -Because then it --
[01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:50.040]   -But things have to put --
[01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:51.320]   -Don't go on for 10 hours.
[01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:51.800]   -Yes.
[01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:53.880]   -And puts it -- it puts it in a feed.
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:55.080]   -Yeah.
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:55.960]   Which I think is important.
[01:55:55.960 --> 01:55:56.200]   -Right.
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:59.080]   -Let's see.
[01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:01.720]   -Do you guys get an email from Facebook
[01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:03.880]   telling you to join Protect or --
[01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:05.640]   -I would if I had a Facebook account.
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:06.840]   -Oh, there's that.
[01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:08.040]   -Yeah.
[01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:08.280]   -Yeah.
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:09.160]   -Facebook.
[01:56:09.160 --> 01:56:10.760]   -Wow. You're the only one, Jeff.
[01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:11.640]   -Jesus.
[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:12.600]   -Oh, man.
[01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:14.360]   No, man.
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:15.640]   -That is fascinating.
[01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:16.920]   That is telling right there.
[01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:18.600]   That's a news story.
[01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:22.440]   -I have -- I actually have a site account,
[01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:25.560]   and we did get a notification, but it was linked.
[01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:26.680]   -What was the notification?
[01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:27.080]   -What is it?
[01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:27.560]   -What is it?
[01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:28.040]   -What is it?
[01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:28.520]   What is it?
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:29.720]   -It's agent said, confirm.
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:29.720]   -It's agent said, confirm.
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:30.040]   -You don't sign up for Protect.
[01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:32.280]   -What does Protect?
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:32.520]   -Go ahead.
[01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:34.120]   -It's crew fact.
[01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:35.800]   -It's two-factor.
[01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:36.360]   -Oh, good.
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:36.520]   -Yeah, authentic.
[01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:37.320]   I was like --
[01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:38.760]   -I didn't tell me to sign up.
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:41.880]   It just wanted me to confirm that I was protecting my account.
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:43.960]   It did look like a fishing email, though.
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:44.840]   -No.
[01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:46.520]   -Well, it absolutely did.
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:49.640]   And I'll let me find the email if I can.
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:51.560]   And that's not helpful.
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:54.440]   -Well, that's kind of -- I was like,
[01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:56.760]   "Well, this feels dodgy."
[01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:57.240]   -Yeah.
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:01.320]   -But then we went to the page itself,
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:03.000]   and looked, and it was fine.
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:06.520]   -Yeah, basically said you're a media --
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:07.800]   A lot of people were getting it,
[01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:09.560]   but you have a popular -- I can maybe sell some of this.
[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:10.200]   -Ah.
[01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:12.120]   -You have a popular site.
[01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:12.520]   -Yeah.
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:16.120]   -And you could be attacked by bad actors.
[01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:19.080]   Ergo, we're going to require you to do Protect.
[01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:21.640]   And if you don't buy it, it's heard us.
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:22.280]   Here it is, found it.
[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:23.800]   Hi, Jeff.
[01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:25.800]   I love how they know it's nice.
[01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:27.080]   -Oh, yeah. My dear friend, because they know you.
[01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:27.560]   -That's nice.
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:32.440]   -Your account has the potential to reach a lot more people
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:34.280]   than the average Facebook user.
[01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:35.080]   Whoa!
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:36.840]   -You make me feel big.
[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:41.000]   -Hackers are often motivated to attack accounts
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.800]   that have a lot of followers, like me,
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:46.200]   run important pages.
[01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:47.000]   Well, yes.
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.880]   Or hold some community significance.
[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:51.400]   I'd like to think I do.
[01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:53.720]   To help defend against these targeted tasks,
[01:57:53.720 --> 01:57:56.040]   we require Facebook Protect for your account.
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:57:59.560]   Turn off Facebook Protect by 17 March,
[01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:00.680]   for the PR European.
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:04.600]   After that, you'll be locked out of your account
[01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:05.560]   until you enable it.
[01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:06.280]   All right.
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:08.120]   So, I, by presumption, was phishing.
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:09.240]   -Now, hold on.
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:12.040]   -I asked him, "Do they close that with a nice tea?"
[01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:14.920]   You know, they were all warm and fuzzy to start.
[01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:16.440]   Then they went and said, "Recwire,
[01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:18.840]   and you better do it now or else."
[01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:20.440]   And then they'd say, "Well, have a nice day.
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:21.240]   You're such a nice--"
[01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:22.760]   -Well, it still makes me feel special.
[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:23.320]   -There we go.
[01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:27.640]   -Because it says, "Note, Facebook Protect isn't available to everyone."
[01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:28.280]   -There we go.
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:29.240]   -That's the sandwich.
[01:58:29.240 --> 01:58:31.480]   -We require strong security for your account,
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:34.840]   because it has the potential to reach a large audience.
[01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:35.400]   -Yeah.
[01:58:35.400 --> 01:58:37.640]   Thanks so much to Facebook team.
[01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:39.240]   So, anyway, so I click on the thing,
[01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:40.360]   turn on Facebook Protect.
[01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:41.560]   Oh, all right.
[01:58:41.560 --> 01:58:41.880]   All right.
[01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:44.360]   And all it does is take me through,
[01:58:44.360 --> 01:58:45.960]   like, "Well, this is what Facebook Protect is."
[01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:48.760]   And then it says, "You already have two factor identification,
[01:58:48.760 --> 01:58:49.560]   so you're okay."
[01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:50.600]   -Well, shouldn't there be some--
[01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:52.120]   -Shouldn't your database know that?
[01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:52.600]   -I know that.
[01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:53.560]   -And not send this to me?
[01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:53.960]   -Yeah.
[01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:56.840]   -But it made me feel so important that I feel better now.
[01:58:56.840 --> 01:58:57.800]   -That's great.
[01:58:57.800 --> 01:59:03.080]   -I wonder, I think, you know, I'd heard that
[01:59:03.080 --> 01:59:07.880]   a lot of this would be happening because of the war
[01:59:07.880 --> 01:59:09.880]   that everybody was a little bit concerned about,
[01:59:09.880 --> 01:59:13.240]   cyber warfare and a lot of companies were saying,
[01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:15.560]   "Let's lock down a little more than usual."
[01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:17.400]   I would guess, anyway.
[01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:21.880]   -Can I put in one extra story that I found interesting?
[01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:23.640]   -As long as it's not the wheel of fortune.
[01:59:23.640 --> 01:59:25.960]   -Did you watch that, though?
[01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:26.680]   -Did you watch it?
[01:59:26.680 --> 01:59:28.440]   -We all watched it.
[01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:29.320]   -I haven't done this.
[01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:30.680]   -The whole internet watched it.
[01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:33.640]   -All six million views of what is this?
[01:59:33.640 --> 01:59:35.160]   Everybody knows what the puzzle is,
[01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:39.320]   but two people go bankrupt and finally the guy solves it.
[01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:41.320]   And what's the moral of this message?
[01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:43.560]   -Americans are--
[01:59:43.560 --> 01:59:45.160]   -Don't speak the same language.
[01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:48.280]   -No, you are ignorant because you don't understand what's going on here.
[01:59:48.280 --> 01:59:56.440]   Murph Griffin designed this show to incent the on-screen contestants
[01:59:56.440 --> 01:59:57.720]   not to solve the puzzle.
[01:59:57.720 --> 01:59:59.560]   The more they spin, the more they can make.
[01:59:59.560 --> 02:00:04.440]   And he designed it because it would make the people at home feel smart
[02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:06.840]   because they're sitting going, "It's feather in your cap.
[02:00:06.840 --> 02:00:08.200]   It's feather in your cap."
[02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:12.040]   And these doofuses who are playing on-screen,
[02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:13.960]   they know it's a feather in your cap.
[02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:16.200]   -Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:17.480]   you're wrong in the sea.
[02:00:17.480 --> 02:00:19.960]   -Because she guessed wrong.
[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:20.360]   -Yes.
[02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:21.800]   -She said I'll solve.
[02:00:21.800 --> 02:00:24.360]   -And it was a feather in your map.
[02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:25.560]   -A feather in your map.
[02:00:26.360 --> 02:00:28.120]   -That's why this is--
[02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:28.920]   -Oh, that's good.
[02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:30.040]   -I can tell you didn't watch it.
[02:00:30.040 --> 02:00:30.440]   -That's good.
[02:00:30.440 --> 02:00:33.480]   -It is special because she solved wrong twice.
[02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:34.280]   -Did somebody--
[02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:38.360]   -She was a dean of students at some college.
[02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:38.360]   -No.
[02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:41.240]   -Maybe she never heard that phrase of feather in your dap.
[02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:42.760]   And she didn't know.
[02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:45.720]   That's what it was, right?
[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:46.120]   -But your right--
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:47.640]   -I'm sorry, is it feather in your gap?
[02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:48.120]   -That's right.
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:48.520]   -Yeah.
[02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:49.000]   -Okay.
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:50.680]   -This is first person effect.
[02:00:50.680 --> 02:00:52.760]   -There's lots of--
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:53.480]   -That's the word.
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:55.480]   -There's lots of academic studies for this.
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:57.000]   -There's third person effect,
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.160]   which says, "Well, you're all going to be
[02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:01.720]   corrupted by disinformation and porn out of me."
[02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:03.000]   -I'm somehow immune.
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:04.760]   First person effect is,
[02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:06.280]   "I'm smarter than everybody else.
[02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:07.240]   They're stupid."
[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:09.400]   The entirety of TV, game shows--
[02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:10.680]   -It's designed that word.
[02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:11.560]   -And it's designed that word made--
[02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:11.640]   -Yes.
[02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:12.520]   -First person effect.
[02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:13.480]   -Except for Jeopardy.
[02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:14.040]   -Except for Jeopardy.
[02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:15.000]   -Except for Jeopardy.
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:15.320]   -Yeah.
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:18.040]   -Which makes you feel horrible.
[02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:19.320]   -Yeah, Jeopardy makes you feel--
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:20.360]   -Yeah, it's a lot of time.
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:21.320]   -Really.
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:22.520]   -No, it's great.
[02:01:22.520 --> 02:01:24.760]   When you do well at Jeopardy, you're like,
[02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:25.640]   "Hutty."
[02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:28.520]   -I love that show, but I hardly ever do well at it.
[02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:29.560]   But I do enjoy watching it.
[02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:30.520]   -Yeah.
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:33.960]   And we'll wrap up on a sad note.
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:34.520]   The--
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:36.280]   -I can't have the story I was going to do.
[02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:37.320]   -Oh, go ahead, please.
[02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:38.200]   That was the sad note.
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:39.320]   -It's quick. It's quick.
[02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:40.680]   I found this interesting.
[02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:45.160]   The copyright review board refused to grant copyright
[02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:47.080]   to art created by AI.
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:47.480]   -Right.
[02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:52.280]   -And they said that ownership by the machine
[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:53.320]   was not sufficient,
[02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:55.560]   and that--
[02:01:55.560 --> 02:01:57.400]   -We're going to go here in their view.
[02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:01.000]   -That there's a presumed human
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:04.600]   touch to it.
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:06.280]   -To present--
[02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:07.880]   -There was founded for,
[02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:08.840]   quote,
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:13.320]   that are founded in the creative powers of the--
[02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:15.400]   and they put in brackets, human mind,
[02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:17.160]   which is to say the law didn't say human.
[02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:19.080]   It didn't anticipate unhuman--
[02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:20.040]   -Yeah, they hadn't.
[02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:22.840]   -Yeah, the copyright law predates any of the say-i stuff.
[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:24.920]   -Well, 1710 starts.
[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:25.320]   -Yeah.
[02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:25.880]   -Right?
[02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:29.720]   So it's weird because this thing doesn't look like it was a very good argument
[02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:30.200]   on its behalf.
[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:31.240]   Maybe it's just a test case.
[02:02:31.240 --> 02:02:32.200]   That's why they were doing that.
[02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:34.280]   But what it says--
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:37.000]   because they also go to an 1880 something case
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:41.400]   where somebody printed a photo
[02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:44.520]   and they tried to argue that the photo was not the creation of human being,
[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:45.480]   it was a creation of machine.
[02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:47.160]   -Well, it wasn't--
[02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:47.880]   -There are a whole--
[02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:51.560]   -For raw about the photo that was taken by the monkey, the gorilla.
[02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:52.200]   -Yeah.
[02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:54.200]   -And who owned the copyright to that?
[02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:55.320]   -It's like that here, monkey.
[02:02:55.320 --> 02:02:56.280]   -But the monkey could--
[02:02:56.280 --> 02:02:56.920]   -Photographer.
[02:02:56.920 --> 02:02:57.640]   -Yeah.
[02:02:57.640 --> 02:02:58.360]   -It has to be human.
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:02:58.840]   -It has to be human.
[02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:00.040]   -I found this really interesting.
[02:03:00.040 --> 02:03:02.520]   -I think that's very human-centric.
[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:03.240]   I don't like it.
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:03.800]   -It is.
[02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:04.200]   It is.
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:04.440]   -Yeah.
[02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:06.440]   Let's power to the--
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:07.000]   -It's human--
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:07.400]   -It's human--
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:08.040]   -It's humanist.
[02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:09.080]   -It's humanist.
[02:03:09.080 --> 02:03:10.040]   -It's very leoist.
[02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:12.040]   [laughter]
[02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:12.840]   -Leoist.
[02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:12.840]   -Leoist.
[02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:14.040]   -It's actually a Leo.
[02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:14.280]   -Yes.
[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:17.640]   I have Leoist as well.
[02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:19.320]   But that's impossible.
[02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:19.960]   -Leoish.
[02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:21.400]   -I have Leo--
[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:21.720]   -That's--
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:22.840]   -Leoist is Leo--
[02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:22.920]   -Leoist.
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:23.320]   -I--
[02:03:23.320 --> 02:03:24.360]   -Is Leo--
[02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:25.000]   -As--
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:25.880]   -Kiv--
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:26.680]   -Is to Kiev.
[02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:27.240]   -That's right.
[02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:27.800]   -Kiv--
[02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:28.360]   -Yes.
[02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:31.720]   -So the problem with Leo is it's got an E with oxontagu.
[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:36.840]   And so that always gets translated into a weird Unicode string.
[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:39.000]   So you can't use it for a domain name.
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:39.880]   It's not--
[02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:40.520]   It's not good.
[02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:41.560]   I tried.
[02:03:41.560 --> 02:03:43.560]   But everybody laughs at me when I do.
[02:03:43.560 --> 02:03:45.160]   Oh, look.
[02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:46.520]   It gets a nice picture, though.
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:48.040]   [laughter]
[02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:49.240]   -That's how it goes, too.
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:50.280]   -That's what it goes to.
[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:50.920]   I don't know why.
[02:03:50.920 --> 02:03:53.240]   Maybe because I asked his Iceland.
[02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:54.520]   Is this a picture of Iceland?
[02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:56.360]   That's very odd.
[02:03:56.360 --> 02:03:58.440]   I didn't put that there.
[02:03:58.440 --> 02:03:59.240]   -Sure you didn't.
[02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:01.400]   [laughter]
[02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:02.840]   -That is weird.
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:03.960]   Oh, that's Leo is.
[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:04.680]   That's the problem.
[02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:06.600]   I need to do Leo is, see.
[02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:07.640]   Anyway.
[02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:09.320]   I think I've told--
[02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:11.000]   -Thank you for anybody who has a little story.
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:11.880]   -I thought you'd know.
[02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:12.440]   -I think that--
[02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:13.000]   -I thought you'd know that.
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:14.200]   -Well, would you agree, though,
[02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:17.320]   that AI should probably not be able to be given copyright?
[02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:17.960]   What--
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:19.000]   -Well, I don't know.
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:19.720]   I think they should--
[02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:21.320]   -What's the entity and what's the purpose?
[02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:22.840]   What's the--
[02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:24.120]   -Well, then--
[02:04:24.120 --> 02:04:26.040]   -The thing about copyright is--
[02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:27.080]   Go ahead, please.
[02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:29.320]   -Well, I was going to say,
[02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:30.360]   if I've got copyright,
[02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:31.400]   then I can make money on it.
[02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:33.560]   So if I'm a person who invents an AI
[02:04:33.560 --> 02:04:35.720]   who can write something that's copyrightable,
[02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:36.680]   or produce something that's--
[02:04:36.680 --> 02:04:38.120]   -Then the person should get the copyright.
[02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:38.840]   -Then I'll--
[02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:41.640]   -Then I end up with the money and the copyright.
[02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:42.120]   -Right.
[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:43.800]   -No, here's the deal.
[02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:45.320]   So copyright was created,
[02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:46.920]   not to protect authors.
[02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:49.480]   It was created by the publishers,
[02:04:49.480 --> 02:04:50.440]   the booksellers,
[02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:51.960]   to create a tradable asset.
[02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:54.600]   They couldn't own the asset and sell it,
[02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:56.840]   unless I own something as the author
[02:04:56.840 --> 02:04:58.680]   and granted it to them.
[02:04:58.680 --> 02:04:59.080]   And then,
[02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:00.840]   "Act sells it to you, Leo."
[02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:01.720]   And that's the why.
[02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:02.680]   So what's going to happen here,
[02:05:02.680 --> 02:05:03.240]   I think,
[02:05:03.240 --> 02:05:04.280]   is Stacy's right.
[02:05:04.280 --> 02:05:05.640]   I'm going to go create an AI
[02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:08.520]   that's going to pump out tons of NFTs.
[02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:09.400]   -Yeah, that's exactly what the ball--
[02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:11.000]   -I want the ball to be tradable assets.
[02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:12.600]   -That's exactly what's happening today.
[02:05:12.600 --> 02:05:13.800]   -That's what Netflix does already.
[02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:15.080]   -Exactly.
[02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:17.000]   -It's basically an algorithm
[02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:18.600]   deciding what movies they create.
[02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:21.240]   So, okay, yeah, I can see that.
[02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:22.200]   -That's a point.
[02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:23.320]   That's interesting, Stacy.
[02:05:23.320 --> 02:05:25.160]   Would you buy a cookbook
[02:05:25.160 --> 02:05:28.600]   based on--
[02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:28.920]   -Yes.
[02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:31.400]   -Yeah, of any kind.
[02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:32.120]   But maybe--
[02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:33.240]   Think about this.
[02:05:33.240 --> 02:05:37.320]   Based on 50 recipes found in the world's biggest email leaks.
[02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:39.240]   Email leaks.
[02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:40.360]   -That would be no, sir.
[02:05:40.360 --> 02:05:42.840]   - Featuring wiki leaks.
[02:05:42.840 --> 02:05:45.560]   And Hillary Clinton, as well as the pizza gate scandal.
[02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:46.120]   Exchanges--
[02:05:46.120 --> 02:05:46.760]   -Hottapostas.
[02:05:46.760 --> 02:05:49.080]   -Between staff and the world's most influential companies
[02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:50.520]   like Enron and Sony.
[02:05:50.520 --> 02:05:53.160]   The leaked recipes, cookbook, showcases.
[02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:55.560]   50 recipes, including the very best cookie.
[02:05:55.560 --> 02:05:58.120]   And a secret barbecue sauce among others.
[02:05:58.120 --> 02:06:00.280]   It's not just a cookbook.
[02:06:00.280 --> 02:06:02.040]   It's an insight into office culture,
[02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:05.960]   politics, corruption hacking, family, and friendship.
[02:06:05.960 --> 02:06:06.360]   -A lot.
[02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:08.760]   -I would 100% buy it.
[02:06:08.760 --> 02:06:10.840]   It would be a great gift to give someone like me,
[02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:12.760]   who is a journalist who also likes to cook.
[02:06:12.760 --> 02:06:15.080]   I would just say that would be--
[02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:16.840]   That's a fun gift, I think.
[02:06:16.840 --> 02:06:17.640]   -It's interesting.
[02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:19.640]   -Because it's cool to see.
[02:06:19.640 --> 02:06:21.000]   -Yeah.
[02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:22.520]   Because it's the whole--
[02:06:22.520 --> 02:06:23.480]   It has the email.
[02:06:23.480 --> 02:06:26.840]   The author made the recipes.
[02:06:26.840 --> 02:06:29.800]   -I was going to say, are these tested?
[02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:30.200]   -Yes.
[02:06:30.200 --> 02:06:31.080]   -That's important.
[02:06:31.080 --> 02:06:32.840]   -Yes. In fact, the images are hysterical.
[02:06:32.840 --> 02:06:34.600]   Here's pecan and pumpkin bread with a
[02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:38.680]   pocket computer associated with it.
[02:06:38.680 --> 02:06:42.120]   This is 35 euros from JBE Books.
[02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:44.680]   It's written by Demetria Glass.
[02:06:44.680 --> 02:06:46.680]   And some of these are--
[02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:46.840]   -Yes.
[02:06:46.840 --> 02:06:48.120]   -Some of these recipes have redacted.
[02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:48.360]   -Yes.
[02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:49.560]   -Oh, boy.
[02:06:49.560 --> 02:06:51.720]   I love the pictures.
[02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:54.920]   -Yeah, you should redact celery in anything.
[02:06:54.920 --> 02:06:58.120]   -Mums the way.
[02:06:58.120 --> 02:07:00.280]   -I think these are--
[02:07:00.280 --> 02:07:01.640]   I mean, just think about it.
[02:07:01.640 --> 02:07:02.120]   -Is that clever?
[02:07:02.120 --> 02:07:04.840]   -I have this instant flashback to all the recipes
[02:07:04.840 --> 02:07:06.440]   I've shared with people via email.
[02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:06.920]   -Yeah.
[02:07:06.920 --> 02:07:07.880]   -So, or Slack.
[02:07:07.880 --> 02:07:08.680]   -Yeah.
[02:07:08.680 --> 02:07:09.080]   Yeah.
[02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:10.520]   -I think that's good.
[02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:15.640]   -Thank you to cocky.org for discovering that one.
[02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:19.000]   From Demetria Glass and photographer Emily Balz,
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:20.920]   the leaked recipes cookbook.
[02:07:20.920 --> 02:07:24.760]   -[imitates a sound]
[02:07:24.760 --> 02:07:25.160]   -That's the name.
[02:07:25.160 --> 02:07:26.360]   -That's the name.
[02:07:26.360 --> 02:07:27.400]   -Think of the week?
[02:07:27.400 --> 02:07:28.280]   -Or are we still--
[02:07:28.280 --> 02:07:29.320]   -Yes.
[02:07:29.320 --> 02:07:30.120]   -I can do what?
[02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:30.440]   -I just--
[02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:30.600]   -I can do what?
[02:07:30.600 --> 02:07:31.480]   -We're going to do a thing of the week.
[02:07:31.480 --> 02:07:33.240]   I just want to mention in passing,
[02:07:33.240 --> 02:07:34.680]   I had never heard this guy's name.
[02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:36.360]   He was co-inventor of Ethernet,
[02:07:36.360 --> 02:07:38.680]   passed away at the age of 71.
[02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:47.480]   He was an intern at the Xerox Park Research Lab in 1973.
[02:07:47.480 --> 02:07:49.800]   One afternoon in the basement of the lab,
[02:07:49.800 --> 02:07:52.120]   he noticed another researcher tinkering
[02:07:52.120 --> 02:07:54.280]   with a long strand of cable.
[02:07:54.280 --> 02:07:58.280]   The researcher, another new hire named Bob Metcalf,
[02:07:58.280 --> 02:08:01.480]   who we do know, was exploring ways of sending information
[02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:03.480]   to and from the lab's new computer,
[02:08:03.480 --> 02:08:04.760]   the Alto.
[02:08:04.760 --> 02:08:07.400]   Mr. Metcalf was trying to send electrical pulses down the cable.
[02:08:07.400 --> 02:08:08.920]   He was struggling to make it work.
[02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:12.200]   Mr. Boggs offered to help.
[02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:13.160]   Over the next two years,
[02:08:13.160 --> 02:08:15.560]   they designed the first version of Ethernet.
[02:08:15.560 --> 02:08:21.240]   -Surprisingly, even though Bob Metcalf mentions Ethernet
[02:08:21.240 --> 02:08:22.840]   every time you talk to him,
[02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:25.080]   he has never mentioned this fellow.
[02:08:25.080 --> 02:08:25.800]   -Well, that's the thing.
[02:08:25.800 --> 02:08:27.160]   I never heard this guy's name.
[02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:30.200]   Metcalf did say in an interview with the New York Times
[02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:31.880]   he was a perfect partner for me.
[02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:33.480]   I was more of a concept artist.
[02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:36.200]   He was a build the hardware in the background engineer.
[02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:38.920]   Everybody who has the idea needs somebody who can make it.
[02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:43.480]   So Boggs was, I guess, Mr. Metcalf's Burke.
[02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:45.160]   He was the guy who...
[02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:45.640]   -He was the guy who...
[02:08:45.640 --> 02:08:47.480]   -He was his was.
[02:08:47.480 --> 02:08:48.600]   -He was his was.
[02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:49.240]   -Yeah.
[02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:49.720]   -Yeah.
[02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:52.840]   So that's, you know, we should mention it.
[02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:59.640]   David Reeve's Boggs passed away at the age of 71 this week.
[02:08:59.640 --> 02:09:03.560]   Also, we're heading to that point where we pretty regularly are being
[02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:06.040]   tribute to people who are and read the technologies we're using now.
[02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:06.040]   -Yeah.
[02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:07.000]   They're in more and more.
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:10.680]   We're getting that time of life.
[02:09:10.680 --> 02:09:10.920]   All right.
[02:09:10.920 --> 02:09:11.880]   Let's take a little pause.
[02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:13.000]   A little breath, a little breather.
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:16.520]   I was going to mention the new UCIE Chipplett standard.
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:20.520]   I was going to mention the success of RISC-V.
[02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:23.400]   All of these were stories to welcome Stacey back.
[02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:28.600]   But, you know, just read her, you know, Stacey on IoT newsletter.
[02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:29.960]   I'm sure she'll talk.
[02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:32.840]   I had put a lot of chip stories in here to celebrate your return.
[02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:33.720]   -I did see that.
[02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:36.120]   I was like, "Oh, I feel like I'm needed."
[02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:37.800]   -What is UCIE?
[02:09:37.800 --> 02:09:39.480]   What is that?
[02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:40.280]   -I have no idea.
[02:09:40.280 --> 02:09:40.600]   -Okay.
[02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:43.800]   It's a STIG.
[02:09:43.800 --> 02:09:45.800]   AMD Intel and ARM supported.
[02:09:45.800 --> 02:09:48.120]   It's always an interconnect.
[02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:49.080]   Universal...
[02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:49.640]   -Oh, this is...
[02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:50.200]   -Okay, yeah.
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:50.200]   -This is...
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:50.680]   -Okay, yeah.
[02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:51.000]   -This is interconnect.
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:54.520]   -This is not something I know about.
[02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:55.320]   -Frestrea.
[02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:57.960]   -This is because it was launched today.
[02:09:57.960 --> 02:09:58.760]   -Yes.
[02:09:58.760 --> 02:09:59.560]   All right.
[02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:02.360]   We'll be hearing about it tomorrow on Stacey on IoT.
[02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:02.920]   -Yeah, let me know.
[02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:06.280]   Let me read about it today's business that I was recording my show for.
[02:10:06.280 --> 02:10:12.840]   -Let us pause when we return the picks of the week, the things of the week,
[02:10:12.840 --> 02:10:14.440]   and that sort of thing.
[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:21.960]   Let's kick things off with Stacey Higginbotham and her thing of the week, Stacey.
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:28.520]   This week's thing is actually an app helping or because of a thing.
[02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:34.680]   So Apple AirTags, we all know and love or are worried about being stocked by.
[02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:39.160]   And we've talked about how Apple released an app for Android users.
[02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:46.200]   But a German engineering school, no, a German university,
[02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:49.320]   that's the word I'm looking for, has released, I'm looking for it.
[02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:52.760]   An Android monitoring app.
[02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:56.440]   I thought there was going to be an ad for me to look this up.
[02:10:56.440 --> 02:10:56.920]   Sorry y'all.
[02:10:56.920 --> 02:10:59.400]   -I did it very fast.
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:10:59.960]   -This is a quick answer.
[02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:00.280]   -Just...
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:01.480]   -I was like, oh my God.
[02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:03.720]   -This doesn't make you crazy.
[02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:08.920]   Apple released its own Android app, Tracker Detect, which really isn't that good.
[02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:10.840]   And it's an issue.
[02:11:10.840 --> 02:11:14.840]   If you have an iPhone, the iPhone will say there's an air tag tracking you.
[02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:16.840]   But if you don't have an iPhone, you're kind of in the dark.
[02:11:16.840 --> 02:11:17.320]   -Mm-hmm.
[02:11:17.320 --> 02:11:17.800]   -So good.
[02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:20.280]   What is this app called?
[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:22.280]   I
[02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:32.120]   Can't find it so good
[02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:39.560]   Oh
[02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:49.600]   It's an ad protection app for Android. Oh yes and they built it big and they're making it better
[02:11:50.240 --> 02:11:56.400]   It does seem to be a little bit more active now because it's on an Android phone. It doesn't go off
[02:11:56.400 --> 02:12:03.280]   It's gonna notify you much less often because it doesn't have access to the Bluetooth controls. I guess
[02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:05.560]   but
[02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:11.080]   You get a notification and it you're also part of a giant research project. I should tell you
[02:12:11.080 --> 02:12:16.840]   When you download this app and like a hundred and twenty five thousand people downloaded it so far
[02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:21.800]   You become part of their research into this and they're very upfront
[02:12:21.800 --> 02:12:26.320]   You have to share all your location permissions even while the app is not being used
[02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:29.000]   So you may get a little weirded out by that
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:32.280]   just so you know and
[02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:35.800]   But it seems to be really good. It's it's notified me
[02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:40.280]   My husband put an air tag on me for wandering around over the weekend. It worked
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:44.080]   I also got a random one that I realized was my friend that I was hanging out with
[02:12:45.240 --> 02:12:51.920]   So yeah, I don't know it seems to be pretty good and
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:13:02.760]   I have to ignore battery optimization, that's a Samsung thing. I'm just doing it on my pixel - you did okay
[02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:07.040]   Yeah, I had to yeah, I'm participating in the study. I'm all set okay
[02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:12.560]   And now it will tell me if there are trackers in my neighborhood, huh? That's cool. Yeah
[02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:18.280]   So it shows me like here all the air tags that have been discovered in my neighborhood or around me lately
[02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:23.420]   So it tracks all that it's tracking right now. Let's see because there are quite a few
[02:13:23.420 --> 02:13:26.240]   Air tags in this environs
[02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:28.240]   Let's see if it finds any
[02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:33.920]   No, it didn't here. Let me put let me just put this air tag right on top of it
[02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:37.160]   And
[02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:38.680]   Give it give it a minute
[02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:45.520]   This is the problem I had with the Apple device as well the Apple app for Android and I maybe it's a it's a limitation of I was
[02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:51.240]   Gonna say Android let it run for half an hour. Okay, and then see if you don't find it, okay
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:56.800]   But it's not something you could walk into a room and see air tags in the room because it's not what this is
[02:13:56.800 --> 02:14:01.720]   That's not what the original app is designed to do. Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, and what's nice
[02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:06.720]   It does allow you to ignore some so if you have some of your of your own you would want to do it
[02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:09.160]   Okay
[02:14:09.160 --> 02:14:12.440]   Okay, oh I had I have to turn on BLE
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:18.920]   Which was not on so that was not on so maybe that was part of the part of the problem
[02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:23.760]   Let's do another manual scan with Bluetooth a little energy turned on ants doing it as well
[02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:29.360]   Did you find anything
[02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:36.320]   No, no show all devices kind of a same problem I had with the Apple app again
[02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:39.800]   Check it in half hour. I'll leave it right in the back or an hour. Yeah, yeah
[02:14:39.800 --> 02:14:45.640]   Yeah, cuz you're gonna it'll it'll pop up mine didn't pop up with anything even though there are air tags hanging out with me
[02:14:45.640 --> 02:14:49.680]   You know constant Apple's doing everything you can and to be fair
[02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:52.920]   There are even better ways to do this like you know
[02:14:52.920 --> 02:15:00.240]   These little inexpensive GPS devices which are much more accurate the reason that's air tags are in issues because there's so many iPhones out there
[02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:10.440]   They're so ubiquitous that it really is it's the same reason it works that Google cert like Google getting your name and Google search engine is such a problem for people because
[02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:12.680]   Everyone uses it
[02:15:12.680 --> 02:15:16.200]   Anyway, that was my thing
[02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:19.080]   Excellent, excellent
[02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:25.680]   Jeff do you want to I see you tweeted about Ukraine radio you want to is that one of your things or oh no
[02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:29.840]   I'm just about that tweeted it because I'm ticked out crinkle cake ticked out crinkle
[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:32.280]   That we could do ticked out quickly
[02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:42.160]   BBC just announced they're gonna start shortwave in Ukraine and Russia which I want I don't know how that do you have you have a shortwave radio?
[02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:47.040]   I do I think me I wonder if they're more common in other countries when I was a kid
[02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:51.280]   That was the best thing to do in fact I listen to radio Moscow all the time. No, I do too
[02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:57.040]   It's yeah, I wonder how many people have shortwave these days in communist. Yeah, we're right. It's right. It's right. Yeah
[02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:02.000]   No, I I decided to do this week in in crypto
[02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:09.400]   Because we have the the Guardian test runs a an NFT vending machine
[02:16:09.400 --> 02:16:13.280]   I put it in my quarter and nothing came out
[02:16:13.280 --> 02:16:23.080]   You don't get anything when you when you buy it you get some kind of box or something saying you're a schmuck
[02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:33.880]   There are only two products you could buy a color for five dollars and ninety nine cents and a party pigeon for our four hundred twenty dollars and sixty nine cents
[02:16:33.880 --> 02:16:36.120]   Har har
[02:16:36.120 --> 02:16:41.240]   Wow, this is this is basically a scam. I would guess
[02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:47.760]   Although it's a book you know, it's smart because by having the party pigeon four to twenty dollar
[02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:53.160]   Thing the five ninety nine for a color seems like a deal. Oh, yeah, I think I'll rack up
[02:16:53.960 --> 02:16:59.680]   Oh, well, I'm not obviously you have to be an idiot to buy the party pigeon. Let's just buy the color. It's almost six dollars
[02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:05.360]   Right. Mm-hmm. Then we also have elsewhere in in the cool land a
[02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:09.880]   Social club says the New York Times runs on crypto tokens and vibes
[02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:19.760]   Friends with benefits get it is a VIP lounge for crypto is creative class. Oh, it's just like the anodevi foundation
[02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:27.360]   Say it's for con artists. It's gonna have great great artists and we are going to have wonderful food everywhere
[02:17:27.360 --> 02:17:34.200]   Friends with benefits VIP lounge for cryptos creative class, man. Those are the people I want to hang out with
[02:17:34.200 --> 02:17:37.440]   It's a dow of course now
[02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:42.600]   The chef the chef is named belly man
[02:17:48.120 --> 02:17:50.120]   Six thousand unique token holders
[02:17:50.120 --> 02:17:53.600]   Dang
[02:17:53.600 --> 02:17:56.320]   It raised ten million dollars from investment last year
[02:17:56.320 --> 02:17:59.240]   Including who else but at recent Horowitz?
[02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:06.920]   Yeah, cuz they're the big pushers of all of this, you know, I have a theory here. So I'm working on a proposal for something I
[02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:14.000]   Wonder how different the internet would be and our attitudes toward it would be if it weren't run by
[02:18:15.080 --> 02:18:23.080]   Bro these these guys well not to but bros. Yeah, bros man. This club is really run down
[02:18:23.080 --> 02:18:31.520]   Okay, yeah, I can't wait to hang out with these guys
[02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:38.200]   That looks so much fun. Do they have a space heater in there some is what is that? Yeah, there's a little space heater
[02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:47.040]   Yeah, this is a quality quality place. So they debate things like whether to spend twenty thousand dollars from the treasury to develop a members
[02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:50.280]   Only subscription coffee service sure. Why not?
[02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:53.920]   It's just money sinking in your cup
[02:18:53.920 --> 02:18:57.480]   And
[02:18:57.480 --> 02:19:02.440]   You're old and old Bob Dylan is getting in the NFT train
[02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:07.800]   Right, this is yours. Yeah, that's mine too. Yep
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:12.840]   Post the wrong article because I only see stuff about the whole house. I see the
[02:19:12.840 --> 02:19:17.680]   You post an article about why the Ramones never had any hits
[02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:23.920]   Which is fascinating, but they just they should have some FTS. Yeah, oh hell
[02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:28.440]   What we're sorry Bob Dylan is getting into NFTs with snow crash
[02:19:28.440 --> 02:19:34.240]   Yes, you know I could see how somebody like Dylan could be talked into you know
[02:19:35.680 --> 02:19:42.240]   Maybe you can make some nice if you have your own alcohol. You probably have your own NFT exactly so
[02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:47.520]   Oh, there's gonna be a miles Davis NFT as well
[02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:51.920]   This is a Solana marketplace called snow crash
[02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:57.240]   Well, what can I get a Bob Dylan NFT drop?
[02:19:57.240 --> 02:20:03.760]   I put it on 195 I found it just doesn't really seem like a good use of my
[02:20:04.760 --> 02:20:06.760]   Do it I haven't oh

[02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:36.600]   So I saw that in my inbox today and then next I want to shout out miss Terry Terry Porter
[02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:44.760]   I met miss Terry this weekend you were on a sailboat. I saw a sailboat was very jealous and with my buddy Chris Michael
[02:22:44.760 --> 02:22:51.160]   I love oh man. It was so much fun. I was invited by flip board and Mr. Jefferson Graham
[02:22:51.160 --> 02:22:55.880]   Who's been on a show before just to come out and do a little photo shoot on the boat?
[02:22:55.880 --> 02:23:01.240]   Oh, do we have any pictures from aunt Pruitt? I put some in my little flip board gallery
[02:23:01.240 --> 02:23:06.720]   Oh nice line, but miss Terry was this little old lady. She was so funny and
[02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:12.680]   Just had a good time and she knew about twit cuz she used to watch iOS today and
[02:23:12.680 --> 02:23:17.760]   She said she remembers watching twit when she first got her iPad and I enjoy it twit
[02:23:17.760 --> 02:23:19.000]   But I just wanted to give her a shout out
[02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:25.000]   She was just a nice lady and just fun to talk to and we didn't freeze out there in the water like I thought we would
[02:23:25.640 --> 02:23:28.480]   I got home and my bed was spinning but
[02:23:28.480 --> 02:23:37.800]   After after you've been on a boat my bed was spinning wasn't rocking spinning. I was so sick
[02:23:37.800 --> 02:23:43.920]   But you weren't sick on the boat just when you got home boat and it's probably because I was driving a whole lot
[02:23:43.920 --> 02:23:47.580]   Oh, yeah, yeah, I love this picture of you
[02:23:47.580 --> 02:23:50.040]   Did Chris Michael take this that was yep?
[02:23:50.040 --> 02:23:55.920]   Yeah, and it must be his Leica. Yeah, I love it that he let the dot be read and everything else is Monica
[02:23:55.920 --> 02:24:02.000]   I love that shot. I love that shot. I had the best dad gun time and I remember sitting there
[02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.480]   Just thinking you know, this is a photo
[02:24:04.480 --> 02:24:07.400]   Opportunity for me, but here recently
[02:24:07.400 --> 02:24:10.960]   I don't know if it's because of the way covet has made us think differently
[02:24:10.960 --> 02:24:16.480]   But I had to put my camera down and I just take it in and just just enjoying the moment
[02:24:17.080 --> 02:24:22.840]   But it's just the one to best times of my life. It's fun. It was a sailboat. Yeah on a sailboat isn't that nice?
[02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:26.360]   Oh, it was great, but I some years ago before your time
[02:24:26.360 --> 02:24:29.240]   we bought an auction a
[02:24:29.240 --> 02:24:34.680]   sail around the bay on the in Humphrey Bogart's old sailboats that
[02:24:34.680 --> 02:24:41.280]   Somebody at the school auctioned off a ride around the bay and we took the twit team. There's a long time ago
[02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:44.120]   But we took the tweet team and went out in the sale
[02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:48.280]   It was really so I it was really fun and getting that very sunset
[02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:51.320]   You know and being able to watch the sunset on the bay there
[02:24:51.320 --> 02:24:57.320]   It's just just beautiful and I put I put a couple shots up on my site for for prints if people want to order them
[02:24:57.320 --> 02:24:59.320]   Hit pro at comm slash prints
[02:24:59.320 --> 02:25:04.200]   But it was just a great great nice nice and
[02:25:04.200 --> 02:25:11.760]   Lastly, I want to say good luck to the little weirdo and the hard head is what's going on with a hard head?
[02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:14.240]   This is her opening week for track season. Oh
[02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:17.840]   The niece yep my little niece
[02:25:17.840 --> 02:25:23.760]   She's wanted she wanted to learn how to do hurdles so I taught her on that and she's doing really dad. I'm good
[02:25:23.760 --> 02:25:28.840]   I can't wait. I'll see what she does. I like to make the camera distort every time she steps
[02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:32.600]   That's fun
[02:25:32.600 --> 02:25:37.240]   I've had a lot of fun working with her and the coaches have been working with her and I'm just just
[02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:41.080]   Really popped up about it in the hard head. He's wanting to defend his title
[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:46.280]   He he pulled a hamstring last week, but he may still be able to run this week
[02:25:46.280 --> 02:25:48.280]   We'll see but this is my little new better
[02:25:48.280 --> 02:25:55.800]   You can turn the audio. Oh, yeah, I should because there's probably some screaming involved probably ants screaming
[02:25:55.800 --> 02:25:58.800]   So pearls of wisdom
[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:00.800]   That's beautiful
[02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:08.640]   And then he wanted to do a trailer for himself. Oh, this is hysterical. I saw this. This is good aunt. This is so much fun
[02:26:10.680 --> 02:26:13.080]   Oh, it's great. What do you use for the effects?
[02:26:13.080 --> 02:26:20.400]   Let me see that was a mix of stuff and resolve as well as in premiere. I love that the boom boom
[02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:23.880]   I have no life. So I sit around it. It's really great doing
[02:26:23.880 --> 02:26:28.480]   I love every time she steps it goes boom
[02:26:28.480 --> 02:26:32.840]   She's gonna crush it though
[02:26:32.840 --> 02:26:38.840]   Are you the coach I am oh nice
[02:26:38.960 --> 02:26:43.760]   You're right back now because you are running you're not jumping. That's right
[02:26:43.760 --> 02:26:46.880]   That's words of wisdom from coach Pruitt
[02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:50.080]   Yes coach
[02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:53.360]   So she's gonna go over that hurdle
[02:26:53.360 --> 02:26:59.400]   Get it get it get it. Oh, yeah, that's scary. She did she got it. She did it. That's hard to do
[02:26:59.400 --> 02:27:06.640]   I'm pretty pumped. Can I get can I get you ant to do some sound things for me when I'm doing my workout?
[02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:08.640]   If you could just be like
[02:27:08.640 --> 02:27:14.520]   I got you they should build that like when I'm doing my
[02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:17.800]   meter row
[02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:23.880]   That'd be good and I pay for that that's not enough keep pulling
[02:27:23.880 --> 02:27:31.160]   There we go exactly because like you get you get to that last 500 you hit that you know 1500 marketing
[02:27:31.160 --> 02:27:34.400]   Diane everything and you need
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:39.640]   But you got to do it appropriately, you know, you got you got 500
[02:27:39.640 --> 02:27:44.600]   But you know you're still got like three and a half more minutes of ruin you got to do so these four kids
[02:27:44.600 --> 02:27:48.040]   I'll tell you then they love and hate our relationship
[02:27:48.040 --> 02:27:53.720]   I'll just say that because they want me to help them out. Well, I could turn you off when I'm done
[02:27:53.720 --> 02:27:57.600]   If you're in my whoop band I could just
[02:27:57.600 --> 02:28:00.640]   I'll be like and we're done

[02:30:33.180 --> 02:30:35.180]   Can I interview Burke? Oh
[02:30:35.180 --> 02:30:39.500]   God, baby that'll do it Stacy. We'll interview you. How about that?
[02:30:39.500 --> 02:30:42.500]   I don't know anything about well, I don't know
[02:30:42.500 --> 02:30:48.620]   Stories to tell you know what he's from Texas. So you two get along really well together. I think he does
[02:30:48.620 --> 02:30:54.740]   He likes the same science fiction books as I do so. All right, Burke Burke Burke
[02:30:55.460 --> 02:30:58.500]   When I officially got the title I
[02:30:58.500 --> 02:31:03.900]   Had already said hey, I want I want to talk to these guys. Yeah, they kept looking people here's our names
[02:31:03.900 --> 02:31:08.220]   But they don't get to know. No, we don't want to be on there smart. They realize the hazard
[02:31:08.220 --> 02:31:15.020]   What about what about scooter X? Scooter X - yeah our chat manager. Yeah. Yeah, maybe some others in the chat
[02:31:15.020 --> 02:31:21.420]   Yeah, I think the chat the chat mods kind of like to stay anonymous. Yeah, they don't they don't want to be out
[02:31:21.420 --> 02:31:24.340]   That's true. They've been targeted. They get a target on their back
[02:31:25.340 --> 02:31:31.380]   But I think Oz Ned and scooter X and some of the others would be fantastic you can do one of those those, you know
[02:31:31.380 --> 02:31:33.780]   Change the voices
[02:31:33.780 --> 02:31:37.700]   Yeah

[02:31:49.180 --> 02:31:53.500]   I will I will mention his gory
[02:31:53.980 --> 02:31:57.980]   I'll mention a quarry that you're gonna do that maybe we get him to pop in as the author
[02:31:57.980 --> 02:32:03.780]   It will be cool Paul Therat at the end of the month. He can he can leave the book club actually if you want if you
[02:32:03.780 --> 02:32:11.820]   And I could just really didn't get the idea here
[02:32:11.820 --> 02:32:18.780]   Be like pulling out Marshall McPlew and saying you have no idea you have no idea what my work means
[02:32:20.180 --> 02:32:26.740]   So if you're not a member club, there's nothing of my work nothing of my work. How did you get to be a professor?
[02:32:26.740 --> 02:32:30.740]   If you are not a member club to it to a TV slash club to it
[02:32:30.740 --> 02:32:36.060]   It really is the best seven bucks. You'll spend this mess, right? It's it's fantastic. Just one coffee a month
[02:32:36.060 --> 02:32:39.900]   Yeah, that's where you can put the image of me searching for the
[02:32:39.900 --> 02:32:49.780]   Mistakes that is a meme I've already I've already we gotta add that to our animated gift collection
[02:32:50.580 --> 02:32:54.060]   Wow, that's a great meme. I should have that in the morning

[02:33:10.660 --> 02:33:18.900]   Says the what oh that thing you threw in the box that thing as it was going out the door. I've been using it as a coaster
[02:33:18.900 --> 02:33:20.900]   Oh
[02:33:20.900 --> 02:33:27.300]   Okay next time I'll put something better in you got the flip the flips a pretty good thing
[02:33:27.300 --> 02:33:32.340]   That's a nice thing. I I'm not looking a gift horse in the map. I just was confused. I was like
[02:33:32.340 --> 02:33:36.180]   This too. I didn't want this. I never asked really
[02:33:36.180 --> 02:33:39.540]   Later as I did it. I thought well this could be good
[02:33:39.540 --> 02:33:44.580]   I could have a reputation as kind of a wag that when you I send you things
[02:33:44.580 --> 02:33:48.740]   They throw extra stuff in the in the box and just you never know what you're gonna get
[02:33:48.740 --> 02:33:53.460]   I do think there's a business in getting a Leo box unsubscribed. Oh, yeah. Yeah
