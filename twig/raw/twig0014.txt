[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.300]   You're not going to go out trick or treating this.
[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.800]   No, I'm probably going to stay home and tail my server logs.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.100]   Well, let me ask you, do you like tail 100 or do you go for a little bit more?
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.200]   I do a tail that dash F and you take the.
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.000]   How to go, you know, do the whole thing.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.200]   Yeah, yeah, just, you know, you're a while.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.700]   And then kind of watch it, you know, fly by.
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.900]   It makes me make me feel happy.
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.500]   That's my treat.
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.000]   I'll leave.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Jeff is completely underwhelmed by this conversation.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.300]   Jeff Jarvis is also here from buzz machine dot com, our resident journalist and expert on the new media.
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:21.100]   And of course, my Halloween costume, playing like an expert, an expert and also the author of what would Google do, which is in its 1000th and.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.900]   Seventy third printing right now.
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.000]   We wish lost track.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.200]   Did you guys see the?
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.700]   I just thought this was wonderful.
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.900]   The Google story video that was on YouTube.
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.800]   Yeah, wasn't that nicely done?
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.500]   What's the story?
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.300]   Is that a is that a an ad?
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.100]   What are they doing there?
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.100]   No, I think it was some like agency that did it.
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.900]   But I don't know.
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.800]   But it's pretty good.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.800]   Oh, I didn't see it.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.300]   What?
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.800]   What is it?
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.800]   It's, um, they, I guess they, um, it looks like it's 3D graphics, you know, character graphics.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.600]   Of the history of Google.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.500]   So it starts with the book and it, and you turn the pages and it's just, it's, it's literally, it's nothing that you don't already know.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.700]   It's just the history of Google.
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.400]   But it's so beautifully done.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.900]   I thought, well, why would somebody put so much effort into this unless I don't know, it's an ad or something.
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.300]   Yeah, that looks really nice actually.
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.600]   So, you know, they've been doing, they've been doing a little more like they did their first TV commercial, right?
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.100]   Didn't Jeff, didn't you mention this last week?
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.300]   They really don't, they haven't done commercials.
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.800]   So, uh, for enterprise.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.600]   Oh, right.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.600]   Friend of a going Google, the going Google campaign.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.100]   Right.
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.400]   There have been billboards.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.400]   I saw billboards in the Silicon Valley a few months ago.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:36.100]   So, but yeah, the first TV ads, they, they bought some time on one of our podcasts for, uh, and I thought this was the first time I'd ever heard an ad from Google.
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.300]   And that was for the Google summer of code last summer.
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.100]   So they're getting a little, you know, you wouldn't think Google would need to advertise.
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.300]   Yeah, that's always been their thing, right?
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:54.400]   That they don't really need to advertise and so you don't see, you know, you wouldn't see commercials for them or you wouldn't see the kind of big, you know, like Yahoo has those big huge billboards all through New York.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.600]   And, uh, but, you know, but yeah, this is interesting.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.500]   This definitely looks like something you'd see on TV, although it's kind of long.
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.100]   It's long.
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.800]   It's too long for a regular TV ad, but it's just really slickly done.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.200]   I don't know.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.300]   Might just, you know, it could easily be just a spec ad.
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.100]   Somebody just did.
[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.100]   Well, we'll just show how good we are.
[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.000]   Speak.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.800]   Now, as long as you're on the internet, kids, go to Google, at least you're listening to this show on Halloween in any way, go to Google.com.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.200]   And you'll notice something a little special.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.300]   The E in the Google has a nice little piece of candy.
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.200]   But what way the rest is ghostly, but wait, there's, yes, but wait, there's more.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.400]   Click it and the candy multiplies.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.100]   But wait, there's more.
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.200]   Click it again.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.500]   The.
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.500]   Here says a surface of candy more candy than you could possibly eat.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.800]   But it's all wrappers and the cute.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.800]   And then you click it again and it's all gone.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.300]   All.
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.000]   And then you make a point with your dentist.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.100]   Yeah, they should have.
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.100]   Now, what are the search results?
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.700]   Maybe they are.
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.000]   That would be funny if it were dentist.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   No, it's Halloween.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.200]   It would be funny if it was dentist less things.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.700]   Like.
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.200]   You might want to check in with your dentist.
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.000]   They have a great sense of humor, I have to say.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.600]   And who now is Marissa Meyer in charge of these little.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.500]   Isn't she in charge of everything?
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.200]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.500]   She said charge of the user interface.
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.700]   So I'm on a page.
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.600]   So I'd imagine that this is this is under her jurisdiction.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:31.100]   Yeah, my for new season in New York, the only then goes to Halloween, 2009 search.
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.900]   And my only ad is from an Afghan restaurant that has free pumpkin turnovers.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.300]   It's your order of two main entries.
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.900]   Doesn't always work.
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.600]   No, I'm being told in our chat room that there are in Hulu, there's ads for Google Chrome.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.300]   I think that is another thing that Google's been advertising is Chrome switch to Chrome.
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:59.600]   Yeah, yeah, I bet you they see those though more as public, you know, public good ads as opposed to commercials
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.300]   because I think that they're really trying to foster a move towards HTML5 and Chrome is just there.
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.500]   You know, what do you call it?
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.100]   Virgin horse.
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.800]   Yeah, stalking, stalking.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.300]   What do you call it?
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.000]   Stocking dog, stalking, calling, stalking what?
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.300]   Horse horse, stalking horse.
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.100]   Yes.
[00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:20.800]   Sorry, I'm not really good on my on my metaphors from the steps.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.400]   Google voice is offering invites now.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.300]   I got a three on my Google voice account.
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.100]   And you can use Google voice with your regular phone number now.
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.300]   That's you mean like number portability.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.900]   And some of the features you can you can I just saw it.
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.700]   I saw it moments before showtime.
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:46.900]   It's on the on the front feed feed, but if you give up a few bits of functionality,
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.500]   but you can use Google voice mail and such with your regular mobile number.
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.200]   Yeah, it doesn't you don't get the full features of a regular Google voice account,
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.900]   but you give it you basically give it your your phone number.
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:03.200]   And then what it does is you program your phone, your cell phone to forward calls,
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.100]   incoming calls to Google voice mail.
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.400]   So it's basically Google voice mail.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.000]   It's not quite a full Google voice account.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.700]   And so what you get is you get a Google voice mail, which means that the voice mail
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.000]   gets stored in Google voice.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   They transcribe it.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.100]   They can eat, you know, it emails it to you or SMS is it to you, which is which is really handy.
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.200]   And I'm actually really excited.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.600]   I set up myself on to do it.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.800]   Your cell phone has to support or your service has to support forwarding.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.300]   You have to be able to forward calls that you're you know,
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.300]   so it basically takes a voicemail away from your carrier entirely and forwards it to Google.
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.800]   You know, I have an iPhone.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.000]   And so of course I don't want to do that because the visual voicemail in the iPhone is so good.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.300]   But yeah, if you have a Google phone, that might be something you'd want to do this.
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:45.200]   This is the G1 treat Google voice differently than than other phones.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:51.700]   It will have the Google voice app, you know, app installed the official app installed on Android.
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:57.200]   So when I get voicemail, you know, or SMS messages, I get notifications, you know, on the phone,
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.000]   just like I would, you know, anything else and I can preview.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.800]   I can see, you know, it's just like visual voicemail.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.100]   I can see who sent it as well.
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:08.300]   I can get the transcript just by browsing my list of voicemail and SMS all in one interface.
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.800]   So not only do I see who called and have to tap it to listen to the voicemail,
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:17.500]   I can, you know, I can glance at a preview of the transcript, which is which is for me is awesome
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.900]   because I hate listening to voicemail.
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.300]   Yeah, no, I like the transcripts.
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.900]   Although there it's actually you may like it for this reason.
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.200]   It's kind of a puzzle to figure out what what they're actually saying.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.700]   It is only about one word and three is actually correct.
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:32.700]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.100]   When your Armenian cousin stays and takes messages for you.
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:35.500]   Yeah.
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:36.800]   But it's fun.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.400]   It's, you know, I don't mind.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.900]   Maybe I bet you, Gina, because you're kind of like me, I bet you like solving puzzles.
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.000]   I actually enjoy the challenge of what the hell is this supposed to be?
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.400]   Yeah, you know, on the in the Google Voice app, you can, when you play the message back,
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.200]   it shows you the transcripts, highlights the words as the person speaks.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.400]   You can actually see like you can watch it, you know, to see how good their transcription is,
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.200]   which I enjoy because it's just kind of fun to see like, oh,
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.800]   they thought that word was that word.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.900]   You know, it's kind of like karaoke or something, you know, the lyrics.
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.000]   Yeah, it's the bottom of the screen.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.400]   It's a feature.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.600]   How good is how good is a Google Google Voice transcription?
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.100]   Not very right.
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.500]   It's not, but you know, fun to play along.
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.800]   It's it and it usually is enough for you to get the gist.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.600]   It is you get the gist for sure.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.300]   On the iPhone, does it do this on the on Android on the iPhone?
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.200]   It highlights the numbers.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.400]   So at least you can call that number back.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.100]   Yeah, you can easily return a call.
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:31.800]   Makes it very easy.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.200]   Just press the button and it returns it.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:41.100]   So there are finally some new Android phones out and there's some real excitement
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:45.500]   around the first from Verizon, the droid, which is the Motorola Sholes.
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.800]   Did you get a look at it at all, Gina?
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.500]   I didn't get a chance to look at it.
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.100]   I read lots of the reviews and I've been, I've been holed up this week,
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.200]   finishing off a project.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.300]   So I didn't get a chance to get out there.
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.700]   Have you, did you get your hands on one?
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.600]   You were going to get one right away.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.800]   I was going to get one right away.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.600]   And I know some reviewers got one, but I'm not on that magic list.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.300]   Oh, Malek was not impressed.
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:03.700]   Really?
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.200]   What did he say?
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.800]   He said it for the iPhone killer.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.600]   This isn't it.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.500]   I had this vision that actually there's a whole bunch of people out there
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.800]   who are waiting for the Messiah.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.500]   Yeah, it's kind of like that or Godot, one of the other.
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:14.900]   Yeah.
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.600]   Then when I tweeted that from home, somebody, a few people said, no,
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.200]   the iPhone killer will come from Apple.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.300]   Well, all made a good point.
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:27.100]   Does it have to be this kind of binary thing where it's either the iPhone
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.000]   or the iPhone killer?
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   I mean, is in their room for something else.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.900]   Well, you're stuck with the phone for two years.
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:32.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.200]   That's the problem.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.200]   You want to buy it after it.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.600]   That's a good point.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.500]   That is a good point.
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.200]   And in fact, that's part of the reason why I haven't run out to the store is like,
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.800]   I have to finish out my contract and, you know,
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.600]   if I walk into the store, I'm going to sign up for another freaking contract
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.100]   and have two wireless bills and I use my Google voice number anyways.
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:49.500]   It's going to be fun.
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.700]   You know, it's just like, I don't want to even attempt myself.
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.100]   And I try to go with the late early adopter crowd.
[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.800]   Like I'm never, I never want to be like the canary in the coal mine.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.300]   I always like to wait for like, you know, version kind of two.
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.400]   So I feel like I want like version two of droid.
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.000]   So I don't know if that's going to be what would hopefully it's going to be spring next year.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Do you know, would you pay the non subsidized rate for it to get a droid?
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.300]   If you could get it without contract.
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.600]   So what is it?
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.600]   It's $600.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.100]   Boy.
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.600]   So yeah, it's a lot.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.200]   I mean, you know, I paid for my G one, you know, the full, well, I got a little bit of discount.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.700]   I worked a little bit of a deal with a friend, but I paid a lot more than the subsidized price
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.600]   because I want to switch over.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.600]   But now I probably wouldn't do that again because the G one.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.000]   So it would only work on Verizon anyway.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.800]   It's not GSM.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.400]   So right.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:32.900]   Right.
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:33.700]   Well, that's another problem.
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:34.800]   It's not a world phone, is it?
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:35.600]   Right.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:35.900]   Yeah.
[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.000]   And like I'm, you know, I'm going to London in a couple of weeks and there'll be a problem.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.300]   There's an HTC handset that'll be out soon to the Aries, which is another Android phone from Verizon.
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:49.200]   That HTC typically makes kind of multi band phone.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.200]   So maybe it will work.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.300]   That's a problem with Verizon in general.
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.600]   It's a confusing array of phones now.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.800]   I think last week TechCrunch had the, had the post with all the phones in it and it's quite a shopping spree.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.600]   It's interesting how long it's taken the phone industry to respond to the iPhone.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.000]   It took them a couple of years.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.800]   The first few attempts like the sprint instinct and the BlackBerry storm were such flops.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.500]   I mean, they just, they looked like an iPhone.
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.200]   That was the only thing they had going for them.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.300]   And I think that it's probably going to be an Android phone.
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:23.500]   Although I ordered, I did order a Nokia N 900, which is not running.
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.600]   I saw you say that.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.100]   Yeah.
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:25.600]   Why?
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.400]   It looks, it's a very powerful piece of hardware.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.100]   It's really a tablet PC with phone capability.
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.500]   It's a big little sucker.
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.900]   It's not as big as it looks.
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.700]   It's thicker because it has a slide out keyboard.
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.500]   That's one of the things about the droid that's kind of interesting.
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.200]   It's not much thicker than an iPhone, but it has a slide out keyboard.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.100]   So it's a very thin phone.
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:50.400]   This, this 900 is thicker, but it's running MIMO, which is Nokia's version of Linux, just as Android is Google's version of Linux.
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:55.900]   It does support all Linux applications, you know, with some modifications.
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.100]   I presume that's kind of like Android in that respect.
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.800]   It has touch, has a lot of nice features.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:10.500]   And I bought it because of, as we mentioned last week, this new T-Mobile, you know, all you can eat plan that doesn't require a contract.
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:11.700]   I like that idea.
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.800]   So you're paying an unsubsidized price.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:18.100]   You're paying 600 bucks for the N 900, but you don't have to, you don't have to commit to it.
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.500]   Yeah, that's, that's nice.
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:26.000]   So when you say it runs Linux apps, I'm told it runs Linux apps pretty much unmodified.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.500]   Oh, huh.
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.700]   Yeah, huh.
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:32.000]   Is it locked to T-Mobile or completely unlocked?
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   It's completely unlocked.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.800]   It's not from T-Mobile.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.300]   I just bought an unlocked US version that runs well on the T-Mobile network.
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:41.400]   And nobody sells those Nokia phones.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:41.900]   Right.
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.500]   The T-Mobile mind, I mean, it's really, it looks like it was designed for T-Mobile.
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:49.700]   It's on the 1700 megahertz frequency, which is T-Mobile's 3G network.
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.000]   So it's almost like it was meant for T-Mobile.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.500]   But no kids smart that way.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:55.900]   I don't know.
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.400]   I think it's I this is going to be my dark horse.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:06.300]   And with another horse analogy, Leo, Leo's, Leo's, ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be my dark horse candidate as opposed to the droid.
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.000]   That's why I wanted to get it to my droid.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.900]   So I didn't have to.
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:13.800]   I I'm definitely I'm going to I'm going to check it out.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.800]   I'm all right.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.000]   Well, we'll we'll do a head to head.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:17.600]   We will.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:23.000]   Now one thing that is important for any of these phones to succeed is some sort of application store.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.300]   What's the Eclair Android app store look like?
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.100]   Is it improved?
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.300]   You know, I haven't I haven't checked out.
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.600]   I haven't I'm not running a Claire right now, which is Android 2.0.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:42.400]   And I'm not sure that the app store, the market is I'm not sure exactly what the improvements are to the apps to the Android market.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.500]   I mean, listen, that the big problem with the Android market.
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:50.900]   Is that they're just you know, there just isn't the selection of apps and high quality apps that there is the app store, right?
[00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:56.000]   So hopefully if the droid gets more popular, you know, the more popular platform more people can develop for it.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.900]   So that's really what's you know, what's what's important.
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.700]   The market is still I have a little trouble with it.
[00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:08.400]   I wish that it notified me of updates on my phone a little better, but it has improved since just in in donut.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:13.200]   So hopefully in Eclair will see see even more updates from more really what we need is more applications.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.500]   That's what's going to make the market better.
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.500]   I tried cupcake.
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:21.800]   So they're asking in the chat room, did is Gina and cost him or did you just forget to change before she came?
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.200]   The glasses are just freaking me out.
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.600]   This is how Gina dresses.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.500]   Yeah, sure.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.500]   She wears protective eyewear and lab coats as she hangs around the house.
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.200]   Perhaps I should take off the protection.
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.100]   No, I like them.
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.100]   Let let let Jeff be freaked out.
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:35.700]   It's OK.
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.500]   It's OK.
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:37.500]   He can handle it.
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:44.200]   So the reason I asked about a store is because we got news this week that there's going to be a Google wave app store.
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:46.200]   Yeah, that's an interest.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.500]   Very interesting idea.
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.700]   Very interesting.
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:49.100]   Yes.
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.000]   So what's the point there?
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:57.300]   Well, Google saying that they, you know, they want developers to develop for wave and they want to set up some sort of revenue sharing.
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.500]   Developers have been asking about it ever since we've launched.
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:11.700]   I mean, I think the app store just, you know, the eye, the iTunes app store just created all these opportunities for developers to make money for, you know, small, you know, small amounts of money for each app sale and and they want the same thing from Google.
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.900]   And so so this is going to be great.
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:17.900]   I mean, it's going to be big incentive for developers to develop for wave.
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.700]   And so it is a way to make money for developers.
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.900]   It's not merely a way to find plugins.
[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.900]   It is a way to make money.
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:30.800]   Lars said that there will be there are going to lay are looking into doing revenue sharing, figuring out a system for revenue sharing.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:36.300]   So yes, you should, you know, be able to purchase apps from, you know, from the purchase extensions.
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:36.800]   I'm not sure.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.700]   So wave extensions are gadgets and bots.
[00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.900]   So it's going to be we're going to have to figure out how that, you know, it all works.
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.400]   It might be a while out.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:47.100]   But yes, you are going to be able to buy wave extensions as well as just find them.
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.300]   I think it's pretty important for the ecosystem.
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.000]   Yeah, I do too, for sure.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.700]   I'm trying to figure out how that works.
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:59.800]   So who would be the most likely to buy them if you're running a wave server and you're running services enterprise or whatever.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.800]   That's where you're going to buy them.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.900]   Yeah, you know, it's a really good question.
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:09.000]   It's like, is it the server administrator who wants to be able to install them for all of the servers users?
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.200]   Or is it going to be the end user who says, I want to use, you know, the ribbon gadget.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.400]   So I'm going to spend two bucks and then I'm going to be able to use it with my with the people who I wave with.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:22.300]   Yeah, but then do the other people you wave with have to buy the same thing?
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.300]   Well, yeah, I mean, that's the issue.
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.900]   It's got to be in both ends.
[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:26.400]   We're not.
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:26.900]   Yeah.
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.000]   I mean, well, that's the way the way gadgets work is when you add a gadget to a wave.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.200]   The people everybody who's on the wave can see that gadget.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:37.200]   Bots are another kind of extension that you can you have access to and you can add to the wave.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.700]   So I mean, they could restrict bots to just, you know, use by the people who paid.
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.500]   I don't know how they would do that with gadgets.
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:51.000]   It seems like they should be able to do some sort of server administrator can buy a license for so many users for a certain extension, but the servers are federated.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.100]   So people are going to have access to them.
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.500]   So it'll be really interesting to see like how this is going to play out.
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:18:05.700]   It was interesting to if somebody can kind of generously buy a, you know, I create the better wave for my group for some reason.
[00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.900]   And I become more popular because I did that.
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.500]   Yeah, interesting.
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.300]   You know, because if it's a map, if it's a map,
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.900]   gadget, then everybody can see it.
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.100]   Right.
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:15.400]   Right.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:22.300]   So you would only you could make a beautiful wave that you created by using gadgets that you purchased that not everybody has to own.
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.700]   I see.
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:24.100]   Yeah, I see.
[00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:30.800]   But everyone who participates on the wave in theory should be able to use that gadget, but you can access, you know, so why create a wave with my gadget and I add you to it.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:35.100]   You can you can look at and use and manipulate the gadget in whatever way.
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.200]   Oh, so that makes sense then.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.000]   If it's not a double ended thing, then it makes a lot of sense.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.500]   Yeah.
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:39.800]   Right.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:40.400]   You're right, Jeff.
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.200]   You hit the nail on the head.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:45.000]   There's this this this kind of competition to make the best.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.100]   I've got the cool way.
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:46.600]   Yeah.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.600]   Oh, I've got the cool wave with the really cool gadgets.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:49.400]   I see.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:49.700]   Right.
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:50.400]   Right.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:58.700]   And so it becomes interesting then to see that if wave does become a media thing as I keep predicting to know, and I keep waiting for.
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:03.800]   Then the cool publisher is going to want to have the coolest wave.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:05.700]   Yeah.
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:11.100]   I mean, I kind of think about wave extensions like WordPress plugins, you know, that you know, you can add that.
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.400]   Add to your installation and make them do stuff on your site.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:29.500]   So so so yeah, it could work that way, although this is totally all speculation like the word that there would be an app store for for wave came through kind of second hand through like a Google developers conference meet up in in London this week and and but there was definitely a quote from large
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.900]   Westminster saying that they're that they're looking into revenue sharing.
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.500]   If that's something definitely on there on the radar.
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.700]   So it's not so there.
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:38.100]   I also saw a rewind that the Federation plans are about out.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.200]   Are they?
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.200]   Yeah, read right.
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:42.600]   That's it.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:47.100]   I don't darn I didn't put it on me because I was one of those things where I figured I could ask you what the hell I'm doing.
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.400]   I don't know if I'm on a bookmark this.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.600]   You got to tell me what it means first.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:51.600]   I had no idea.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.000]   I forgot.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:00.800]   Well, that's a big that's a big deal because it means that people who run other people who are running wave servers besides Google can federate their content with other servers.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:01.300]   Right.
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.300]   Because right now the only Google wave server is wave.
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.200]   Google.com.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:04.500]   Right.
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.800]   And actually there's another one.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:11.800]   The developer sandbox is is waved at Google.com slash a sandbox.com.
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.200]   So there are two sort of there are two wave servers in existence right now.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.800]   They cannot talk to one another because Federation is not ready yet.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.200]   Here it is.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:21.900]   And so Federation being ready is a huge thing.
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.400]   They're getting ready to open up this.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.300]   This is a rewrite web according to next web.
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.000]   Don't you love links?
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.800]   You never know who really originated the story.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.300]   I mean, how come as early as today and that was on the 30th.
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.500]   So never mind that.
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:47.700]   An open protocol update at Google spokesman just told us the company will have more news about the launch of the wave Federation program early next week.
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:52.000]   Ah, yeah, that's that mean that's that's really exciting.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.800]   I'll bookmark this right now.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.520]   Yeah, because you know what that means is that everyone doesn't have to be on the central wave.
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:04.500]   Google.com server that you could get on to other wave servers and use wave and communicate with people on other servers without being.
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.400]   On Google server and when I have no way for invites from them.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:14.700]   This is moving so fast and yet nobody really understands what wave is or how to use it.
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:20.600]   If somebody would just write a book that would explain Google wave.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.700]   So I would buy it in a flat.
[00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:26.400]   And if that book were online, I would just I would buy it in faster than a flash.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.600]   I would just like go to the website, but we'll find out more about that in just a moment.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.500]   I'm so bad.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:40.700]   If you go to the bookmarks, you'll see a nice little one of those great little diagrams that I never understand with boxes.
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:47.100]   Federation boxes.
[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.500]   I suspect the stars fleet becoming in any moment.
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.800]   Okay.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.600]   So that is important.
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.600]   That's an important next step.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:01.900]   And what does seem to be true is that everybody now who wanted to be on wave has I mean the buzz.
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.000]   I need a wave invite has kind of calmed down, right?
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.600]   Maybe because people say, Oh, I see what it is.
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:07.200]   I don't want it.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:13.100]   Well, I mean, I think I think people are in different stages like, you know, when the different stages of denial.
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.000]   Depression.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:21.500]   And I think that some people are just like, I know I think people now who always wanted an invite and put in their name in for an invite and haven't gotten it yet or like at this point of bitterness.
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.000]   Like I give up.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.700]   Like I give up you, you, you, Tommy, I'm just not cool enough, whatever.
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:31.800]   And I think the people who had did have gotten invites or got invites a couple of weeks ago have gotten past the shiny phase and made it.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:36.000]   And maybe aren't logged onto wave as much because their friends are in honor because it didn't capture them.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   So I think I think it's an interesting time right now.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:51.800]   And I think that what Google needs to do with the way folks need to do or keep rolling out interesting things like this Federation thing, although the Federation thing is more of a developer thing, but they got to keep keep themselves in the news in the news cycle.
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:55.000]   I mean, invites have been going out at a pretty steady, steady pace.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:01.100]   It's a developer thing, but it's also the kind of thing that is going to make it more attractive to end users.
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:04.000]   So you've got to give it to the developers so they can implement it.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.100]   And then, you know, I would, I think having a custom wave server of your own that federates with other servers is important.
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:10.700]   Definitely.
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.200]   That's what's going to make the architecture work here.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.700]   We have to figure that out how it works together.
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:22.500]   I also put up on the, on the friend feed that there are two Google wave apps awaiting approval in the iPhone store.
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:24.700]   Wow.
[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.500]   Jeff has done awesome wave coverage.
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:30.600]   The race is on for the first Google.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.500]   I heard that.
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:32.400]   Yeah, really.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:37.900]   The Google wave iPhone app waveboard is one.
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:41.800]   There's also an Adobe air application called waiver.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.600]   It's a waveboard is a is a Mac app.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.600]   It's not an iPhone app.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:49.400]   Although maybe there's is there an iPhone version and maybe there may be an iPhone version of wave.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.100]   There is a apparently it's waiting approval in the iPhone app store.
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:24:00.500]   You know, what's interesting about Google wave on the iPhone is if you just visit it in mobile Safari and you and you open it.
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.400]   It uses these special head attacks.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.300]   Yeah, it does a good job.
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:06.600]   And it uses these meditags that actually hide the Safari Chrome.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:11.600]   So the app, the web app goes full screen and feels very much like a native app.
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:21.300]   Well, I don't, you know, the thing that people don't know or really remembering is that the UI for wave is completely.
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:26.000]   Fungible and in fact, Lars showed, you know, a variety of.
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:30.200]   UIs including one that was like, looked like a green screen on a command line.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:34.300]   So there's no reason it has to look like it looks.
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.600]   And I think it might be not the ideal UI to be anyway.
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.600]   So maybe they maybe they can get there.
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:46.200]   There's a video at get waveboard.com on of the iPhone app and its basic functionality.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.600]   It looks a lot like wave to be honest.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.800]   It basically has no way.
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.900]   Yeah, we're just seeing an instance of it.
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.800]   It's pre-why it's right.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.300]   It's pretty nice.
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:00.300]   Yeah, this UI is just like, let us show you everything we can do.
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:06.200]   And now it's up to some clever developers and UI people to, you know, get down to the really useful stuff and simplify it and make it.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.900]   You know, apply it to different use cases, I think.
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.500]   We're going to take a break, come back.
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:15.600]   We will talk about a book that will help you understand Google wave in just a little bit.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.400]   Also the mystery town of Argleton.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.200]   And then why you should care.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.500]   Or not as the case may be.
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:29.600]   And Eric Schmidt talks about with the way we have will look like in five years, but I want to tell you about go to meeting right now.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:38.300]   This is, hey, when wave, maybe someday wave will be as useful as go to meeting for your online meetings, but until that day comes, I want you to try go to meeting.
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:38.800]   Thank you.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.800]   Try it free by going to go to meeting.com slash twig.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.700]   It's very easy to understand.
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:46.000]   You install the software.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.400]   You don't even you just can, you know, you don't have to pay for it right now and just try it.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.900]   So go there and install it.
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:51.700]   Take a couple of minutes.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.800]   And now the next time you have a conference call scheduled, you send them a meeting invite.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:02.400]   You say during the conference call, I'd like to show you the keynote or the PowerPoint or I'd like to show you the website.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.600]   I'd like to work together with you.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.300]   And it's so incredible.
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.500]   I mean, now it's not real time collaboration like wave.
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:18.700]   You're you're it's more like you're there in person with them, giving them a demo, but you can work together on a single document wave like you can you can work.
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:19.500]   You can train.
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.300]   So you can say I have the program.
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:22.100]   I'm going to use it now.
[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:22.700]   Here's how you use it.
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:23.300]   Now you try it.
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.300]   I'm going to do this with my sister.
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.600]   We're training her out to do the feeds.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:30.300]   And this is exactly what this is meant for just about any kind of conference call.
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:35.700]   This is a lifesaver and you could try it free for 30 days from the front for the great people at Citrix who know this stuff.
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:39.500]   I bet you I bet you they have something up their sleeve with regard to wave.
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:40.900]   I would be that'd be my guess.
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.200]   Get your go to meeting account right now.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.500]   Go to meeting.com slash twig.

[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.900]   Thank you for their support of this week in Google.
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:04.900]   Do you want to make your announcement now, Gina?
[00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:06.100]   Let's do it.
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:06.700]   Let's do it.
[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:07.700]   What's the deal?
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:18.600]   So the reason why Jeff is schooling me on current wave news is because I've been I've been heads down writing.
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.800]   My new book, which is called the complete guide to go.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:23.200]   Wave.
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.400]   Yay.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.800]   Hey.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:34.000]   And I'm really excited to tell you that it is mostly written or eight chapters of it is are written and it's free to read online right now.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.600]   I literally took the password off of this site an hour ago.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.400]   If you go to complete wave guide.com.
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.900]   Complete wave guide.com.
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.500]   You can read.
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.800]   It's about 90 pages printed.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:51.100]   I've been I've been working on this thing nonstop along with Adam Pash from Life Hacker.
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:28:00.000]   So you know, this is top drawer stuff for about a month now and the whole book is going to be free to read online continuously indefinitely.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:07.700]   And I'm also going to make a PDF available for purchase and a soft cover print version available available purchase going forward.
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:12.000]   I'm going to have the preview edition later on this month and then all through 2010.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:16.900]   I'm going to issue kind of a new edition every few months as wave changes and grows, which it definitely will.
[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:20.400]   The current content that's up right now is just a start.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:24.600]   I mean, I think wave is such a sort of complex and deep rich product that it needs.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:29.800]   It could probably have many books written on it, but this is my first try at it or or it's more like the forever book.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.600]   It is the forever book.
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.100]   It is a forever book.
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:33.100]   It keeps on developing.
[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:34.100]   It's a living beast.
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:35.400]   Exactly.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:35.800]   Exactly.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.700]   You know, I kind of took some inspiration from wave.
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:42.100]   I mean, what I really like about wave is that each conversation is kind of this living document that changes, right?
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:46.900]   Unlike email that when you send an email, it's kind of dead and it gets filed away and it never ever changes.
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:49.600]   And that's kind of how I feel that tech book publishing works.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.000]   You know, I've written two technology books and Adam has written a book as well.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.100]   And you know, you write a book and the book gets published and then the book is just dead.
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:57.900]   It's out on shelves.
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.500]   It's done and then things change.
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.600]   And as an author, you feel horrible because things change.
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:10.100]   You know, when people tell me they bought my book these days, like I cringe, you know, when I feel terrible because I feel like there are things in it, you know, that don't apply anymore.
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:13.300]   Because it was published last March in 2008.
[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:21.600]   So my goal with this book is to constantly update it, iterate it real time live on the web at complete complete wave guide.com.
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:28.600]   So anybody can get the most recent information about wave in one place kind of organized in a book in a book structure at any time.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.800]   I think that's great.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.600]   Now, this is a brand new model for you.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.700]   As you said, you have two traditionally published books.
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:40.500]   Is this a little bit of racking or is this just I mean, I think it's pretty obvious the future publishing, right?
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:45.400]   It's really scary and it's really, it's really exciting.
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:52.500]   I'm working with a small company here in San Diego to lay out the PDF and the offer it for sale and to also to print the softcover book.
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.900]   I do think that this is the future of publishing and you know, I come from the web.
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:59.800]   I wrote for I wrote for the web for years before I ever wrote for magazines or my print book.
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:05.700]   And it just it just seemed like, I mean, this idea of locking down text, especially when you're writing about technology, which changes so much.
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.700]   I mean, I just it just doesn't feel natural to me.
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:19.100]   And I'm a big believer and we've talked about this before about just giving stuff away for free, you know, karma, karma's a bummerang and my my my, you know, my goal is to be the kind of authoritative resource on wave and I think you've done that by the way.
[00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:23.000]   It's too late for better or worse.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.700]   You are now the wave woman.
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:29.000]   Well, now that I'm wearing this dumb lab coat and he's glad he's goggles.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.300]   You're definitely the author photo.
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:34.100]   The woman from wave.
[00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:41.000]   Well, you know, I've thought with books like this that in a sense you want to subscribe to the future.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:41.500]   Yep.
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:46.000]   You want to get a guarantee of Gina helps me out for a long time.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.700]   You do not want to buy a static book for something like this.
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:49.800]   That would be nuts.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.400]   Yeah, these things are going to change.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.800]   I mean, wave is going to change a lot.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:56.000]   We're going to look a lot different this time next year than it does now.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.700]   And I want people who get the book read the book to to get the latest latest and greatest.
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:06.800]   I mean, I would really love if people bought it too, that would that would help, you know, just support the, you know, the people in the time, you know, they put in behind it.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.400]   But they will.
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.700]   I really have confidence that people will do that.
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:15.300]   I mean, everybody should tell you this, Gina, but I think you got hammered.
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.300]   Yeah, the server is down.
[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.700]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:18.600]   It was down.
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.000]   It was down the minute the last word.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.300]   Dot com left your lips out out of memory.
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:26.200]   Allocating.
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.200]   Oh, man.
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.500]   Oh, it should be embarrassing.
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.400]   It happens to every single site that gets mentioned on.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.900]   It's what live does.
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:38.500]   Yes, and my several logs are going crazy.
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.700]   Well, thank you, everyone.
[00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:40.800]   And I'm really sorry.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.200]   I'm going to be a long, a long tail session tonight.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.100]   Let me tell you.
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.600]   I wouldn't do tail dash F.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.200]   I think you're really going to have to do dash N.
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:54.000]   I'm sorry, but it's just going to be long, long, long.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.500]   Well, I suppose this is a good problem to have.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.900]   I'm going to look at it.
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.200]   No, well, good news is that the book will always be there.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.100]   It's not going anywhere.
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:05.800]   So so once I get the server back up, I think this is a fan.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.300]   I think there's a fantastic idea and it's the only way you could do a book about wave.
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:13.100]   And I'm sure there will be people who will try to do dead tree additions of books about wave,
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.000]   but I just I just don't see how that can work.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   There definitely will be and surely they will be from my publisher who I love.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.100]   I would like to say that I love my publisher and I also love my literary agent and I'm sorry.
[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:26.500]   And all respect to all the Google wavebooks that are going to come out,
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.500]   especially the O'Reilly books and I would like to thank the wonderful everything
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.400]   that they've ever done for me.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.800]   And this isn't anything personal.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:39.900]   This is just, you know, I've wanted to self publish a book for years and wave just seem like the perfect opportunity to do it.
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:44.900]   So I see it sees the opportunity and did it and I want to thank Adam for doing it along with me.
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:48.900]   And we've just been typing furiously and frantically for weeks now.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.400]   So I'm so happy to have this out there.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:55.700]   You're good ideas people are suggesting to do a an ePub version if you could.
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:59.200]   I'm sure you will think about that.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:03.700]   Yeah, we've got a PDF now so anybody could mail that PDF to their Kindle.
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:04.500]   To their Kindle.
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.000]   Yeah, yeah, we're definitely going to do a PDF.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.400]   PDF isn't quite available yet.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:12.600]   I want to have the site out there and yeah, I mean, I wanted to make the book really a collaborative thing, right?
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:17.100]   So I wanted to put out Adam and some of my first draft and then I wanted people to give us feedback
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:21.200]   and I wanted us to, you know, and Adam and I are going to refine it and add people's contributions
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.700]   and then we're going to issue the PDF later on this month.
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:29.600]   So for now, it's website only, but PDF later this month and then soft cover book early next year
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.400]   and we'll definitely look into other formats.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.200]   I mean, I thought the PDF would be the most portable and I really wanted to do something
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:39.100]   that was non proprietary and portable, but whatever people want, you know, we'll do what we can.
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:43.000]   You know, I'm thinking about John O'Bacon who did his art of community very much this way
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.600]   and then published it with O'Reilly.
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:50.600]   So they had a kind of a community website where people was a wiki where people were having stuff.
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:56.600]   And Yokai Benkler's The Wealth of Networks was a brilliant book, same kind of model.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.500]   I think this is really the way.
[00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.900]   You know, I wonder when we talk last week about Kickstarter.
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:01.900]   Yes.
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:06.900]   I would think that this is a perfect project for Kickstarter where people who contributed to it
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:11.200]   and financially get some privilege and some access and something else.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:11.700]   Yeah.
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:11.700]   Yeah.
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:12.500]   The print copy.
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:13.100]   The one thing.
[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:13.500]   Yeah.
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.500]   In fact, I wish that I had actually used Kickstarter in retrospect and you know, there's a page in the site
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:25.800]   when the server comes back up on how to contribute and you know, contributors, the site is a wiki.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:29.000]   It runs, it's running media wiki, which is the same software that runs Wikipedia.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.500]   So all the pages are editable.
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:35.500]   I've protected some of them just for the, you know, the launch, but contributors will be able
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:39.100]   to edit the pages directly and the standout contributors were definitely going to add to the credits.
[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:43.300]   So and the whole thing is licensed as a creative commons, share like attribution.
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:48.100]   So everyone is free to take, remix, reuse, share, how they want.
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.500]   I mean, I just, I want people to understand this is a thing.
[00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:53.900]   We've and everybody who listens to the show knows this.
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:58.300]   We've just has captured my imagination in a way that a web app, you know, really never has before.
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:01.300]   And so I'm totally not objective at this point, but I just, I fell in love with it.
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:05.600]   And I feel like I want, I want other people to see how cool I think it is.
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.100]   So that's the point of the book.
[00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:09.900]   Wave is the first application that moves as fast as Gina.
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:13.300]   I think that's really what it is.
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.200]   It's the first thing that could keep up with you ever.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:20.400]   It's the ideal GNA app because it needs explanation and she can do it.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:24.300]   That's another way to look at it.
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:24.800]   I guess.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.100]   Yeah.
[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:25.900]   That's on that.
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:26.900]   It requires a book.
[00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:30.700]   No, you know, the whole computer world requires books, doesn't it?
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.900]   I mean, it's not intuitive for anybody.
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:33.800]   We're there.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:38.400]   We're there as you as you dug deeper into wave or swam deeper into what I should say.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:43.800]   Were there surprises to you things you haven't thought of in our talks here in terms of what it's for,
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.500]   what it does or what it ought to do or anything?
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:52.600]   Most of the surprises, unfortunately, were just were along the lines of, wow, this thing really isn't done yet.
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:36:08.400]   In fact, I will say that I think it was around 11 p.m. or 12 o'clock last night, Adam and I were in a furious chat session about like what the difference between a ping and a private reply was and like, why was Google calling at the same thing in their help docs and how are we going to explain it.
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:12.000]   I mean, a lot of things are just not quite baked yet.
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:21.400]   But yeah, no, the book has really made me think about different scenarios like mostly around etiquette and the things that wave lets you do right now and doesn't let you do that that could really wreak havoc.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:26.800]   I mean, anybody can edit anybody else's wave, which means that anybody can insert the word not and anybody else's sentence.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.700]   You can't remove people from a wave.
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:31.400]   So in fact, we had some private waves about the book.
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.200]   I managed the whole project, the whole book project.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:33.800]   Oh, neat.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.300]   Yeah, which was, which was awesome.
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:42.600]   I worked really well, but I accidentally, you know, I typed A in my search, my contacts panel to find Adam and someone else came up first and I wound up adding.
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:46.800]   This person told, you know, who I don't know to a private wave and I couldn't remove him.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.300]   Oh, dear.
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:53.300]   So it was this horrible, like, you know, that feeling when you send that an email, you had send that an email to people who weren't supposed to get it.
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:58.300]   It was this horrible feeling of like, oh, I just screwed up and you can't, you know, you can't remove people.
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:07.900]   So, so the fact that wave is so half baked, it creates some problems and also the fact that I mean, I really would have wanted to write this book in wave.
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:18.600]   The wave is just not ready yet. I think that wave is going to be a great publishing tool, but I went with, you know, a proven publishing tool that's been out for years and years and had, you know, the way to Wikipedia on it, which was media wiki.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:23.600]   So, so really it was more, it was less about possibilities and more about limitations, unfortunately.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:31.200]   I think wave has a long way to go, but I think it also has like tons and tons of potential, which is, you know, why I wrote the book.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:36.600]   Well, we're excited and I'm thrilled that you announced it on the show.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.800]   I think it's a perfect place for you to announce it and crash your site now before.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:44.200]   Before Monday, I don't know before you go on this today's show.
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:47.300]   I could watch Gina reboot the server live and.
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:48.500]   Yeah, that'd be fun.
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:49.000]   Go ahead.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Just because I know she's the itchy to do it right.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:51.500]   Go ahead.
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:51.900]   Go ahead.
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:52.500]   Kill it.
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.000]   Go ahead.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.300]   I am right now moving the slider up change private server resources.
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:37:58.700]   Okay.
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:00.900]   More more resources.
[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:02.300]   We need more power to captain.
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:03.200]   Power.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:07.300]   You can see my charts right now. It's like, whoa, it's got.
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:14.300]   Hey, what we're talking about that go to Google.com/robots.txt.
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.600]   Y'all know what a robot's a file is.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.000]   It's a it's a file.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.500]   I don't know if I don't think Google started this, but it's but certainly Google honors it.
[00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:27.500]   It's a text file you could put on your website that will instruct the Google bot and other search bots.
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:28.700]   Whoops, I just closed it.
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:29.500]   Let's go back there.
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:34.400]   Other search bots as to what directories to search and what directories not to search.
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:45.300]   So you have, you know, disallow allow and that, you know, most webmasters use this to to keep people out of parts of, you know, private parts of the website.
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:49.100]   There's no point in a search engine searching that and most search engines honor it.
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:54.700]   Well, look a little deeper as you go down the robots that text today and you'll see user agent kids.
[00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:57.400]   This allow slash tricks.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.700]   There it is.
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:00.700]   Allow slash treats.
[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:02.700]   See, Gene, have you done that on your server?
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:09.100]   Also, I'm putting on the to do list right now nicer 404 page.
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:09.500]   Yeah.
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:10.400]   Page.
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:13.800]   Those pH peers are a bitch, aren't they?
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.500]   I don't like those.
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.900]   It's like standing in a public square with your.
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:18.300]   Yeah.
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:21.000]   Well, it's a new costume.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:21.400]   Yeah.
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.400]   Open new costume.
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.600]   So who discovered this robots.txt thing?
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:26.100]   Because that's that's hysterical.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.900]   But I mean, you'd have to be looking at the Google robots.txt text.
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:30.300]   It Matt cuts.
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:31.300]   Oh, cuts published it.
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:31.600]   Okay.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:32.200]   It's tweeted it.
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.000]   So so he knew about it.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.200]   He's got the inside line.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:35.900]   He works at Google.
[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.000]   I bet you there was a memo.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.100]   Yeah.
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:38.500]   Yeah.
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.900]   So funny, isn't that?
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:42.200]   I'm sure he's actually pretty close to the robots.txt file, right?
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.200]   Because he's the spam.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.000]   Sure.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.200]   Maybe I don't know.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.600]   I don't know.
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:47.300]   That's interesting.
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:47.900]   I don't know.
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:49.000]   I don't know how it all works.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:49.600]   It's a mystery.
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:50.800]   The Internet's a mystery to me.
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.700]   It's true.
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:53.500]   You agree?
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.000]   Oh, now we're now I'm worried.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:56.100]   I don't know.
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:56.900]   I'm the expert.
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:57.900]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:59.900]   I wrote a book, but I can't keep a website up.
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:03.100]   So what's the deal?
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:05.000]   Jeff was Argalton.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.600]   I just found that right before the air.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:13.800]   So so I saw this in the telegraph in London that it's it could be an Easter egg in Google maps.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:20.400]   There's this town of Argalton in the match Google Maps in the UK and it doesn't exist.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.700]   Of course, it's pinpointed on the map.
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:27.400]   So one of the guys quoted in the story went to that position to try to find Argalton.
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.000]   It's kind of like Narnia.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.800]   Did you have to go through a wardrobe to get there?
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:32.700]   I mean, exactly.
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:40.000]   The guess is that it's there to trip up one one guess is that like Phantom streets that appear on maps.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.200]   It's there to trip up copyright by later.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:42.700]   Right.
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.700]   Or it could be some, you know, strange reference.
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:47.800]   I didn't even you know what I didn't Google Argalton.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:48.700]   What would that look at me?
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:49.700]   Oh, you never know.
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:55.600]   Google's got these guys now are getting really arcane in their in their search bread crumbs.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:58.700]   I like with that crop circles thing.
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:02.800]   Did we ever tell people with the the upshot of that whole crop circles thing was?
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.700]   No, I can't remember now.
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:08.400]   They explained it finally after three or four weeks.
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:14.800]   You know what you find is a Google Maps references to the fact that Google Maps talks about it.
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:15.800]   I think you hit the nail on the head.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:18.300]   I think it's map makers have done that for years.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:23.200]   They put fake entries in their maps so that if you copy a map, they know and they could say, look, it's not.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:23.900]   You didn't do that.
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:24.500]   Work yourself.
[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.600]   You copied ours, but doesn't Google buy its maps from somebody else?
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.000]   So might not even know where the new thing here.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:38.200]   Google is doing, of course, Google made the stock of nav devices plummet this week because it announces.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.100]   So doing its own.
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:45.300]   Drive destinations and they're I think creating their own map data.
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:53.000]   So because they've been licensing it from telinav and a bunch of other companies just as the GPS devices do.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:01.800]   But now they're going to have their own free driving spot to spot directions on Android 2.0.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:05.400]   And so you'll have no need to buy a nav device.
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:11.500]   You know, I'm kind of a little disappointed. There is an open mapping group called openstreetmap.org
[00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:15.900]   that has it's like a wiki for mapping and it's really good.
[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:21.000]   And I was a little disappointed that Google didn't just kind of work with them because first of all,
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.900]   they've already got a very complete data set.
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:27.400]   And it would have been great to have Google supportive that instead of Google saying, well, we'll do it ourselves.
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:32.900]   Yeah, in fact, I would love to have those guys or gals or behind open street maps on the show.
[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:36.800]   We did a floss week with them with them a couple of months ago.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.500]   And they were just so great.
[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:43.700]   And you know, if you can make an account there, everybody has GPS's now.
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:46.400]   So you can make an account there, put a GPS track on it.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:52.200]   You can look at your neighborhood and see if it's accurate and because it's a wiki, you can fix it.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:58.100]   And they and they do want volunteers to go to openstreetmap.org and do that updated.
[00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:01.600]   It looks a lot like Google Maps, except there's more information.
[00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:04.300]   There's there's really kind of interesting information.
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:05.400]   Bikers use it, for instance.
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:08.000]   So there's very good bike trail information on here.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.200]   You're a bicyclist.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.100]   We talked about a few weeks ago, the idea of the annotated world.
[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:13.000]   Yes.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.800]   And if it allowed you to put new layers of information, you know, great bike rides.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:22.900]   Well, this does I don't know how much metadata, but that's the idea.
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:23.700]   Yeah.
[00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:28.400]   Do you use it, Gina, with a because I found out about it in a bicycling app that I use on the iPhone.
[00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:32.900]   I haven't, I haven't done into it too much.
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.100]   I haven't been riding my bicycle as much as I should be.
[00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:37.200]   But you're not waving, Gina.
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.800]   You're still hanging behind you, aren't they?
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:41.900]   So I'm zooming in next week.
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:44.500]   I mean, this is this is I'm looking at the neighborhood.
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:48.900]   I know best, which is my own and it's as every bit as accurate as Google Maps.
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:51.200]   And I would just love to see.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:58.200]   I was kind of a little disappointed that Google didn't go with, you know, the one that's already out there would have the same benefit.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:00.200]   What is there's liability though?
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:04.600]   Oh, perhaps to Google say how it was going to license its map information.
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:09.500]   Um, no, maybe they're maybe you're right.
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:10.300]   Maybe they can't just.
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:11.400]   I don't know.
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:18.800]   I mean, the other interesting story is that is in the UK, the government owns the map information and you can't get it even though people own it.
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:23.300]   Oh, it's a huge controversy in trying to open up government data.
[00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:30.500]   And it's kind of the first front in the effort for transparent government in the UK is to say, at least give us our own damn map.
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:32.000]   Data to our own damn country.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.900]   Well, now we know who to blame for Ardleton.
[00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.300]   Yes, Maggie Thatcher did it.
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:38.000]   Huh.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.400]   Yeah, this I mean, the government doesn't own shouldn't own the map.
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:44.600]   That's ridiculous.
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:50.600]   So that you also posted this story, Jeff, and I haven't parsed it yet, but Eric Schmidt.
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:54.100]   This is an article from read right web a few days ago.
[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:59.600]   Envision's an internet in five years is dominated by Chinese.
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:07.400]   Oh, oh, that of course leads to the the I can decision this week that finally is going to run on Roman characters.
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.800]   Ooh, as a programmer, Gina, that must scare the heck out of you.
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.100]   I know Dave Weiner said it's going to break all my software.
[00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:13.500]   Yeah.
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:16.100]   Is it Unicode?
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:17.600]   They're allowing what is it that they're allowing?
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:22.500]   Um, because they said that non Roman characters will be allowed in.
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:29.400]   But so just the main names, I think, right, but that's that's enough to break a lot of some.
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.700]   Where you know, just having an E ox on.
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:35.600]   They go in a in a URL hat.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.200]   Do you turn it into an E?
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.300]   What do you do with it?
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:40.800]   Yeah, interesting.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:46.600]   Huh, he says Eric says five years from now, the internet will be dominated by Chinese language content.
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:51.200]   Well, that's just kind of a mathematical guess because they're a billion Chinese or whatever.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:55.500]   He says today's teenagers are the model of how the Web will work in five years.
[00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:58.800]   They jump from app to app to app seamlessly.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.700]   Like little monkeys.
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:08.600]   Five years, he says is a factor of 10 in Moore's law, meaning computers will be capable of far more by that time than they are today.
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:10.500]   Well, that's the impressive thing.
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:14.600]   Yeah, but yeah, yeah, within five years, there will be in this.
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:15.900]   I hope he's true on this.
[00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:16.900]   I pray that he's true on this.
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:21.700]   And in fact, I have banked my entire business on this within five years.
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:28.700]   Broadband will be well above a hundred megabits in performance and a dis and distribution distinctions between
[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:32.000]   TV, radio and web will go away.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.300]   I don't think that's five years off.
[00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:43.200]   I think that's maybe two, but what could really throw monkey wrench in that is the is how corporations, particularly in the US behave, how Comcast and Verizon behaves.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.000]   There's enough.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.100]   There's enough dark fiber to make that possible.
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:49.400]   In fact, to make internet access practically free.
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.900]   He said something surprising.
[00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:54.400]   We're starting to make significant money off YouTube.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:59.700]   So he says content will move more towards video.
[00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:02.800]   Again, something I'm hoping he's right on.
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.700]   Yeah, yeah, we all are right.
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:08.800]   Real time information is just as valuable as all the other information.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:10.400]   We want it included in our search results.
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:11.800]   They're obviously moving in that direction.
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:16.900]   And this was telling and something I've said for a while, but it's not obvious.
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:21.800]   There are other companies, many companies beyond Twitter and Facebook in the real time space.
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:22.800]   I think that's absolutely true.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.700]   The next one is interesting too.
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:26.900]   You can index this is where this is.
[00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:28.300]   I think Google's weakness today.
[00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:31.400]   We can index real time info now, but how do we rank it?
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:32.700]   Oh, it's huge.
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:33.700]   It's huge.
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:35.500]   This is we talked about this last week.
[00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:37.700]   What is authority in a real time world?
[00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:39.200]   What is relevance?
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:41.900]   What is how do you how do you cluster topics?
[00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:42.800]   How do you do all that stuff?
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:48.900]   It's just I think, you know, just as in media, we brought all of our old assumptions to the internet and treat it like medium.
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:54.600]   I almost think the Google's in the position now where they're going to try to treat everything like search and the real time web isn't about search.
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:55.800]   It's something new.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:59.000]   And I know they're trying to get their heads around it because I have to say this in every show.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.800]   They're talking about hyper personal news streams.
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:09.900]   But the stream, the notion of the live river is just so different from the static page world of media and of the first web.
[00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:22.700]   I've been talking about a river, the river concept for a long time for at least a year and a half and really been trying to figure out how to do a river of text that goes with our river of audio and video on our live streams.
[00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:24.200]   Because I think text is so important.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:24.800]   It's searchable.
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:25.500]   It's clickable.
[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:29.300]   It's it's it's where you add metadata to video and audio.
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:30.500]   And I've wanted to do that.
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:32.500]   CNET beat me to it.
[00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:37.000]   They have a new view on CNET's homepage called the river.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.300]   That's an interesting idea.
[00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:51.400]   It says instead of if you go to news.cnet.com/river instead of sorting or organizing the information we post by, you know, topic, just go to the river and you'll see it all in order.
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:56.200]   Our tweets are our articles all in real time.
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:59.100]   I think this is this is very smart of them as a news organization.
[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:02.100]   I doubt very much it'll get picked up by anybody.
[00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:05.400]   And you can narrow it down to blog post videos, photo galleries, see that on Twitter.
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:19.000]   Well, CNN just did a redesign and kind of a big deal of redesign, but they have their news pulse there, which is their kind of big media way to do the same thing just by having the most popular, you know, the stories with buzz going on now.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.100]   It's on the top now.
[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:22.800]   Most popular stories right now.
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.700]   Brazilian Indians find plain survive.
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:25.500]   Yeah.
[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:29.500]   I mean, this is this is where we're going where we're in too much of a hurry.
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.900]   It's what you're doing with your book, Gina.
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:35.000]   There's no time to make a dead tree edition.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.600]   You have to have it online.
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:37.700]   You have to get it out there.
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:42.900]   But, you know, for consumers, it means really tuning your filters and retraining your brain.
[00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:49.100]   I think to consume these things, you know, it's consuming the things that you're that you're interested in.
[00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:51.200]   Actually, this kind of segues into the Twitter list.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:56.800]   I don't know if we want to talk about Twitter list this week a little bit, but yeah, I mean, I agree.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:59.800]   You know, this is the river is a is a good thing.
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:01.300]   It's the fastest way to get information out.
[00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:03.600]   But at the same time, I don't know, maybe this means I'm getting old.
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:05.300]   Sometimes I'm just like too much.
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:08.000]   I can't keep it overwhelmed too much.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.300]   Well, Clay Shurkey says that's not you've always had too much.
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.600]   And the problem is filter failure.
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.100]   Right.
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:16.900]   So the opportunity is to find the ways to try to prioritize this.
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:19.300]   And it goes to last week's conversation about what was it called?
[00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:20.700]   Do drop, news drop, whatever.
[00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:23.500]   You know, the efforts prioritize things.
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:26.600]   The efforts to give us to add value to this to this river.
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:30.500]   Well, and it turns out humans are the best at this, I think.
[00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:35.400]   And you find trusted editors who who Twitter is very good at that.
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:42.100]   You let your you follow people who will surface the news in a timely and and organized fashion.
[00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:46.300]   You know, the thing is though, and I totally see the value of this.
[00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:59.300]   You know, the reason why like I wrote the wavebook in a book structure with chapters and a hierarchical sort of, you know, structure is that like blogging about new things that happen on wave just isn't it doesn't give you, you know, you just don't get the context.
[00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:03.300]   You're always getting sort of the new item, but you don't see how that fits into the rest of it.
[00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:12.300]   And this was always kind of one of my biggest gripes on life hacker was like, I want to create a resource a reference where people can go and say, what is the best image editor for windows right now.
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:16.200]   You know, and a reverse chronological stream, which is what every blog is, right?
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:18.600]   But and these times are real time streams even faster.
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:20.100]   There's no way to figure that out.
[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:21.600]   And I mean, we struggled with it for years.
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:24.200]   It's like, how do we rank content per Iortized content?
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:32.800]   How does the editor say this is the thing that you should look at right now and this is the thing you shouldn't look at, you know, so, so it's, I mean, it also introduces kind of lots of issues.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:37.100]   I feel like I feel like writing the way thing in a book structure is sort of an old school.
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:39.900]   No, no, I would not judge you adapted it.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:44.100]   I mean, it's it's the problem is that it's process versus product.
[00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:44.900]   Right.
[00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:48.200]   So it feels like you put on a product, but it's a product that's going to be constantly evolving.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.400]   And so what matters is not the product.
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:56.900]   What matters is that you created a place to bring together the information to create a reference, but it's going to be constantly in process.
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:58.800]   And that's your the future of media.
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.100]   No, I think so.
[00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:02.900]   It's a combination of both.
[00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:03.800]   You need both.
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:06.500]   You need what's happening right now, but you need some contextualization.
[00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:08.700]   It is wave itself.
[00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:14.000]   People, you know, this we've gone through this before when people said, oh, there'll be no linear structure stories anymore.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.100]   No beginning, middle or end.
[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:16.500]   It'll just be slice of life.
[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:18.700]   It's very similar to this kind of real time thing.
[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:19.500]   What do we find?
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:22.200]   Well, it's life's of life is fine, but people still want stories.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:23.300]   Right.
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:32.400]   And even within that, I had a journalism student come into my class in the first year of our three year old school and this young guy said, you know, what the hell you doing?
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:40.300]   I'm just teaching us this newspaper, crap for, you know, leads and nutgraphs and all this stuff.
[00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:46.800]   And I said, if you put out a blog post that doesn't have a nut graph that tells you what it's about, nobody's going to read it in an RSS feed.
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:49.600]   If you don't have what's in, can you tell me what a nut graph is?
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:50.200]   Oh, sorry.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.400]   It's the graph that tells you what the whole thing is about.
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.600]   It's the nut.
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:55.300]   It's it's the none of the story.
[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:55.700]   Okay.
[00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:59.400]   But the third or fourth paragraph, you come down and you have the nut graph boy.
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:01.300]   I'm learning so much in this show.
[00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:09.700]   But a good lead and a good headline are going to make people click on your link in Twitter and in RSS.
[00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:12.200]   And so those old structures still have value.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:17.600]   The book structure you did, Gina, I think, right, it's you've got to be able to go from the beginning to an end to learn something.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:20.500]   Yeah.
[00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:26.300]   And you know, for me, I'm going to kind of feature recent changes to the book and I'm probably the book will have some sort of blog.
[00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:27.700]   Like, here's the new thing to look at.
[00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:36.100]   But, you know, I tried to pitch a wiki structure to the published life hacker publishers and say, Hey, I want to build, you know, a wiki PDF for software essentially.
[00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:39.200]   And it was like, people just aren't, you know, what's the reason to come back?
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:40.800]   It's, you know, it's got to be sort of a news base.
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:41.900]   It has to be a first chronological.
[00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:44.100]   So I think it's, I think it's striking a balance between the two.
[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:49.500]   Do you think that 10 years from now, we'll look back and say, isn't it, isn't it quaint?
[00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:52.300]   How challenged we were by all this?
[00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:53.800]   I do.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:55.200]   It was so obvious.
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:57.400]   Why were we worried?
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:53:59.400]   Bad news.
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:09.400]   If you're a newspaper publisher, I just saw the Chronicle circulation statistics for our San Francisco Chronicle, 25% down the New York Times dropping below a million for the first time in memory.
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:13.900]   It's now, it's not just a revenue problem for newspapers.
[00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:16.400]   It's a circulation problem for newspapers too.
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:17.800]   Well, but it's bigger than that too.
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:19.900]   I mean, this is what I'm blather about all the time.
[00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:24.100]   You know, it's also a cost problem because they, but it's also then a cost opportunity.
[00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:28.900]   The fact that you could work collaboratively with lots of people saves you a tremendous amount of money.
[00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:33.200]   In fact, the marginal cost of new journalism is zero because the people themselves will do it.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:35.700]   And the question is, how do you add value to that?
[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:40.600]   The economics of news have changed completely and utterly and will never be the same.
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:46.800]   I've come to, I'm not this blog post, I'm getting it, but I think the future of news is not institutional.
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:47.600]   It's entrepreneurial.
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:48.600]   Yay.
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:53.100]   And I think that's going to be true in many areas of, of, of, of, of, of, of, I think it's business.
[00:54:53.100 --> 00:55:01.800]   In fact, you know, what I talk about with, with the educators, especially for high school kids is you need to teach kids entrepreneurial skills.
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:02.800]   Amen.
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:05.200]   They need to come out.
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:11.100]   Of course, in journal, in entrepreneurial journalism and, and if either of you in New York on December 9,
[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:14.600]   we'll have our, our, our during for the classes and there's $50,000 in seed money to give them.
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:15.300]   Wow.
[00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:18.800]   And I have three students from last term who are starting businesses now based on this.
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:19.800]   Oh, that's great.
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:21.800]   We realize is most journalists are going to go out.
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:24.000]   They're going to work independently and we have to teach them new skills.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:24.500]   Yes.
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:27.800]   We're doing a session in how to create a brand and market yourself.
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:29.800]   You got to learn how to send out bills.
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:33.600]   You got to learn how to, this is, this is heresy, but you probably have to learn how to sell ads.
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:34.100]   Yeah.
[00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:35.700]   Yeah.
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:36.600]   Look at me.
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:38.600]   I had to do all that.
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:39.400]   Yeah.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:44.200]   Just thinking this week about how really at this point, you know, everyone really needs to have a freelancer mindset,
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:46.600]   regardless of whether or not they have a nine to five job.
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:50.000]   I mean, yeah, you just, you have to have that freelancer mindset and get, you know,
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:56.300]   try new things and have different ventures and, you know, try and fail and start new stuff and do what happens.
[00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:59.100]   It's so much more satisfying to be honest.
[00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:00.300]   If you could just do it.
[00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:06.400]   It's scarier, just like you, Gina with this book, it's scary, but in the long run, it's so much more satisfying.
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:07.500]   You have to troll.
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:10.500]   You're creating your, your, your, it's more vibrant.
[00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:11.300]   It's more exciting.
[00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:12.400]   And I think this is Leo.
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:16.000]   What were the biggest lessons you've had to learn those when you set on your own?
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.800]   I think a delegation was important.
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:20.800]   I, you know, you can't do it all by yourself.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:25.300]   So it was very valuable for me to realize that I had to let go a little bit of control.
[00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:27.200]   You know, you can't be a control freak.
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:28.200]   You have to get help.
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.400]   You have to collaborate with people.
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:34.300]   So it can't just all at the same time as you're being an entrepreneur and it's all about you.
[00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:37.000]   You have to also be collegial and collaborate.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.600]   That was a very important lesson for me.
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:40.400]   Were you good at business?
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.000]   No, I have no business skills.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:42.800]   So what did I do?
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:46.400]   I found people who were now.
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:47.900]   I don't know if that's going to work for everybody.
[00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:50.600]   You kind of, you kind of needed some business skills.
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:59.200]   I wish I had some, but I just, I think, you know what I, I'd say what the lesson was for me, Jeff, is knowing what I'm good at and what I love to do and focusing on that.
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:56:59.700]   Yeah.
[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:02.500]   And not feeling like I had to do it all.
[00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:10.400]   Whether you hire a person on staff to do your business stuff or outsource, we do this project at CUNY on new business models for news and one of our key.
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:19.100]   Beliefs is that there have to be organizations that do things like set up networks or critical mass to sell apps.
[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:19.600]   Yes.
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:22.100]   And that's how we sell our ads, by the way.
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:23.900]   We're going to have to have technology help.
[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:25.400]   You're exactly right on.
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:26.600]   We don't sell our ads ourselves.
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:29.300]   We outsource to exactly that kind of organization.
[00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:40.300]   So the gig economy also requires cooperation and doing what you're good at and letting and having a,
[00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:42.700]   others outsource to others and stuff you're not good at.
[00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:43.900]   But just, yeah.
[00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:47.800]   That's my cheap blog line is do what you do best to link to the rest.
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:49.100]   Perfect.
[00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:51.000]   T-shirts soon to be sold.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.900]   We're running out of time.
[00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:55.700]   Can we can we save lists for next week?
[00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:57.600]   Because it really is a big topic.
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:00.200]   And I think the Twitter lists we should talk about for sure.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:04.700]   Because it brings in all of these issues, including authority and and so forth.
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:09.300]   They have, I think metadata, I think they've gone now, Twitter wide half thing.
[00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:11.400]   I know I see a lot of people now talking about them.
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:14.400]   Yeah, I think they've gone wide.
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:15.400]   Have they gone 100%?
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:17.600]   They were they were rolling it out pretty quickly this week.
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:20.600]   I saw some folks panic that they had it and they lost it.
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:24.200]   There was promise they would get it back.
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:28.400]   I created right away about 20 20 lists.
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:29.800]   Just case.
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:30.800]   Ever.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:31.100]   Yeah.
[00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:34.800]   I complained about that and Fred Wilson, who of course invested in Twitter, Kim, one and said,
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:38.100]   no, no, that's what what developers are going to do is create easier ways to do it.
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:42.300]   Yeah, third parties need to do that partly because I don't even know if they have an API yet.
[00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:44.800]   That's that's part of what's holding it back.
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:52.600]   But I look now that I I think it's gone wide because I'm now on 3000 lists up from like 200 a week ago.
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:55.700]   So that's a significant number.
[00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:59.200]   And I noticed that on some of my list, I've got hundreds of people following some of my lists.
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:58:59.700]   So.
[00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:03.300]   Oh, yeah, my list number went up a lot to a lot of people.
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:04.400]   That's only got this this week.
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:04.900]   Yeah.
[00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:06.100]   Yeah, if not everyone.
[00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:06.600]   All right.
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:08.900]   Let me just see what the API is rolling out.
[00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:10.800]   But Tweet deck has a tweet deck is promising.
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:11.800]   Some of these said they're going to have it.
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:12.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:14.200]   Anyway, what we should say it for next week.
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:14.500]   Yep.
[00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:18.500]   It's a good subject and I think there'll be more to say and I'm just saying I'm on more lists and scobles.
[00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:19.400]   That's all I care about.
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:23.800]   That's all I care about.
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.600]   It's the numbers back, baby.
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:30.200]   It's all about numbers.
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:31.800]   Your site is up.
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:32.900]   Yay.
[00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:33.900]   My site is on my side.
[00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:36.100]   Cast star while you run servers.
[00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:37.100]   You are so impressive.
[00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:38.000]   That's pretty good.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:38.800]   Wow.
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:39.800]   Give the URL again.
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:41.700]   Okay.
[00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:42.700]   We're going to do this again.
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:43.100]   Okay.
[00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:44.200]   I'll go watch it go down again.
[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:47.200]   It is complete wave guide dot com.
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:48.200]   All right.
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:49.700]   Now let's try to hit.
[00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:51.100]   Don't all go there at once.
[00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:51.700]   Okay.
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:53.800]   Kids kids don't.
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:57.100]   And just and a shout out to all the the twig waivers.
[00:59:57.100 --> 00:59:58.400]   I'm going to be in wave this afternoon.
[00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:02.200]   You know, pimp in my stuff and I'll stop in and say hi right after we.
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:07.400]   Yeah, there are a lot of twig waivers and people saying why aren't you doing an official wave for twig?
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.100]   I can't follow it and do the show.
[01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:09.700]   That's why.
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:13.900]   Yeah, it's yeah, the nonlinear thing is tough and also busy waves.
[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:14.900]   They just they break.
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:18.100]   I mean, once you go over like a hundred blips and people add gadgets and bots,
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:22.500]   things get really unstable and you start getting firefly error messages and it all goes to hell.
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:24.600]   So it's not that we don't love wave.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:25.600]   It's not shiny.
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:28.300]   It's not not shiny.
[01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:29.800]   All right.
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:34.500]   Let's let's wrap things up because it's Halloween evening and I'm sure some of you want to go out and trick or treat.
[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:38.000]   Let's start with Gina Trapani and her tool of the week.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   My tip of the week.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:40.300]   I'm sorry.
[01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:40.800]   Tip of the week.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:41.600]   I do the tool.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:46.700]   So there are so there are a couple of really cool things this week.
[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:53.800]   I'm going to go with one Google Docs released the ability to batch export all of your documents.
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:58.200]   Yeah, is it really cool as is it file, which is fantastic.
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:03.900]   Right, so before you could open up a doc or a spreadsheet or whatever you had and save it locally or export it locally.
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:07.600]   But if you use Google Docs, you have a big collection of documents already.
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:14.000]   So so as of this week, if you are in Google Docs, which actually got a quite a nice little facelift recently,
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.300]   if you're select all items from the drop down, you can choose select all.
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:28.100]   And then from the more actions drop down, choose export and you can convert to Microsoft Office format.
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:32.000]   You can choose the formats you want to convert to PDF open office, Microsoft Office.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.600]   It continue and you've got a zip file of all your Google Docs.
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.300]   So so this is this is pretty cool.
[01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:42.600]   You know, I'm always worried about storing too much of my information on Google and I'm sort of having an amanopoly on my stuff.
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:46.300]   But when they give you this kind of I tweeted about this when they give you this kind of escape hatch,
[01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:48.700]   batch, easy export.
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:52.400]   It really kind of makes you feel better like, OK, this is my data and I can get it in and out.
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.200]   It is easily.
[01:01:53.700 --> 01:02:02.800]   I've seen some plugins. I saw one and I'm going to give it a try that allow you to kind of have a toolbar for Microsoft Office that interacts with Google Docs so that you can go back and forth.
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.200]   And that's sweet.
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:04.700]   Yeah.
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:06.100]   Have you tried that kind of thing?
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:06.700]   Do you know about that?
[01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:08.300]   I have not, but that's pretty sweet.
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:09.200]   I'm going to find out about it.
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:09.600]   Yeah.
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:09.700]   Yeah.
[01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:13.100]   I mean, think about that like saving locally and saving to the cloud and the same one shot.
[01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:13.800]   I'll give you an example.
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:19.800]   Our business manager says I cannot use Google's spreadsheet because it's too slow and I need I'm used to excel.
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:21.200]   So I want to use Excel.
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:24.700]   So now I can say, yeah, you can use Excel, but you can still share them on Google Docs.
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:25.700]   You can save them up there.
[01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.200]   You can access access them from there.
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.600]   That seems like the best of both worlds, right?
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:32.100]   Very cool.
[01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:37.100]   So now look under more actions once you've selected all your docs or some of your docs and you've got an export command.
[01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:38.600]   It'll give you all sorts of formats.
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:42.600]   Open Office, Microsoft Office, rich text PDF.
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:43.500]   I like PDF.
[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:45.500]   I like PDF rocks.
[01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.500]   You have rocks and Jeff.
[01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:54.400]   I think it was the Suddline Foundation had a great piece this week about how PDF is the ruination of government data.
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:57.300]   Everyone thinks it's good that we're all stayed out as a PDF.
[01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:59.100]   And then we got it out there and we can't analyze it.
[01:02:59.100 --> 01:02:59.900]   We can't do anything with it.
[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:01.800]   PDF is interesting.
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:04.300]   They they they they promote text, I guess, right?
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:04.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:05.300]   Huh?
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:07.300]   Data just plain text.
[01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:07.500]   Yeah.
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.700]   PDF is I think is encumbered.
[01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:12.300]   Isn't it Adobe's proprietary format?
[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:12.900]   Yeah.
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:13.800]   That's the problem.
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:14.800]   That would be a big problem.
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:15.100]   Yeah.
[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:16.500]   Can't analyze it very well.
[01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:17.900]   Does you have a number?
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:19.100]   I do.
[01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:20.500]   You stole the first one, which was 10.
[01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:21.100]   I'm sorry.
[01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:21.600]   That's right.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.100]   That's right.
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:22.600]   That's right.
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:25.000]   1.4 million is the number.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.200]   It is the number of Google voice users.
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:28.300]   Wow.
[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:31.000]   Half of whom use it daily.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:41.400]   The number was in some document that was supposed to be redacted on the FCC discussion of Google voice don't knows and business.
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.400]   We ferret it out.
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.900]   So now it's out now on.
[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:45.100]   It was a PDF.
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:50.300]   It was a PDF that was formatted Google misformatted this PDF and mentoring.
[01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:51.500]   That was so funny.
[01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:54.100]   They went to stack the numbers and they didn't.
[01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:59.400]   And so the FCC published this, this document and then they pulled it as soon as Google realized.
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:04.600]   But I just not to point laugh, but it's just that's a big mistake for Google.
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:08.400]   But that's easy to do, I think, because you think you've protected it, but you haven't.
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.400]   Yeah.
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:10.200]   Yeah.
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:12.600]   But they've had a couple of these nephews, right?
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:13.100]   Yeah.
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:16.000]   Metadata and PDF problems anyway.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:16.900]   So has Microsoft.
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:17.800]   So is everybody.
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:18.400]   Yeah.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:18.800]   Yeah.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:19.600]   It's not uncommon.
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:25.500]   We had I worked with a host at Tech TV who had some headshots done and some of them she was naked.
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:29.100]   Don't ask, but she used a thumb.
[01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:31.800]   I think she was Photoshopped to reduce to crop them.
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.000]   Oh, no.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   But the thumbnail still had the full image.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.200]   Oh, so she distributed the cropped version.
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.200]   Somebody saw, hey, wait a minute.
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.400]   She's naked in the thumbnail.
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:44.300]   It was everywhere.
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:45.300]   You remember that, Jeff?
[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:47.100]   Oh, of course I didn't look.
[01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:48.900]   I felt so bad.
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:49.400]   I felt so bad.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:50.700]   How embarrassing is that?
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:52.500]   But that's how easy this stuff, you know, it's hard.
[01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:53.700]   These formats and stuff.
[01:04:53.700 --> 01:05:01.400]   My tool of the week is brand new this week from Google and it allows you to search for music.
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.100]   Oh, hey, pirates.
[01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:08.500]   Search Google for music and her song, artist or album name.
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:12.600]   And let's let's pick somebody who puts their music up online so that we don't.
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:16.000]   So I actually, I'm sorry, I'm going to have to search for Metallica.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.200]   I do it.
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:19.000]   I have to do this.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.900]   And now you do get a Google ad, but then you get a lot of MP3s.
[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:30.500]   Probably many of these are not legitimate, but they're out there.
[01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:33.900]   But this, wait a minute, this is the wrong one.
[01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:35.100]   This is not the one I want.
[01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:36.900]   This is not the Google music search.
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:39.900]   This is somebody else's Google music search.
[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:41.400]   Let's let's do this again.
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.600]   Take two.
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:44.600]   I thought I was like, wow, Leo found a whole different.
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.600]   That's a different interface.
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:49.400]   Somebody else was doing that.
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.000]   This is the one I wanted to show you.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:57.400]   That's what happens when you Google Google music search.
[01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:59.600]   And I wasn't paying attention.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:00.600]   I said, oh, yeah, this is cool.
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:01.900]   So it's similar.
[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:02.600]   It's similar.
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.200]   Let's let's let's click and do Bob Dylan.
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.000]   This is a much better results page though.
[01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:07.700]   And you even get a little player on it.
[01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:11.500]   So you can play the Bob Dylan song with a nice little player and like that.
[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:14.300]   Violate copyright like to your heart's content.
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:19.800]   Now notice a buy MP3 link on there.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.300]   That's coming from my space.
[01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:23.600]   So this is interesting.
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:26.000]   I don't, you know, Pandora, Rhapsody, Lala.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:31.900]   This supports, I think, the purchase of music, but I don't know if it's limited to legal music or not.
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:33.700]   I'm not sure how they would even do that.
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.900]   It acted differently for different songs for me.
[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:40.400]   Like you would get a you get just a little excerpt of a song on some and others.
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:41.200]   You get the whole thing.
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:45.000]   So yeah, I think it's a great feature.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   It's a nice thing to have.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:46.900]   It is.
[01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:52.500]   That's now don't go to the one I went to go to Google.com.
[01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:58.100]   Now this says says slash landing slash music, but I bet if you go to Google.com/music, yeah, that works.
[01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:01.600]   Google.com/music for the Google music search.
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:04.600]   But let me see music dot Google dot com.
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:05.400]   I wonder if that would work.
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:05.900]   I bet it would.
[01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:10.200]   They're good about giving you all the all the conceivable ways to get somewhere.
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:10.800]   No, it doesn't.
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.800]   You got to go to Google.com/music.
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:17.100]   Well, that's it for us for this week in Google.
[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:20.800]   What a fun show as always, Jeff Jarvis is a fantastic blogger.
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:25.600]   If you're not reading his blog, you're missing out on some of the best writing on the internet right now.
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:27.900]   I've been abandoned lately.
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:28.300]   I feel bad.
[01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:32.500]   I tweeted yesterday that I wanted to do nothing this weekend, but blog, but I haven't even blog yet.
[01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:34.600]   That made me so happy when I saw that.
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:36.100]   Yeah, we all feel that way.
[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:42.300]   We're all guilty as sin of, you know, not not blogging enough, but you write how many thousands of words a week.
[01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:44.600]   Yeah, your poster just gifts, Jeff.
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:45.700]   Yeah, they're so good.
[01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:46.200]   We need now.
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.100]   You're tweeting.
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:48.200]   I had fun this week.
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.300]   I've got to put up some audio.
[01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:51.400]   I couldn't because of my health, which is fine.
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:52.600]   I couldn't fly yet.
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:57.400]   And so I gave talks to London and Munich and New York home the same day.
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:58.100]   Thanks to Skype.
[01:07:58.100 --> 01:07:59.100]   Thanks to Skype video.
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.200]   Skype video is amazing.
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:00.900]   It's amazing.
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:03.100]   It's a it's a it's a revolution.
[01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:04.300]   So you're feeling well.
[01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:05.100]   Yeah.
[01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:07.400]   And and do they do?
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:12.500]   Is there a, you know, like they go back and check or is there anything that three months from what I got out?
[01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:13.500]   They they do what?
[01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:13.800]   Test.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:14.200]   Okay.
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:14.700]   Good.
[01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:16.100]   We all read about the blogs.
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:16.900]   We'll be there.
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:18.000]   I know.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:18.900]   I know like you're into.
[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:20.900]   I'll make Gina blush again.
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:23.800]   No, no, I love your post about it.
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.500]   It's give me insight into the mail.
[01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:27.300]   I mean, you know, I'm married to a woman.
[01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:29.500]   So I don't even I don't even know how to stop work.
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:30.600]   This doesn't come up for you.
[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:33.600]   This is this is this is foreign plumbing.
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:34.400]   Yes.
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:36.500]   Nothing you need to know about.
[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:39.400]   It's I love it.
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:41.200]   I really I think I'm serious.
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.900]   I just love Jeff's blog, Buzz machine.com.
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:45.500]   And I have to say the same about Gina.
[01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:49.500]   I don't know how you find time to write all of this and a book a book.
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.600]   You are so prolific.
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:53.000]   It's kind of amazing.
[01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:57.900]   The book is let's break the site one more time complete wave guide.com
[01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:02.900]   and her blog site is smarter where.org where you also find.
[01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:04.300]   Oh, you've redesigned.
[01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:05.500]   Yes.
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:06.400]   Yes.
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:10.600]   And in fact, the blog has been sort of abandoned because I've been hacking out hacking away at the book.
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.900]   Well, I like the new design.
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:13.900]   Thank you.
[01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:18.800]   I just want to thank you so much for letting me announce the book here on the show and thank you to everyone who broke my server again.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.500]   The best problem you can have in the world. Seriously, I feel grateful and the book's still going to be there and I really appreciate it.
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:25.500]   Break it.
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.700]   Let's break it all week and break it all week.
[01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:29.200]   Yeah, seriously.
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:30.000]   I'm all about it.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.300]   Bring it down, baby.
[01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:34.500]   I just I Gina, you're the best.
[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:35.800]   Congratulations on the book.
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:37.700]   I think you're doing exactly the right thing.
[01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:40.600]   This is how a book should be done, especially a book about Google wave.
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:41.300]   Thank you.
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:43.400]   I can finally take these silly glasses off.
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:45.900]   No, you can never take them off.
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:48.200]   She's back.
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.000]   He's back.

[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:56.000]   Don't forget you can listen to this week in Google.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:56.700]   It's on iTunes.
[01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:58.400]   It's all all the podcast clients.
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.000]   We are soon going to have video.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.400]   We are recording video.
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:02.600]   We are editing video.
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:08.000]   But as always, these things take these things take time, but we will get them.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:15.300]   We get the video out soon, I think in the next week or so, as well as live streaming on most of the platforms that you're using today, including most of the phones and so forth.
[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:16.400]   So just keep watching for that.
[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:19.300]   Meanwhile, we'll see you next week.
