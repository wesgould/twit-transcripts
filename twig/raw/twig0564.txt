[00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.920]   $75,000 robot that looks like a dog
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.280]   Well, at least I'll put it in my shopping cart
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.320]   I'll tell you two things that Facebook and Instagram have done and I think make a big difference and Jeff
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.120]   We'll tell you something he doesn't like that Facebook did
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.840]   That's bizarre and then we'll look at my head
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.400]   Rotating in space. It's all coming up next
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.840]   on twig

[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.960]   I'm
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.640]   Did a blah blah blah blah blah at the Craig DuBarc graduate school of journalism. That's all I can just say I believe in a mark
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.840]   Can we tattoo that on the back of your hand?
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:11.240]   To go up his whole arm the late end up the other arm the late Fred Willard who I just adored and you may remember
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.240]   he was the
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.680]   The Ed McMahon this the second banana on Fernwood tonight with Martin Mall as the host and every time
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.680]   He he was reading the tonight's guests and at the end he would look down at the card. He would say and I'm
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.400]   He would read
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:37.960]   Maybe laugh every single time and I'm the Leonard Ta professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark graduate school of journalism at the City University of New York
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.520]   Yes now our star
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.000]   Stacey
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.440]   Hang about them back from a week off
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.360]   She is of course from Stacy on IOT calm and expert on all things
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.440]   Tiny whether they be Chinese IOT devices even radios
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.880]   She knows all about that stuff and she's also got an event coming up. Is it next week?
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.080]   No, no, no more events. I did my event. You did the event how to go. Oh, it went super well
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.320]   And I'm I'm delayed on giving out my hop in
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.200]   Update on like how to use the platform and all that good stuff, but it went really well machine learning at the edge. Oh, yeah
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.200]   It was June 11th. Yeah, congratulations. Yeah, hop and work well hop and work well
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.200]   It did it didn't there were some like little glitches, but this is what you used instead of
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.720]   zoom
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.480]   zoom
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.240]   Zoom and yes, so the videos are up on YouTube if anyone gets
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.040]   Good, I have to say the quality looks great
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.420]   Okay, can I just tell you you see that wood ceiling behind the Karen Panetta? Dr. Karen
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.960]   She
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:57.240]   Made that herself what she cut herself, okay?
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.660]   I just all in the cool good all the other pandemic probably to
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:09.640]   Yeah, that is gorgeous amazing. That is true. Yeah, that's awesome
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.720]   See we don't the difference here is we don't make you sit on camera when somebody else is talking you can yawn
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.840]   You can go to sleep you can eat lunch
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:26.160]   But this when when you're one of these things you got a really you got to be you got to always be on
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.400]   Oh, see there was a glitch so every now and then somebody would drop out people had to pop out
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.080]   It was hop in has a is real persnickety around the microphone usage. Oh, interesting
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.080]   so if
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.400]   If anything starts losing the microphone or starts trying to use the microphone
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.080]   It'll just like cut you out for everybody and then so that was Karen had to move over
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.800]   Yeah
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:55.080]   That's funny. Oh, I have to watch that's exciting. This is about machine learning at the edge
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.640]   Yeah, the best I think the most interesting for the more technically inclined is probably Dan Jevons
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.160]   Who was the one below you or below that one?
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.120]   That's like that was the first one was kind of like intro and
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:15.880]   Then Dan really talked about like scaling challenges. He was really good. He's with a shell oil and then there's
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.760]   More here and my monetization poor sign making money at the outer edge nice
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.480]   So good, you're gonna do more of these. I hope Stacy. I am my next one is gonna be on ecosystems
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:34.160]   And I'm really torn as I was telling Jeff. I've got so many decisions about moving which happens in like 10 days
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.560]   So I'm like oh too much to do Wow
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:47.080]   I'm gonna be doing I'm gonna be on Alex Lindsey's event tomorrow. I have to get up really early in the morning. Oh
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.320]   People don't see about a time. What's the like lock there? I think there's
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:57.360]   If you go to youtube.com/Alex Lindsey you can you can see I think it's 25
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:05.400]   And then but there's like is there's other people. That's the people he calls them the in the pit and
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.960]   then and then so these are all the people in the pit. Yeah, it's 25 and then
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.520]   There are hundreds of other people watching
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:21.480]   It's complicated, but it's really cool. So he does these every Monday through Sunday doesn't every day of the week
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:27.920]   They start at 6 a.m. Pacific time they really get in our way 7 and 8 and they go till about 9
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:33.760]   He says on the weekends it goes even longer that he puts up the middle part the kind of formal part
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.520]   On YouTube at youtube.com/Alex Lindsey and he uses zoom for this, but he also does this is cool
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.040]   This is that new Google feature. We talked about last week. Oh
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:48.320]   Where he just puts in the times and Google will actually make that a link so you can jump so as you're reading the show notes
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.640]   You say I want to jump to using royalty free music and commercial streams
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.720]   It'll jump right to that portion if you click it, which that's done by oh, that's awesome
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:01.800]   Yeah, you have to put the really hard in but it makes it a hot link which is nice and then if you want to join the conversation
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.880]   on
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.880]   tomorrow morning, I think I'm there
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:12.560]   7 or 8 I can't I'll be there early, but this is the zoom link zoom
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.800]   It's right in the at the bottom of the show notes
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:20.240]   So it's just a regular permanent zoom call you should read that and the read the rules about how to be in attendee
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.840]   That'll be fun. I'll be fine. Does he say something about not being a jerk?
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:30.160]   Don't be a jerky jerk. He has as you know with Alex. He has very tight control
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:37.440]   Over everything. I think worse than being a jerk is poor video quality from Alex's point of view
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:46.440]   So he has very high standards. I hope I can live up to them. I've ordered some cleag lights from Hollywood
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:51.600]   No, I haven't but that's gonna be I was like wow. That's I feel like you probably have good lighting
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.680]   We have some pretty good lighting, but I'm not gonna do it from here. I'm gonna do it at home. It's a problem. Yeah
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:01.960]   I have the cameras. Do you have a ring light? No, I should you know what I wish I had and you can't get them anymore
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.960]   Elgato sells those key key lights
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:11.840]   And I bet that they're probably trying to produce them as fast as they can but they are really a nice
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.920]   Portable you should you guys should look at that. Oh, I was about to say that's what you should get. Yes
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.200]   These are cool what we got it once they get back in production
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:25.640]   John we should get a whole bunch of these because it's a LED, but it's soft you see
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:31.160]   Yeah, and you could set the temperature. So it's kind of it's a cool idea and
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.600]   They're not very big, but you see how he's got that set right on there
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.880]   He's this is actually the twitch streamer dream, right? You put this yeah
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:44.360]   That is on your monitor and the cameras on your other monitor and now you're mr. Twill camera. Yeah
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.880]   Yeah, cuz I noticed a lot of people with their ring lights
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:55.280]   Drives me nuts because you can see the the ring right in their in their glasses or in iris and you're like
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.520]   buddy, yeah, I had
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.760]   For my little pro setup that people sent me to record the speech
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.160]   They sent two of those and they just hung out here and I was tempted to not give them back
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.880]   But I did I did give them back y'all
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.440]   She's looks like you're very y'all age day y'all

[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.920]   She's not a yaller

[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:21.040]   Dog robot that we've shown many times the terrifying dog robot that they finally are selling but they're selling it is for like for research
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:28.840]   Research uses and sell any business your business. No any business. They have that thing patrolling parks in Singapore, man

[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.360]   Yes, it's so cute

[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.160]   I love that
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.840]   Beer Leo and it'll go to the fridge. It can open the fridge door
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.360]   Get your beer
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:54.080]   Right there is clearly in the oil industry and he's got two spots sitting sleeping in front of like a nice dog
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.720]   Just waiting in the box and in a Mac book, which is not the case. No, I think that's a surface
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.880]   I think it's a surface. Don't you think I was like
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:07.120]   That looks like that's looks like well. It's indistinct. It's it's no brand
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.880]   What is the term that Alex uses when they do that?
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:16.600]   To brand logos. He talked about that on Mac break weekly. There's a name for it
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:23.280]   Yeah, it's not it's not anything you would anyway, I'm sure the chat room will tell me
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:32.360]   Uh, congratulations Friday is a holiday at Google. I think this is a good idea. June teeth is an official. Well
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.760]   I'm not clear. It's on the calendar
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.080]   I don't know if people at Google are taking the day off
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:47.600]   But it is now part of the official u.s. Holidays calendar also known as freedom day or jubilee day this Friday is the day the last
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:52.080]   enslaved black americans were freed in all the u.s. And it really happens because
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.480]   the south ignored the emancipation proclamation of two years earlier
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:02.720]   It wasn't until after the civil war ended that the last slaves were freed in your home state stacey
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.160]   texas of america
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.360]   Amazon
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:14.960]   Is telling employees to cancel meetings but work and then offering
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.920]   educational
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.520]   That's like those those school holidays where the teachers were like doing in service
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.680]   But you still have to come and they made you watch videos. That's so Amazon. That's just
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:31.360]   No meetings. Where am I gonna get my pizza
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:37.840]   Google has also created a task force to improve racial equity in the company
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:44.240]   to it will listen to staff feedback and even uh work
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.160]   Oh, I have to have to be a bi subscriber to read this
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.120]   Uh-huh
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.120]   More subscriptions for leo
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.040]   I hit the same thing. Yep. You know, I just recently
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:02.240]   I realized I have been using the guardian so much. I said, you know what? I really ought to kick in
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:08.000]   Yeah, good. I don't need to give a business insider diddly. No, it's owned by a sprayer
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.160]   I am not a fan, but the guardian it's a british paper, right?
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:17.200]   Yes, it's based in london, but it's but it's worldwide. It has major offices in New York and then
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.920]   Australia and i'll tell you why I gave money to the guardian because they don't have a paywall
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.720]   but every time you go there you they
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.440]   Well, they say
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.760]   Not big, but they'll put there's a pop-up and stuff
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:36.800]   But I I full disclosure. I worked with them on the on the membership program. Good. Oh, um, well, you'll be glad
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.960]   You know, we we thought it was membership and we and pretty quickly and they said you know what it's not membership
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:46.080]   We're not really offering we're not giving people took bags or anything. So it's really it is. It's a donation. It's charity. Yeah
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:51.600]   No, I learned that also. Yeah, you can't call it a membership if you don't give them anything really
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:58.720]   I don't know about the UK, but in the United States you have to be careful about the language you use. Yeah, huh
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:09.040]   Um, just this way I don't charge people money. Yeah, it's just too complicated. Yeah, the the taxes in tax laws get involved and things like that
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:13.200]   Um, let me log in the guardian though since I did actually pay for them. I should
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:24.320]   I should probably log in so that they know I'm here your newest guy. I didn't now jeff did tell me what do they what they give you your choice of payments
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:32.080]   They will give you all kinds of things so brilliant brilliant woman named amanda mickle is is the genius behind most of what they did
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:37.120]   And we brought her in New York right before the shutdown to talk to other audience people and other publications
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.920]   And there's just great detail about how they do this
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:45.920]   They've learned through the data because man is an old campaign organizer. So she understands how to work people that way
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.840]   And
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:52.880]   So they found that some people say yeah, I want to give you once a year. That's it. I'm done. Thank you very much. Okay. Goodbye
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.200]   But other people say no, no, no
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.280]   I want I feels good to reward you and I want to do it every time I see a story I like
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.680]   I'll give you a little more money a little more money
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.680]   And so they need options for both
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:09.360]   Um, they propose amounts but people will give whatever they want to give and more than a million people have given
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.920]   not I mean more than a million
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.400]   contributions, I think it is
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:21.120]   Yeah, I tell you what I'm never going to give the financial times any money because I can't I can't tell what I'm not getting
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:25.600]   But with the party and I was reading it. I what I realized was I was reading it every day
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:31.040]   Exactly. That's what the and so so they they also found this. I love this. It was a
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.240]   Exactly the exact number of zeros here
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:38.320]   But they they started by having kind of an ad unit saying hey give us money
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:45.680]   And then the experiment and got rid of that and then uh, cath finder the the editor in chief did a you know a few paragraphs of
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.560]   You schmuck you just read the story. Don't you feel guilty?
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.520]   In the end it was half the page
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.840]   The that was a 90x
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:58.960]   Improvement. Oh wow in contribution. Yeah, I think people appreciate being it
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:04.400]   It was actually well done. I think look you appreciate what you clearly appreciate what we do. You're reading it
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.360]   This is why we would love you to give us some money. This isn't free. We need to pay for it somehow
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.880]   And and journalism is dying everywhere and I want to do want to reward
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:17.040]   Good. They did research with readers who found what they found was readers said
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:23.600]   No, we we we want to give you money so that it is free for the world because we think what you do is important for the world
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.440]   Okay
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.240]   Whereas so journalists so often value themselves about saying well
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.960]   Um what I do is valuable. You should pay me for it
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:36.640]   No, people value that entirely devoid now of course in the us. We have the the tradition of public radio
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.200]   MTV to watch instead
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.560]   But it works even in the uk and in australia. Yeah
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:49.200]   Yeah, I I like how they did it and it didn't guilt me so much as inform me and then
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.760]   I just used my brain
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:56.720]   To say, you know, I happen using this. Yeah, they deserve they deserve and I didn't give them the biggest amount of money
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:01.200]   I could I gave them what I felt was a reasonable amount of money for how much I read so so today
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.040]   I did an interview which we're gonna put the video up in a couple days with like a name ruffet
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.040]   I'll lead if you ever run into ruffet
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.440]   profit
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:16.960]   Repeat yeah, so it's actually rough it. There's no accent. I asked him days. Is it rough it or rough? Okay. He said it's neither
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.960]   It's rough it. Um, okay
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.840]   Uh, but he's
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.720]   Yeah, giga owned bought it. I don't think a lot of him. Oh
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.840]   well, he's a
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:37.200]   uh, unique character, but he started skiffed. I like ruffet. He started skiffed which which covers the travel industry
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:43.680]   And so a he covers the travel industry b his primary 40% of his revenue is events
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.320]   Uh-oh
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:51.840]   So we got hit in both so we had a very frank discussion about what he's gone through and keeping he's keeping the business afloat
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.880]   and um, sorry, we'll have that video up soon
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:59.200]   Yeah, I think this case we might have had this conversation. I think we might have had this conversation
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.720]   all the sentences for the rest of the show with the word google
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.680]   So that way people will think that shows about google
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:13.520]   Well, let's let's talk about google. I mean, we did not demonetize zero hedge
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.360]   NBC got it wrong
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:24.160]   I thought they did zero. I didn't do federalist. No, both the national review fox news and nbc which
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.400]   broke the story
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:32.800]   Uh, the issue was that uh, there was content that they're both zero hedge and the federalist are
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.640]   uh
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.640]   strongly conservative
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.920]   Yes, and i'm saying that actually very generously because really they're kuku
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.040]   um
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.400]   and uh
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:47.840]   The story that nbc broke was that google was going to demonetize them. They would no longer be able to run google ads
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.680]   fortunately
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.680]   Mike maznick as usual on tech dirt. Uh good for you mike
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:20:00.480]   No google did not demonetize a federalist and it is not an example of any conservative bias
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.840]   In fact, they did the same thing to the federalist
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.760]   And zero hedge that they had done to tech dirt
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.200]   google
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:18.240]   Uh, when the case of tech dirt because of certain comments people put on tech dirt stories. They were pulling google ads from that page
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:23.040]   And that's in fact what happened is
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:29.280]   Uh, it's not how nbc presented at mike says nbc's coverage is weird in its own way
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:35.040]   It took an operation it took a report from a uk based operation that put together a blacklist of websites
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.440]   It said should be defunded for racist fake news
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:43.600]   And nbc reporters took this report reached out to google to ask about these pages
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.640]   That's head off google's review process
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.080]   And
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:54.000]   The recognition that some of the comments on the pages violated google's ad policies on dangers and derogatory content
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:21:02.080]   Those pages so as it does google alerted the federalist and warned if it wasn't corrected ads removed from that page
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:06.720]   Google says zero hedges page has already gone through this process
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.040]   so, uh
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.480]   It was reviewed for dangerous and derogatory content
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.360]   And google worked with them
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:22.080]   And it was never more than a page. It was never the entire site. The federalist was never demonetized
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:26.880]   uh after google but now we've got a
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:32.560]   Culture war occurring around platforms. Yes, and it's gonna get worse and worse
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:40.000]   230 stop the national review as an example. It's oral cook wrote is google stupid
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:47.360]   And this comes down to uh debate really more important debates
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:52.640]   So this is a story that got misreported and then became part of a larger war about
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:58.400]   You know is silicon valley anti-conservative, but that's so we have the big debate the real big debate
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:04.640]   It's related to that is this section 230 issue. So under government we got you know, we've got a we got a three prong attack
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:12.000]   On 230 and the platforms the white house with his executive order now bar is going to go out for them directly
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.320]   And then investigate white house asked fcc also to weigh in
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.200]   And then holly has a bill
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:24.320]   Uh saying that they could be sued for quote-unquote censoring political speech
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.640]   Which I just tweeted. Can you read the first amendment? Yeah, um
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:34.080]   So how far off are we from a like sedition act? Do you think?
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:38.960]   Well, there's a case in yeah, it's good questions. Daisy. There's a case in italy that I fear
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:43.360]   Um, did we talk about this before the ation case? I don't think we did
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.960]   No, go. I was in here last week. So I know all right when it was the other way before last
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.720]   So so in your younger and have more memory than we have so I I trust you
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.760]   So there was a case where there was a fascist
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:58.240]   Italian fascist site and they got a long experience without there that facebook took down
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.320]   And courts at two levels have now ordered facebook to put it back
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:06.320]   Which is compelled to speech, which is another form of
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.120]   lack of freedom of expression
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:14.800]   To to imagine compelling the guardian to run a brexit piece
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.840]   Compelling facebook to have to put back up
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:22.560]   A fascist page where they took down because i violated there for once they got something down
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.080]   um
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:29.840]   There there are standards of community standards and and that's where I think we go stacy
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:36.560]   Uh, then we had the the rather lunar chris response of zucker bird to biden is that in the rundown? I think it is
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:42.000]   Yeah, we're gonna put that in there. We're gonna get to it. Okay, but but so I think what you get is you get the chill
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.400]   You get the law
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.240]   Um in this country
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:50.240]   Well, you know if holly get bened just to pass a bill which I don't think it will pass
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.280]   That's just that won't that won't happen. That's just grandstanding
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.840]   but it is but
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.840]   And it wouldn't survive in the port
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:01.280]   No
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:08.000]   Starracle is limiting section 230 immunity to good samaritans act
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.640]   I do hope that in the actual bill good samaritans is not apostrophized
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.560]   but uh
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:20.560]   If it is it gives a whole new meaning to the the name of the bill. So who knows now that was just a
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:24.640]   One honest man. Yeah, yes, cnbc's typo
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:31.520]   Uh, it would allow americans to sue tech companies that censor political speech or hide content from competitors
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:36.560]   And really the up upshot of this would be just math. It's basically
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:41.840]   It's so funny because republicans of for years have invaded against the trial lawyers
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:49.280]   And uh and have really wanted to limit these kinds of lawsuits and this would be a bill that would basically turn on the tap
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.480]   For for a million lawsuits
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:56.800]   Uh, and it you know for anything you just didn't like it's like, okay
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:02.400]   Um, so yeah, this is I think a non-starters cosponsored by marco rubio
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:07.600]   Uh, florida mike bran of indiana and our favorite tom cot in a varkinsaw
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:14.080]   Um, you have to promise in your terms of service to operate in good faith. I promise
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.360]   I just get on uh record here
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.080]   I promised operating good faith from now
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:26.960]   But but leo it's it's like the the law that is being contemplated in the uk out of the harms report where you to operate
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.440]   uh with a duty of care
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:33.840]   And no definition of what that is and no definition of what the harm is you just will know it when you see it
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.360]   And you have to operate with duty of care anybody who thinks I am not operating in good faith can now sue me for not operating
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:44.560]   No good face. Yes. Well, the reason so there's a couple reasons for that sort of vague language
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:53.840]   One is it's very hard to articulate and write a law that's flexible around these things right and we have decided that we really value super flexibility
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.440]   Um because and and rightly or wrongly
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:01.200]   When you put things as specifics you do
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.240]   tend to miss edge cases and have other
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:13.680]   Consequences that then have to be worked out, but vague laws stacey right aren't aren't vague laws or vague reina law is a is a is a is
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:22.080]   Is not I don't want to say constitutional, but not good law, right? Right. So what happens it can be good law. So so that's
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:30.960]   Usually what you have when you when you include those phrases you include things like that is not limited to or
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:38.480]   Uh, constrained by and then a list and what happens is outliers and the edge cases then go to the courts
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:45.040]   When you don't have any sort of guidance as part of the law though, it then becomes much more difficult
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:49.760]   It's either the courts or the regulatory agencies. So having seen this and
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:54.960]   Both of those things are a problem because one it makes it take a long time
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.320]   You know a regulatory fight is going to last for two to three years
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:04.560]   And then then there are inevitable lawsuits after that or a lawsuit can take just as long or longer
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:09.520]   And so really we're just kind of hosed in terms of trying to get things
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:17.200]   It's hard to pass good laws and it's become much more difficult in the last probably 30 years
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.640]   So we've also as we've also pointed out that
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:24.160]   A vague law like that
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:28.320]   Tech companies are going to err on the side of censoring everything
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.280]   So yes, what I don't know
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.240]   I mean, I don't know
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:37.040]   There's two unintended consequences more law suits and more censorship
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:42.400]   So I think I don't think this is really what this is supposed to accomplish, but that's what it's going to happen
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:48.640]   I think a big tech company would actually come out and find a case and fight it with that case
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.440]   That's usually how these things go. They don't self censor
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:56.240]   They're big enough industries. You see this happen in telecoms all the time. They get a law
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:00.240]   They don't like they instantly break it so they can test it in the courts
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.960]   so
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:08.960]   Now it will hurt smaller businesses in the meantime, but well remember like smaller publishers remember
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:14.880]   It's a three-pronged attack. So there's this this bill which won't pass, but that's one. There's the DOJ
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.720]   uh mark lemley uh tweets the
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:22.880]   Doj net censorship proposal quote and this is a joke
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:29.520]   You are both required to take down bad stuff on your sites and forbidden to take down bad sites stuff on your sites
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.360]   um
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.720]   This is this is this came out right after holly's bill
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.800]   um
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:41.200]   incentivizing online platforms to address illicit content
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:44.240]   and uh
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.320]   I mean, I'm not gonna I don't want to read
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:51.760]   There's also by the way a bad samaritan carve out in this something about the samaritans
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.120]   What is a bad samaritan? It's the opposite of a good samaritan
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.280]   the
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.880]   First of all the
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:03.920]   Doj proposes denying section 230 immunity to truly bad actors
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:10.960]   Uh the title of section 230's immunity provision protection for good samaritan blocking and screening of offensive material makes clear
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:16.160]   Section 230 immunity is meant to incentivize and protect responsible online platforms
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:20.560]   It makes little sense to immunize from civil liability and online platform
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:27.520]   That purposely facilitates or solicitous third-party content or activity that would violate federal criminal law
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:34.880]   Now i'm starting to sound like so there's there's a twitter account which i recommend you go to now called bad 230 takes
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.880]   Oh boy
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:41.680]   And it's nothing but i mean jeff kossif who wrote the magnificent book the pointy six words of greater the internet
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:46.400]   Which is a wonderful book about 230. It's the definitive book. He tears his hair out
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:51.280]   With people getting these things wrong all the time and then today in a discussion
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.040]   um
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.280]   Uh somebody said oh, did you know there's this account?
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:58.400]   uh, and it's uh
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.640]   It's um
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.120]   It's a little detailed to get into it's not kind of
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:07.280]   Kneeslappers, but for people who are section 230 geeks
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:10.480]   It is it is a collection of stupidity
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:15.200]   And if any but and it looks like it comes from the eff because they're using the eff's graphic
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:21.760]   on uh cda 230 the communications decency act section 230 so um
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:29.440]   Yeah, the doj says the entire setup of 230 should be changed third the department
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:33.280]   Supports reforms that make clear the section 230 immunity does not apply
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:41.360]   In a specific case where platform had actual knowledge or notice that the third party issue violated credit criminal law federal criminal law
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:46.720]   You know and actually if it if it can be proven to violate criminal law well, okay
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:51.760]   Or where the platform is provided with a court judgment that that content is unlawful in any respect
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:56.720]   Why is it bad that the the sites should not be able to leave s content?
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:02.640]   Content up that violates federal law. No, they don't right now. They don't that's already the law
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:07.760]   It's it's they leave you don't leave up if it's child pornography if it's terrorism
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:11.920]   That's already taken care of and the platforms don't want it there and they do take it down
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.840]   And it is a law to take it down because it is illegal
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:17.760]   We have very few things that are illegal in this country, but in in france and in germany
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.200]   You can't leave up nazi stuff right that is against the law and they take it down
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:25.680]   They follow local laws. There's nothing new in that
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.840]   That's just as you say grandstanding to say, oh, they leave up illegal stuff. No, they don't
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.640]   but but back to the discussion with stacey
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:37.520]   One, I think need be really careful about the notion of illegal speech
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:41.600]   And and and and I would say the
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:46.000]   One should err on the side of making very little speech illegal
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.160]   Uh, and but if you do you got to be explicit in definition
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:54.720]   Well, they I mean these are platforms so as
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:59.280]   Here's my biggest concern is that you get the same situation
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.240]   with this that you have with the dmca
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:06.720]   And that's the chilling effect of this, you know, we get stuff taken down all the time
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.800]   Which we can quite reasonably defend
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.520]   Under fair use and other things
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:16.960]   But it but because youtube is so nervous about the dmca. They just take it down. They get down take it down
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.280]   Right and that's exactly what would happen here
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:22.080]   I mean nobody's gonna argue that
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.160]   You know, you shouldn't allow illegal
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.840]   You know things on twitter
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:29.360]   But what will happen is the minute anybody complains about anything
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:37.920]   You'll have a you know section 230 takedown rule and you'll start getting these automated content takedowns on on facebook and twitter as well
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:42.800]   Um, and if I were them, I wouldn't like this because they just don't want to risk the liability of getting sued
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:49.120]   But it then I mean that means anybody isn't like anything. They're gonna ask you to take it down there and say I think this violates
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.760]   You know the good samaritans act
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:58.480]   That's what's happened in germany with net stay gay the hate speech law is that is that there's been overage of taking of that takedowns
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:05.360]   Is a very good place safe. There's a very good analysis of this again, uh
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.480]   from mike maznick, uh on a tech dirt
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:17.600]   On the justice departments. He calls them preposterous recommendations on 230 the problem is and mike has been so good on section 230
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:23.440]   I would suggest reading everything he's ever written on it and the problem is that we and every it's very difficult
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:30.960]   To really understand what 230 does and doesn't do and it's even more difficult to understand why these proposals
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:37.360]   Are problematic. I mean on the surface of it sounds like well what yeah the doj saying you're not allowed to have illegal federal
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:42.320]   Federal illegal stuff on content on your site, but that seems like that's all right
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.440]   But it's kind of more subtle and then that
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.240]   It's always more subtle than that
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.280]   Yeah
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:55.920]   I should I think we have we tried karsen. Let's get mike maznick on I would love to get him on
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:34:02.000]   He has his own podcasts as well. Um, I see he's very smart. Yeah. He's really really good
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.440]   Um, if I could give him money, I would give him money
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:11.520]   Um, I I gave him money when he was fighting his lawsuit. Oh, yes. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Yes
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:14.640]   That was a good cause and he won thank god. It was indeed
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:19.520]   He was getting sued by somebody who claimed he had invented email and maznick
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:24.080]   Quite accurately said you invented email it completely
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:29.760]   Oh, it's sorry is the male character gonna sue the dog
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:37.120]   Um, I don't know what just happened there. No, I don't like it a little barking. I do my uh, my heart just
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:41.120]   Stopped. Yeah, but that's because the dogs right next to you
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.920]   From a distance. It was amusing
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.720]   Um
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:48.800]   So
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.800]   Yeah, I mean
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.440]   What's really ironic is all of this all of this
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:56.160]   stems from
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.160]   The president's fit of peak
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:02.240]   That twitter would dare suggest anything he said was inaccurate
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:09.600]   Meanwhile every other journal in the world is publishing the stories 16,000 lies and counting and things like that
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:15.200]   Uh, which he you know can manage to ignore but as soon as twitter said you might want to think about you know
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:18.480]   Whether email voting is dangerous. He went ballistic
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:23.360]   You know and when the shoot when the looting starts the shooting starts
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:28.320]   He went ballistic and now that's why we have all of this. This is all at the president's past
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:35.440]   Well, and he also I mean twitter is his platform. I'm sure he's offended in part because
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:39.920]   You know, it's like someone coming into your house and saying you're lying. Okay person
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.600]   There is a little problem right there right twitter is the president's house, man
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:48.320]   Well, don't you be messing with the president in the president's house?
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:51.760]   Not my house. No, I agree with you 100 percent
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.800]   It's fascinating
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.360]   Josh holly, uh the doj
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:04.880]   And the fcc are really all doing his bidding that's clear whether this will match anything. I don't know
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.440]   Well, but you know it has an an
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:09.760]   effect
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:13.760]   Because the left scream take down this bad stuff and then they say okay
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.240]   I take down some bad stuff and then the right says that was my stuff
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.280]   Right
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:20.320]   And and that's where we are and so and so you know, I'm surprised
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:24.400]   They're not going to pass a law requiring facebook to save very christmas at christmas time. Yeah
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:29.360]   Well, that's it's it's that kind of absurdity of the war on christmas time. Yes stuff. Yeah
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:33.280]   But it's going to have an impact. You know again, you don't want to get ahead of it quite yet
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:37.040]   But I think the biden's the facebook and i'm you know, i'll defend
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:42.560]   facebook and its rights and so on but I think they're i've been very critical of them lately
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:46.400]   Because they're they don't have a north star and their response to biden was
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.480]   ludicrous
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.480]   ludicrous on the can't do that
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:54.880]   Facebook has done two good things. I think so let's take a break and I will come back and tell you
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:58.240]   What facebook has done that i'm happy about how about that?
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.360]   We said no
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:04.160]   You listen to this jeff's critical of facebook leo is praising facebook
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.600]   What could this be?
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.600]   Stacey's just shaking her head. What the?
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:13.760]   Stacey's just saying what happened while I was gone. What the heck is going on?
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.120]   Last week's dacey
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:19.200]   We said that we'd solve the same facebook problem and so we wanted to alert you that we had in fact
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.200]   We had we had agreement last week
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:26.800]   Yeah, that's just because after the break you can't disagree. Yeah. No, it's when and it's the great the great peacemaker. Yes
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:31.360]   He is he is in fact. I think we're gonna have anne back on the show on a regular basis
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:37.040]   I haven't figured quite out all the details of that but I he was so right now and I'll go take a nap
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:41.040]   No, because we're talking we're talking about things that I'm like, oh man
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:44.800]   What do you want to argue about this today? No, no, we're just talking about little chips
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.440]   I will I do have to say okay. I'll say one more thing than we're done
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.560]   Just to annoy stacey
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:55.600]   We no it's not annoying. I'm just like oh I have so little to contribute here
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:00.880]   I don't know. I don't know. I don't either. I feel like this is but this is that's why this is the perfect issue
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:07.440]   For a certain type of politician, which is an issue that is fairly nuanced and complicated
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:11.680]   But can be easily misrepresented with something everybody understands
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.160]   So yes, you see what I'm saying?
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:19.760]   So it's it's really perfect because you can say something like well all we want to do is ban illegal speech
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:26.480]   And all of the nuances get buried because everybody you want to say something everybody can understand that
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.960]   Everybody who's watching tv
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.120]   Can get in a little sound bite and go yeah?
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:36.240]   Well, I'm for it and you see this all the time and the problem is that a lot of the problems in this modern
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.800]   complicated world are very nuanced and
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:43.280]   Complicated and it related and frankly, I'm I'm stymied
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:47.520]   By the screw nuance. Let's go with the corner. It's a lot easier
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:55.200]   Honestly, and I know this because as a broadcast as a mainstream broadcaster for 40 years. There's intense pressure
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:03.840]   If you're gonna if you want to be successful the the best way to be successful is to misrepresent complex subjects as simple ones
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:08.320]   So that simple tins can understand it and agree with you
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:11.760]   That's or she can get them riled up or get them riled up
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:19.120]   And that's really what happened to radio. That's all you hear now on may forget radio on tv and radio on mainstream broadcasting
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:23.840]   I think people actually want the nuanced stuff explained to them
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:29.360]   But it takes so much effort and I think journalism today does not allow you to build up that expertise
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:32.160]   and the time to do that because I
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:37.440]   I was tempted to agree with you because sometimes I wrote these like really esoteric stories like when I would
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:43.440]   Talk about like the devil in details post is what I call them and those
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:50.800]   those actually unless if people actually cared about the issue because you know I care about things a lot of people don't care about but
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:57.760]   If people cared about the issues, they really appreciated the fact that I explained the nuanced cases on both sides
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:04.560]   They also though wanted me to tell them where they should stand. Right. So like with net neutrality. I would be like
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:07.760]   This is why the carriers are arguing with it
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.520]   This is
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.480]   Why
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:16.400]   The current rules of the fcc aren't really awesome for people who create content on the internet, but they are good for google
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.520]   Um and carriers are like sort of hating parts of it
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:26.800]   But you know at the end I had to say something like but carriers are evil and they want to shut down the internet
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:30.800]   Um, but if you explained everything they did that but they also wanted your perspective
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:36.800]   And that's really hard to do when you could just say screw it carriers are evil and enough people will click on that it'd be fine
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:40.560]   Yeah, they they don't want you to make them think
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:43.600]   They want you to tell them the answer
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:48.080]   Think for them, but they're they're smart at most not everyone but
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:54.160]   People do want to understand the issues and so you can report and do nuanced stuff
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.880]   You just have to tell people how to think afterwards and it's hard
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:01.200]   Some people are are going to be like I disagree with you and that'll be fine too. That's okay
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:06.880]   You represent the other side accurate. Yeah, that's really that's the truth. The problem is it's exhausting
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:11.760]   Especially in our area. It's very exhausting because a you have to have the expertise or gain it
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:16.400]   You have to learn all about it note and in and out to you explain it in a in a simple way
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:22.240]   And then be it's a lot of work and ever it feels like it's a slog with every single story
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:25.440]   Because you have to well, but wait a minute. It's not that simple
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:31.520]   And that's the kiss and then you and then of course in your back of your mind, you know, well there
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:36.960]   I just lost 90 percent of the audience. It's like there. Goodbye. Wait. Could you make it simple, please?
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:42.960]   It's not that simple. No, but I don't care. It's what's the bottom line, please bottom line it for me
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:46.080]   Well, it's not that simple. Give it to me in a card
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.760]   Yeah
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:52.160]   But that's human and I don't you know, I'm I don't want to I don't want to know the ins and outs of
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:56.880]   bauxite mining either. I mean, it's just you know, there's certain there's certain things
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:02.000]   that uh you and I and uh and anybody who listens network are willing to kind of
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.680]   delve into and then there's some things that you know, I don't have the patience to learn the rules of cricket. I just got the true volume
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:12.800]   Typographia here. There's your problem. I can tell you anything you want to know. There's your problem
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:20.400]   Now is that about typography or about printing? This is this is well about printing. It's the entirety of 1825
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:24.320]   Two volume 1000 pages about printing. I just spent the day
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:32.480]   Writing about yes, I spent the day trying to understand exactly how pages were imposed on the forms
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:38.480]   I can go into that boy. Actually, that's fancy in terms of doing things that are boring. I can I can
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:43.920]   That is interesting. You win, jeff. You win. I do. I do. I had to take a piece of paper
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:51.600]   And put numbers on it and then cut it up to understand where the pages went when you print the form. I could I could go into
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:53.520]   detail
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:43:00.480]   From 1690 you wouldn't believe it's where they paid by the world word in the 18th and 19th centuries is that why I know it seems
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:05.920]   Was dickens his stuff. Yeah, because he was they were he was serious, but even people's letters and things
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:09.200]   You know the amount of effort it took to typeset
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:15.280]   And they they were verbose you think it would be the opposite. Yeah, whereas we now have all the space in the world and we have twitter
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.720]   Yeah
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:19.280]   Well, there's no sense value to brevity
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:22.080]   16 the soul of wit
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:27.840]   Yeah, maybe actually that's true the longer the joke the worse the punchline. I think that is true
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:31.360]   I actually you know what you said something that jeff that does
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:37.600]   That made me think I do enjoy and I will go deep on stuff that explains things
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:42.400]   We take for granted and why they are the way they are like pagination. I think that's interesting
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:46.640]   Like we just we enjoy the hell out of it. We walk around we sleep walk through life
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:50.480]   Because you know doing things because that's how you do them and that's how they were always done
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:52.640]   And I love finding out well actually
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:58.560]   They weren't always done the way the reason you do it this way is because and it's usually something dopey
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:01.920]   But we just we don't we're not used to examining
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:07.760]   You know why there's limited brain cycles and in order to avoid getting eaten by a tiger
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.080]   We've really got to focus our attention. Yeah
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:14.960]   Stuff that keeps us from being eaten by a tiger. That's that's really fundamental
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:18.400]   Otherwise, you're not going to survive if you look at the dust
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:21.120]   What makes all that dust
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.720]   Speaking of tigers
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:29.120]   Yes, let's go to a break so we can learn about the two things that facebook did right actually that has nothing to do with tigers
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.200]   No, that's good. But it's a long end right. It's
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:35.200]   Let's pay attention to what's happening you've learned by the way another vital
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:38.240]   vital skill and journalism that
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.040]   Professor Jarvis will never teach you
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.920]   One is non sequiturs are fine
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:51.120]   Never explain just keep going speaking of tigers. Let's hear about that facebook thing is a perfectly good
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:54.720]   Yes, if you didn't if you hadn't said anything everybody would go on. Yes
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:56.800]   Let's
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:01.040]   I don't think so. I think our audience is a little smarter than that. I'm giving y'all credit
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.880]   No, no
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:10.240]   I I live in non sequitur world. I'm in non sequitur land and I like it. I showed today brought nothing worse
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:15.840]   Oh, sorry. Go ahead. Oh, no, there's nothing worse than having an editor say bad transition. Yeah
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:19.040]   Made sense to me. It's horrible. It's horrible. Yeah
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:22.000]   Means I got to go back to the typewriter
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.360]   Our show today brought to you by world
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:30.160]   Wide technology. This is an example of some somebody who
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:36.240]   If you're in business, if you're an enterprise and you're dealing with enterprise technology, I guarantee you
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.080]   the boss
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:46.480]   And probably a good few levels below the boss does not want to hear the ins and outs the pros the cons the pluses and the minuses
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:49.040]   They're very bottom-minded for me
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:54.000]   What technology and here's my priorities it's got to work. It's got to work with our existing stuff
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:58.880]   It's got to be affordable. It's got to help us make money. It's got to be help us be successful
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.880]   It's very straightforward
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.880]   worldwide technology is there
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:07.840]   To do all the nitty gritty and to cut through to the stuff that's going to make you more successful
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:14.880]   And that's why worldwide technologies partners and and clients love them and have loved them for years in fact
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:18.240]   I know once you're a worldwide technology customer, you never
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:22.480]   Leave we talk a lot about all the different things worldwide tech does
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:26.720]   One of the things we learned when we got out to st. Louis a couple of months ago
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.760]   Was they do they do apps
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:34.960]   This portion of the show brought to you by worldwide technology and app dynamics
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:38.160]   Together they deliver the application experience
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.800]   Your customers your users want
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:48.000]   But that will transform your business great software can do that you know can change lives and ww t is driven
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.600]   as and
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:54.240]   This is like what you do that too as a custom application and development company
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:56.320]   They design with you
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:02.160]   Actually, that's one of the things they do best the best developers start really early talking
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:05.200]   to you about your specific business needs
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:12.960]   Thinking about how to approach the problems you face in new ways and then create software solutions that make an impact
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:18.000]   You want a company that doesn't mind getting deep going in the nitty gritty
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:25.600]   But helps you hit the bottom line you want to cover the focuses on exactly what you want in your app the specifications you must have
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:28.240]   And then makes it happen
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:33.040]   Their team has the resources the platforms the skills the systems by the way
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:36.960]   If anything, I would say wwt is a great systems company
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:40.960]   They really make an effort from top to bottom and understanding
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:43.920]   How systems work and what makes them work better
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:49.200]   And with two decades of experience they have a proven track record that can really help you succeed
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.280]   for instance
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:57.040]   And we have and actually saw this app. I I don't think I have I can tell you the company, but it was a health care organization
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:03.600]   And they now that's a problem right that's hard for a lot of companies because there's all sorts of legal requirements hip-a and so forth
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:07.680]   The health care organization wanted to connect medical teams from their care center
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:10.640]   to patients at home
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:16.960]   And they explained exactly what they were trying to do wwt created a custom software app where the care teams
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:22.800]   Could interface directly with the patients and the results are mind-blowing
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:29.200]   50 reduction and preventable readmissions for their engagement at home patients 50 percent
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:32.640]   35 fewer days spent in the hospital
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:38.880]   With virtual care they can stay at home and you know what your patients really want to stay at home. I know I do
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:45.280]   60 fewer septic shock deaths occurred in patients being treated remotely all because of this app
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:49.520]   There is a rental car company they worked with again, no names
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:54.240]   But it'll they produced a mobile app to provide an improved customer car rental experience
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:59.760]   The app let customers make reservations perform check-ins and returns without waiting in line
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:03.040]   Just boom and you can see how much of a difference that would make
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:07.440]   They worked with a grocery retailer to improve their customer experience
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.560]   And it starts at the beginning through ideation and then innovation the creative work wwt
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:18.400]   Improve this retailer's customer experience. They hit their two and three year goals in less than a year and boy
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:21.360]   You know what when covid hit they were really glad they had this app
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:26.080]   You want your customers to use your app. You want them to love your app
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:32.480]   Put something in their hands that exceeds their expectations and that's how wwt does it and they do it with systems
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:38.480]   They're brilliant in this way. They have their agile software development, which really works from planning to ideation delivery
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:41.840]   Because it's a it's a feedback loop with the customer
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:46.160]   And so you get closer and closer and closer and closer and closer to your reach perfection
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:51.040]   Agile's brilliant. They do the dev ops model. They understand it
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:58.240]   That they drive business outcomes by evaluating designing implementing and operating with tools to enhance your operational efficiency
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:02.880]   They also uh, you know the latest hottest thing we're going to actually talk about this in a little bit
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.040]   containers
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:10.160]   They rapidly create services that can scale and perform by designing architecting and implementing
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:13.120]   cloud native apps in agile fashion
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.840]   In the cloud and containers
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:18.080]   Among other things they really I tell you what?
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:21.440]   You got to check them out wwt.com/twit1
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:26.960]   And you can also learn about the advanced technology center, which is mind boggling this this is a company
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:32.160]   If actually now that I think about it from top to bottom, they do executive training
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:38.160]   They really are thinking about the systems that lead to success and I've they think very deeply about this stuff
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:42.720]   wwt.com/twit1 let those systems help your business
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:50.240]   Worldwide technology delivering business outcomes and modernizing it infrastructure all over the world. So I will tell you
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.800]   about
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.560]   the tiger
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.240]   in your tank
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.240]   the two things facebook did
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:06.560]   Number one they announced today they're going to let and remember we we said if you had mark zucker burger at a dinner party
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:11.200]   And you could say and he would do it one thing you would say to fix facebook and I said yes
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:17.440]   Stop taking political ads and jeff you raised a reasonable issue, which is well. That's one way that
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:20.960]   You know unknown candidates get a chance to be heard
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:25.920]   Facebook and instagram have announced they're going to let us users block political ads
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:33.200]   You just I presume just flip a switch he wrote. I don't know to read the editorial in the USA today
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:38.560]   It'll roll out to some users now all users in the next few weeks
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:43.360]   And by the way, it's not just politicians, but packs as well
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:48.080]   And at the same time as they're doing that they are going to launch
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:53.600]   And we know this from the last election facebook had a huge impact on voting registration
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.120]   They are going to launch a big voter information center
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:03.520]   That they say and I'll have to see what they do, but they say we'll give millions of people accurate information about voting
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:08.640]   Tell them where their ballot box is and help them register their goal is to register
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:16.400]   4 million voters using facebook instagram and messenger and then help them get to the polls this could make a huge difference
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:19.840]   Tell me why i'm wrong jeff javis
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:22.640]   um depends on well
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:25.520]   It bothers me
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:28.880]   that we think that
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:34.720]   And this is this is a commentary not on facebook or but but if we think that that pulling away from
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:41.120]   The civic dialogue is is is is something desirable. That's a larger
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:44.080]   problem with society
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:45.440]   um
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:47.440]   Second what's the political ad?
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:50.960]   Uh, that's good. I'm guaranteed. There's gonna be nickers and nuts over that
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:54.480]   Because if I put up an ad saying, you know come to my
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:58.800]   uh, pro environment rally is that gonna be taken down?
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:04.800]   Um, you know how how chicken just to be foodier. You can post that
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:07.680]   Yeah, but if everybody says no to it
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:12.320]   Like it can buy the ad but you can turn it off uli ole port
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:18.560]   slug no i'm just saying um that face this is advertising not content so you
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:20.720]   understood
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:26.080]   And people already have the ability to turn off ads like I buy I buy the more expensive hulu
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:31.200]   So I don't have to sit through ads some people buy youtube to avoid it. So I don't see why
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:33.200]   specifically political ads
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:39.360]   Um all ads but especially political ads but i'm saying to to separate political ads from other ads
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:43.040]   I don't we had the fairness doctrine forever
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:49.440]   Which recognized that politics in not just that wasn't advertising but politics are a different
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:55.440]   Politics are not a product. Are they shouldn't be a product and we've turned them into a product and that's a problem
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:54:02.320]   So I would say politics can be a separate category and I am fine with that because we should not be
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:11.280]   You should not make as casual a decision about the people who run your country as you do about what brand of toilet paper
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:14.080]   You want to buy but that's that's just be
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:19.200]   Um, I just think that it it says something bad about our nation
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   that
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.880]   To be engaged
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:30.640]   In the political debate is now seen as a bad thing and that's that's the reality that's where we are but that's not saying
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:36.240]   It's a bad thing. It's just saying that there is the reality is there's so much overt manipulation
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:41.440]   Tied to these platforms and these platforms do distort the political process
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:44.160]   And we have to solve that
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:46.720]   Is it sad that we have to do this?
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:53.760]   Sure, but we can't just be like I wish I lived in a world where everything was rainbows and sunshine
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:59.200]   But we don't so we're just gonna have to deal with it. Oh, that felt really bitchy. Sorry
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:02.640]   No, I didn't that was right on
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:10.800]   Um, I I think that I understand and it is in a way it's throwing up in your hands and saying
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:13.040]   Yeah, well, we can't fix it. So we're just gonna block it
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:20.000]   You still have you still have speech. You still can post what you want as an individual. Sure. You just can't buy an ad
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:25.760]   And I you can buy it. You can buy it, but some people can block it. They can block it
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:30.800]   Yeah, they're just gonna and what remains to be seen is how difficult that is and of course everybody knows
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:34.880]   The tyranny of the default and no no one more than Mark Zuckerberg
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:39.280]   That the 99 percent of facebook users won't flip that switch
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:42.800]   And the amount of money that they lose from it is is diminuous. Yeah
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:45.200]   But I think it's I think it's
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:50.240]   So to me this is an acknowledgement that yes these these these ads are a problem
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:56.800]   Uh, and he's getting hit on both sides. I mean joe biden's buying ads saying facebook you're stupid and and and you know, I mean
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:58.800]   It's going it's kick ends getting hit from both sides. So
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:03.920]   Just no no political ads. I think I continue to stay say they should just
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:07.600]   Blend them all but at least giving users the right to turn it off
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:10.880]   And then I think the next step is for everybody to remind everybody how to do that
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:16.640]   Um, I think there's a lot of people. I'm not on facebook. I don't want to see anything on facebook my way of
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:22.880]   Of getting rid of all the ads on facebook and also all the back brown noise on facebook is not by being a member
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:27.120]   And I tried I really did I stuck it out for three months
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:35.440]   I mean, I'm not there. So yeah, I'm fine with that. I tried I thought I came back when the virus hit I thought well
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:40.880]   I'm gonna use facebook as it was intended to stay in touch with family and friends see it see that they're all doing well and so forth
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:45.680]   Uh, it did not help me with that. It just made me it just made me upset every single time
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:54.800]   You know, you know, I I still don't understand how that works just because I don't follow a holes. I don't follow a holes. I only
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:57.600]   Only
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:01.040]   I only had people's friends that I know in real life
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:06.720]   A lot of listeners and fans and other people when even people I haven't seen in 20 years
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:11.600]   When they saw me back on facebook tried to friend me and I apologize to all of you
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:16.800]   But I said no only the people I have that I wanted to keep in touch with the find out how they were doing didn't matter
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:21.680]   Maybe I have bad friends. Yeah, you must because I really honestly
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:24.720]   I'm a bullet
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:28.480]   Maybe you have normal friends. I mean I have normal friends
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:33.920]   I have friends who I added from back in high school and some of them, you know, they're
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:40.720]   Crazy and I quickly realized that and was like, oh, well, I don't need this person in my life anymore
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:43.760]   Also, people can be kind of nostalgic about their friends. I don't know why
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:49.440]   Do we agree that the voter information center is a good thing? We must agree on that sure. Yeah, sure
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:51.600]   Sure, but the problem there, you know, what's gonna happen there?
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:56.080]   They're gonna push you being able to vote by mail and then guess who's gonna say that that's
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:58:00.640]   Awful and then there's gonna be a fight over that and we're gonna be back in another cultural war over postage stamps
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:03.360]   And voting by mail. Well, and I should point out
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:08.080]   We're in a culture war about masks. So, you know what? We are at the most ridiculous point
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:14.720]   And and by the way, that's exactly Donald Trump Donald jay Trump's strategy
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:21.920]   To play along well, it's it's just natural and you know what if your reality show isn't one watching a reality show
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:27.280]   I've never seen a reality show before including the apprentice, but I'm watching a really dumb one called below deck that's about
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:29.280]   yachting
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:32.640]   And that's the service personnel on big charter yachts
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:36.000]   And it's actually I can't stop watching at least and I like pinching them
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.560]   But I so I understand the the whole idea of channel is that on it's bravo
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:45.760]   The whole thing the whole thing about reality shows is strife is good conflict is good
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:50.640]   That's what gets your attention your keeps you watching. I gotta see what happens next
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:52.400]   and
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:55.520]   Boy did Donald Trump learn that from mark bernette when he did the apprentice
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:59:00.240]   That's you want to you want to own the news cycle keep people fighting
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:06.320]   And and every time the fire starts to die down throw in another another piece of kindling
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:09.920]   And he's an all fight masterfully adept at that
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:12.400]   We all get suckered into it
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:18.240]   And that's what's brought us to exact. I mean we are so polarized and and you know people say oh we're polarize
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:20.400]   We got to stop that and
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:26.320]   But I don't think it's it's the natural state. I think it's we were been we've been fed that and not just from
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:32.640]   President Trump, but everybody's fed into that now and twitter hasn't helped and facebook hasn't helped
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:37.440]   No, I'm gonna remind you I'm gonna remind you without social media. We wouldn't have black black matter
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:41.200]   Lives matter. We wouldn't have had the 17 year old girl who shot the video of
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:43.120]   George Floyd
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:48.320]   Let us remember that these are voices who were not heard mainstream mass media run by old white guys like me
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:54.400]   And and walking away from social media means you're walking away from voices who have not been heard
[00:59:54.960 --> 01:00:00.720]   In big old mass media and I say that is three white people sitting here. Well, and the good news is mass media is over
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.880]   so
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:07.440]   You can still find those voices and I mean people will still be on
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.600]   On facebook
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:11.040]   We're not saying these things go away
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:14.880]   We're just saying that you don't have to talk about politics or you don't have to ask
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:19.280]   And there's podcasts and there's a quick twitter and you quit facebook
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:21.440]   Oh, you're also leaving behind
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:27.040]   Well, most people get their news from instagram now anyway, jeff come on. Well, you can see that story
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:35.680]   I I think quitting social media is the single best thing you can do for your mental. I think I think that's I think that's a privileged position
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:38.080]   No, because
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:43.440]   No, because the New York Times CNN all these places are now trawling not trawling trawling
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:47.520]   Central social media for their stories. So I
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:55.520]   Am it and by the way view of the world if you run up for if you want to improve your mental health also give up your 24-hour news channels
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:02.160]   Because those are exactly driven by conflict as well television is in general
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:07.760]   If it will I mean that's the television's worse. We've that's what I'm saying. We have optimized
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:14.240]   We have optimized for engagement and in every case where we have optimized for engagement
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:17.040]   the discourse has been destroyed
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.240]   Our minds are turned to mush and we end up hating each other. It's just I have made it a mission
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:28.800]   I after I did my covid twitter list with 600 epidemiologists, virologists, etc
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:34.160]   I have now in recent weeks when making my mission to find more african-american voices on twitter
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:39.680]   And I find it spectacular. I'm getting perspectives that I that I did not hear before
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:46.160]   And i'm learning things and i'm choosing actual african-americans. We're not allowed to go out to talk to anybody right now
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:50.640]   All right, and this is what people choose to say not not that I have to go out and say
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:54.560]   Educate me. This is what they choose to say. All right, now can I criticize facebook?
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.640]   Yes, please
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.640]   the biden story piss me off
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.280]   So
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:07.120]   A lot of us have been trying to push facebook to take some kind of action around the trump stuff and to
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:11.200]   Find its north star
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.200]   And then facebook biden
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:18.160]   Goes after them which biden's also going after section 230. So there's a problem right there
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:21.520]   I do have my joe hat, but i'm i'm pissed at him about that
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:23.920]   but then um
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.920]   No, I want to subscribe now
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.840]   and then
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:32.800]   So facebook's response was oh, we can't do that because the president issued an executive order
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:35.280]   That's bs
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:36.720]   Have the courage
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:42.960]   Stand up the executive order which has no teeth makes not law is there's no force of more choiceable
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.440]   That was such bs
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:51.200]   Penny waist crap and and I who will defend the platform because i'm defending the internet and all that
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:56.000]   Bs facebook come on come on don't read us like any that is actually a
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.520]   You know facebook historically has turned to
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:06.560]   very republican lawmakers even during abomas administration. So I I think they're just as kind of a super
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:13.120]   Republican leaning effort like at the leadership level of the republican reading. I think they're scared
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:16.000]   I think I think this is an indication stacy that they don't have a spine
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.520]   As the issue. I've always said they're not immoral. They are amoral or amoral
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:28.560]   They don't have a guiding principle or north star other than maximizing engagement
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:37.280]   And ultimately maximizing rep while i'm staying out of trouble in this case the real the real context here is staying out of political trouble
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:42.160]   Right staying out of the inconvenience of that that's what they're trying to do and in doing so
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:46.000]   They only dig themselves deeper. So anyway, I just wanted to you know be on the record there
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.080]   And by the way full disclosure is that facebook don't anybody my school
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:57.760]   To do projects on disinformation mainly outside the school. I received nothing personally from any of the platforms end of disclosure
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:05.440]   Meanwhile
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:13.840]   I've given google lots of money for pixel books and pixel phones. Oh, have I ever i'll give them more money for picks
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:17.680]   Look, they'll just make it. I've even given so are you making money for portals
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:21.200]   Am I making
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:23.360]   twitter audio clips
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:29.360]   No, I want to make one. I'm not part of the test. I really want that. I love talking. It's a ios stay c. It's ios
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:34.320]   They love that and right. I will epox on their heads under twitter or if you go to the better yet
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:38.160]   No, so you can do it. Okay. So leo, let's see you make an audio clip
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:42.240]   Can I say radio may make the audio be
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:47.200]   Hey, don't know not again
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:50.400]   That press so many people
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:56.480]   Okay, okay, okay. I can't do that. So i'm in the official blue bird app
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:58.880]   And
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:03.600]   I press the tweet button. I don't know because i'm android. So I don't know
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:09.680]   Oh, and you have to do it in ios. What if you're on the web? I don't see a record audio
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:12.800]   But I think it's only just select users. I thought
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:17.760]   Oh, is it oh cardy b is a select user. There's three examples. Oh, there's cardy b
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:23.600]   Yeah, okay. Thanks. My favorite is the one that I put in there labeled better yet. It's my favorite one
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:25.520]   Is that one safe for uh
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:29.600]   I think it might have a bad word in it to edit out. Okay. I don't care better. Yes
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.520]   I said a bad word. I'm sorry karsten
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:36.880]   No, I already just said the worst bad word. Okay. Here it is get my audio, baby
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:44.000]   You're not right so to clarify twitter's given us voice notes for the timeline, but not for the dms
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.240]   Which is where I absolutely wanted it. I don't want it on the timeline. I don't want to hear anybody else's
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:52.000]   I want voice notes in the dms. What is this?
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.520]   That's called conflict and it's good for engagement
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:06:00.000]   That's what that is cardy b here we go
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   I
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.920]   Hey everybody. Hi
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:09.920]   Oh my god, what the **** is this?
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:12.880]   Sorry, go to get me. I just woke up
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:18.400]   I know it's two o'clock in the afternoon. Oh my god. What is this?
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:22.880]   So you think this is going to save civilization?
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:25.280]   No, Jeff is uh
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:28.640]   This social media it's got a it's got a big future you think it's uh
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:31.760]   It's like a political ad thing. You don't have to listen. We're hearing voices
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:34.480]   From uh all kinds of people
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:39.760]   You could just choose to let it go by and you don't have to you you have to click the play to listen
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:42.720]   So finally twitter has got
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:46.720]   Audio clip features and I was only talking about this the other week
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:52.880]   Jesus what's going over at twitter? Okay. Well every one of them have profanity. Well every single one. Yes
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:57.840]   Yes, it absolutely would not have they given me you would have heard
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:01.040]   OMG, yo, we got a new
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:05.280]   Alright, let me see here how we do it
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:13.360]   Let me see how we do it. You have to upgrade update your app or some dinner. There is a new big button
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.840]   That I don't have
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:19.200]   This is a new user interface. Let me see. Let me see if my app is updated
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:23.200]   Because if anybody should have audio besides art cardy b
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:28.800]   It would be yours truly the professional radio announcer
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:33.360]   Uh, yes, there is an update. We made some improvements. Let's see
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:36.720]   I'm going to update my twitter right now
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:39.920]   Hello, I want to do it like that
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.680]   Hello america
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:46.640]   Do your do your full radio do a radio voice. Let's see if I could do it here. We go. Let's see
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:52.080]   I'm open up my twitter tweet here. No, I'll have any special buttons or nothing. No
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:57.120]   So you guys have this thing this bar here
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:02.240]   That's got a that got big button for pictures and it's got other people's stuff and
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:05.680]   I don't have that. I don't know. They don't have that
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:08.640]   No, so
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:11.040]   That's all right. I don't I don't really I can
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:15.120]   All right, well, I'm sorry. Mine's in shark mode. So it doesn't look like that at all
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:17.540]   Yeah, I don't why mine is not all
[01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:20.400]   Stacey stacey stacey. That was just a mistake
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:26.480]   Jeff mark mode. Yeah, my phone the food. I know I still don't understand what you have against dark mode
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:31.760]   Um, it's been the creeps. It's so dark
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:38.240]   Like putting microsoft things on my chroma now you made me unhappy Jeff now I want it
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:42.080]   Don't get it eventually
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.240]   No, too. There's a lot of stuff I don't ever get
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:46.080]   Well
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.080]   Don't you know
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:52.720]   It's not that it's I just think that they do a lot of experiments that they don't roll out
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:54.880]   That's okay
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.920]   Steve co-vac has 684 listens on his
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:01.760]   Who does Steve kovac
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:04.880]   So, yes, so I'm seeing them in my timeline
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:08.480]   But uh, it's interesting
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:11.200]   So uh twitter, uh
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:14.320]   Has been branded a propaganda machine by turkey
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:18.480]   That's that's canned
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:21.680]   Uh
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.680]   That's maybe because they were removed
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:30.560]   32 000 plus accounts engaged in propaganda linked to russia china and turkey saying they were state linked operation
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:33.040]   Information operations
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:36.640]   This was a story. I don't know why that I thought steve gibson would cover this
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:40.160]   I thought everybody would be talking about 20. Oh no
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:43.440]   What what's herbal 20
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:51.600]   Elite cia unit that developed hacking tools. Oh fail to secure its own systems allowing massive leak
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:56.080]   This is this is according to a in an internal report
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:04.320]   Prepared for mike mike pompeo back when he was a uh director cia and jina haspull who is now the director
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:06.320]   um
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:12.080]   They the elite computer hackers at the cia prioritized building cyber weapons at the expense of securing
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.720]   their own systems. This is the
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:19.760]   This is the stuff that got leaked to a wiki leaks the vault seven release
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:27.680]   us officials called it the biggest unauthorized disclosure of classified information in the cia's history
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:30.320]   um
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.520]   And
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:37.200]   Important point had the data been stolen for the benefit of a state adversary and not a publisher
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:39.600]   We might still be unaware of the loss
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:11:03.900]   So nice really nice by the way, that's uh, that's uh julian as
[01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:12.380]   Agencies the report said finding most of our sensitive cyber weapons were not compartmented users shared systems administrator level passwords
[01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:14.620]   folks
[01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:16.620]   if people in your
[01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:18.620]   company were sharing
[01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:22.140]   Systems administrative level passwords amongst each other wouldn't you worry
[01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:30.380]   They all had the same password wouldn't you worry there were no affectable thumb effective thumb drive controls anybody could stick one in
[01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:36.380]   And historical they did and did historical data was available to users indefinitely
[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:39.580]   any sensible
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:44.860]   Company would have you know, even this is this is like the half-assed stuff
[01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:48.140]   You'd think the cia had even like really super secret stuff
[01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:53.820]   The hacking tools were developed by the cia center for cyber intelligence, but they were
[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:56.460]   Too busy working on that
[01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:59.260]   I guess they didn't think they I don't know they were under attack. I don't know
[01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:02.460]   so there you go
[01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:05.580]   Part of the problem was that the leak actually we believe happened
[01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:14.300]   Because a guy who was I think a contractor took the hacking tools home with him
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:24.220]   You know put a usb drive put copying him over. Uh, he has pleaded not guilty. So it's a legend all a legend
[01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:27.580]   But uh
[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:32.220]   The the thinking had been that he took them home and then he was running kaspersky anti-virus
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:34.860]   On the system that he put them on the system
[01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:36.780]   the kaspersky
[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:42.140]   Correctly noted that there were it is a bunch of exploits in there and exfiltered them to
[01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:47.420]   Russia kaspersky's home country where the russian secret service got access to them
[01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:50.380]   Um, oh wow
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:57.420]   Well, no one knows if kaspersky did it on purpose
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:00.700]   But one of the features of kaspersky like a lot of anti viruses
[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:05.580]   If it detects a virus it quarantines it and then sends it to their servers
[01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:08.460]   For research because if it's a new virus
[01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:11.100]   They want to be able to say
[01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:15.100]   Well, it is a bad thing if at the same time as you're doing that
[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:17.740]   you are either
[01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:18.940]   under the
[01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:23.900]   auspices of a secret service or compliant with a secret service. It's unclear
[01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:30.060]   It's not I mean for kaspersky kaspersky has some people who are former russian military officers working there
[01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:36.140]   And of course for the way the russian state works much like the chinese state. It's very impossible
[01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:38.140]   They just said hey, what do you got?
[01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:42.460]   They have to give it to them. So it's not sure it's not clear whether they
[01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:44.220]   in you know
[01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:48.940]   Intentionally did this or did it but it that's and it's not even for sure. That's what happened
[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:50.380]   but that's
[01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:53.820]   When this actually happened that was the conventional wisdom
[01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:59.340]   Nevertheless, you shouldn't as a contractor be and this is what snoden did too by the way
[01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:04.060]   You shouldn't and you would think after snoden who was doing it for the nsa not the cia
[01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:05.580]   But the cia would have looked over there and said
[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:11.260]   Let's make sure that doesn't happen here. None of our wash. That would be a bad thing
[01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:17.100]   And uh, but no now you bring in a usb drive copy everything over take it home. No problem
[01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:23.980]   um, you'd think you'd think let's see let me quote this person
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:27.260]   Accurately here. I want to get this person's name
[01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:33.980]   You'd think these incidents would be a major wake-up call for the intelligence community and the entire
[01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:36.620]   american security establishment
[01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:43.660]   But it appears the most powerful and best funded intelligence agencies on the planet are unable to stop the bleeding
[01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:49.580]   Of their own data. That's thomas ridd. He's an information security professor at john's hopkins
[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:56.460]   School of advanced i'm sorry at john's hopkins craig new mark school of advanced international studies
[01:14:56.460 --> 01:15:00.540]   I'll give you a free beer
[01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:04.700]   I don't want him to give money to them
[01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:10.620]   I'll have to if he likes the sound of that but there is good news there is good news
[01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:17.420]   Apparently wicki leeks did not obtain even more sensitive information contained in a gold folder
[01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:23.340]   That included the final version of the hacking tools is whether as well as source code the gold folder
[01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:26.220]   state secure
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:29.900]   Was that an action?
[01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:32.540]   We'll get to this in the rundown in the uh and the watch mccollum
[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:38.220]   But they could have had one of those special google folders where it's all encrypted that would be okay. They needed the special google gold folder
[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:40.460]   Yeah, but we'll get to that in a few minutes
[01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:45.260]   Uh, we could get it to it now if all if somebody if somebody would just play the trumpets
[01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:50.700]   The google that was well time good wow
[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:53.980]   Good segue good time
[01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:59.820]   I was riding that button man. That was right on it. Thank you. Mr. j brockman
[01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:06.460]   Also known as jeff files by google which was used to be the files go app
[01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:08.380]   uh
[01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:13.900]   According in this another one of those where the xda developers looked at the next version they were able to look in the apk
[01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:20.060]   According to xda developers there may be a google has not announced this yet, but they saw it in the ui
[01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:25.020]   A safe folder to its file manager and even had a little helpful
[01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:27.660]   informational
[01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:33.820]   Thought bubble hovering over it move any files you want to keep protected by a pin to this folder now
[01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:35.820]   This is not unusual in fact. I use a
[01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:42.380]   Cloud drive storage that does that. I think it's a really good idea a pin. Maybe I'd love more than a four-digit pin
[01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:46.620]   Um, but see that's that's pretty cool. So that is in the
[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:52.780]   1.0.315 version of files by google, but it's not apparently yet turned on
[01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:56.460]   But maybe it'll be rolling out soon
[01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:59.260]   Maybe one day maybe one day
[01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:05.500]   We'll have a secret folder or a gold folder as it's known in uh in mcclean
[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:09.900]   Android developers blog unwrapping android 11
[01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:16.220]   beta they've been doing I didn't know this after the public by the way, I installed the public beta as you may remember last week
[01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:22.780]   Jeff on my pixel four have had zero problems. It's been more reliable. Oh, I made fun of you. It's been better
[01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:25.900]   It's what it's been good
[01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:32.700]   Scroll the other one was bad. Yeah, I was having trouble as usual with android after a while it kind of
[01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:38.460]   It seems like it degrades a little bit in performance. You just complain about everything. Why?
[01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:41.020]   No, that's not an unusual
[01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:48.380]   Experience with android but 11 on here seems to do a very good job and what's cool is the android developers have been putting out
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:50.380]   daily
[01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:56.220]   Like videos they call unwrapping android 11 in which they talk about features
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:18:00.220]   So they're there are more we're learning more and more about features
[01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:05.260]   In this one they would have done it. I owe yeah, I'm guessing that's kind of like what they would have done
[01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:07.420]   But they're they're dripping and dragging it out
[01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:13.740]   So I there's so many new features here and I know most of you are probably not using 11 yet because it's a public beta
[01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:15.420]   but
[01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:17.580]   Uh, this is something you might want to look at
[01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:21.660]   If you if you are using android 11 because there's a ton of stuff
[01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:29.100]   For instance, there is now an on device visual cortex that understand what?
[01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:36.460]   Oh, yeah, they got a brain in this thing. It's in the voice access for people who control their phone entirely by voice
[01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:41.500]   The on device visual cortex understands screen content and context
[01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:45.340]   And generates labels and access points for accessibility commands
[01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:50.620]   So instead of just reading what's printed on the screen it can actually understand what you're what you're looking at
[01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:54.620]   We're gonna have bubbles in messaging. Okay, the new bubbles api
[01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:59.420]   We're gonna I mean, I'm just I'm just scratching the surface here
[01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:01.980]   There's a lot of stuff
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:03.420]   Permit you like it
[01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:09.660]   Yeah, I love it. I would there any particular feature that just makes you say oh screw iOS. Um, no
[01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:12.540]   No
[01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:14.860]   Especially now that I got that twitter record feature
[01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:18.460]   That was serene
[01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:20.460]   Yeah, you know, you know, actually
[01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:27.580]   Uh, I had stopped using the pixel for because it seemed a little unreliable and it would it would like for once in a while
[01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:31.900]   Just freeze for a few seconds or even longer that seems to have gone away
[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:34.780]   So that's good news. That's good news
[01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:38.300]   Uh, and the other thing they're doing it's interesting they're releasing
[01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:44.620]   More either not only more information, but more features it seems over time there are they're getting turned on or
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:46.380]   uh
[01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:49.980]   There's so there's a lot of a lot of stuff happening
[01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:53.900]   In android 11 and I have to say it yeah, it's you know
[01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:58.860]   We're at peak phone at this point where you're not going to see any feature that you go. Wow every phone should have this
[01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:01.660]   Although I have to say that auto the voice
[01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:04.220]   I was going to say the voice transcription
[01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:08.780]   Should have this yeah, that's the killer app
[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:14.780]   Yeah, well, no, there's there's no such thing as killer apps as we take computing in more places
[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:18.300]   We're just going to have individual things that appeal to people
[01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:21.020]   The mass
[01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:23.020]   Media is dead it the mass is dead and yeah
[01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:26.220]   Stacy yay Stacy
[01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:29.020]   Kill the mass death to the mass
[01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:35.740]   So if you go to developers.dynandry.com/11 weeks of android this is week one
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:39.100]   There will be many many more i'd be bored by 11
[01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:43.020]   That's a lot of us. Yeah, this is not the ideal way to share this with people
[01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:47.340]   Well, I guess his news media our job is to watch all of the rest explained it
[01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:52.300]   And that's what it is and you'll see in the android blogs and we'll talk about things that this they'll become parts of the
[01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:56.700]   change log this is people and identity week and
[01:20:56.700 --> 01:21:02.620]   There he is talking about people and identity so um apparently
[01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:08.540]   I have to think this is kind of these are the tracks they might have done
[01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:14.860]   in google.io. I keep that's that's kind of the explanation for what I would say they're also doing uh
[01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:19.340]   Distancing social distancing online meetups
[01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:24.300]   So that you can go and this is actually good apple's going to do this to a wwdc
[01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:30.860]   But the big things you get at a developers conferences the ability to sit down with the devs and say hey this feature is not working
[01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:36.220]   Or how do I use this and they're going to do that with online meetups as apple is as well
[01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:38.860]   to help people and
[01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:42.540]   better yet you'll be able to earn a badge
[01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:45.100]   so
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:47.100]   If you view the pathway
[01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:52.540]   You will earn a badge by completing a quiz. I don't know what you could do with a badge
[01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:57.740]   Bad but hey when does google add quizzes for like
[01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:04.060]   If you google something i've googled like an Edward hopper painting and I suddenly was
[01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:08.780]   Shunted to a place where I could take a fine arts quiz. Oh, have you all ever been there? No
[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:13.260]   Yeah, it was totally it was like five answers and then it was like do you want to level up and I was like
[01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:16.300]   I got nothing better to do sure. I want to level up
[01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:21.820]   Wow, I I just was curious and it's like I'll have to ask on the show you must be in the new
[01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:24.940]   trivial pursuit edition
[01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:31.100]   Of google or some the google games. That's interesting. No, I haven't seen as they've been the chat room seen that that's really cool
[01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:33.980]   That's really cool
[01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:39.260]   Here's one from our chat mod who is very
[01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:45.180]   Very good at the google google has a new shared piano experiment
[01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:50.460]   That lets you create music with friends. Would you like to share a piano?
[01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:53.420]   No
[01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:57.100]   No, I don't know what to do with it. Okay, me neither here. Let's place
[01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:59.580]   Let's place some piano together
[01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:06.060]   Hey, i'm brie and i'm in boston. I'm in new haven, canadicate. I'm in queen's new york
[01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:10.860]   And i'm in brooklyn. We're going to use this website called shared piano to play together live
[01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:14.460]   You don't need to download or install anything or even make an account
[01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:16.780]   It's totally free and anyone can use it
[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:21.260]   You just go to the site in your browser and start playing you can play on a mini keyboard
[01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:25.980]   And you can also play together on regular computer keyboards which brie and i would be doing like this
[01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:29.580]   We all just open up the link and start playing together
[01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:32.380]   I'm the unicorn
[01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:34.380]   I'm the rabbit
[01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:36.380]   I'll be the octopus
[01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:38.780]   And i'm the dog and i'll kick us off with the drums
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:50.700]   That's kind of cool. Okay, yeah, it is. Yeah, that is cool. It's a music lab
[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:59.420]   I have now been sold thanks to the awesome video experiments. Yeah, okay. All right
[01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:03.900]   Dot com
[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:06.700]   Did it okay you're gonna play music with me
[01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:13.180]   No, okay. Thanks. Thanks. I can't play that. All I can play is when the saints go marching in
[01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:20.540]   Okay, nevermind nevermind. That's cool. I think that's a cool feature. Don't you
[01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:26.540]   Yeah, yeah, we admitted it would you f it are like, oh, all right. Our our lack of enthusiasm was wrong
[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:29.980]   How how would you like some meat in your gmail?
[01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:33.740]   Why I don't get this
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:39.500]   Corbin davenport at android police headline says it all in a panic to beat zoom
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:43.980]   Gmail app will get full google meat integration
[01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:53.100]   What was wrong with the google chat that was that was good and you actually had voice and video calling in that too, didn't you? Yeah
[01:24:53.100 --> 01:25:01.260]   Why i'm like what is happening here because like going back having i've been a remote worker for for decades
[01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:06.540]   And we would just be like you would i am people who were in gmail, you know, you're in your email
[01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:09.820]   You're working on stuff and then you'd i am someone who'd be like dude
[01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:12.860]   This is too complicated voice question mark and then we'd go to voice
[01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:15.820]   That's a perfect way to do it, isn't it?
[01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:20.060]   Because sometimes chats just not and so yeah, you just want to make a call and if you're already there
[01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:22.940]   You just do it
[01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:25.580]   I see Lisa doing that a lot with our sales team because we use slack
[01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:29.020]   and she said no in fact that's for like
[01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:34.860]   Any more than three emails about a topic and i imagine this extends to chat as well
[01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:38.700]   We're gonna make a phone call. It's like you just you know cut cut to the chase
[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:42.620]   I don't like this idea at all, but i'm an old timer
[01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:44.460]   They are
[01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:49.180]   Experimenting with removing the full address from the ul url bar. Yeah, I hate it
[01:25:49.180 --> 01:25:51.260]   No
[01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:53.260]   And this is in canary 85
[01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:58.860]   It just shows the domain apple did this with safari and i you know when apple did it I thought well
[01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:02.940]   That's apple thinks his users are idiots, but now google does too
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:09.900]   I have to say I did I remember asking tim burners lee about this, you know http colon slash slash
[01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:17.020]   www.google.com/questionmark equals and all of that stuff and he said I never thought a human would ever see that
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:19.340]   It was always intended to be machine readable
[01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:24.700]   And not human readable so he never made any effort to hide that in browsers. Oh, you're so cat
[01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:27.340]   Yeah, the q cat. Yeah
[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:32.060]   Yeah, that's uh so anyway, um, so this will
[01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:39.260]   Again carbon davenport with the headlines google resumes its senseless attack on the ul bar
[01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:46.860]   Apple did this as far as there will be a way to to stop it to turn it off, but uh, yeah
[01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:50.460]   I like seeing the whole thing and I think there's actually good a good
[01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:53.500]   uh reason that you would want to for safety
[01:26:56.460 --> 01:27:01.260]   Google area 120 team has created a Pinterest clone just just what the world needs
[01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:04.060]   called tangy
[01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:06.140]   Tangy
[01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:09.500]   It's you can if you're on android. I know you're not buying. Maybe you are
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:11.660]   Oh, yeah, you are
[01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:16.140]   You can you can get in the play store. Just just get yourself some tangy
[01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:19.660]   But pinterest is so good at what it does
[01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:23.420]   Oh, but we're not allowed to use pinterest anymore because they're racists
[01:27:25.180 --> 01:27:27.180]   Or something. I don't know. I can't keep track
[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:30.220]   Uh t-a-n-g-i
[01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:33.900]   Yeah, I read some posts from a black a former
[01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:41.260]   Pinterest uh executive who said yeah, not so good now wait a minute. Here's tangy quick videos
[01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:44.220]   Is that what that's supposed to be tangy?
[01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:49.740]   That must be because it's from the the the the google one area 120 team
[01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:53.420]   So maybe it's a video focused
[01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:57.340]   Thing oh well that that is different. That's different, isn't it?
[01:27:57.340 --> 01:28:00.060]   Here's tangy
[01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:01.500]   Tangy
[01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:03.260]   Try new ideas
[01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:07.020]   Summer is here. Would you like some gelatin popsicles sure you would
[01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:12.060]   Mmm and see this a video now. So it's pinterest with videos
[01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:14.940]   Okay, I think that's kind of cool
[01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:17.340]   That would work. Yeah
[01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:21.660]   Um, okay, let's do the let's do the death pool how long before this is killed
[01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:28.540]   Oh google's gonna kill it right away if it doesn't automatically generate a huge number of users or interesting stories
[01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:34.860]   So I'd say probably 18 months. Yeah, it's not fair to call us a pinterest clone to be honest because uh
[01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:39.660]   It's it's it's better because it's video, but at the same time. It's going to be more work
[01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:44.940]   For you here's tiktok clone then oh, that's interesting. Maybe pinterest meets tiktok
[01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:48.700]   This is uh somebody showing you how to throw a cereal bowl
[01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:56.780]   Uh on a pottery. Oh, this could be part of that whole how to thing like there's there is a need for a place to collect your how to
[01:28:56.780 --> 01:29:02.700]   Videos yeah, like I know like I have collecting a whole bunch right now because I've got to do so much for the house
[01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:06.060]   So i'm like how to build a screen. Okay
[01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:10.860]   Here's how you do skeleton lettering on your painting
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:14.380]   I don't care about skeleton lettering. What a skeleton thing
[01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:19.180]   If you want to watch the video we can do it together
[01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:21.740]   That's all i'm watching next
[01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:28.860]   Rainbow painting messy free sensory paint ice cream. Let's make some ice cream
[01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:31.820]   Why didn't they just do this via you
[01:29:31.820 --> 01:29:36.780]   Well because it's a it's a style. I think i gotta
[01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:42.700]   Upload a whole video and play it on youtube. This is kind of just it takes a lot more production though
[01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:44.940]   I if you ask me
[01:29:45.740 --> 01:29:49.020]   Oh, that's neat. So here this is an illustrator
[01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:52.140]   Snow bison
[01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:57.980]   Center a picture. I don't know center pictures. She drew it. That's neat. Well, you got bored so quickly. Don't you?
[01:29:57.980 --> 01:30:03.500]   I am well, that's what this is for. By the way, I've watched the young's do tiktok and all that it's quick
[01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:08.620]   Here's a here's how you make your unlava lamp with a little bit of canola oil
[01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:12.940]   an unknown waxy substance
[01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:17.500]   That oh look at that. We're gonna make a lava lamp
[01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:20.700]   Oh, isn't that cool?
[01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:23.820]   Timmy made a mess
[01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:26.380]   Now it's bubbling. Why is it so little?
[01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:30.220]   Okay, you can't even expand it. That's not good
[01:30:30.220 --> 01:30:35.980]   So yeah, I mean obviously these have all been seeded by the area 120 people and their friends
[01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:42.700]   I'm feeling this is not going to take off just because it's just too much work. Here's a guy posting a a piano solo
[01:30:42.700 --> 01:30:47.020]   Is he playing with the google piano?
[01:30:47.020 --> 01:30:50.060]   He's in Amsterdam
[01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:51.740]   That's cool
[01:30:51.740 --> 01:30:57.580]   I don't know. I'm glad I downloaded it. I'm sure I'll be opening that again. So it'll be complaining about it within two weeks
[01:30:57.580 --> 01:31:02.540]   I know i'm in the world. I like it. I don't think tangy is gonna ruin the world
[01:31:03.020 --> 01:31:07.340]   That's the secret is not to have uh two big monolithic
[01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:11.100]   social networks, but let a thousand flowers bloom
[01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:15.260]   Except the
[01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:20.940]   Thousand flowers are owned by three companies two companies. Well, that's what we gotta make. Yeah, you're right
[01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:27.420]   It should be easy to make a new social network. We have ours twitch. That's social. You ever go? No, I I have gone
[01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:31.020]   I went more. I did I forget about it. I can't go moving
[01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:36.380]   I have by the way, how's that going excuse for everything? How's that going when you're moving? You said in a couple of weeks
[01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:39.180]   10 days 10 days
[01:31:39.180 --> 01:31:40.620]   and uh
[01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:46.540]   Is the house done? Is it is it ready? Is it movable? No, no, it's just so much
[01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:52.380]   Do you have a contractor or is that much? Oh, yeah, I have I have a GC. Yeah, he's doing all the crazy stuff
[01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:56.300]   But there's still like crazy stuff. I've got to do and
[01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:59.100]   the craziest thing you have to do
[01:31:59.820 --> 01:32:02.380]   biggest most most hassle. Oh, I was like
[01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:07.180]   Crazy thing. I don't know. I'm gonna be crazy. I mean the entire downstairs
[01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:10.060]   Oh, that was a lot
[01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:15.420]   And then we're gonna paint my office. So y'all will see that in a couple weeks. What color is the office gonna be?
[01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:18.460]   It is a very light pink
[01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:21.660]   Oh my a bold statement
[01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:25.260]   No, no, it's very light. I would I'd normally go for bold
[01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:29.260]   But it's light pink because it's the benjamin more color of the year actually
[01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:34.860]   Light because it's gonna look really good on camera. So what I'd like today
[01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:36.860]   I'm all tired and kind of like uh
[01:32:36.860 --> 01:32:40.620]   At least I don't have the rosy glow of my walls making me look
[01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:47.260]   I did not know I'm glad you I've been asking you to do this to stall
[01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:51.260]   While I download a app that I never heard of there was a reason. Yeah
[01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:56.540]   Well, we're still in the change log. There's an app I never heard about called pixel sounds. Did you know about that?
[01:32:57.260 --> 01:32:59.340]   What does it do? It's a sounds app
[01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:03.340]   Apparently not available on my phone. I don't see it
[01:33:03.340 --> 01:33:07.980]   Sound amplifier
[01:33:07.980 --> 01:33:13.180]   Wow google you need to work on this search on your pixel sounds app google
[01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:21.900]   No, is it a ringtone company or a ringtone? No, it's yes. Yes. It is because according to nine to five google
[01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:31.420]   Google pixel phone celebrity around since 2018. I never even heard of it pride month with 16 new sounds of pride ringtones available in
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:34.860]   The google sounds app
[01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:40.860]   No, no, no, you can access it on a pixel device by going to settings sound phone ringtones. Okay
[01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:44.860]   I was doing I was doing that while you were oh
[01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:50.940]   So
[01:33:51.260 --> 01:33:56.540]   I don't even have that. I don't ever even tell. Oh wait a minute. Wait out. It's advanced. There is way down advanced
[01:33:56.540 --> 01:33:58.380]   Okay
[01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:00.140]   So here we go
[01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:05.100]   So currently I have crackle. I didn't even know that but let's see sounds of pride
[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:11.420]   What do you think the sounds of pride sound like? What does pride sound like? What does pride sounds like? Well, it sounds like

[01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:21.180]   I would if it would make any noise

[01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:40.620]   I'm like, why don't you work? So is this a good ringtone?
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:47.580]   I'm so tired of that sounds tired of that sounds tired of that sounds

[01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:14.940]   That's good. That sounds like a ring. That's perfume genius on the floor. Here's cakes tequila
[01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:17.500]   free to be

[01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:41.260]   on the sounds of pride collection. It's not an app
[01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:48.220]   I guess these are all well known members according to nine and five google of the lbgq community
[01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:50.940]   And uh, that's nice
[01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:56.140]   It's the first time google's included ringtones on pixel phones from known musicians
[01:35:56.140 --> 01:36:01.420]   I was going to say I think the most interesting part of that is the fact that these are actual songs because
[01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:06.940]   I mean, I don't spend a lot of time on my ringtones because when my phone rings, I never answer it
[01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:08.940]   So, but if I did
[01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:11.500]   care about ringtones
[01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:16.380]   You know, there are no I'd have to download something if I wanted a song for a particular person or something
[01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:20.460]   You can also in the wallpaper there are pride wallpapers
[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:23.260]   so let me uh
[01:36:23.260 --> 01:36:27.980]   Look at that google's always been really good about this with the an apple too frankly, uh
[01:36:27.980 --> 01:36:31.980]   So let me see about celebrating pride month
[01:36:33.660 --> 01:36:36.700]   Okay display would be where wallpapers would be
[01:36:36.700 --> 01:36:41.100]   And styles and wallpapers. Let's see if I can find some pride

[01:36:53.820 --> 01:36:56.060]   That's pretty
[01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:58.060]   I'm gonna do that one
[01:36:58.060 --> 01:37:03.580]   What which would not have looked at my phone. I just got an 11 page reopening plan for my daughter's school
[01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:07.340]   And the fall. Oh, that's scary. Oh my oh look at that. That's pretty
[01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:10.220]   That's nice. Yeah
[01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:12.940]   All right, and that
[01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:15.900]   My nice friends is the google changelock
[01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:23.100]   Adobe flash dies on December 31st 2020
[01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:26.940]   Really? Yeah
[01:37:26.940 --> 01:37:32.220]   There the other will stop allowing you to download it from adobe site. That's pretty much the end of the line
[01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:35.740]   So when will he stop seeing it on? Yeah, yeah
[01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:39.420]   What's gonna happen with my uh my solitary game
[01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:45.580]   Well msnbc just only a few months ago finally got off of it for their site. It was just ridiculous
[01:37:45.580 --> 01:37:51.740]   They've been dude if you're on a google chat with someone if you're on a video chat with someone to share
[01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:57.340]   Oh, no, okay. Hold on. I'm gonna try to make that i'm gonna try to replicate this because i'm pretty sure
[01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:01.980]   Uh, I am a t-mobile user and I did not notice that the
[01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:10.220]   Google makes it. Sorry google makes we're gonna talk about so when I go to google if I'm in google google has flash
[01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:11.580]   chat
[01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:14.380]   If I'm in chat and I hit the little thing to send a photo
[01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:19.420]   If I do the web camera like I want to make my own emoji of my face going like but
[01:38:19.420 --> 01:38:22.540]   I have to when I hit web camera
[01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:25.980]   It says unable to find flash player 10.1. Oh
[01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:29.180]   Right. Stop it. Stop the insanity
[01:38:29.180 --> 01:38:31.660]   That's google
[01:38:31.660 --> 01:38:36.460]   I'm granted its chat and lord only knows i've got six other messaging things to focus on but the guy
[01:38:36.460 --> 01:38:39.500]   The guy who did that left in 2016
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:44.860]   Adobe's been trying to phase flash out for three years now, but it finally is happening now
[01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:47.340]   T-mobile
[01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:51.340]   And by the way again mike maznik had a great takedown of t-mobile saying yeah
[01:38:51.340 --> 01:38:55.900]   Yeah, this uh merger was sprint was they said no it won't be any problem. No problem at all
[01:38:56.540 --> 01:39:02.540]   Muffle was down on monday because they had a cascading failure was not
[01:39:02.540 --> 01:39:09.340]   As some spec speculated a d-doss attack their fiber went out, but then all the other stuff went out
[01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:14.620]   How did it affect me on an at and t-phone calling my son on a Verizon phone? It shouldn't
[01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:17.580]   Did it seem to have yeah
[01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:23.660]   So there were other things initially the down detectors reporting that outages on att Verizon and sprint
[01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:27.420]   But apparently that was not the case on the other hand if you were calling a t-mobile number
[01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:35.260]   From verizon then you might have said all right. Yeah, but if you're calling it if there was no t-mobile in your gun
[01:39:35.260 --> 01:39:39.020]   I don't know. I don't know it maybe
[01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:46.140]   Maybe that when the fiber went out there was some speculation and it's still not clear whether this was a third party
[01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:49.820]   Uh backbone that they were honored for was a t-mobile backbone
[01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:52.300]   uh according to a tech crunch
[01:39:53.260 --> 01:39:56.700]   Um, although they had heard it was a level three outage
[01:39:56.700 --> 01:40:04.300]   Tech crunch said no they told us it wasn't so it's unclear, but it was down it was down and and you know who's
[01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:08.860]   Miffed about it mr. Adjut pie
[01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:13.420]   He even Adjut pie was was angry
[01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:17.980]   He tweeted the team mobile network outages unacceptable
[01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:22.780]   The FCC is launching an investigation. He's taken a page from troms and book
[01:40:22.780 --> 01:40:27.020]   We're demanding answers and so are american consumers. Wow
[01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:32.540]   mr. Pie please put down your reese's peanut butter cup and get serious
[01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:37.660]   Um
[01:40:37.660 --> 01:40:39.900]   So it was a misconfiguration error
[01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:43.260]   Although we may not use happens. Yeah, it happens
[01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:48.540]   We may not know ever exactly what happened, but this what t-mobile is saying
[01:40:48.540 --> 01:40:53.740]   Well, and it may not be relevant what exactly happened. I mean there are plenty of one-off weird
[01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:59.500]   Configuration error tree like yeah, oh, it's a cascading failure across our entire network crap
[01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:02.620]   Yeah, these things happen
[01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:05.500]   uh, hmm
[01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:11.020]   The internet archive is closing the emergency library. We talked about the publishers. We're suing them
[01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:13.820]   over
[01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:16.700]   and
[01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:24.460]   Somebody is outraged that the internet archive rooster kale is buying a seattle record store that's going ahead of business
[01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:31.660]   Why are they outraged because they're worried they're going to digitize all the records
[01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:36.860]   So they bought this record store. It's actually an interesting story
[01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:40.140]   Which one is it it's it's going to be their great
[01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:44.380]   78 product project
[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:50.140]   Uh, they bought I want to say bobs. I can't remember the name off to get the name
[01:41:50.140 --> 01:41:55.580]   But this was this is the great 78 project to preserve these kind of weird
[01:41:55.580 --> 01:41:58.620]   recordings many of them on 78 rpm
[01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:02.140]   Vinyl or even harder things like shellac
[01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:04.780]   Uh, so that you know, this is our
[01:42:04.780 --> 01:42:08.780]   Cultural heritage it gets preserved. Let me see if I can find though
[01:42:09.900 --> 01:42:12.620]   The name of the store. I think it was in seattle
[01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:16.140]   Um
[01:42:16.140 --> 01:42:22.860]   Senator tom tillus seems really pissed off that the internet archive bought a record store
[01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:31.260]   It was bobs not records not bobs bobs street. That's it bobs street in seattle. They were going out of business. They had
[01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:35.100]   uh a huge collection 500,000
[01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:40.300]   Uh, sound recordings 100 albums by fat's waller
[01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:44.220]   uh classical music rock rmb jazz country
[01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:46.940]   and um
[01:42:46.940 --> 01:42:49.020]   They were they were going out of business anyway
[01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:52.620]   So, um the internet archive
[01:42:52.620 --> 01:42:55.340]   Picked it up and they're going to go through those
[01:42:55.340 --> 01:43:01.500]   Records and see what should be the half million recordings and see what should be saved if you uh, I put in the
[01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:03.660]   rundown chat
[01:43:03.660 --> 01:43:05.100]   senator tillus
[01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:10.380]   Because he says he's sending him a letter, you know one of those famous letters from the senator
[01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:13.820]   As I understand
[01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:17.740]   Top five record shop in the country focuses collectible vinyl
[01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:24.620]   Uh, anyway, yes, I he doesn't he doesn't like to get a copyright. Oh, okay. That it doesn't want him to digitize stuff
[01:43:24.620 --> 01:43:26.620]   even though
[01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:28.460]   You're really saving it
[01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:32.860]   Your sound recording projects do not appear to comply with the relevant provisions of the orrin hatch
[01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:36.620]   Bob good latte music modernization act which deals
[01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:46.620]   Yeah or in hatch a major music modernizer deals only with pre 1972 sound recordings would not allow for streaming or downloading
[01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:49.580]   I think this actually was
[01:43:49.580 --> 01:43:56.060]   Who was it there was a there was a group who was pissed off that because their records came out a long time ago
[01:43:56.060 --> 01:44:00.620]   Spotify could just play them without ever paying them royalties even though they were still under copyright
[01:44:01.260 --> 01:44:04.780]   Anyway, this is a letter to bruister kale from senator
[01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:10.540]   So I put it in the in the rundown chat a story from the seattle times with us a picture of pop street records
[01:44:10.540 --> 01:44:14.140]   I don't know about you probably stasis too too young for this
[01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:16.860]   But I can look at the picture. I can just smell the place
[01:44:16.860 --> 01:44:19.740]   I can smell it too because I used to work in a record store
[01:44:19.740 --> 01:44:23.660]   I love it. Oh, yeah. Oh, man. I that was fun
[01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:26.300]   um
[01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:30.460]   Oh, yeah, that's exactly where i see so oh it's old fart time
[01:44:30.460 --> 01:44:34.940]   I used to work at odyssey records and sanakruz looked exactly like that
[01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:38.300]   Yeah, exactly without the boxes on the floor
[01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:43.500]   Obviously, uh, it outpaced his ability to keep track track of all the stuff he had
[01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:49.020]   but um, yeah, no a record store is a wonderful thing and browsing through a record store is a wonderful thing
[01:44:49.020 --> 01:44:54.460]   And I agree with bruister kale and nina in archive. These are recordings. It would be lost forever
[01:44:54.460 --> 01:44:56.940]   Yeah, it's he's doing a good deed
[01:44:58.380 --> 01:45:02.300]   So but dave voorhees was the owner he announced last month because partly
[01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:05.420]   He was going to close the end of june partly because of covet 19
[01:45:05.420 --> 01:45:10.700]   He didn't know what was going to happen to these half million records that he you know, he had
[01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:17.980]   Uh, and brister kale who was I think a great guy. I love I love rooster. Yeah, uh, decided to save it
[01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:24.540]   And he's doing god's work and of course, you know internet archive has always scirted the edge of copyright
[01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:28.220]   But that's you know, that's what happens. Oh jeff
[01:45:28.220 --> 01:45:31.180]   Of course you like it. He looks just like you
[01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:34.060]   And he's wearing a flying burrito brothers
[01:45:34.060 --> 01:45:37.740]   t-shirt. Yeah, yeah, he's our generation. I think that's great
[01:45:37.740 --> 01:45:41.500]   He's kale says
[01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:47.420]   High school marching bands soundtracks for foreign movies you've never heard of those are just treasures
[01:45:47.420 --> 01:45:49.900]   They see you aren't you young for records stores, aren't you?
[01:45:50.700 --> 01:45:57.500]   I went to a tower records the the tower records closed the my first or second year in college
[01:45:57.500 --> 01:45:59.900]   Okay. All right
[01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:04.700]   I mean, but they sold cds too. So it wasn't a formal only record store. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know
[01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:09.500]   They modernized but in austin my my nephew who is let's see
[01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:11.340]   He's nine or ten now
[01:46:11.340 --> 01:46:18.380]   For his I went into record stores for his eight and seventh birthday because he's obsessed with music from the eighties. Oh
[01:46:19.580 --> 01:46:21.580]   You got us you got to support that
[01:46:21.580 --> 01:46:27.580]   Congratulations, the united states has fallen out of the top 10 internet speed
[01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:31.500]   Demons
[01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:38.380]   We are now number we're number 11. We're number 11 very proud of that fact
[01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:46.940]   In the in order the top 10. This is based on average broadband speed speeds. The number one is singapore 195 megabits per second
[01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:51.900]   Singapore is really tiny and very dense easy to do same thing with hongkong, right?
[01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:54.780]   I don't know about Romania, south korea
[01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:56.940]   Switzerland, Taiwan
[01:46:56.940 --> 01:47:03.500]   Monaco is tiny and dora hungry sweeten and then the united states however
[01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:07.260]   So we're better than licton stein. So take that
[01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:12.540]   That's pretty small and there are only 119 megabits per second
[01:47:12.540 --> 01:47:15.660]   We're 124. Yeah megabits per second
[01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:19.500]   Thailand france spain denmark canada. We're better than canada
[01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:23.340]   Norway, luxenberg netherlands china. We're better than china
[01:47:23.340 --> 01:47:26.860]   So there you go
[01:47:26.860 --> 01:47:30.540]   So what what did more interesting in the oes tv does
[01:47:30.540 --> 01:47:38.540]   Report this is the percentage of people in each country who are stuck with only with zero or like sub broadband
[01:47:38.540 --> 01:47:45.180]   Wrapping yeah dsl basis. No, I agree and I bet you we we're we're pretty high up on that chart. I would guess
[01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:48.700]   People who don't have it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[01:47:48.700 --> 01:47:52.460]   Well, and there's always there are people who don't need the internet
[01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:57.660]   And I am constantly surprised that there is still like if you look at the fcc reports
[01:47:57.660 --> 01:48:00.620]   There are people who are just like
[01:48:00.620 --> 01:48:02.620]   Yeah, it's not for me
[01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:08.460]   Uh, do you want to talk about the benedict evans article you tweeted about news by the time?
[01:48:08.460 --> 01:48:11.980]   Yeah, I like it. I think I think you'll enjoy there's one particular
[01:48:13.660 --> 01:48:16.460]   is spot you see you surprised me I wasn't I wasn't on that kind of
[01:48:16.460 --> 01:48:23.180]   JB ready to hit the button. I'm trying to rush through the rest of this show because it's almost uh, where we want to go home
[01:48:23.180 --> 01:48:28.220]   Cause stacey is sleepy stacey is sleepy. I lost
[01:48:28.220 --> 01:48:32.940]   I'm like a toddler. I don't know why you'll have i haven't eaten i haven't eaten
[01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:38.540]   Are you an honest mccr. Diet again or no? I got it though. Oh, yeah, yeah
[01:48:39.580 --> 01:48:43.500]   So television advertising you think it's not been affected yet by the internet
[01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:49.260]   It as a as a percentage of gdp benedict evans points out that it's lost 40
[01:48:49.260 --> 01:48:51.740]   Wow
[01:48:51.740 --> 01:48:54.940]   Number of chris
[01:48:54.940 --> 01:48:58.220]   I got I got other numbers. I'm generous. I'm sure namas galoa
[01:48:58.220 --> 01:49:01.500]   So this was fascinating too as newspaper circulation fell
[01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:04.380]   And it started falling long ago
[01:49:04.380 --> 01:49:08.700]   Um add revenue went up in newspapers because they added more pages
[01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:12.060]   They consumed more newsprint and they added more staff
[01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:15.740]   Which I found moderately interesting
[01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:19.820]   US newsprint consumption of tons per newspaper employee went down
[01:49:19.820 --> 01:49:27.100]   Uh, but this this is the one that's relevant to the show google so he in in benedict ben's brilliant and he cautions
[01:49:27.100 --> 01:49:31.980]   uh not being you know putting too much weight into google trends
[01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:35.580]   but he shows the the search of
[01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:38.620]   Best versus cheap. It's a little lower down
[01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:42.220]   um that it crossed a line
[01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:45.820]   That when the internet started we were all looking for cheapest
[01:49:45.820 --> 01:49:53.580]   And now we're looking for it's up a little bit so best too. That's really interesting. Isn't that interesting? That's really interesting
[01:49:53.580 --> 01:49:55.900]   going up keep going up. It's
[01:49:55.900 --> 01:49:58.540]   It's two lines across
[01:49:58.540 --> 01:50:01.340]   with a very jagged edge
[01:50:01.340 --> 01:50:04.140]   This is the one that I thought that's the tv spending is
[01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:10.060]   tv spending is this light gray internet spending is the orange and you can see the slice of ad spend
[01:50:10.060 --> 01:50:13.900]   Which was based which was less than zero in 1995
[01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:19.660]   His slowly grown to well he redid the post that's why it's not there. Oh, he took it out
[01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:27.020]   I think so. Yeah, so it's a much wider feat, but yeah, so so the there it is. That's it. That's it. Best versus cheap red is best
[01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:31.980]   Cheap is black people aren't looking for the best price. They're looking for the best product
[01:50:32.780 --> 01:50:38.940]   That's really interesting which also says that goes into the end of the magazine turf, right? Oh, I'm gonna buy um
[01:50:38.940 --> 01:50:43.500]   Rolling stone to find the best albums
[01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:45.900]   expertise
[01:50:45.900 --> 01:50:48.540]   That's why the New York Times is smart to buy the wire cutter
[01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:51.420]   Oh, yeah, well that and the affiliate links
[01:50:51.420 --> 01:50:53.020]   Yeah
[01:50:53.020 --> 01:50:57.900]   Yep, that's interesting. Yeah, that was interesting. I'm not surprised. I mean I think the internet definitely influenced
[01:50:58.620 --> 01:51:05.580]   That you could you could uh, you know, well and also the the glut of crap cheap products may have something to do with it too
[01:51:05.580 --> 01:51:08.460]   Yeah, it is easier like yeah
[01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:11.660]   It is easier to find
[01:51:11.660 --> 01:51:14.780]   people who speak to your ditch in
[01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:18.620]   On the internet in a way and it's usually cheaper too
[01:51:18.620 --> 01:51:25.420]   No, it's true. We don't talk about price very often on on our reviews. I mean we do but it's not the most important criterion
[01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:27.420]   Uh
[01:51:27.420 --> 01:51:38.460]   Just looking to see if there's anything else the Oscars delayed two months. They're gonna be in March for April instead of January don't care
[01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:43.900]   Don't care read Hastings and his wife could be 120 millions to more house spelman to
[01:51:43.900 --> 01:51:52.220]   Historically african-american. Yeah, that's grub serving colleges plus a scholarship fund. That's great. That's good. Yeah more houses where bill Cosby went
[01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:57.820]   That is not necessarily something they want to tell. Oh, sorry
[01:51:57.820 --> 01:52:00.780]   Just as you just as an fy-i
[01:52:00.780 --> 01:52:05.660]   Okay, never mind. Yeah, just best of worst best and worst
[01:52:05.660 --> 01:52:10.060]   We work is found a way to
[01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:15.980]   Use its space. They're offering classroom classroom space to private schools in New York
[01:52:15.980 --> 01:52:17.180]   I wonder if they're
[01:52:17.180 --> 01:52:22.300]   Trying to think there's a lot of money there or whether they just have to have any use for the space or what?
[01:52:22.540 --> 01:52:26.380]   I was talking about needing more space for our school and I was thinking about trying to go to we work
[01:52:26.380 --> 01:52:28.700]   But now we don't need the space for a while
[01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:30.860]   huh
[01:52:30.860 --> 01:52:35.260]   What so your your daughter's school is gonna is it gonna be back to school in the fall?
[01:52:35.260 --> 01:52:41.420]   Um not it's gonna be blended. It looks but I haven't read the 11 pages
[01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:48.300]   I bet you that's what everybody's doing is uh is some sort of intermediate step. Yeah, it looks like like I knew they were
[01:52:49.340 --> 01:52:56.220]   It looks like they are pulling back the number of kids like she will only go to school three days a week or two days a week
[01:52:56.220 --> 01:53:01.820]   And then while she's there other kids will be at home and then vice versa on the other
[01:53:01.820 --> 01:53:04.220]   So the teachers will be there four days a week
[01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:07.500]   so um
[01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:11.820]   Um
[01:53:11.820 --> 01:53:13.820]   when a
[01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:16.540]   newsletter published a negative story
[01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:19.660]   about ebay
[01:53:19.660 --> 01:53:21.260]   Good god
[01:53:21.260 --> 01:53:26.860]   This is amazing. This story is gets more amazing for the minute. It's former communications
[01:53:26.860 --> 01:53:29.260]   Tiger king and their public relations
[01:53:29.260 --> 01:53:31.980]   uh chief
[01:53:31.980 --> 01:53:37.100]   Decided to go after the newsletters editor. We're going to crush this lady. They wrote
[01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:42.860]   And the cyber stalking campaign included sending them live cockroaches
[01:53:43.660 --> 01:53:52.140]   He they sent the couple of funeral wreath a bloody pig Halloween mask and a book on surviving the death of a spouse
[01:53:52.140 --> 01:54:01.340]   Federal prosecutors claimed the former ebay employees james bow and david harvall led the elaborate campaign for other former ebay employees
[01:54:01.340 --> 01:54:03.740]   were also charged
[01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:06.380]   and but also
[01:54:06.380 --> 01:54:08.380]   an executive is now
[01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:14.060]   indicted former PR chief executive to
[01:54:14.060 --> 01:54:20.860]   Named executive to in the cyber stalking indictment. He has not been charged with a crime
[01:54:20.860 --> 01:54:26.620]   Yet former executive one who's the former chief executive devin wen egg
[01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:32.780]   Also, not charged with anything so they got the uh, they got the guys who actually did the low level employees
[01:54:32.780 --> 01:54:35.980]   But it's there seems to be a smoking gun implying that
[01:54:35.980 --> 01:54:38.860]   They were in order to do this from uh
[01:54:39.420 --> 01:54:45.740]   From above what what possesses someone to think this is a good idea
[01:54:45.740 --> 01:54:49.420]   I I I'm
[01:54:49.420 --> 01:54:55.980]   Ebay says we have terminated all involved employees including the company's former chief communications officer back in september
[01:54:55.980 --> 01:55:00.860]   Wow
[01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:02.860]   It's just baffling to me like
[01:55:03.580 --> 01:55:09.660]   We I mean, I've had people who drive me nuts like commenters like I had people comments stuck me at giga home
[01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:15.020]   And just disagreed rudely with me about everything and I was like god that person's obnoxious, but
[01:55:15.020 --> 01:55:21.260]   Nowhere would I come up with this crazy plan to do this?
[01:55:21.260 --> 01:55:23.980]   Calculated campaign to like
[01:55:23.980 --> 01:55:26.460]   Well, just so you know
[01:55:26.460 --> 01:55:28.460]   It is apparently an indictable offense
[01:55:28.460 --> 01:55:31.980]   Uh, so
[01:55:31.980 --> 01:55:35.500]   It's it's so baffling it is wild, isn't it?
[01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:39.660]   And this person is hidden in corporate america like
[01:55:39.660 --> 01:55:46.540]   You don't just jump from that from like being a normal person to that like rape there there's been an
[01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:51.180]   There's somewhere as a chain of just bad decisions angers. Yeah
[01:55:51.180 --> 01:55:53.980]   Yeah, I
[01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:57.340]   Let's uh wrap things up with stacy hicken bothoms
[01:55:58.540 --> 01:56:01.740]   Thing of the week do you have a thing of the week? I have
[01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:04.060]   Yeah
[01:56:04.060 --> 01:56:07.020]   You want a book or do you want an app? Oh, I like books
[01:56:07.020 --> 01:56:12.140]   All right, I just finished reading lorance rights the end of october
[01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:14.860]   Which is about a pandemic
[01:56:14.860 --> 01:56:16.460]   uh
[01:56:16.460 --> 01:56:21.500]   But it also tied to some of the things we talked about on this show is it was a good book
[01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:26.140]   I felt like the ending was a little rushed. It felt like kind of like the last season of game of thrones
[01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:31.340]   You know where you're like what just happened how that what but it's okay. So
[01:56:31.340 --> 01:56:34.380]   It talks about a pandemic and it's
[01:56:34.380 --> 01:56:37.020]   remarkably accurate and
[01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:39.180]   it
[01:56:39.180 --> 01:56:44.380]   He he he must have written it after trump was elected because there's definitely the president
[01:56:44.380 --> 01:56:47.180]   There is trump and the vice president is probably pence
[01:56:47.180 --> 01:56:49.740]   um
[01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:55.820]   He also talks about a novel though, or is it it is a novel? Oh, so he's usually writing on fiction
[01:56:55.980 --> 01:56:59.740]   I read mostly like I read a scintology thing that was just freaking awesome
[01:56:59.740 --> 01:57:03.100]   Yes, I did I read that also. That's where I knew I knew the name
[01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:05.580]   So the thing is what's again?
[01:57:05.580 --> 01:57:08.060]   The end of october the end of october
[01:57:08.060 --> 01:57:10.620]   Did I get that right? What if I got that wrong?
[01:57:10.620 --> 01:57:16.140]   Um anyway, but he also talks about russian interference with the elections
[01:57:16.140 --> 01:57:22.220]   And because of his research and his his knowledge of national security
[01:57:22.780 --> 01:57:27.820]   He's actually it's a very factual book and it it did a really good job creating a narrative around
[01:57:27.820 --> 01:57:31.100]   cyber war and how
[01:57:31.100 --> 01:57:35.900]   Pro like what a big problem it is and how we pretty much ignore the influence
[01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:39.500]   I can't wait to read this this sounds so good
[01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:43.980]   It's pretty good again the ending kind of jumped there real fast, but sure
[01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:48.540]   But I I enjoyed it and it was it was a good read and not
[01:57:48.540 --> 01:57:51.900]   While it is a pandemic book
[01:57:52.300 --> 01:57:59.820]   So did he write this after the pandemic had already hit or was he no no no? So he was just super prescient. Wow
[01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:07.660]   Wow, that's really interesting a devastating virus that begins in asia before going global
[01:58:07.660 --> 01:58:10.460]   It's an influenza not a coronavirus
[01:58:10.460 --> 01:58:17.260]   But I mean everything about mask policy just a lot of the stuff that like I'm like, oh well
[01:58:17.260 --> 01:58:20.380]   He called that real well. Go ahead. Wow interesting
[01:58:21.420 --> 01:58:26.620]   Uh Lawrence right w r i ght the end of october i'm putting that on my audible list. Thank you stacey
[01:58:26.620 --> 01:58:28.540]   That's a great pick
[01:58:28.540 --> 01:58:30.540]   Jeff have you a number?
[01:58:30.540 --> 01:58:38.860]   I do i'm gonna i'm gonna go back to my benedict evans fan club and in his newsletter, which I do recommend I read every week loyally
[01:58:38.860 --> 01:58:45.500]   Um, he had a little bit of fun putting up, um a clear illustration of how venture capital works
[01:58:46.300 --> 01:58:53.180]   So we put up a press release from june 7 1999 and now it's seen a 25 million equity funding in google
[01:58:53.180 --> 01:59:00.140]   um from um a few folks sequoia and um clarperkins
[01:59:00.140 --> 01:59:06.940]   And he said just look at the other companies these folks are involved in in the list you see the economics of vc
[01:59:06.940 --> 01:59:11.500]   Right so john door fat co-founder of at home. How well does that work?
[01:59:12.300 --> 01:59:16.060]   Mike morris director of various companies including yahoo
[01:59:16.060 --> 01:59:18.300]   e toys
[01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:22.700]   quote.com e groups planet rx flex tronics and web van
[01:59:22.700 --> 01:59:25.500]   door
[01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:28.460]   We think these guys are genius is it in a sis article
[01:59:28.460 --> 01:59:33.660]   But the failure rate is so amazing. Amazon. Okay good drugstore.com handspring
[01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:38.700]   healthy on web md still alive home shop into it and sun those two don't count
[01:59:38.700 --> 01:59:41.020]   um
[01:59:41.020 --> 01:59:44.220]   And and if you go down and look at the companies that they've all been involved in
[01:59:44.220 --> 01:59:46.700]   Yeah, that's the that is we all know this
[01:59:46.700 --> 01:59:50.940]   We know that it's about you know having one huge home run and then it makes up for all the failures
[01:59:50.940 --> 01:59:57.100]   And it's such a big home run that you win, but it's pretty funny to see the list of companies here. So I enjoyed that very nice
[01:59:57.100 --> 01:59:59.740]   I
[01:59:59.740 --> 02:00:01.180]   Have a
[02:00:01.180 --> 02:00:03.180]   Actually a pick that came from alix lindsey
[02:00:03.180 --> 02:00:05.900]   on mac break weekly yesterday
[02:00:05.900 --> 02:00:09.900]   Uh, as you know, I'm all over making face masks
[02:00:10.060 --> 02:00:15.420]   Alex has recommended a a free program ios only
[02:00:15.420 --> 02:00:23.980]   Um, that is called bellus 3d and i'll show you it lets you like in literally 30 seconds scan your head
[02:00:23.980 --> 02:00:26.620]   to make a perfect 3d
[02:00:26.620 --> 02:00:29.100]   Uh
[02:00:29.100 --> 02:00:35.820]   File of it, which I guess you could use to 3d print your head if you really wanted to but they've now added a new thing called a mask
[02:00:35.820 --> 02:00:38.780]   Fitter which means you can take your head
[02:00:39.580 --> 02:00:46.940]   And make a frame that goes over the fabric to make a perfect seal in your mask and you see this is I've ordered
[02:00:46.940 --> 02:00:49.740]   Okay, leo, this is like gonna haunt my dreams
[02:00:49.740 --> 02:00:55.180]   I call it the Hannibal
[02:00:55.180 --> 02:01:01.660]   I'm like looking at the chat and then I pull back
[02:01:05.180 --> 02:01:10.780]   Uh, so it's about he stays he loses neck, but he's lost the top of his head. I don't need that part
[02:01:10.780 --> 02:01:13.980]   That's empty as you can see. I don't really need that
[02:01:13.980 --> 02:01:17.100]   But the the idea is not the
[02:01:17.100 --> 02:01:20.620]   Head which by the way, this app has been out for a long time
[02:01:20.620 --> 02:01:23.740]   We've played with it, but there's not much you can do with it. I guess unless you wanted to print a
[02:01:23.740 --> 02:01:29.740]   Mask of yourself or something, but now there really is something useful you can do that with which is make a
[02:01:29.740 --> 02:01:33.100]   A filter piece that goes on your on your mask
[02:01:33.740 --> 02:01:37.260]   Could fix me with my effing horrible torture
[02:01:37.260 --> 02:01:46.060]   It doesn't like that doesn't it now the idea that it goes cloth gonna be under that and uh, and then there's you put rubber bands on the t
[02:01:46.060 --> 02:01:50.780]   Joints at the four corners to tighten it and then you're gonna have a very nice seal
[02:01:50.780 --> 02:01:55.580]   And uh, and I have ordered several of these they're about 20 bucks to get imprinted
[02:01:55.580 --> 02:01:58.380]   I got them printed printed by a dental supply company
[02:01:58.380 --> 02:02:01.580]   Um, yeah
[02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:03.580]   I
[02:02:03.580 --> 02:02:06.700]   What the
[02:02:06.700 --> 02:02:12.700]   That's a transition I didn't get oh, I don't know jeff's just throwing stuff in just for fun. Okay
[02:02:12.700 --> 02:02:19.660]   It's like i'm here. Anyway, and you are there anyway, so the program is called bellows be el us
[02:02:19.660 --> 02:02:21.980]   3d you can
[02:02:21.980 --> 02:02:28.620]   spell is 3d.com high quality face scanning it is actually kind of amazing it really does an amazing job and now
[02:02:28.620 --> 02:02:31.020]   It actually has a use
[02:02:31.580 --> 02:02:35.660]   Well, you know if you're an ebay executive and you want to terrify someone
[02:02:35.660 --> 02:02:38.060]   You can actually
[02:02:38.060 --> 02:02:39.500]   Use it
[02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:41.500]   And a 3d printer to 3d print
[02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:43.660]   That's right. That's scary. Favourite face mask
[02:02:43.660 --> 02:02:48.620]   You know what I should do is print it and see if it can full-face recognition that would be kind of interesting
[02:02:48.620 --> 02:02:52.540]   You could print a photo of their child and send it
[02:02:52.540 --> 02:02:54.540]   Send it in
[02:02:54.540 --> 02:03:00.620]   Like a skin mask of their child. Oh, that would be horrifying. That would be terrible
[02:03:01.340 --> 02:03:03.180]   That's not do this
[02:03:03.180 --> 02:03:06.540]   Stacy Higginbotham apparently has some very deviant ideas
[02:03:06.540 --> 02:03:12.700]   But we don't ever see them because she writes about iot and there's nothing weird about iot
[02:03:12.700 --> 02:03:19.580]   Uh, Stacy maybe there is. I don't know Stacy on iot.com get her newsletter is free and subscribe of course to her podcast

[02:03:57.580 --> 02:04:00.860]   The printer is not gonna have a place of honor. I
[02:04:00.860 --> 02:04:04.140]   You're not putting on the floor. I hope
[02:04:04.140 --> 02:04:10.380]   Well, I am for this will still be there for now. It's not the finish office. Stacy your standard
