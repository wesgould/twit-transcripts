[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   Coming up on this week in Google, we've got Kevin Marks, Ron Richards and myself, Jason
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.400]   Howell.
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.300]   We're going to talk all about some pixel rumors that are around the corner, a little bit
[00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.040]   about the essential phone.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.000]   We've got Boston Dynamics robots.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.080]   They're making a move to SoftBank.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.280]   We've got Facebook and Safety Check.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.760]   A whole lot to talk about.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.960]   Coming up next on this week in Google.

[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.600]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.320]   Week two, I think of two of Leo Laport being out of the studio.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.840]   So I'm in his place, Jason Howl.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.560]   I'm super psyched to be back.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.640]   I have not one, but two amazing guests because both Jeff and Stacey are actually out this
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.640]   week.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.720]   I have two amazing guests to fill their shoes.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.000]   First up, my longtime friend Ron Richards, all about Android and so many other things,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.960]   including a Twin Peaks podcast, by the way.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.520]   Yes, my many, many podcasts.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.520]   It's great to be back.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.160]   I believe last time I was on this week in Google, it was the same lineup, I think.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.840]   I know, yes, it was very close to this.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.880]   I think it was right around Pixel Time or hard work time.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.640]   Also joining us, Kevin Marks.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.640]   Kevin Marks.com.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.680]   How's it going, Kevin?
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.680]   It's going great.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.080]   It's just turning to sunset here in the UK, so.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.080]   I know.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.040]   Ready for an interesting chat about what's happening this week.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.840]   I got to get used to this whole Kevin not coming to us from outside in the sunlight.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.440]   It's taking me a while to process this, Kevin.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.920]   We did a morning show.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.840]   It could be in the sunlight, but it's just...
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.280]   I'll tell you what, I'm not doing a morning show.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.280]   It's too early.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.440]   I'm not down with that.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.320]   It's great to have you both here.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.440]   I actually missed last night's all about Android, so thankfully I'll get a chance to kind of
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.960]   talk about some of the Android Google news that you guys talked about last night.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.080]   There's a bunch of interesting stuff, and we missed you a lot, and you can go to twit.tv/aa
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.320]   to see us missing you real time.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.680]   Because, yeah, I believe at the top of the show, I was going, "Oh, Jason, why aren't you
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.680]   here?"
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.840]   But I'm glad that we get our time in now with this week in Google, and we can talk about
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.840]   Android.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.840]   That's right.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.920]   Why don't we kick it off with something that I feel like is pretty familiar space for all
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:16.920]   of us?
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.520]   Remember, Kevin, do you have a Pixel phone?
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.520]   Are you Pixel right now?
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.800]   I have a Pixel phone.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.800]   Yes.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.800]   Okay.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.880]   So, Kevin and I are the Pixel.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.080]   Ron, you're still hanging out with the Robin.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.560]   I'm still hanging out with Robin, although I have come to the conclusion that the moment
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.640]   that the essential phone in that green color and that green and gold combination goes,
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.600]   I'm going to put my money down and I'm going to do it.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.560]   So, I'm getting ready to move on from the next bit, Robin, which, by the way, I feel like
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.560]   it's not on the dock.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.560]   I'm sorry, I should have mentioned this earlier.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.400]   Did you see that Amazon is selling the next bit, Robin, for $117 now?
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.560]   I didn't see that.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.560]   $117.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.040]   So would you recommend it for $117?
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.600]   I mean, it's your chance.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.600]   Absolutely.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.600]   It's a complete no-brainer.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.880]   If you're looking for a phone, a low-cost Android phone for anyone in your family or just
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.080]   to get a test device or anything like that, at $117 from Amazon, you cannot beat that
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.080]   price.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.080]   It's amazing.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.080]   So, I don't know why it's doing it.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.680]   I don't know if it's a glitch or if it's a problem, but literally right now on Amazon,
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.640]   both colors, both midnight and mint.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.920]   I don't know if they're just getting rid of dead stock as Razer is winding down the
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.440]   Robin for whatever's going to come next from next bit.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.520]   But yeah, so it's a super cheap good deal.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.480]   Search for it on Amazon, $117.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.080]   Yeah, that would be my guess.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.400]   They're probably trying to blow it out a little bit.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.600]   I mean, are they coming out with another Robin now that Razer owns it or is it going in
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.200]   a completely different direction?
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.800]   You don't know everything that I've heard and I haven't heard much, to be honest.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.800]   Right.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.120]   But was that yeah, that Razer acquired next bit.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.960]   They were keeping it as an independent entity and that they were going to be, Razer was
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.560]   going to get stuff from next bit.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.760]   Next bit would have the support to continue on.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.080]   So my guess is that there's got to be another device in the works that they're going to
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.480]   unveil and that will be like the next one in the next phone.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.600]   But they stopped selling the next bit Robin on their website.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.360]   They stopped selling anything on their website and all I've seen is the Robin being on sale
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.440]   at various places.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.840]   So I'm curious to see what the plan is.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.360]   But as far as I know, next bit is still an entity.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.360]   Okay.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:23.840]   So then Kevin, you had said that you were a little bit out of tune with the now news.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.160]   Did you catch the essential news from, I think it was at this point a week or two ago, Randy
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.200]   Rubens kind of follow up?
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.200]   Yes, yes.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.200]   I did see that.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.200]   That's kind of interesting.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.080]   Is it something that you would consider moving away from the Pixel 4?
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.480]   I think this is the question that a lot of like Android fans are asking themselves, do
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.480]   you stick with the Google or do you go with the father of Google?
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.640]   Well, I had a sidekick.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.280]   So I've had Andrew Ruben design phones for what's that?
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.280]   12 years now?
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.280]   More.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.280]   40 years now.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.280]   About that time.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.280]   Yeah.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.280]   2003.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.520]   So I'm not completely convinced yet.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.600]   I'm intrigued by it.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.680]   And I'm also intrigued by the rumors about the operating system for the home and those
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.880]   pieces, but that's all rumors.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.480]   There's that vapor at the moment.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.720]   So it's one of those wait and see things.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.720]   Yes.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.840]   I do tend to buy the latest Google phone and keep that high.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.360]   And I don't change it that often.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.560]   Maybe you'd maybe want to see every 80 months or so.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.560]   Right.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:33.640]   When I moved to UK, I got this one before that I had the original Nexus 6.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.640]   Mm-hmm.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.480]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.680]   It's a pretty nice looking phone.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.680]   There was this news that I know you guys talked about last night and all about Android.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.680]   Yep.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.680]   That.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.880]   I mean, initially when we heard about the essential phone, it was Andrew Ruben just
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.040]   basically saying, we're going unlocked.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.920]   We're selling it through our own channels.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.840]   We're not going to be in any carrier stores.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:59.560]   And now suddenly, essential as an exclusivity deal with Sprint, it basically means that
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.640]   you're going to be able to go into a Sprint store and find the essential phone.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.320]   You'll still work on all US carriers.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.960]   So it's not like this phone only works on Sprint.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.240]   It's just Sprint, as far as we know, as of this point, is the only carrier store here
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.440]   in the US where you could actually go in and see it being displayed on the shelves and
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.920]   have the representatives point you in that direction.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:28.880]   And the essential president, Niccolo Dimasi, told USA Today, this is how the news broke,
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:34.800]   we like to bet where we think the market is going as opposed to where the market was.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.560]   He says, I feel like we are a new brand and a new consumer electronics company and we
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.320]   are partnering with the network of the future.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.840]   Is Sprint the network of the future?
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.320]   Well, that was we talked about this last night on all about Android, but Jason, I'm
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.080]   actually I want to turn around on you as the host.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.320]   What do you think of this announcement in this news?
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.720]   Because I have thoughts and opinions, but I don't want to bias you with my thoughts.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.160]   So I want to hear when you heard this, what was your immediate kind of response?
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:08.360]   Well, I mean, I think my knee jerk response was Sprint, really, but that was my knee jerk
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.040]   response, but I came around.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.040]   I came around.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.480]   Honestly, I think any deal is good when you're talking about getting into carrier stores.
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.400]   This is very US centric conversation, right?
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:24.080]   Because the essential, you know, as I'm sure Andy Rubin has plans for this to be all over
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.600]   the world.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:31.120]   But in the US, I mean, in some ways you live and die by your availability in carrier stores
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.600]   for right or wrong and people outside of the US to a certain degree have a hard time sometimes
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.520]   understanding that, but that's just the way it is here.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.840]   People will buy from their carrier, whether it's a good or a bad idea.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:43.840]   It's there.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.840]   It's being presented to them.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.200]   It's being sold to them from a representative.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:51.200]   So that can actually really influence the sales numbers on your device.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.680]   So I think when you're Andy Rubin, you know, trying to guide your new brand to some sort
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:01.560]   of success, having a deal is better than not having a deal.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:07.120]   And it like expecting the general consumer to go online and to buy it unlocked and to
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:12.280]   be able to have that be your strategy for success over the next however many years.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.280]   I don't think that happens.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.280]   I think at some point you have to figure out your way into a carrier store.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.120]   If they can get into Sprint and they can prove that it has some sort of momentum, they get
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.160]   Sprint's kind of money, you know, marketing muscle behind it.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.360]   Sprint's going to be pretty happy to have, you know, the father of Android's newest phone.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.040]   So they're probably going to at least make some sort of a big deal about it.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.760]   That could be really good for the essential brand.
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:38.160]   So we're I mean, that is one big after you cover it.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.120]   I mean, there's one big difference between banks to the UK is that here you can buy
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.120]   Sims in any shop.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.440]   I mean, literally in a shop like shop, you buy your newspapers in sweet spot and they'll
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.640]   have a little rack of Sims up there for a pound each and you buy them and then you can
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.080]   top them up there as well.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.120]   So pay as you go, Sims here.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.680]   We have phones, you know, we have phone stores too.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.240]   We have more carriers and there's much more interrupt is there's much, there's much less
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.440]   lock phones and so on.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.360]   You can do the full full contract thing, but you can just buy the fault you tend to get
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.520]   unlocked phones and the ability to swap Sims in.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.880]   So the interesting thing about this though is that like my first gut reaction was like,
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.880]   Oh, Sprint.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.640]   Oh, you know, and I actually, I, I recounted this on, on, on all about Android last night
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.800]   as well too, that I talked to two individual different people and they both had the same
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.240]   opinion, which is like, Oh, essentials can be on Sprint too bad.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.240]   Nope.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:31.400]   You know, and just an immediate shutdown at the, at the S word as they said, and sprint
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.480]   being involved.
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.440]   But then the news broke yesterday and I dropped it into the chat and the doc who want to show
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:42.480]   it, sprints offering a free year of unlimited service if you, if you switch to their service.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.480]   I didn't say that.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:51.800]   Yeah, so I think that this is really interesting and that's, I think sprints trying to breathe
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.080]   life into their brand and doing whatever they can.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:58.480]   And they're like, this offer of a free year is a very T mobile esque promotion.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.480]   Yeah, right.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.200]   Does that, does that seem very team all like seems that a T mobile's playbook, right?
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:08.040]   And, and I think that my guess is that they must have, you know, they must have dumped
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:13.960]   a bunch of money in, in essentials pocket in order to get this exclusive.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.800]   I think that essential has to get into the carriers.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.200]   I mean, we've talked about this all every time I talk about cell phones, the great one
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.760]   plus is a great phone.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:22.760]   Grab somebody on the street.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:23.760]   They don't know how to get it.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.760]   No.
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.440]   You know, like we all know that you can go, you can buy these phones unlocked.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.440]   It's not Kevin.
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.920]   It's not like in the UK with Carphone Warehouse and places like that where you were, you know,
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.160]   there's a different, there's a different approach to phones in other countries.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.640]   Here the millions and millions of people go to the cell phone store and it's, it could
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.120]   be Verizon, it could be Sprint, it could be T-Mobile's, whatever's in their neighborhood
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.560]   and they buy whatever phone is there.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:50.320]   So if essential wants to break away from the one pluses and the next bits and all the other,
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:55.160]   these other kind of, you know, even Huawei, like all these kind of, you know, one off hardware
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.640]   startups that are trying to break into the US market, they have to get with a carrier.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.000]   So if it's sprints, so be it.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.680]   Maybe, maybe the sales are enough then that when the exclusive ends, then T-Mobile and
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.640]   AT&T one on board.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.640]   No.
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.600]   And if, if, yeah, I think you're exactly.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.600]   Right.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:17.520]   Sprint, Sprint needs eyeballs, it needs, it needs some sort of fire underneath their brand
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:21.960]   because they're clearly behind the other three at this point.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:27.120]   This is totally out of T-Mobile's playbook and T-Mobile continues to do these things and T-Mobile,
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.320]   you know, is, is improving its network.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:33.800]   So it's, it's, it's able to kind of back it up at this point.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.880]   I think this was just, this was an opportunity for Sprint to say, hey, here's what has the
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:45.360]   potential to be a very kind of eye catching, very, I don't know, buzzworthy device and
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.600]   it doesn't have a carrier agreement.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:52.320]   We're willing to do what needs to happen in order to give, you know, bring them into
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.800]   our stores to make it comfortable for them.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.360]   We're there early on in, you know, maybe that ends up, you know, giving a little bit
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.640]   of extra cashier to Sprint.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.600]   I just don't know how much, how much power the essential brand will have out of the gate.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.520]   I don't think it has very much out of the gate.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.520]   It has to build that.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.520]   This is a way to start building.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.520]   It's got to start somewhere.
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.720]   And, and, and, and with that Sprint offer, there are tons of restrictions and like not
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.320]   all phones and all this sort of stuff, but still even then some people are going to get
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.320]   free service.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.880]   And so I think it's really interesting.
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:24.720]   And, and hopefully people give essential a try through Sprint and like I'm rooting for
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.960]   Central just because I'm rooting for innovation in the space.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.360]   And you're, you have said that you plan on getting an essential?
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.360]   Is that correct?
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:39.440]   Yeah, I'm waiting, I'm waiting desperately for, for some date around the, I think it's
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.000]   the, oh, is the ocean blue color?
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   What is it?
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Is that what it is?
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.360]   We're not ocean blue or ocean green.
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.720]   I forgot what the color is, but let's see, I'm going on the website now.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.120]   Your standard black white.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.120]   I don't want the black or white.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.160]   No, that's, I'm the thing that, yeah, it's ocean depths.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.160]   That's what it's called now.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.160]   Ocean depths.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:59.600]   It's the, the green phone with the, with the gold kind of a bezel or, you know, kind of
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.600]   frame around it.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.960]   Yeah, like a black or white, that's a bore.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:06.600]   After, go, after with the next bit Robin having such a unique looking phone, I want to make
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.040]   sure I have unique looking phones.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.040]   So, yeah.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:13.360]   Let's just hope that has that, that the essential has a little bit more longevity on
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:18.760]   the, on the design, like on the, on the actual durability of the design than the next bit
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.760]   Robin.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.360]   Cause your phone's showing a little bit of age and not going to lie.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.840]   I've definitely, I've definitely beaten that phone up.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:33.600]   But yeah, I want to put the essentials titanium case, uh, to kind of give it the, the drop
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.600]   challenge myself.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:39.280]   So, titanium is nice and all, but there's also a little bit of ceramic in there.
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.280]   So just be careful.
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.480]   I'm definitely looking forward to the phone.
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:47.800]   And I think it's an eye catching device and, um, yeah, any, any deals better than no deal.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:52.120]   I also really hope this sprint doesn't get in there and, you know, one, one of the things
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:15:00.360]   that Andy Rubin was really kind of very emphatic about was a very kind of cruft, free, true
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.280]   Android experience.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:06.040]   No extra kind of, you know, bloat, bloat apps on there.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.560]   And once you start making deals with carriers, at least in the Android space, not in the
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.360]   iOS space, apples made the deals to where they, this doesn't happen.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.400]   It seems like, but on Android, it ends up meaning that you get a bunch of extra apps
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.720]   and icons that maybe you do or do not want there.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.560]   Uh, so hopefully that doesn't happen with this, but I guess we'll see.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:29.920]   Um, so what I was originally going to talk about, but I'm happy we started with the essential
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.280]   first is kind of this.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:38.080]   We've suddenly have this influx of pixel news, which I'm a pixel XL owner.
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.680]   Uh, Kevin, you've got the pixel.
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.920]   Do you have the bigger one or the smaller one?
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.120]   Oh, the big one here.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.120]   There you go.
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.120]   You've got the XL.
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.120]   Wow.
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.120]   So, so the rumors had been up until now.
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:52.160]   Little bits here and there that there were going to be not one, not two, but three pixel
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.160]   phones.
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:58.120]   It was going to be the next generations of the ones we have and then a much larger one
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.120]   or something.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.120]   I got confused.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.120]   It's all room rate.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.120]   It doesn't really matter.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.880]   I suppose when it's in the rumor world.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:09.800]   Um, but apparently, excuse me, Android police is pretty darn confident that the successor
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.320]   to the pixel XL is actually not happening.
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.480]   Uh, the, it code name, Musky.
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.840]   I love their code names for these phones.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.480]   The fish is a fish, right?
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.480]   All around fish.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.480]   Yes.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.480]   Exactly.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.960]   Um, in its place, they're going to opt for the even larger pixel than the XL.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.600]   So maybe the double XL or whatever they're going to end up calling it.
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.000]   So, and I don't, I don't understand.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   I don't get it.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:41.160]   So the pixel XL right now, the 2016, which is what I have is a 5.5 inches.
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:46.400]   So I would think that that would be a good kind of, you know, that's a decent size to
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.760]   go with the sequel.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.120]   From what I understand from this, and correct me if I'm wrong, Ron, is that they're not
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.920]   going to be replacing this size with a sequel.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.520]   They're going to be replacing this size with a larger one.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:57.680]   Is that right?
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.680]   That's the rumor.
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:16:59.680]   Yeah.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.880]   That is going to be a larger version of it.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.880]   It's going to be a next gen.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.640]   And there's also a bunch of other rumors about the chipsets as well as that they did
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.880]   you see that hiring announcement?
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:10.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:11.880]   That's a pixel rumors.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.760]   We're in the pre-pixel announcement rumor mode, right?
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:15.760]   We are.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.760]   We've done this.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.960]   We've done this enough, you know, a number of years now to the point to where we know
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.960]   the phases that we've gone into.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:25.880]   And now that we're in summertime, it's like leading up to Google hardware time for the
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.160]   next couple of months.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:32.160]   Yeah, there's a number of things leaking around this.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:39.040]   One of them is that the successor will be larger, but that it'll be a narrower screen
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.040]   ratio.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:46.360]   Similar to what we see with the Samsung Galaxy S8, S8+, it's a larger screen, but you know,
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:51.640]   it's taller, essentially, and narrower, less bezel, of course, because everybody's going
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.640]   less bezel.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:58.920]   And that was a big complaint that people had about the pixel is that it was a, it loved
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.160]   its bezels, at least at the top and bottom.
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.000]   And what do I always say, Jason?
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   The future is bezel-less.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   Yes.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.280]   So I don't know how I feel about that.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.280]   Bezel never bothered me.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.160]   I don't know, Kevin, you've lived with this device.
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:15.520]   Did the top and bottom bezels ever stick out to you, sorely?
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:19.880]   I prefer it when I had one that was black-randy edges rather than white, but this was the
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:24.280]   one that they had in stock, so I've got the one that's white.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:28.080]   But there's dead space there.
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:35.440]   Yeah, I mean, I could use a bit less space and have me more useful, but you still want
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.240]   the challenge of what you do to do where you put the cameras when you shrink the bezel,
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.240]   obviously.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.240]   Exactly.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:45.280]   And I mean, if you take a look at what Essential did, they just notched out the display.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.440]   They were like, "Yeah, well, the camera's going to go there.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.360]   We'll just put the display around it in a little U-shape."
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.760]   I think it looks a little weird.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:52.760]   Ron, you seriously--
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:53.760]   I love it.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:54.760]   I love it.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:55.760]   I think it's great.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.760]   The weirder, the better.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:57.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:58.760]   Exactly.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.760]   So that's going to work for that.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:00.760]   What's up, Kevin?
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.760]   As long as you're like, some of you're trying to read isn't under it.
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:05.760]   That's one of the questions that I have, right?
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.200]   It's right up there in the notification pane.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.200]   Is that going to require some sort of custom work?
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.200]   You know what I mean?
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:17.600]   You can't have your notifications hidden because the notch is taken out and the OS doesn't recognize
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.600]   that.
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.600]   I'm sure they'll have that figured out.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.640]   I got to imagine they're smart enough to figure that out for whatever reason.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:28.320]   But-- No, but I happen to-- I mean, so if the Essential Phone hadn't come out, I was
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:32.120]   eyeing the Pixel as my next phone.
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.360]   And I was in that mode of, "Am I going to wait for the Pixel 2 or not?"
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.600]   And maybe wait until the Pixel 2 gets announced and get the Pixel at a cheaper price.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.600]   That sort of thing.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:45.600]   But I got to admit, from the few times I've seen the new Samsung Galaxy phone, I like the
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.520]   longer, thinner style one.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:53.400]   I think the fat, big version is-- I don't know.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:58.480]   Something about the long Samsung phone that I think that's a good aspect ratio for phones
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.480]   moving forward.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.560]   And yes, it's hard to get your thumb all the way down to the top, but so you two hand
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:03.560]   it.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.000]   It's not the end of the world.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.160]   But then usually I fall for the five and a half inch kind of size, the smaller size phone
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.160]   anyway.
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.960]   So I doubt I would even buy either of them, so it doesn't really matter.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.280]   But I do like the longer version.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.280]   I would agree.
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.440]   I would agree, actually.
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.960]   I would not be.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.680]   And we saw that from the six.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:24.880]   Like I had the six before the six P, which was fatter than this one.
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.880]   And I mean, you couldn't even reach across to the other side of the screen with one hand.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.840]   It was definitely a two handed thing.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.960]   I've definitely noticed the slimmer they're getting, even though they're increasing the
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:40.120]   screen size, they're able to kind of maximize the size of the device around the display,
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:44.000]   make it a little slimmer so it's easier to use with one hand, but still have kind of
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.560]   the overall size and dimension of the phone one handable.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:49.560]   You know what I mean?
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:53.560]   It's bigger, but it's not because they're reducing the bezel.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:21:00.880]   So there's that trend that is apparently potentially going to come to this rumored pixel sequel.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:08.680]   Or gigs of RAM, octa-core CPU, which Snapdragon 835 is what's expected there.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.000]   And I mean, other things.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Let's see here.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   What was the next one?
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.920]   LG is apparently potentially going to be working on this device.
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:24.040]   With the previous, with the pixel that we have now, it was made by Google.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:27.680]   But then when you really got under the hood, you realize it was made by Google with HTC's
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:32.800]   port, and apparently that's going to go in the direction of LG this time instead of
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:33.800]   HTC.
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.480]   Very curious about that.
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.320]   Why do you guys think that might be?
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.840]   Any, any, I don't know, wild guesses?
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:49.280]   I mean, historically, they flip back and forth between the different builders, haven't they?
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:52.080]   What'd you call it?
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.080]   The Nexus was LG.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.080]   Wasn't it?
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.080]   At least one of them was.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.080]   They had a couple.
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.080]   Legendary Nexus.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.080]   Yes.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.080]   My favorite phone of all time.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:08.160]   But I mean, I think with the pixel universe, Google really wanted to make a statement and
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.680]   say, "Well, these aren't deals that we're making with anyone else.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:12.680]   These are our phones.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:16.200]   They want to pull an app and be like, "We're doing this all in house."
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.240]   Which ties into other things that we're hearing.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.240]   This all threads together here.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.160]   Think of my motor rider again?
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.160]   What's that?
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.400]   Think of my motor rider again?
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.560]   Would that be a good thing or a bad thing at this point?
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.560]   I don't even know.
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:32.560]   No.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:37.480]   So apparently, Google hired Apple veteran chip engineer Manu Galati after eight years with
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.720]   Apple.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:44.040]   Google has big plans to kind of move its chip production in house.
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:47.000]   Galati has 27 years of industry experience.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.160]   He worked 15 years at AMD in Broadcom before his eight years at Apple.
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:55.760]   While he was at Apple, it coincided with the company switching to its own chips using
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.800]   them in the iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip and beyond.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:07.520]   Big time coordinator and engineer around Apple switched to in-house chip production.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.520]   Google's bringing him on.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:17.760]   They've also got jobs posted for other engineers on the SOC side of things.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.080]   What does that say for Google's hardware?
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:25.720]   When it's creating its chips, we heard David Burke and other Google execs at Google.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:31.800]   I/O talking about hardware embedded in the phones that they create that tie directly
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:36.480]   into things that aid in advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning and all
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.760]   this kind of stuff.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.240]   What does it mean when Google brings all of this stuff in house?
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.880]   Is it good to have it all vertically integrated the way a company like Apple does?
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:49.600]   Do you think that would be a good thing for Google's efforts, Kevin?
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:54.920]   Well, they do have some experience of how we're custom-how with themselves.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.800]   But they previously don't have a data center.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:01.440]   They do have a bunch of chip experience in that realm, but it's a very different realm
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.440]   than this.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:09.400]   It would make sense to bring someone in who knows this low-power domain much better.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:13.840]   I think they are big enough and they have enough money to afford to do some of this.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.200]   That does make some sense.
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:20.840]   It's the question of, now they've been pulling back from lots of the moonshot stuff.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.960]   Is this the way they can spend the money and become more like Apple or, in some sense,
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:25.960]   even like Microsoft.
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:30.680]   Microsoft has been doing a little bit of this as well.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:36.880]   It makes sense if you look at the alphabet level, it would make sense for them to do
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.560]   this as an alphabet company, I would think.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.320]   But if they're doing it, it's probably good.
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.760]   That's interesting too.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:44.760]   That's true.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.880]   What part of the umbrella would this hardware or would it fall under Rick Osterlow like
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:53.360]   is this firmly in the hardware camp or Rick Osterlow formerly of Motorola.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.720]   He now leads the hardware division at Google.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:02.480]   Does he oversee that whole effort, especially in the sense that it all ties into the hardware
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.360]   like the Pixel line that they're creating everything?
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.080]   Ron, it looks like something to say.
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:11.800]   I was going to say, I think the combination of the rumor of LG making the next Pixel
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:17.600]   phone plus this higher of Manu Goladi or all indicators, I'm not surprised LG is being
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.360]   tapped for the next Pixel phone because like Kevin said, for years they've spread the
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.360]   wealth.
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.640]   They've never favored one manufacturer over the other.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:30.560]   I think that has been done to maintain those relationships to keep everybody happy.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:36.840]   But also they're inching ever closer to the identity of the Pixel and the Google phone.
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:42.680]   The branding on this past time with the Pixel was so strongly Google.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.680]   We knew what was under the hood, but the average person thought it was Google.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:51.080]   I think that hiring Manu Goladi and looking into doing the chipset and then maybe the
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:55.320]   hardware is again, I feel like it's a repeat of a couple years ago, but it's Google tipping
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.880]   their toe back into the water of saying, okay, well, what if we bring all this in-house and
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.560]   we do this all, we don't have a partner?
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:06.800]   And I feel like it's a tightrope that they're walking because on one hand, you get the sense
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.160]   that they really want to own a phone.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:11.720]   They really want to own the phone business if they can.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.640]   They want to compete with Apple and Samsung.
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:17.280]   So on the other hand, with Android, they have all these OEMs and all these partners that
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.280]   they need to keep happy.
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.240]   And so it feels like they're trying to keep both sides happy.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:26.120]   >> Well, the other thing is to map this to the rest of the sort of Google point of view
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.120]   on this.
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.960]   They've been building stuff for the other sense for a long time.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:33.840]   As I said, they've basically been building it out custom machines to be data center machines.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.720]   They've also built their own switches to control systems there.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.160]   And now they've moved to the TensorFlow, the TPU.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:46.000]   So part of this may be drawing some of that back to, if they're taking this big bit on
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.560]   AI, it may be that they're putting it, they want to put a TPU in the phone as well and
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.920]   get that to a low power design as well.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.800]   So that may make sense for them to, if you're looking at the next generation of Android
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.840]   or the generation after that, you're going to want custom chips for that.
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.800]   And if they're going to keep up the VR stuff, they're going to want custom chips for that
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:04.800]   as well.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:10.080]   So there's potentially a set of integrations that they want to do to make sure that, so
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.880]   hiring someone who's an expert at pulling multiple subunits together into one chip and
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.960]   keeping the power low is a very smart move from that point of view.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:17.960]   Yeah.
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:18.960]   Yeah.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.680]   It's an idea of holistic development of that.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:25.600]   Listen, we want a device that can do this on the software side instead of leaning on
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:31.040]   Qualcomm or whomever else that's making chipsets or processors or whatever components, let's
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.080]   just oversee the components ourselves.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.080]   And who knows?
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.520]   Like maybe, you know, Menogolotti and the team that's working on this stuff designs the
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:41.320]   chipsets, but then they outsource the production of it to like a Foxconn or whomever else.
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:44.120]   You know, like there's a bunch of different ways this plays out.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.360]   I mean, that, yeah, spot on.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.280]   And they even talked about that at Google I/O, right?
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:58.000]   TensorFlow Lite is, not was, is their effort to bring that machine learning into the device
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   itself.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.440]   David Burk had said, you know, silicon on the device that's dedicated to this machine learning
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.600]   stuff going forward.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:11.160]   So if they're creating their SOC, I mean, right now everybody in Android is using, I mean,
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:16.120]   not everybody, but almost everybody's using Qualcomm chips in their, in their devices.
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:21.960]   And while that's great, because Qualcomm obviously is doing, you know, a great job creating their
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:25.040]   systems on a chip to power these smartphones.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.520]   It also has, there's a lot of feature parity.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:31.040]   Like everybody's kind of offering the same things because the chipset offers the same
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.040]   things.
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:37.400]   It brings in its own, its own, or alphabet, Google, whatever, brings in their own team
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.480]   to create this stuff on their own.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:43.320]   They can more tightly integrate that with their efforts, like TensorFlow Lite and really
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:47.080]   create something that differentiates the hardware that they're creating compared to
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.160]   the rest so that they can coexist.
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:53.000]   But we offer some, you know, Google's already shown that they're fine with offering things
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.800]   that other phones don't have, you know, for years.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:00.040]   That was the question is, Google doesn't want to compete with its competitors because it
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.040]   might scare them away.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.720]   You know, they'd just, they'd be too big and too dominant.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.520]   But now it's obvious, like Google thinks that it can coexist with its competitors and
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:13.320]   offer different things on its devices and, I don't know, swim in the same pool.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:21.200]   But, so there's that also, by the way, LG, another aspect to that is that the, there
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:27.400]   was a rumor that, that Google wanted to invest in LG's flexible OLED displays.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:31.200]   So maybe there's some sort of crossover there as well.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.840]   They all seem to be, yeah.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:33.840]   That would be wonderful.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.160]   I do like flexible displays.
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.200]   I mean, I doubt that means you'd get your phone and you could bend it.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.200]   But I think-
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.800]   I want a phone that I can roll up and put in my pocket like a newspaper.
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.600]   Someday Ron, someday.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.040]   Someday, I have it.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.640]   We're just not there yet.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.800]   I believe, Jason.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.920]   I believe in it.
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:54.160]   More than likely it'll be kind of the edging, you know, the rounded edges, which is what
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.920]   we see right now with Samsung devices.
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:01.840]   Which, by the way, allows for a, you know, less bezel in your device.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.800]   That's one way to kind of make that happen.
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.720]   And that's one way that they're pulling that off.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:13.400]   So, well, I feel like, oh man, that was a lot of rumor and one little one short-
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.040]   And the funny thing is, though, what I think is really interesting is that here we are
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:19.640]   in June and when is the Pixel announcement going to be?
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.960]   Like, we were betting last night.
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:25.600]   Like, I said September, Florence Island said October, right?
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.440]   But we're still three months out.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:30.760]   So these are the rumors we're getting at least three months or so out.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.240]   What is August going to be like?
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.240]   Oh boy.
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:39.280]   I mean, the last hardware announcement was the beginning of October, if I remember correctly.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.280]   Yeah.
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.360]   So if you were to follow the year.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.360]   And that was late.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.360]   That felt really late.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.920]   And it felt like that was, yeah.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.640]   It did feel a little late.
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:55.320]   And then just real quick here, Google has announced kind of end of life dates for the
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:59.160]   devices that you might have or that you probably have.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:03.320]   The Pixel and the Pixel XL are going to stop getting operating system updates on October
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.320]   2018.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.320]   So that's next October.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.320]   Yeah.
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:12.920]   I mean, those dates, like I have to imagine they'd have their successor around when these
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.040]   updates stop.
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:18.560]   So it's probably October at the latest that you'd have the new devices.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:21.520]   And then security updates October 2019.
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:26.000]   Basically Google has dedicated themselves on their devices to two years of OS updates.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.280]   For what I understand, for what I remember, three years of security updates.
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:35.880]   Quite as long as you get on the iOS side of things, but better than before where we just
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:36.880]   didn't know.
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:38.880]   Exactly.
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:44.720]   And then, yeah, 6P, 5X, they're going to end support September 2018.
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:48.920]   I think that's security support September of next year.
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:53.040]   And then the 6 and the 9 will stop getting security updates this October.
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:32:00.480]   So just in case you have those devices now, you know, did I miss anything in that block?
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.480]   I don't know.
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:05.200]   Is this getting you excited for the next the next wave of a Pixel devices?
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.840]   Well, I need to see more before I'm excited.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:12.200]   I don't think I'm an excitement level yet.
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.960]   You're already all in on the essential.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:16.360]   So I'm on the essential hype train.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.360]   That's for sure.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:23.680]   But also some of the Google released Android O developer preview three.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.680]   A couple of days ago.
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:31.320]   And so while that's still not like they say that was a big release because it has all
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:34.320]   the APIs now and apparently it squashed a bunch of bugs.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.720]   But because I'm not running it, I don't know if it's more stable.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:39.720]   So Jason, I'm curious once you install it, whether it'll make your Pixel more stable
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.400]   because I know you've been having stability issues.
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:48.040]   Yeah, so I updated to the Android O update at Google I/O basically when they announced
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:51.080]   that there was the official kind of move over to the automated system.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:54.440]   So I opted into that, took a couple of days for it to happen.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.320]   But I got it on eventually.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.360]   And then yeah, I was having a lot of weird bugs.
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:01.400]   Like I'd try and install apps from my computer.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.480]   Like, you know, how you can go to the Play Store on your desktop and say install this
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.400]   on my phone and it would appear there.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.400]   And it just wouldn't install.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.840]   And for whatever reason, I would restart everything.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:13.160]   I couldn't get half the apps I wanted to install on.
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.400]   I did get this update though.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:19.240]   The OTA came a couple of days ago and I updated and I haven't had any issues since.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:23.120]   But I've also kind of been not looking at my phone a whole lot.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.160]   So there's that too.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.280]   But so far so good.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:32.320]   I'm curious, Kevin, if you've had a chance to like look at the Android O feature set
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:37.080]   or play around with any of the developer preview or do you keep your device clean and pristine
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.480]   like most people do?
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.920]   I don't normally go for the developer previews unless I've got something I'm specifically
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:43.920]   developing.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.680]   And if I would, I would do it on this one.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:50.440]   I'd get another one to try that on, I think, because it's either one phone that's not fully
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.440]   over.
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.520]   I did so I did upgrade to Anna early.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:58.600]   But that was basically because the previous self update managed to brick my phone.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.320]   So I had to how to do that.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.120]   I encountered that too.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.120]   That's right.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:06.120]   The only way to like update it was to go to the beta.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.120]   That's right.
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.200]   Yeah, how that worked.
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.200]   But it worked.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.080]   Hey, I was happy that it existed because otherwise I thought my phone was dead in the
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.920]   water for good.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.280]   But yeah, so far so good.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.440]   I'm happy with with the change.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.720]   You know, it doesn't seem to be crashing or anything like that.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.280]   So there's that, I guess.
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:26.440]   But I mean, when I recommend it for like everybody, probably not.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:31.040]   There's probably a night bugs in there that that you don't want to jump into it unless
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.040]   you're cool.
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:37.080]   I would say I would say to wait until like like at least for if not really number five
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:40.920]   before you start thinking about the closer we get the September, that's when you want
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:41.920]   to do it.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:42.920]   If at all.
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:44.320]   Because it's a developer preview.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.320]   It's not a user preview.
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.480]   It's a developer preview.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:47.800]   Right, right.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.920]   Um, real quick, I guess, I guess what we can do.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.840]   We can round out a little bit of the Android stuff and then I have to take a break.
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:35:00.280]   But um, Google had just announced that they're highlighting, didn't they just do this?
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:05.400]   They're highlighting Android excellence, basically apps and games that are really, really
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:10.560]   good in their categories in a program called Android excellence.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:16.320]   So their collections curated by Google, uh, they're picking these based on, you know,
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:22.120]   apps and games that follow best practices, have great design, performance, optimizations,
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.120]   localization.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:24.120]   I don't know.
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:28.560]   How is this, how is this any different than the end of the year awards that came out six
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.560]   months ago?
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:30.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:31.560]   I don't know.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:32.560]   Maybe an ongoing thing.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:33.560]   I don't know.
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:34.560]   I'm sure there's good access to.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.160]   It's cool to mine in there for the arena though.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.560]   Yeah, that's for sure.
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.640]   And then you guys, I know you guys talked about this last night.
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.360]   I haven't had a chance to play around with it.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:46.480]   Gboard, which is the keyboard that I use on Android.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:49.560]   Cause I think it's, it's kind of like Google's default keyboard now, right?
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:50.560]   Is, is Gboard.
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.520]   It's really, it's really the go to, I don't know if it comes pre-installed.
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.240]   Does it come pre-installed on the pixel or not?
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.840]   But, uh, it should if it doesn't.
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:02.200]   Um, but no, this is the Gboard is interesting because it's also cross platform in that it's
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.760]   both Android and iOS, which I think is great.
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:10.320]   But the, the recent Gboard app, uh, added the ability to suggest phrases, which is something
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.440]   that Swifty had about a year ago or so.
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.480]   So as you're typing something, it's not only predicting the next word, but predicting the
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:18.960]   rest of the sentence based off commonly used phrases.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:23.320]   And then also the ability to draw an emoji and have it match the emoji and have that
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:24.320]   go in.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:28.160]   So if you feel the need to draw the poo emoji, uh, you can do that.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:31.320]   I don't really know the, the drawing emoji thing.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.320]   I don't know.
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.320]   I guess people want that.
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.920]   I, like just, just, just, just tap the emoji.
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:37.120]   Well, um, I understand it though.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:41.160]   I understand it because I'm in this weird, I'm old school, right?
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:46.560]   Like I've realized like, if I want to do a smiley face, I do the colon and the parentheses
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.720]   and then I realize I'm totally old school.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:53.920]   Um, you know, only only, yeah, just laying people do that.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.440]   You got to step into the emoji age.
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.960]   So then I go, this, then I'm like, okay, great.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.720]   I'll step into the emoji age.
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:02.240]   And then I spend 10 minutes trying to find this stupid face that actually represents
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.240]   my feeling.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:04.800]   I'm like, what am I doing wrong?
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:10.280]   Like no one takes this long to find like a face that represents their emotion or do
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.280]   they?
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:15.760]   So if you draw it, do, do you like, I need to express myself by drawing this emoji that
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:19.560]   I'm feeling like, if that's going to give me there quicker, then yes, I will.
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.560]   I'm down for that.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.560]   I'm fine with that.
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:26.120]   Well, what I'd understand is that why, like, so I'm a, I'm a, I'm a heavy WhatsApp user
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:31.040]   and WhatsApp actually converts the colon and parentheses to the smiley emoji.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.040]   Okay.
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.040]   Like there.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.040]   So like why Gboard can't do that.
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.120]   I don't know.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:40.240]   Um, but one other feature on Gboard that I do like is that they have enlarged arrow buttons
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:45.720]   to allow you to navigate text, which is fantastic because of someone with fat fingers and a
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:46.720]   small screen.
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:47.720]   Yeah.
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.600]   And if you're trying to do edits on like a document on your phone, it's a nightmare.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:54.160]   And so being able to go tap, tap, up, up, up, left, left, left, you know, like, that's
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.920]   sort of thing is a great addition as well too.
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.480]   So I love the Gboard is my, is my go to keyboard now.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:02.640]   So, uh, Kevin, where do you stand on emoji gate?
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:05.360]   Kevin, I still use Swift key.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:10.200]   And what Swift key has is if you type a word or suggest an emoji that belongs with the
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:14.800]   words so that, um, that, that is my, my short card for him.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:18.720]   So rather than typing, you know, shrug or whatever, rather than looking for the shrug
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:24.520]   image, I'll type shrug and just miss, shrug emoji or train or pool or whatever it is.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:27.040]   Usually in my case, I'm trying to find the poo emoji.
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:30.640]   You'd think it would like appear easier for me and know that I'm looking for the poo emoji
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:31.880]   because I use it so much.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.960]   That's like, that's like your go to emoji, man.
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.320]   I wish that it were.
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:39.720]   I just don't use emoji at all because I find it more way more inconvenient than it, than
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:40.920]   I feel like it should be.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:41.920]   Meanwhile, we have guests here.
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:46.760]   That's why the Swift key is good because it, right, you'll just be typing normally.
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:49.680]   Like I'll suggest you an emoji instead of the, along with the two words, it suggests you
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:50.680]   as well.
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.080]   Yeah, that's, that's the way to go about it.
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.080]   That's actually helpful.
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:58.200]   As I was describing the hours and hours it takes me to find a face that represents how
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:03.040]   I feel our guests here and the students were like, yeah, that's, that's what you do.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.040]   It takes that long.
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:05.360]   That's just the way it goes.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:09.800]   So apparently I need to just like, let go of it and realize it's taking a long time to
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:10.800]   get that face.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:14.680]   What I've done in this emoji field world now is that I just use nonsense emojis.
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:18.600]   Like I'll be texting somebody and I'll end it with the, with the smiley face of the cowboy
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:24.040]   hat or I'll end it with the, with, with the volcano or like, or the cactus.
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.040]   And everyone's like, what does that mean?
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:26.040]   I'm like, I don't know.
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.840]   You got to be careful on.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.840]   Exactly.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:31.360]   You might say something and you don't have no idea what you're saying in emoji.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.360]   All the better.
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.360]   All the better.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:35.760]   I just sort of a Google, Google, Google feature.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:38.760]   What you should do is, is you should be able to pull a face at the screen and give you
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.760]   the right emoji base to do a sprint.
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:41.760]   Wait a minute.
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:42.760]   Wait a minute.
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.360]   Something like this off a few months ago, right?
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.280]   Alo rolled off.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.680]   I think it's an alo.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:50.680]   It was a facial recognition.
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.880]   They made stickers based on your face.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:57.120]   So not necessarily emojis, but more stickers like, you know, the kind of, you know, the,
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:01.280]   the, the bitmoji type type thing that was, remember Jason, you did it and it looked kind
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.080]   of like you, but not totally.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.080]   Yeah.
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:08.120]   And I'm not going to go into my aloe because there's one's chats there and I just don't
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.120]   trust myself.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.080]   Not in this mind state.
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:13.000]   But yes, there is a way to do that.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.080]   And, and it made a bit moji thing.
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:18.920]   I thought there was a way to interpret your, your face into an emoji though.
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:23.280]   And if that doesn't exist, Google, you're, you're the ones to make this happen.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.360]   Do it.
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.360]   Get on that.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.000]   That's important stuff.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.640]   Way more important than like, you know, shaming people into getting solar panels on the roof,
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:35.840]   which we'll talk about here in a few minutes.
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:38.720]   Before we move on, let's thank the sponsor of today's episode.

[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.240]   All right.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:47.560]   Well, I teased it.
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:53.680]   So I guess it's by no means the top Google news, but Project Sunroof, which is basically
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:43:01.440]   Google's map project that can tell how much sunlight is hitting your roof to see.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:04.800]   You can use this to see if solar panels might actually be a good fit for your home.
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:07.000]   I would love to get solar panels on my home.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:13.880]   Actually maybe not even solar panels, solar tiles, the Tesla tiles, those things are hot.
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:16.160]   But anyways, this is literally hot.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.480]   Yeah, you probably don't want to walk up there.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:24.000]   But this is a way where you can essentially Google is using their artificial intelligence
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.120]   as they use for everything, their machine learning algorithms.
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:35.600]   To take a look at solar imagery, satellite imagery rather, and recognize solar panels
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:40.880]   and be able to tell you if your neighbors are converted to solar or not in the hopes
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:45.280]   that-- I don't know if it's the hope or not, but it's probably going to make you feel kind
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:48.640]   of bad that you aren't and then make you want to get solar converted.
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.280]   Didn't they do this last year?
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:52.080]   I was going to flashback it.
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:53.880]   So what changed?
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:59.600]   I think the change is the analysis, the AI analysis.
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.840]   Because I remember this too.
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.400]   They released this a few years ago.
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:10.160]   And I think then basically what it was was a way to determine how much sun actually hits
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:14.600]   your roof throughout a given day to determine whether it would be a good idea for you to
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:15.600]   get it.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:20.240]   And now what they're doing is they're training their AI to determine who's done it and who
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:23.840]   hasn't so that you feel guilty and you get solar on your roof.
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:27.040]   But how do you feel guilty if you're not checking it?
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.440]   Well, that's true.
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:30.240]   Who's actually checking it?
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:35.520]   Yeah, if I'm not aware of it, then how would I be feel shamed?
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:39.880]   I think this is cool because maybe you see your neighbor and you're like, "You've done
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:40.880]   it."
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:41.880]   And you're like, "Oh, cool.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:45.040]   If my whole block does it, then we can save this X amount and you want to talk your neighbors
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:46.280]   into it or whatever."
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:49.600]   But this just looks like an evolution of what they did last year.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.360]   That's pretty much what it is.
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.360]   It's this growing trend.
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:55.840]   Can I detect those Tesla roofs?
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:56.840]   I know.
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:57.840]   They look like ordinary roofs.
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.800]   Oh, man, those things are hot.
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.960]   I want those so bad.
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:05.400]   But we don't need a new roof at this point on our house.
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.880]   It's like, I don't know if I could justify that.
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:09.600]   I'd have to go with the solar panels.
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:14.440]   Basically Tesla says, "If you already need a new roof, this is the way to go.
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:20.520]   Cost-effectiveness, you might as well replace it with this and over time it'll pay for itself."
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:24.080]   If you don't need a new roof, you might as well stick with panels.
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:26.560]   But man, they look nice with those solar tiles.
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:30.440]   Hey, listen, just because that's the conventional wisdom, Jason, doesn't mean you have to stick
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:31.440]   to it.
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.640]   If you want those tiles, I want you to have the tiles.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:35.440]   Yep, they're expensive.
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:37.000]   Yeah, I know.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.440]   Some day, maybe some day.
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.920]   Maybe I'll win the lottery, although I don't play the lottery.
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:41.920]   Who knows?
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:46.240]   Anyways, that was probably not the top Google story.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.240]   Let's see.
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:48.240]   What do we have any?
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:50.120]   There aren't really a whole lot of top Google stories, to be honest.
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.920]   I'll just start up here at the top.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:46:00.360]   Google's, the little self-driving cars, the totally characteristic, I think they had some
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:05.360]   promo videos, the little two-seaters, people get in them, they look like these little futuristic
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.360]   pods.
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:11.720]   They're autonomous vehicles and they were basically Google's way of showing what the
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:14.600]   autonomous driving future may look like.
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:17.080]   They began testing on roads back in 2014.
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:18.440]   Apparently, those are going away.
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:19.440]   Yeah, those little guys.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:20.440]   Aww.
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:21.440]   The firefly.
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:23.680]   Those are basically goof-con, some day.
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.680]   Yeah, more than anything is probably what it doesn't.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:30.760]   They only went like 25, 30 miles an hour, right?
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:32.920]   Top speed, 25 miles per hour.
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:37.080]   You not go very fast, but there is a stop and go button inside.
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:39.880]   I appreciate it for its simplicity.
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:48.520]   Apparently, they logged in 3 million miles in three years, and Google/alphabet has decided
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:53.000]   it's probably best to just focus all of its efforts on the thing most people have heard
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:00.120]   of, which is Waymo, which is taking the roads by storm at this point, or about two.
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.880]   And the courtrooms.
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:02.880]   That too.
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:08.720]   Yeah, there's some stuff going down with Waymo and the courtrooms in Uber.
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:09.720]   Yeah.
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:13.840]   And a whole lot more about Uber, but we don't need to talk about that.
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:19.680]   Google Drive, apparently, is, I think this is a great idea, although I wonder how expensive
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:20.800]   it would get over time.
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:26.320]   But Google is going to release a new app called Backup and Sync.
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.920]   They're going to release it on June 28th.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:36.200]   And basically what it's going to be designed for is pointing it to any folder, or sorry,
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:42.280]   folder, not file, folder on your drive or number of folders and have continuous sync backup
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.920]   to the cloud.
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:47.960]   When I read this, I was like, man, I just assumed that they already did that, but I guess they
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:48.960]   don't.
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.400]   I think they did that in photo upload, but not in just general file upload.
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:58.200]   Yeah, no, I don't think they've ever done the entire thing, like a true Dropbox style,
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:01.200]   kind of backup kind of situation.
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.200]   But hey, man, I've been--
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:03.440]   We've done them with photos, surely.
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:05.240]   Yes, photos for sure.
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:06.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:08.240]   And then photos.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:09.240]   You're going to go to--
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:10.240]   Oh, you're going to--
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.240]   I was meant to be--
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.240]   At least I've had that before here.
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:14.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:15.240]   So I'm just very confused.
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:16.240]   OK.
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:20.040]   So they say that they're replacing the Google Drive app and the Google Photos Backup app
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:22.160]   on desktop with this.
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:26.400]   So it's probably going to do what it's done before, also the photos backup.
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.200]   Oh, I see.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.200]   OK.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:34.800]   Because I mean, I've had the opposite problem, which is that if I install Google Drive,
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:38.040]   then my hard drive fills up because my Google Drive has got more stuff on it than my computers
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.040]   have.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.040]   So--
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:41.040]   Yeah, that's a problem.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:45.040]   Because I've got a terabyte with the Chrome--
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:47.160]   The Chrome Pixel years ago.
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:48.480]   So just everything in it.
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:52.520]   And then I bought a new Mac and it didn't have enough storage to sync to it.
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:55.080]   So you still have a terabyte from when you bought the Pixel?
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:56.080]   When you got the Pixel?
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.360]   No, it expired at Google I/O last year.
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:59.920]   So now I'm paying them for it.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:00.920]   Oh, OK.
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:03.880]   I was like, wow, you got off easy if you still have that.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:04.880]   That's awesome.
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:05.880]   That was the irony.
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:07.360]   It was like it was Google I/O week.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:13.840]   And suddenly all my Google things were saying, you are out of this space by a factor of 10.
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:14.840]   You need to hear--
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:15.840]   I'm actually here.
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:16.840]   90% of your stuff.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:18.480]   And it's like it's I/O week Google.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:19.480]   Oh, right.
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:20.480]   Yes, my three year freebie just expired.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.560]   Now I'm going to start paying you that.
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:24.320]   But isn't that how they get you right?
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:26.680]   There's actually totally related news to this.
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:31.520]   Amazon got rid of their unlimited file storage.
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:36.320]   They had a few years ago rolled out their unlimited cloud storage plan.
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.440]   They're ending that.
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:42.960]   If you have an existing unlimited storage plan, you won't lose it until the renewal.
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:46.720]   But then at that point you'll be downgraded essentially to a one terabyte plan and you'll
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:54.320]   have to pay extra $59.99 per extra terabyte or $11.99 per 100 gigs per month.
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:58.320]   And then if you don't purchase any extra data after like six months, all that data just
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:59.720]   disappears.
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:05.760]   But it's an interesting strategy that we're seeing where I think there is a certain population
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:09.520]   of people that saw unlimited and thought unlimited forever.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:11.920]   But of course, forever never lasts forever.
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:13.320]   Ever does not mean unlimited.
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:14.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:17.800]   Forever is not forever when it's talking when you're talking about a limited nor is unlimited
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:21.320]   actually unlimited when you're talking about unlimited.
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:24.520]   But anyways, so it's a great way to get you in the door.
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:25.520]   But then what are you going to do?
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:26.680]   All your data is up there.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:30.920]   Now you have to decide is it worth it for you to pay or do you just kiss a goodbye?
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:31.920]   You chose to pay.
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:34.280]   It was important enough for you to keep in the cloud.
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:38.160]   Well, it was either that will spend a week deleting 90% of my stuff.
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:39.160]   Exactly.
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:43.320]   Or about that to download to local drives.
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:44.840]   But you to work.
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:49.040]   But I've already delegated photos and music to Google.
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:54.400]   I mean, those two, they don't have a limit on you just let you back stuff up.
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:58.400]   So it's like, okay, yeah, all my photos, sure, all my music from, you know, that I've
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:01.360]   got down in lots of my machines, simple that up to Google, that's fine.
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:03.080]   Then my phone doesn't have to have it on.
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:05.520]   And I trust them to back it up because they're Google.
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:09.280]   They don't actually delete things unless something terrible happens.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:11.480]   They're deleting things if you don't delete things.
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:17.320]   So by default, Google has six copies of everything in more than one data center and more than
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:18.320]   one continent.
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:20.680]   So it's quite hard to do stuff that you backed up to Google.
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:24.240]   As long as you don't lose access to your Google account, everything's okay.
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:28.600]   As long as you don't enable.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:33.600]   It's all wine and roses until you do something stupid.
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:34.600]   It's a long time.
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:35.600]   You'll go to account.
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:36.600]   You'll get locked out of your Google account.
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:37.600]   How would that happen?
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:38.600]   That would never happen.
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:39.600]   It would never happen.
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:41.600]   Except that it did on this very show.
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:45.600]   It was two factor authentication plus Google voice.
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:46.600]   Yes.
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:49.600]   It was a toxic combination, deadly combination.
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:51.600]   Okay.
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:52.600]   So you brought up Google photos.
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:55.520]   This is not in the dark and it's totally not related to much other than Google photos.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:57.600]   But this is something I was struggling with yesterday.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:06.320]   So Google I/O, we were given one of the few gifts that attendees were given were was a
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:10.600]   20 page hardcover photo book from Google Photos or whatever.
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:11.600]   They're like a free photo book.
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:12.600]   You choose the photos.
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:14.960]   We'll give you a free photo book.
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:18.000]   And so I went into my photos and my wife and I were like, you know, we never actually
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.560]   got our wedding photos in a book.
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:22.360]   So this is a perfect opportunity to do that.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:23.360]   Let's do that.
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:24.640]   So I go into Google Photos.
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:27.200]   I mean, I've got like, we've got like a thousand photos.
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:30.760]   We had a really great photographer that we hired.
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:33.960]   It was one of the things that we spent the most money on was the photographer because
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:36.160]   we're like, you know, this is the thing you're going to remember forever.
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:38.320]   So you might as well have it look nice.
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:44.080]   And it turns out that all of my photos, all of our photos from their wedding are duplicated
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:46.560]   and the duplicates are sideways.
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:51.720]   So there's some of them, you know, half of them are the right orientation.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:54.120]   Half of them are sideways, but the same.
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:57.800]   Google didn't do so much with artificial intelligence.
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:03.160]   Is it difficult to like detect that a photo is sideways and automatically swap it up?
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:05.880]   And if not, they have one of those.
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:08.480]   I've definitely seen that in the assistant tab.
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:10.000]   It says you're these photos are sideways.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   Should I rotate them for you?
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   But it does that.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   But it does that automatically.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   How do I do that?
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   How do I say go back into my library?
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   I'm going to go in front of you.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   That's a good question.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   I'm going to show you.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   Maybe I can.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   Well, you can ask them to do that.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   That's true.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   Maybe I maybe I can't.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   Have you.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   I mean, look at the stop version of Google Photos.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.080]   Was it opposed to the app?
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:29.080]   Was that run?
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:32.120]   Have you looked at the desktop version of Google Photos as opposed to the app?
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:34.000]   Yeah, I looked at both.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.480]   But, um, okay.
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:38.640]   And, you know, there's like a keyboard shortcut for rotating.
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:39.640]   So that helps.
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:40.640]   It's shift R.
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:43.440]   If you're looking at a single photo, shift R, that'll rotate it so you don't have to
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:44.440]   find the button.
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:51.120]   But I just wanted to be like, look at all of these and rotate all of these.
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:54.160]   And someone in chat posted a thing from the app.
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:57.920]   Is this a way that you can manually do it?
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:58.920]   Like fire?
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:02.760]   I've definitely seen one of the, no, I've definitely seen an assistant thing that said
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:07.560]   that found, because I had a bunch of old ones from like, you know, 15 years ago that were
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:08.560]   all the wrong around.
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:10.040]   And it said, these will rotate the wrong way.
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:11.040]   Do you want to fix that?
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.040]   And I said, yes, and they were rotated.
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:15.400]   But the problem with the assistant is you can't tell it to do things.
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:17.800]   It is just like, you know, like, gripping it.
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:21.080]   If I can't detect it, it's not going to do it.
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:25.600]   And there must be something in those photos that is making it think it's not sideways,
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:28.880]   whether it could be the orientation of a face or something like that.
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:32.760]   You know, like it's, you know, machine learning is great, but you can still fool it at some
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:33.760]   point.
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:35.040]   Oh man, there's, there's no denying.
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:37.720]   Like the majority of these things are head to toe.
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:39.200]   We're just standing side.
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:40.200]   Obviously.
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:41.640]   So maybe it, maybe it thinks we're all laying down.
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:42.640]   I don't know.
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:44.280]   Anyways, totally random.
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:48.520]   It looks like, I mean, maybe I can go in here because I know sometimes you can go into
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:50.600]   the photos app and you can select a bunch of photos.
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:54.200]   Well, you do it with photo books, you select a bunch of photos and then you go in the menu
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:55:00.000]   and you hit, you know, photo book, maybe there's something in there to trigger an auto rotate
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.480]   and analysis or something.
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:06.800]   But I didn't see it yesterday and I tried on desktop and mobile because I have, I have
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:13.720]   gotten received that assistant card before for rotating photos, but yeah, obviously didn't
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:16.160]   get to these.
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:20.080]   So anyways, a little bit of a tangent.
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:23.920]   Thank you for coming along with me on that journey.
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:25.880]   This was interesting.
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:30.320]   Alphabet finally found a buyer for Boston Dynamics.
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:34.320]   I think they've been trying to unload their robots for about a year now.
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:40.920]   And now SoftBank is the proud owner of a whole bunch of robots.
[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:46.200]   Also not only Boston Dynamics, but Shaft, which was also an alphabet property that you
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:47.840]   probably heard a lot less about.
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:49.880]   They were also creating robots.
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:55.640]   They had released a bipedal robot last year, or at least a video of one last year that
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:58.000]   was designed to help carry heavy loads.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.840]   So kind of doing some similar stuff to what Boston Dynamics was, but maybe a little bit
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:04.600]   smaller, more compact.
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:07.200]   I'm not really quite sure.
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:11.080]   I think the first thing I thought of when I read this is that there's no chance I'm
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:14.200]   ever going to run into a Boston Dynamics robot at Google I/O.
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:16.480]   It's just not going to happen now.
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:18.160]   I'm not going to run that makes me sad.
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:23.400]   Well, I'm glad because the bipedal robots freak me out.
[00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:28.080]   Or they freak me out almost as much as the quadpedal robots, like the dog robots.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:30.360]   Those freak me out the most.
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:31.480]   But I'm more interested in it.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:36.920]   It just seems like every time something interesting is happening, it seems SoftBank is involved.
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:38.840]   SoftBank is really involved.
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:40.360]   SoftBank is really involved.
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:44.440]   They're really, there's all this stuff about how they're restructuring this $93 billion tech
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:51.440]   fund and doing, they invested in Sprint and they pulled the investment from Essential.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:56.080]   It just seems that SoftBank keeps coming up in these interesting tech stories.
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:59.760]   I'm curious, what are they going to do with Boston Dynamics and Shaft?
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:01.560]   That's really interesting.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:02.560]   So, kudos.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:09.280]   Masayoshi San, chairman and CEO of SoftBank Group Corp, said in a statement, "Smart Robotics
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:13.920]   are going to be a key driver of the next stage of the information revolution."
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:16.800]   I don't know what that means.
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:22.480]   Does that mean that these robots are going to be delivering my information on a platter?
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:23.480]   What that means.
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:29.920]   I mean, there's no doubt robotics are a future or a part of our future.
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:38.640]   Do you have any thoughts, any theories on why a company like SoftBank might want robots,
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:41.440]   who knows?
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:45.920]   Robots have been a cool thing in Japan for years.
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:49.760]   It makes sense for a Japanese company to pick it up.
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:56.200]   I know it's one of those bizarre things.
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:59.280]   Those robots seem really cool, but also really weird and off-putting.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:01.200]   They're too uncanny for me.
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:02.920]   Yes, agreed.
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:03.920]   That's great.
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:04.920]   They're awesome.
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:09.440]   That's why they're awesome and scary all at the same time.
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:13.440]   If you look at sort of Azimuth and Ibo and the Japanese-style ones, they put a lot of
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:15.080]   effort into making them cute and friendly.
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:16.080]   That's true.
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:18.480]   Whereas the Boston-era ones, they were just scary.
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:22.600]   They just look like evil robot dogs rather than cuddly robot dogs.
[00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:26.960]   Yes, they definitely had a military edge to them.
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:30.120]   You could definitely see those out on a battlefield somewhere.
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:31.640]   Oh, no.
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:33.120]   I just see the Star Wars prequels.
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:34.120]   I don't want to see that.
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:36.120]   It's the future, Ron.
[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:37.120]   It's the future.
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:42.920]   Well, speaking of Toyota, Osmo is Toyota, right?
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:43.920]   Is it Osmo?
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:44.920]   I think is what it's called.
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:51.920]   Toyota had apparently been in the running according to reports as well on buying Boston
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:52.920]   Dynamics.
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:55.200]   They lost out to SoftBank.
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:57.920]   So Osmo is just going to have to be cute on his own.
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:59.880]   Osmo is Honda, by the way.
[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:00.880]   Oh, is that Honda?
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:01.880]   Sorry, I got it.
[00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:02.880]   It was Honda.
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:05.120]   The world's most advanced humanoid robot.
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:11.320]   It was pretty cool, but not nearly as frightening as Big Dog.
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:17.200]   I really hope the SoftBank keeps up the tradition and allows Boston Dynamics to continue to
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:22.240]   release the videos because pretty much it's like Christmas anytime Boston Dynamics releases
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:24.120]   a new video of their robots.
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:29.000]   Every time I open it and I watch it and I mouth a gape and I'm like, this is actually
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.080]   happening.
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:36.280]   I once thought that this would just be science fiction, but no, here it is invading nightmares.
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:37.640]   I don't know how that's Christmas.
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:40.000]   For me, that's like the stuff of nightmares.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:44.520]   Every time I see one of those new Boston Dynamics videos of the robot walking awkwardly and
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:47.480]   like not falling down and oh, it's creepy.
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:50.080]   Or being kicked and it doesn't fall down and it comes out.
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:51.080]   Yep, that one.
[00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:52.080]   Yep.
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:53.720]   That one's a little scary.
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:59.240]   If you like your material as part of your design, then you might like the fact that more
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:05.360]   material design is coming to Chrome OS, Canary Channel apparently is getting a new material
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:15.000]   notification design, more streamlined, rounded corners, cleaner icons, condensed actions.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   And that's not all there.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.160]   It's not like small, too gray and illegible like they've done on Android.
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:21.160]   Oh, really?
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:25.600]   I want high contrast, larger type back in my notifications, please.
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:31.400]   That's true, they're getting so elegant that you need a pair of bifocals to even read them.
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:32.400]   Yes.
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.400]   Because they're condensed.
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:36.000]   Why is the main tips on these things gray?
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.160]   There's no excuse for that.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:44.800]   It doesn't pop, but it looks nice.
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.120]   If you want to get in on that action, you can.
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:48.600]   You just have to enable a flag.
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.120]   Just do a search for it.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:53.600]   Get on Canary, of course, and you can enable a flag.
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.760]   That's all there is to that.
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:00.760]   I know you guys talked a little bit about local guides last night on all about Android, something
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:05.600]   that I still only sort of really understand this local guides thing with maps.
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:10.600]   And I didn't even realize that actually Florence Iann was like a level three local guide.
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:11.600]   Oh, wow.
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:12.600]   She's participating in this.
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.600]   It's just crazy.
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:19.920]   But yeah, no, but basically it's just kind of, you know, Google's kind of crowdsourced
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:26.680]   information about locations within maps and allows people to add information and answer
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:28.280]   questions and things like that.
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:31.000]   I do the things in Google mastery to answer questions about places, but I don't know
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   what level I am.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.400]   I don't know if that's even tied to local guides.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:38.080]   I know local guides has been around for a while, but it's clearly a program that's working
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:41.800]   well for them because here they're other adding five more levels that brings it to a total
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:47.400]   level of 10 in hopes to kind of keep everybody incentivized, keep using it, keep the gamification
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.720]   going.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.720]   And they give rewards.
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:53.600]   You get free months of Google Play music and discounted rentals and stuff like that.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:57.520]   So it's pretty neat, but it's not something I have any like I barely have time to work
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.600]   on my projects, much as Google's projects.
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:00.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:03.440]   A couple of free months of Google Play music.
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:06.240]   Don't they just offer that every other month anyways?
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.240]   Yeah.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:08.240]   Well, I see.
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.520]   Yeah, it's kind of weird because it keeps nagging me to do that.
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:11.520]   It's like, okay, you're this place.
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:12.520]   Do you want to tell me about it?
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.520]   No, I don't want to tell you about it.
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:19.400]   But well, the way I look at it is that I participate in that because the way I see
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:21.400]   it is like this is information I would want to know.
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:24.880]   Like when I because I go to Google Maps all the time and look up like what are the dollar
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:28.400]   signs are when the when is this place busy, like all that sort of stuff.
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.760]   And so I figure you got to pay it forward a little.
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.360]   I got to give some information as well too.
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:34.360]   So it says like, does this place take credit cards?
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.360]   And I say I don't know.
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.360]   And then I move on.
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:37.360]   So.
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.360]   Hey, it's on with uncertainty.
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:40.360]   Sure.
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:44.000]   I've already done that with four squares.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.720]   It feels like I'm having to do it twice.
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:50.360]   It's like, can you just like talk to Dennis and get some data from him?
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:51.360]   Yeah, I know.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.360]   I know.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:53.360]   I completely agree.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:54.360]   I get that notification.
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:57.600]   We're all arrived somewhere and then I look, I get a buzz and look down on my phone and
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:58.600]   there it is.
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:02.760]   Like it knows that I arrived there as one of those moments where I'm like, but I mean,
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:05.720]   but you know, props for it actually getting it right.
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:10.440]   I just I never apparently afford myself the time to actually do very much with it unless
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:15.400]   it's a really quick like yes, no, but to like type out a review is just I never give myself
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:16.760]   the time to do that.
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:19.840]   It's important to note though that those questions we're talking about are a function
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:22.080]   of Google Maps in terms of crowdsourcing information.
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.960]   Those are not local guides.
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:29.040]   I just went to maps.google.com/localguides and you actually have to actually join and tell
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:32.800]   it what city you're in and agree, you know, kind of agree to their terms and all stuff
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:33.800]   like that.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:34.800]   You got to choose to join.
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:38.160]   And once you do that, then you can submit information about places and locations and
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.160]   things like that.
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:43.000]   And it's kind of like it's basically like Google's Yelp baked into Google Maps.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   Got it.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.200]   But but it gives you that really kind of in-depth information and that's how they do the rewards
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:49.280]   and all things like that.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.280]   I think it's cool.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:51.280]   It's interesting.
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:52.280]   And I'm glad that they're doing it.
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:55.040]   I just don't know why like it's the kind of thing like, you know, Jason, you and I are
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:58.400]   so close to all the stuff and I just learned that right now in the past two minutes, you
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.560]   know, like it's not saying that's like widely popularized.
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:03.280]   They don't bubble it up within the Google Maps app that much, which I think that's what
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.280]   they would do.
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:06.480]   So yeah, I mean, they do.
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:07.480]   It's pretty.
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.480]   I see it all the time.
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:09.480]   Do you not get that?
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:10.480]   Oh, you know, I get it.
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.480]   I don't know.
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:14.640]   I know that these people are local guys and what levels they are and things like that.
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.640]   Oh, I see.
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:16.640]   Yeah.
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:17.640]   Yeah.
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:18.640]   Yeah.
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:19.640]   I got you.
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:20.640]   Yeah.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:21.640]   Like how you would even know to jump in there.
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:25.840]   But I guess man, is this the thing I feel like at some point I heard about it where if
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:29.920]   you are already contributing a lot, if you're just kind of that person that like to make
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:34.680]   you a lot, then you get contacted and it's like you can be part of the local guides.
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:37.320]   And that's when you get in on kind of these bonuses.
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:42.360]   And for what I understand, like it was five stages before and the problem is like their
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:46.000]   best users would get to the fifth stage, the fifth level or whatever.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.840]   They'd level up and that's about as high as you could get.
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:52.000]   And it's like, okay, well, what is my incentive to continue contributing?
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.040]   Now they've added five more levels that you can continue to get more as you contribute
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:58.080]   more.
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:04.880]   And that gives other users more information to pull from, I suppose.
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:13.760]   In our constant march towards an AI ruled future, the New York Times apparently has enlisted
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:19.120]   alphabet AI to help it moderate its comments.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:24.480]   Hey, more power to the AI that can moderate comments because I have to imagine that's
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.880]   not an easy task.
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:29.000]   But it's actually really interesting.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:36.760]   Only 10% of New York Times articles allow for comments at least prior to this because
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:42.600]   the task of moderating all of those comments with the limited staff that they have dedicated
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:45.520]   to it, I mean, it just takes too much time.
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:49.080]   So they could only allow comments for 10% of their articles.
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:55.400]   Alphabet steps in with their Jigsaw division, they created a tool called Perspective that
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:06:00.240]   is allowing the New York Times to expand the number of articles that they're allowing
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:01.520]   comments on.
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:05.160]   They plan to open up commenting on 80% of the articles.
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:09.160]   And when you consider somewhere around 200 articles per day being posted, that's quite
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:11.080]   a lot of moderation.
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:15.640]   New York Times articles get a lot of comments when you go to one that has comments activated.
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:22.320]   So the AI algorithm essentially is scanning for known things that would trigger a flag
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:26.800]   and then it can kind of pass things off as need be to human moderators to make the calls
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.800]   or whatever.
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:34.360]   But it's just trimming the easy stuff, letting most of it pass if it passes and if not kind
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:37.600]   of passing the questionable stuff off to humans.
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:40.720]   So AI taken one for the team.
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:45.280]   In this case, if someone's going to read the comments, it might as well be a robot.
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:46.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:52.280]   Well, I like the comment was the tool sometimes proven perfect, missing some of the comments
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:53.280]   and modern slurs.
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:56.480]   That's the idea that we've got.
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:59.760]   Continuity reinventing slurs on other people to get past the robots.
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:00.760]   Yes.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.640]   There's one thing we know about the Internet.
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:05.400]   Can you be more creative in your abuse, please?
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:06.400]   Right.
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:09.640]   Come on, but something new and let's all jump on that bandwagon before the robot catches
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:10.640]   us.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:14.440]   But this is, I mean, it's like the Twitter thing now where Twitter will censor certain
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:18.680]   words unless you're verified, but won't censor certain other words.
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:22.560]   So somebody can be very rude to you and then you get crossed back and then you're blocked
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:23.760]   for 12 hours.
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:24.760]   Right.
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:25.760]   Yep.
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:31.200]   And sometimes that works effectively and sometimes it goes rogue.
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:37.600]   So I guess you never really know what you're going to get when the robots take over.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:38.600]   Let's see here.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:40.920]   I think, let's see.
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:46.600]   I know that there's more, but it's probably not in the Google section here.
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:48.360]   We talked about the Amazon.
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:49.360]   What am I missing?
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:50.360]   Anything jump out?
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:56.560]   Well, I guess Facebook has some interesting stuff along these lines and actually very,
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:57.840]   very timely right now.
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:04.760]   There's obviously some pretty crazy stuff happening in London with the high rise that
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:11.360]   was on fire and it's just really devastating news.
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:16.320]   Facebook has its safety check feature that it's implemented a while back.
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:22.760]   It's basically all around kind of alerting other Facebook users whether someone is okay
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:23.760]   or not.
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:27.960]   They're basically pushing out a number of new features to this.
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:32.000]   One of them ties into fundraising.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:38.720]   So essentially, essentially, I guess Facebook already kind of has a fundraising program
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.080]   integrated into its service.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:42.560]   So this is kind of tying it into safety check.
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:48.880]   So if safety check is activated for someone, this would allow someone to essentially kick
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:55.200]   off a nonprofit or a personal fundraising effort that might help around a scenario like
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:56.200]   this.
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:09:03.800]   Thankfully, all of those efforts are vetted by Facebook's humans essentially prior to that
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:04.960]   actually happening.
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:13.280]   But yeah, I mean, that's got to be a good thing in the case of a tragedy or a disaster of
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:14.280]   some sort.
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:18.000]   We're seeing safety check happen more and more.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.600]   TechCrunch hadn't had an article that's really timely about kind of today's news or yesterday's
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:24.600]   news.
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:27.880]   Wondering if safety check does more harm than good.
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:31.120]   I think it's kind of an interesting question because I hadn't really considered it.
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:36.760]   I figured it's a network that has contact with a whole lot of people.
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:40.600]   So it would make sense that they would know whether someone might be in harm's way or
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:47.960]   not would be there to alert their loved ones or their friends whether they're okay or not.
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.480]   That seems like a great thing.
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:53.920]   The article in TechCrunch is kind of asking the question, like does it cause undue panic
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:59.560]   and undue worry depending on how wide of a net it casts based on who is targeting for
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:01.560]   safety check or not.
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:05.080]   I don't know if either of you had a chance to take a look at this because it's a little
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:07.680]   bit of a dense way, but it's an interesting question.
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:13.480]   Well, I do recognize the problem because we had that with both the terrorist attack in
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:18.400]   London and this fire thing where basically is asking a large report in the population
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:21.320]   of London whether they're involved in this.
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:25.760]   And those were both scary things, but the number of people involved in each was a few
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:33.320]   hundred at most, but it's asking five million people to check in and give safety check responses,
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.920]   which is a bit bizarre.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:42.200]   >> Well, yeah, that's the challenge of a densely populated area like a major city like London
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:46.560]   where it's a combination of where the app picking up where you are from your location
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:49.200]   as well as where you tell it you are.
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:54.480]   So, and then the times I've seen the safety check in action have been like very loud the
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:58.360]   tornadoes in the Midwest and things like that where people kind of mark themselves as okay.
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:01.920]   Those are kind of cast a wider net and it's more you could, there's more wondering if
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:06.040]   somebody in Kansas is going to get hit by this tornado or not, then this localized terrorist
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:10.200]   attack that happened on it within a couple of blocks radius in London.
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:13.600]   I don't know, I think for, after you, Jeff?
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:17.600]   >> So, I mean, it is tricky because yeah, you know, if it happens somewhere in central
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:24.200]   London, the terrorist attack of Tower Bridge and Borough Market, that is an area that I've
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:25.200]   been to lots of times.
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:28.120]   Lots of people have been to my sons that work near there.
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:31.360]   So there's some reason that they could have been in the neighborhood.
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:38.120]   But the idea that I was still seeing people marking themselves safe two days later and
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.320]   things which was kind of weird.
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:44.440]   So, it felt like they've got the focus wrong.
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:50.360]   And the other half is when the disaster does happen, then everyone who knows you will check
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:51.360]   in anyway.
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:56.880]   We were living in California whenever there was a mudslider or a fire, I would say, "Are
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:57.880]   you okay?"
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.920]   Yeah, that's 200 miles away that way.
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:05.240]   So there is that sort of, it's behaving more like your sort of geographically confused
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:08.360]   relatives than Facebook.
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:13.800]   Facebook is tracking where you are all the time if you're running the Apple Messenger.
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:19.360]   So it could do a much more focused job of saying, "Okay, this person was very close
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:24.040]   to that neighborhood or was supposed to be at some point in the last two days."
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:26.200]   And do a better job than it does.
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:32.240]   What I've seen to do is prompt anyone within a mile radius or two mile radius, which in
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:35.080]   London is a million people literally.
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:36.080]   Right.
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:42.440]   Yeah, I mean, one of the examples from this article was that it's 120 flats in this London
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.600]   high rise that were on fire.
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:47.880]   Well as far away as eight miles were being prompted to check in.
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:52.520]   And what kind of a signal does that send to the people on the other end that see this
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:58.200]   check in where they might not have been worried or concerned?
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:02.600]   Now suddenly they feel like there's need to be worry or concern and it just kind of
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:08.880]   potentially spreads this kind of feeling of panic where maybe it didn't need to be.
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:09.880]   Right.
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:13.160]   At the same time, I'm conflicted because I'm like, "Yeah, but it's nice to use data that
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:19.040]   you have information that you have to attempt to do some greater good.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:24.160]   Maybe it's just not being used as efficiently or as effectively as it should be for this
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.160]   tool."
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:26.160]   Yeah.
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:32.280]   Well, I think the expansion of safety check in terms of with fundraising is interesting
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:38.020]   because I know that fundraising, I saw an article recently like something crazy about
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:44.980]   GoFundMe, how the majority of 80% of GoFundMe, oh no, more than half of GoFundMe's money
[01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:48.260]   that's raised through crowdfunding goes towards medical expenses.
[01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:49.260]   Right.
[01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:54.420]   And so this idea of crowdfunding in need and around disasters and around when things
[01:13:54.420 --> 01:14:00.180]   happen and things like that, that's clearly Facebook is doing that in order to help.
[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:03.860]   But also there's a business there.
[01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:05.460]   So I think that's interesting as well too.
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:10.620]   I think what other functionality they can build on around safety check as flawed as it might
[01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:11.620]   be.
[01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:12.620]   Yeah.
[01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:13.620]   Yeah.
[01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:16.780]   I hadn't heard that news about GoFundMe.
[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:21.340]   Medical carriers make up $930 million to the $2 billion raised on GoFundMe.
[01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:22.340]   Yep.
[01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:23.340]   Isn't that crazy?
[01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:24.340]   Wow.
[01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:26.380]   It is actually, I think that's crazy.
[01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:30.980]   That says more about healthcare than about safety check.
[01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:31.980]   So.
[01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:34.340]   Well, the power of crowdfunding.
[01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:39.940]   I mean, you know, which is, and that ties exactly right into what Facebook had announced
[01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:44.820]   with their changes or with their updates to safety check, which is in a time of need.
[01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:49.260]   Sometimes, you know, personal fundraising is necessary, let's say.
[01:14:49.260 --> 01:14:51.940]   And so they're, they're including that into here.
[01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:52.940]   It was, it was in it.
[01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:54.980]   The TechCrunch article was definitely an interesting read.
[01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:56.780]   I just hadn't thought of it that way before.
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:59.460]   I've been like, well, this is obviously a good thing, right?
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:01.700]   Like, tell people whether you're safe or not.
[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:07.780]   And if it's used, and if it's used too widely, it can almost work in the opposite direction.
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:14.380]   So apparently they have some work to do there to kind of tighten it up a little bit.
[01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:16.580]   And then let's see here.
[01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:19.380]   What other crazy things is Facebook doing?
[01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:22.860]   I mean, while I wouldn't know, I haven't been on Facebook since December.
[01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:25.780]   Just throw that out there.
[01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:27.660]   Facebook wants you to type with your brain.
[01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:29.540]   This isn't weird at all.
[01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:36.060]   They have first announced this at F8 in April that neuroscientists and engineers apparently
[01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:40.100]   are a little doubtful that Facebook could pull this off, but Facebook is investing millions
[01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:48.420]   of dollars in research anyways into the idea that we could someday share our thoughts to
[01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:49.980]   Facebook, I'm guessing.
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:54.300]   It's part of the greater effort within Building 8, which is the incubator for moonshots at
[01:15:54.300 --> 01:16:01.380]   Facebook that if you remember Regina Duggan, once A-Tap at Google has shifted over to,
[01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:08.820]   this is one of her, I'm assuming, many projects that they're working on moonshots to get us
[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:12.620]   wearing a headband and transferring our thoughts into Facebook.
[01:16:12.620 --> 01:16:19.820]   That doesn't have any potential scary consequences whatsoever that I could possibly think of.
[01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:21.220]   Wasn't this an idea?
[01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:27.340]   Wasn't this a moonshot pitch in Silicon Valley when Big Head was working at a...
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:31.940]   It was like, yeah, wouldn't it be cool if whatever you thought just typed it?
[01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:32.940]   Like, oh, can we do that?
[01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:34.500]   He's like, I don't know, maybe.
[01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:36.740]   That's what the moonshot department is about.
[01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:41.540]   If you think it, we can throw money at it.
[01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:47.900]   One question I had about this when I was reading through it is, are our thoughts structured
[01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:49.100]   like sentences?
[01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:54.100]   If it could read my thoughts, is it really like I'm thinking about something?
[01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:56.900]   It'd be like, I was thinking about it, whatever.
[01:16:56.900 --> 01:17:01.620]   Like, I don't know, you probably have to learn how to type like this.
[01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:06.980]   As a aspect, it's more like the suggestions you already get in Aloe or Gmail or wherever
[01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:11.620]   else is making up little replies for you and it'll just pick one of those for me.
[01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:14.580]   It's bucket of pseudo-human replies.
[01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:23.500]   I think the more interesting thing about this is Charlie Strose, the sci-fi author, wrote
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:24.940]   about a while back.
[01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:32.980]   Basically saying, 2007 is when the human species accidentally invented telepathy because we're
[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:39.340]   now communicating through Twitter and Facebook and all these disclosure induction social
[01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:41.940]   media with little things in our hands all the time.
[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:45.300]   Basically, all our thoughts are being sprayed out to the net and read to each other all
[01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:48.180]   the time.
[01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:53.780]   His argument on this is, he wrote this in January 2016, is that this is going to have
[01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:55.220]   really strange effects on politics.
[01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:58.620]   I think that's about right.
[01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:02.460]   If you look at what's happened over the last two years in politics, yes, that is exactly
[01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:03.660]   what's been going on.
[01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:08.500]   There is this strange ability because we can actually communicate thoughts with each other
[01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:13.540]   and therefore ramp each other up into these loops of, "I have a wild idea.
[01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:14.940]   You have that wild idea too.
[01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:16.380]   Let's all spread it out."
[01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:21.500]   Those sprays and so's around social media and then spread into mainstream media and
[01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:25.700]   get taken up by political parties and all these things happen.
[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:28.660]   The world has got very strange very fast.
[01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:31.820]   I had not thought of it like that before.
[01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:36.620]   My mind is slightly blown because when I think of telepathy, I think of it in the way of
[01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:37.620]   this article.
[01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:39.900]   You're absolutely right.
[01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:46.820]   The barrier for passing along a thought, it's just part of our daily nature.
[01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:48.020]   We have a thought.
[01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:53.260]   We act on that thought by pulling out our phone, punching out that thought into words
[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:56.340]   and sending it out and now everybody knows that thought.
[01:18:56.340 --> 01:19:01.060]   That's just the way that life is in this strange technological world that we live right
[01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:02.060]   now.
[01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:06.540]   It's not very far removed from just having thoughts be transcribed onto a screen automatically.
[01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:08.300]   That's almost the same thing.
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:14.140]   >> But no, but I think it's a little, it's not far removed, but it's removed enough.
[01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:16.700]   Because there's a filter there.
[01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:22.460]   There's the action of typing the letters and building the thought and doing it as opposed
[01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:26.220]   to the unfiltered kind of your thoughts being transcribed.
[01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:31.340]   Because I'm feeling that if we could directly telepathically transcribe our thoughts and
[01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:36.060]   tweet them, the world would be much more disturbing than even as disturbing as it is now.
[01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:40.540]   And as much as we think that some people are doing that now by just saying immediately
[01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:44.780]   what they think and tweeting it, there's still a level of barrier that happens and I would
[01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:49.220]   be even more scared to see what those people would tweet telepathically with no filter.
[01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:53.020]   Just imagine what they actually think.
[01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:57.020]   But I love this, I love that they're investigating this as a moonshot.
[01:19:57.020 --> 01:19:59.020]   I love this as a concept.
[01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:05.020]   It's real sci-fi, but it's also like, I hate handwriting because I've used computers for
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:06.020]   so much.
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:09.180]   And I'm now at the point now where my wrist gets tired and I hate typing.
[01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:13.420]   And as much as I know a lot of writers who lean on like dragon dictate and other kind
[01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:15.660]   of voice speech recognition stuff.
[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:19.020]   But to be able to just sit there and look at something and have your thoughts get transcribed
[01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:24.860]   into text would be like amazing and would be able to make writing that much faster and
[01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:26.140]   easier.
[01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:28.180]   And just like imagine what it could unlock.
[01:20:28.180 --> 01:20:33.620]   Aside from just our unfiltered thoughts for Twitter or whatnot, the productivity I think
[01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:38.820]   would increase of could George RR Martin finally finish that Game of Thrones book of all you
[01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:42.020]   had to do was look at the computer and think about the story.
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:43.020]   That's pretty cool.
[01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:44.500]   But that's part of the problem.
[01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:50.700]   The thing is if you're a professional writer, even if you're not these days, a lot of people
[01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:55.340]   are very fast at typing and have a very direct line between their hand and their keyboard
[01:20:55.340 --> 01:21:04.420]   or their hand and their touchpad or they use voice notation and have trained themselves
[01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:08.620]   into a feedback loop with the computer just to speak in a way that gets transcribed well.
[01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:12.780]   Whereas if you try and transcribe me talking at the pace I'm talking at the moment, Google
[01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:14.380]   falls over and I have to go back and correct it.
[01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:15.860]   So I'm better off typing.
[01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:23.180]   But whereas if you've taught yourself to speak at that pace that Google is happy with and
[01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:29.100]   space out the words a bit more, then it will transcribe it reasonably reliably.
[01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:36.300]   But the point is more that we have, it's not just about the gap between the hard problem
[01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:39.940]   is not the gap between your brain and getting into the computer because we have four or
[01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:45.140]   five ways of doing that, all of which are pretty much close enough these days.
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:48.740]   But the weird thing that's changed is the ease of anyone be able to see that and spread
[01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:49.740]   that to other people.
[01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:55.180]   And that's the bit that feels more like sympathy where, and also you will see the news and you
[01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:58.260]   will think of a joke and go to tweet it and find that joke's already trending because
[01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:01.420]   everyone has had the same thought as well which is the other sort of bizarre on the
[01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:04.340]   report of this.
[01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:05.340]   That's really true.
[01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:07.300]   I mean, yeah, that's another aspect.
[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:08.580]   Yeah, I had it considered, right?
[01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:14.980]   Like it's super and that's why you see a lot of this like reactionary behavior on social
[01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:15.980]   media.
[01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:21.580]   So easy to see someone's thought and in a split second decide, I agree with that thought.
[01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:22.580]   Boom.
[01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:25.740]   Now everybody else knows that I agreed with it because I've spread it and that network
[01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:30.700]   effect extends far and wide and that's that's a direct tie right there.
[01:22:30.700 --> 01:22:31.700]   It's fascinating.
[01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:33.820]   Yeah, man, more and more.
[01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:34.820]   I'm just not sure.
[01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:39.060]   I'm not sure about this new Fangle technology, this social media stuff.
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:40.060]   It's ruining everything.
[01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:42.060]   Am I getting old?
[01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:43.060]   Is that what's happening?
[01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:44.060]   I'm getting old.
[01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:45.060]   Get off my lawn.
[01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:47.220]   Get off my lawn, you kids.
[01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:52.100]   Just let me draw my emoji.
[01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:53.100]   We've got tips.
[01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:54.100]   We've got tricks.
[01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:55.100]   We've got numbers.
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:57.340]   I'm not sure what we have actually to be honest after this break, but we're going to
[01:22:57.340 --> 01:22:58.340]   take a break.
[01:22:58.340 --> 01:22:59.900]   Yeah, it looks like we all have picks.
[01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:00.900]   Excellent.
[01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:02.500]   We're going to do the picks here in a second.
[01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:07.100]   Let's thank the sponsor of today's episode of this week in Google and that is rocket
[01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:09.100]   mortgage by quick and loans.
[01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:12.380]   I don't know if you've done the mortgage process before.
[01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:16.580]   If you've ever bought a home or refinanced a home, it's not always that easy.
[01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:18.140]   It's not always that straightforward.
[01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:22.060]   The mortgage experience wasn't keeping up with the times.
[01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:27.220]   It was dated and it needed a client-focused technological revolution.
[01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:32.020]   That's why quick and loans created rocket mortgages to make your life a little bit easier.
[01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:36.980]   Rocket mortgage gives you the confidence you need when it comes to buying a home or even
[01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:39.660]   refinancing your existing home loan.
[01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:40.660]   It's simple.
[01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:44.900]   It allows you to fully understand all of the details because there can be a lot of details
[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:50.700]   in the mortgage process and be confident that you're getting the right mortgage for you.
[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:53.380]   It's convenient, which is absolutely what you want.
[01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:56.140]   We live in the digital age, so we want more and more convenience.
[01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:58.820]   It's just part of how we do business online.
[01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:02.620]   Their trusted partners allow you to share your financial information with rocket mortgage
[01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:03.620]   at the touch of a button.
[01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:09.100]   You don't have to go diving for information, paperwork, all that kind of stuff in the
[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:10.100]   real world.
[01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:12.780]   They make it convenient for you and make it easy.
[01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:17.060]   It's powerful whether you're looking to buy your first home or your tenth, rocket mortgage
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:22.940]   is able to perform thousands of calculations in seconds so you can be up to date, you can
[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:27.980]   tweak your own scenario and find what's just right for you.
[01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:30.780]   It's based on your income, your assets, your credit.
[01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:35.500]   Rocket mortgage can analyze all of the home loan options for which you qualify and then
[01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:39.300]   find the one that's just right for your scenario.
[01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:45.580]   Rocket mortgage by Quick Elones applies simply, understand fully, mortgage confidently.
[01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:49.460]   To get started, go to rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:57.540]   That's rocketmortgage.com/twig, equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states, nmlsconsumeraccess.org
[01:24:57.540 --> 01:25:03.300]   number 30-30, and we thank Rocket Mortgage by Quick Elones for their support of this week
[01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:04.300]   in Google.
[01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:08.900]   All right, all three of us have picks this time around.
[01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:12.140]   Kevin, why don't we go with your pick or picks?
[01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:13.820]   You might have a couple, I don't know.
[01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:17.740]   Well, I have three related ones.
[01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:26.380]   So in the group I help organize and basically the goal is to get people to have their own
[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:31.300]   websites again and to find ways to connect between those websites so you don't have to
[01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:35.140]   do everything through Twitter or Facebook, but you can have your practical telepathy on
[01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:37.300]   your own website too.
[01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:44.020]   And there are a bunch of Indian Web Camp, our Home Group website clubs tonight.
[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:50.460]   You've probably missed all the UK one has already finished, but we have Bellingham,
[01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:58.420]   Washington, San Francisco, and Fort Collins, Colorado tonight coming up at 5.30.
[01:25:58.420 --> 01:26:01.980]   So check the link there for those.
[01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:07.020]   The San Francisco ones at Mozilla, Bellingham is at the Foundry and so on.
[01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:09.820]   I think a friend of mine is involved in the San Francisco one, Kevin.
[01:26:09.820 --> 01:26:13.540]   I think my friend, Tontak, is involved in the indie web stuff.
[01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:17.140]   Yeah, so yeah, I strongly recommend the indie web.
[01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:18.140]   It's awesome.
[01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:21.060]   Yes, Tontak is a great friend of mine too.
[01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:24.420]   And he hosted at Mozilla when he can and it is there tonight.
[01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:30.660]   And so it's worth going down there because it's a, and it starts at 5.30 quite writing
[01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:34.420]   hours, 6.30 you hang out and talk about your website.
[01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:39.340]   It's not quite website addicts club, but it's like I built my website and here's what I've
[01:26:39.340 --> 01:26:40.900]   done.
[01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:44.420]   I need help with this or have you thought of doing this.
[01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:48.340]   It's like a sort of self-help web building.
[01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:55.660]   And then the indie web summit is June 24th to 25th, so that's weekend after next in Portland,
[01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:56.660]   Oregon.
[01:26:56.660 --> 01:26:57.940]   And this is a full weekend.
[01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:01.380]   This is basically you spend the weekend.
[01:27:01.380 --> 01:27:06.380]   The Saturday is an unconference.
[01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:11.300]   So you get together and talk about things and to have to have the conversations about
[01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:14.300]   different aspects of building your own website.
[01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:17.980]   And then the Sunday is a building day where you get together and implement some of the
[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:20.380]   things you've talked about or improve your site and so on.
[01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:21.860]   And that's coming up.
[01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:24.540]   And then there's a there's a there's a drinks on the Friday night.
[01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:28.180]   So that's coming up June 24th, 25th in Portland.
[01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:33.060]   And there's there's there's still nine or 10 places left.
[01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:35.980]   And it's going to be live streamed as well.
[01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:36.980]   Nice.
[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:45.820]   And that should be if they want to check on that is that that's the indieweb.org or 2017.indiweb.org.
[01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:46.820]   Yes.
[01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:51.620]   And you've got the main site 2017 or any web.org is the summit.
[01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:52.620]   Awesome.
[01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:53.620]   There we go.
[01:27:53.620 --> 01:27:55.300]   So check that out if you're in the area.
[01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:56.300]   Great stuff.
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:28:01.180]   Ron, I recognize yours, but there was some news associated with this yesterday, I think.
[01:28:01.180 --> 01:28:02.180]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:04.060]   Some news broke a couple of weeks ago on all about Android.
[01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:10.460]   I brought to our app arena, a new email client called Astro, which is available for both
[01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:13.660]   the desktop as well as mobile.
[01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:18.420]   And folks who have seen me on on the show or on all about Android know that I'm obsessed
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:20.500]   with finding the perfect email client.
[01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:24.540]   And I don't know if Astro is the perfect female client, but I'm really enjoying it.
[01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:27.580]   It's got an AI chat bot kind of tied into it.
[01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:30.620]   That's what that's their big kind of thing that they were promoting.
[01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:34.220]   The fact that you could like talk to this bot about your email and be like, who is Jason?
[01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:36.340]   And when did he write to me and things like that?
[01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:41.220]   I don't necessarily use that, but it works with Gmail and with Office 360.
[01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:44.060]   And I believe that they're adding other support for other email services.
[01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:48.620]   It's just a really well designed slick email application.
[01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:51.740]   But they were in the news, I think yesterday or the day before, where they announced that
[01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:54.980]   they've added integration with Amazon Echo and Alexa.
[01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:58.820]   So you can interact with your email via your Echo.
[01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:01.700]   And I hope Google Home is coming soon because that's what I have.
[01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:03.700]   But then they also added a Slack integration.
[01:29:03.700 --> 01:29:09.100]   So you could actually interact with your email via Astro in Slack, which I find very funny
[01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:11.700]   because Slack is meant to be the anti-email.
[01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:16.460]   So bringing email into Slack is a bit of a, you know, like, yeah, but still.
[01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:18.540]   Sometimes you gotta do it.
[01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:19.540]   Sometimes you gotta do it.
[01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:23.340]   But it's a really, really well done integration and it's really sleek and elegant.
[01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:26.980]   So if you're a Slack user and you're looking for an email client that integrates Slack,
[01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:28.900]   Astro is the way to go, all in all, it's great.
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:33.340]   I'm moving into it for my desktop as well as my Android phone.
[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:35.860]   So I recommended it said hello, astro.com.
[01:29:35.860 --> 01:29:36.940]   You can check it out there.
[01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:44.380]   Do you integrate or do you, I don't know, because you can chat with the AI bot from within the app.
[01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:46.820]   Do you interface like that at all?
[01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:47.820]   No, I don't.
[01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:49.060]   I'm an adult.
[01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:52.660]   Fair enough.
[01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:54.180]   I just need my email.
[01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:56.660]   But no, no, I actually haven't played with the chat about that much.
[01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:57.820]   Maybe I will a little more.
[01:29:57.820 --> 01:29:59.540]   I still need to load it in.
[01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:00.700]   Like currently I've only got one.
[01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:04.740]   I have like eight email accounts now that I'm actively going.
[01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:08.540]   And so I need a client that can do all eight of them and that takes a while to load them
[01:30:08.540 --> 01:30:09.940]   and organize everything.
[01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:13.140]   So that's my weekend plan is that I'm switching completely over my actual.
[01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:18.180]   Especially like I was testing it, I was playing with it with one email account and it's past
[01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:19.180]   the smoke test.
[01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:21.620]   And now that they have the Slack integration, I'm like, oh, I'm all in.
[01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:22.620]   So awesome.
[01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:23.620]   All right.
[01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:24.620]   That's Astro.
[01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:27.620]   Hello, astro.com.
[01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:30.820]   Mine is just here to freak you out.
[01:30:30.820 --> 01:30:33.820]   It's a it's picks to picks photo generator.
[01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:36.100]   This has been making the rounds the last couple of weeks.
[01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:41.620]   It's with an F photo generator dot MPO cloud dot NL.
[01:30:41.620 --> 01:30:44.460]   This is one of those tools where on the left you have your input.
[01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:47.500]   I wish I could do it on my touchscreen on my pixel, but it doesn't allow me to do it.
[01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:48.700]   But you can use your mouse.
[01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:53.780]   Essentially, what you do is you can clear that image and you can create a little of a face.
[01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:55.100]   So I don't know.
[01:30:55.100 --> 01:30:59.100]   You could do something very rudimentary or you can get really detailed.
[01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:03.980]   Some people I think are able to use a wack and kind of interface.
[01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:06.740]   I bet it would work really well on a surface or whatever.
[01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:14.660]   And then you hit process and it takes it takes machine and AI algorithm on the back
[01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:22.700]   end that's been trained with human faces to take the face that you draw and basically
[01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:25.620]   turn it into a human life form.
[01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:30.140]   It is the creepiest thing you'll ever see and the more detailed you get with some of
[01:31:30.140 --> 01:31:32.380]   these pictures, the weirder results you get.
[01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:39.740]   I put a link to an article in the doc underneath this with just some examples of things that
[01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:42.340]   artists have done and non artists.
[01:31:42.340 --> 01:31:47.780]   No matter how you how you do it, there's just a lot of really weird outcomes.
[01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:50.620]   Jason, you love these kinds of things.
[01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:55.060]   This is like like I'm fascinated by it and I don't know why.
[01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:59.860]   What I really love about this is I love the idea of taking what it was like a stick figure.
[01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:00.860]   Like look at that.
[01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:02.660]   That looks like a beast or something.
[01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:03.660]   I love it.
[01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:06.860]   Yeah, it looks like Gilmore Datoro type monsters.
[01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:07.860]   Totally.
[01:32:07.860 --> 01:32:08.860]   Totally.
[01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:15.260]   It's very much the what was the Google the deep dream stuff where you know suddenly you
[01:32:15.260 --> 01:32:18.260]   you've you've feeded a picture and suddenly there are eyeballs everywhere.
[01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:23.100]   But it's basically it's doing this conversion from stick figure art or you know or just
[01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:28.700]   trace trace art of a face and it actually turns it into a human.
[01:32:28.700 --> 01:32:30.020]   What would the human look like?
[01:32:30.020 --> 01:32:34.260]   And you can you can poke around and see some examples of what this thing has done.
[01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:35.260]   I mean, look at that.
[01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:37.100]   That's really cool.
[01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:42.060]   Like that stick figure, you know, that that line tracing turned into an actual face with
[01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:48.460]   shading and I've just seen some really crazy results and it's just a I wish I could come
[01:32:48.460 --> 01:32:52.820]   up with something half as awesome in my attempts to do this stuff.
[01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:54.540]   Mine don't like that dog.
[01:32:54.540 --> 01:32:55.540]   That looks really great.
[01:32:55.540 --> 01:32:56.540]   I don't know.
[01:32:56.540 --> 01:32:59.860]   It's a it's a cool thing to scare yourself with, I guess.
[01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:02.060]   Horrifying absolutely horrifying horrifying.
[01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:05.420]   Yes, fun at the same time.
[01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:10.940]   Look for picks to picks photo generator and you can play around with it and see what kind
[01:33:10.940 --> 01:33:13.180]   of horrifying heart you come up with.
[01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:18.580]   It's just an interesting example of what AI is doing in this day and age and we're at
[01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:21.340]   the beginning of it all it seems.
[01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:22.740]   I think I think we did it.
[01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:23.740]   I think we made it.
[01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:25.540]   We we channeled through the Google.
[01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:31.420]   We dug ourselves through the Android and then we took a dip into the Facebook and Amazon
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:36.100]   waters a little bit as well and it was a lot of fun because I had both of you guys on.
[01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:38.620]   First Kevin Marks Kevin Marks.com.
[01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:41.100]   It's always fun to get the chance to do this with you Kevin.
[01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:45.340]   Thank you so much for staying up late with us.
[01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:50.780]   Oh, I think your connection just just just went out.
[01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:55.980]   I'll say by to Ron and I'll come back to you because I think I think it froze for a second.
[01:33:55.980 --> 01:33:59.340]   Ron, we podcast a lot, but it's never enough.
[01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:01.940]   Thank you for coming out of this week in Google today.
[01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:02.940]   My pleasure.
[01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:03.940]   Yeah, no, it was great.
[01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:06.260]   Great to be here to talk about more than just Android and talk about Google, Facebook,
[01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:07.260]   all that fun stuff.
[01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:10.820]   Yeah, thanks for having me and folks can find me.
[01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:14.580]   Follow me on Twitter at Ronxo and that's where I talk about all my other projects and
[01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:15.580]   other stuff.
[01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:18.740]   Check out my other podcasts, talking about comic books over at ifamboy.com and talking
[01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:22.940]   about Twin Peaks with Tom Merritt at damnfinepodcast.com.
[01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:23.940]   Radical.
[01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:28.980]   And I mean, you're like deep in the current season of Twin Peaks, right?
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:29.980]   At this point.
[01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:34.340]   Yes, we are one third of the way through the new season of Twin Peaks, Twin Peaks the return
[01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:39.580]   on Showtime and we put out new episodes every Sunday night, Monday morning, right after
[01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:41.860]   we watch it, we record and we do our immediate impressions.
[01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:47.580]   It's been a lot of fun and it's, we got, I think, geez, 12 more episodes to go.
[01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:50.180]   So all through the summer, it's going to be fun.
[01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:51.700]   All right, right on.
[01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:55.260]   You're doing a great job with that and I'm sorry, I missed you last night, but back there
[01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:57.100]   next week, next week, next week.
[01:34:57.100 --> 01:35:01.340]   Yeah, of course, everyone, everyone check out all about Android every Tuesday at 530
[01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:03.900]   Pacific time here on Twitter.
[01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:04.900]   That's right.
[01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:10.220]   I'm stalling, of course, also because I'm hoping to get Kevin back, but I think Kevin
[01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:11.580]   might be lost to the wolves.
[01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:17.380]   I think, I think what happened is Kevin saw my pick and couldn't help himself and he
[01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:18.380]   got scared, he ran away.
[01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:19.380]   I was suing.
[01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:25.500]   If we get him back, we'll say a proper goodbye, but I always enjoy podcasting with Kevin.
[01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:28.860]   It's great to have him on kevinmarks.com if you want to find out about all that he's
[01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:33.220]   up to in the open web, which is very close to his heart as you've heard on this show
[01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:34.220]   before.
[01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:38.020]   So a big thanks to Kevin for taking time out of his night to join us.
[01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:39.260]   And as for me, I'm Jason Howell.
[01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:41.300]   He can find me all over the Twin Network.
[01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:45.900]   Of course, I do tech news today, every day with Megan Moroney, do all about Android with
[01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:50.260]   Ron and a whole lot of other things on the network and occasionally fill in here on
[01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:51.860]   this week in Google.
[01:35:51.860 --> 01:35:59.700]   Reminder that Twig records every Wednesday, 1.30 p.m. Pacific, 4.30 p.m. Eastern 2030 UTC.

[01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:06.220]   We had some folks in studio watching for a while.
[01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:09.940]   That was a lot of fun, but you can do it virtually just by going there.
[01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:17.220]   Of course, you can find the show on demand at Twig.tv/Twig TWIG and big thanks to John,
[01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:22.060]   big thanks to Carson as well for helping out here in the studio and getting everything
[01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:24.220]   all coordinated with the show.
[01:36:24.220 --> 01:36:25.580]   Because I always have a lot of fun doing it.
[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:26.980]   So thanks for having me back.
[01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:29.180]   I think Leo's back next week, right?
[01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:32.460]   Yes, getting two big nods on that.
[01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:33.940]   So welcome back, Leo.
[01:36:33.940 --> 01:36:36.660]   Next week on this week in Google, we'll see you then.
[01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:37.060]   Bye, guys.
