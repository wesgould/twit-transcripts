[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.600]   It's time for Twig this week in Google joining us from Lutansa.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.960]   He's in the lounge.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.040]   Are you flying to or are you coming back?
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.840]   Tuberlin.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.320]   Tuberlin.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.840]   So you're in New York at JFK?
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.960]   Yeah, at Newark.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.480]   Newark.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.400]   All right.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.840]   Jeff Jarvis, he is, of course, the author
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.600]   of What Would Google Do and Professor of Journalism
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.080]   and Expert in Journalism at the City
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.160]   University of New York and blogs at buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.800]   Good to have you back, Jeff, our regular--
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.400]   Always.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.080]   Also our regular Gina Trapani of smarterwear.org.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.520]   Good to see you.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.040]   Hello.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.440]   And instant searchers.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.720]   Instant searchers.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.520]   We're going to talk about that.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.120]   Beautiful.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.000]   And Willett.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   And there's a fan doing the hair thing.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.520]   I know.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.880]   That's really slick.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.520]   It's just really hot in my office.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.520]   I have the fan on.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.520]   Oh, yeah, sure.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.400]   The side effect is a blowing hair.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.880]   If I have but one life to live, let me live it as a nerd.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.320]   Great hair.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.080]   Also, Jordan.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.600]   Oh, my God.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.240]   No, it looks great.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.600]   I love it.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.200]   Don't stop.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.200]   Go, stop.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.120]   Also joining us right now, Kevin Marks.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.040]   He is actually at the Google event
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.280]   at the Museum of Modern Art, which
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.920]   concluded just a couple of hours ago.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.200]   He stuck around to give us his perspective.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.080]   Former Googler, formal appler, currently at British Telecom,
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.160]   running ribbit.com.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.000]   It's great to have you, Kevin Marks.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.080]   Great to be here.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.840]   There was some speculation or I was spec--
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.600]   it was all on my part because the invitation
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.760]   was extraordinarily clear that Google was going
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.080]   to talk about search.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.720]   But I thought maybe this will be the event
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.800]   where we'll hear about Google music, maybe Google TV more.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.880]   Maybe they'll announce Google me, the Facebook.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.040]   No, it was search.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.080]   It was search search.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.160]   And they've done this before, haven't they, Kevin?
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.120]   Yeah, no, they don't search event last year.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.280]   And before that, they've done smaller ones.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.560]   But I think this particular one was very focused
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.360]   on the Google Instant feature, which
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.360]   is the star of the show.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.760]   Whereas the last last year, it was
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.640]   the little refinements of things like that.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.520]   Whereas this is a very clear change.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.400]   They did start off talking about the year in search
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.000]   and stuff like that and how we named ourselves
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.600]   Google Topeka and all of that.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.200]   caffeine was the one announcement that was germane, really,
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.960]   to this instant search.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.280]   That was a speed up in search that they instituted
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.600]   a few months ago.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.560]   That's a small speed of indexing speed up, rather than
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.720]   speed of results, I think.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.520]   I see.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.360]   But that obviously helps, too.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.640]   I mean, one thing I have noticed with the Google Instant
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.040]   is that Google real-time results
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.400]   tend to be showing up in there.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.680]   So there's an interesting crossover there.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.440]   And it may just be like, I wasn't typing the right queries.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.360]   But there's a bit of a challenge when you got two
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.600]   of the time updates going on at once, I think.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.240]   They said this event was all about speed, speed, speed.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.240]   And indeed, indeed, indeed, Instant Search
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.040]   is, they say, will save something like 350 million hours
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.360]   a year in time, because you'll save two or three seconds
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.080]   of search.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.920]   Before we start looking at Instant Search,
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.200]   was there anything else that they talked about that was
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.440]   of import, or were there any tea leaves you could read
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.680]   by who was on the stage, or what they were saying?
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.920]   No, not that I said this was a very focused presentation.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.920]   They've got this one huge feature,
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.600]   and they were very excited about that.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.480]   And they weren't really taking questions about anything else
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.800]   in the audience Q&A version.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.600]   And they may have said a few things afterwards.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.480]   Sergey Brin was on stage.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.840]   I didn't see Larry, though.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.440]   No, Sergey was here.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.680]   And Marissa, and Udi Manbar, and a bunch of other Google
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.720]   people, but not Larry and Nairak, the key still in Europe.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.840]   And this is the criminalologist in me, not Vic Gundotra,
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.440]   who is their social guy.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.520]   And the fact that Vic wasn't there kind of made me think,
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.960]   oh, well, I guess it won't be Google me or Google music.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.440]   Yeah, and I think this looks in a different world.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.840]   This is Search, which is a cool business,
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.480]   has a huge infrastructure, and is a big chunk of what Google
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.200]   does.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.600]   So what is Instant Search?
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.840]   Instant Search is, well, I think it's turned on for everyone
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.640]   now, I'm not sure.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.920]   In the US.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.360]   In the US, sorry.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.480]   Everyone in the US, we have that usual problem.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.080]   But as you type, the search results
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.680]   appear with every letter you type.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.640]   And when you say appear--
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.440]   I mean, we've seen before the dropdown.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.160]   Let me see if I can get it running here.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.080]   Let's see if we can get it up.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.880]   It's definitely worth watching if you can get it working.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.440]   Yeah, so give me a search.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.840]   Gina, what should I type in the search box here?
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.360]   Type to it.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.840]   Thank you.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.520]   You get a raise.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.520]   Gina gets a raise.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.800]   All right, I'm going to start typing.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.040]   Actually, I'll do it T. And so immediately, not only do I
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.400]   get the dropdown, which we got before,
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.320]   but I also get a page of results.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.200]   And then I type W. And now the page results changes.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.240]   And a second page loads in, which is headed by Twitter.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.920]   And I notice--
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.560]   Notice, fascinating, is this is both personalized and localized.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.280]   Let's all put in T and see what the first response is.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.160]   Mine's target.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.800]   What do you get?
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.400]   Ah, interesting.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.520]   And that's because you can't use this unless you're logged in.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.880]   And you have your--
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.720]   so your previous web searches are in this box.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.840]   So I do get target.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.920]   You all get target?
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.760]   You all do it following along?
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.560]   Chat when everybody gets target?
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.920]   Target is Twitter's the sole rest of the velocity.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.200]   Yeah, that's what I get to.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.840]   If I go to W, Twitter--
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.960]   I get TD Bank in there and tick Master.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.000]   Ah, because you've been--
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.160]   I get TMZ and tick Master.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.280]   TMZ, interesting.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.520]   We know what you spend some time doing there, you know, lady.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.600]   Awesome.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.600]   You're shocked.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.560]   You know, I'm a little bum because OpenDNS just
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.680]   started blocking TMZ.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.200]   So now--
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.320]   Well, the one that was the weirdest for me
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.960]   is if you put D in, I get California Department of Motor
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.640]   Vehicles.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.240]   Well, it does know your location, right?
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.080]   And I do too.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.600]   I do too.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.320]   I do too.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.520]   But I bet Jeff doesn't get DMV.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.240]   If you type D, what do you get, Jeff?
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.640]   You've muted yourself.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.600]   Unmute yourself, sir.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.360]   Hello, Jeff.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.360]   Earth to Jeff.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.200]   Oh, he's gone.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.000]   I get the Del Mar Fair, which is a local San Diego event.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.480]   Really local.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.400]   What if I type D?
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:11.920]   Interesting.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.520]   Here you go.
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.920]   Ultra local.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.120]   Very local.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.760]   Wow.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.920]   Well, let's see if I type P. Do I get Petaluma?
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.120]   I get Pandora, PG&E, and PayPal.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.760]   I get P.E. is Petco.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.840]   P.E.T. is still Petco, of course.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.120]   Now, one thing that Steve--
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.160]   there at FITI type P.E.T.A. I get Petaluma.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.160]   One thing that Steve Gibson pointed out--
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.160]   and I think it'll be interesting to see if anybody notices
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.120]   or complains about this--
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.920]   he said, you know, it's loading a hell of a lot more data
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.000]   than it used to.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.120]   Because every time you type a letter,
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.520]   it's loading a full Google page, images, and all.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.520]   But it doesn't look like an image search or blog search.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.080]   A lot.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.160]   You will get images if they show up
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.360]   in universal search, right?
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.680]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.800]   So if I search for Pia Zadora--
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.560]   I don't know why I would--
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.440]   I get pictures of Pia Zadora.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.600]   By the way, and Irina--
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.680]   How did that enter your brain?
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.520]   I don't know why.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.440]   I don't know why.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.400]   Irina Slitsky, who was in the event,
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.880]   asked, hey, why when I type my name, Irina SLUT--
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.480]   and this is a very common Russian name--
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.440]   blank, blank, blank.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.920]   And that's even if safe search is turned off.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.760]   Yeah, you'd have to have four in the same thing.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.680]   Type sex-- same thing S. You get Skype SF-Gate,
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.160]   which is a local result.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.720]   E, you get Sears, Sephora, and Selena.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.720]   X, you get sex in the city.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.560]   Sex defenders.
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.880]   I think sex is OK, but there are definitely
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.160]   stop words if you type.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.040]   And Slitsky was a weird one because it blocks whatever
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.040]   you type, whereas if you type--
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.200]   Yeah, poor Irina, you can't search for her anymore.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.720]   If you type, Bartik goes blank.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.520]   But if you add a no, it re-complete to Button,
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.640]   whereas Irina, any combination of her name just vanishes.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.080]   I would be pissed if I were--
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.840]   Well, it will run the search.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.680]   OK, so--
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.560]   Maybe it'll still get it.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.040]   Yeah, you'll still get it.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.120]   But you just don't get it.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.760]   But I think for a lot of people-- maybe--
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.400]   I mean, yeah, you know that.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.120]   But it does say press enter to search.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.840]   But for a lot of people, they're going to say, oh, I guess
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.880]   there's no result.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.320]   Aren't they?
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:21.880]   Yes.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:22.920]   Oh, it's a problem.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.120]   You're right.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.640]   This is going to be a self-ful problem.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.200]   And it blocks, otherwise, the other one that Irina came up
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.120]   with was Bitch Magazine.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.280]   If you type, it's a stop word.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.880]   Everything goes white, which means
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.240]   that Bitch Magazine is now at a disadvantage
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.080]   to the other women's magazines that it's competing with,
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.560]   because it won't appear.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.680]   Boy, that's terrible.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.800]   I think that's probably a problem that Bitch Magazine has
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.480]   in general, though.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.000]   Maybe.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:48.760]   But I agree.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.720]   And it is disconcerting when the whole page goes white.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.880]   You're like, what-- what went wrong?
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.400]   What did I do wrong?
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.080]   They're an error.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.520]   Yeah.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.880]   But yeah, that is unfortunate for--
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.040]   I mean, I guess he doesn't want to suggest to you words
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:09:59.600]   you wouldn't have seen.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.800]   But wasn't that suggestion going to be there before anyway?
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.160]   We just didn't notice if this happened before.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:04.520]   I don't know.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.240]   That's a good question.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.600]   You can turn Instant Search off.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.720]   All you have to do when you're getting the Instant Search
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.160]   is go to the right.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.160]   It says Instant is on, and you can turn it off.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.840]   And by the way, if you do turn it off, I found out
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.400]   it'll stay off on all of your logins
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.760]   until you actually go into Settings.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.520]   And there is now in Search Settings,
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.120]   there is a section called Google Instant.
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.560]   And you can change that.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.000]   It also says-- and this might be relevant to some people--
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.920]   sign-in users can remove personalized suggestions
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.560]   from their web history.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.920]   So if you're getting something you don't like every time
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.120]   you start typing, which I can see happening,
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.280]   but people have to find that.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.840]   But let me get back to my original question.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.840]   Doesn't this use considerably more bandwidth
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.000]   than Google used before?
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.320]   Every letter there's another processing power.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.680]   Well, it's not quite every letter.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.360]   If you type quickly, then it'll only send.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.120]   Ah, OK.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:10:59.400]   Fine.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.720]   But yeah, if you type things slowly,
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.880]   then it will send for each time.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.160]   There is a little spin loop there.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.000]   So if you type a word, you won't get--
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.280]   you won't see it changing that quickly,
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.720]   because there is a--
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:11.920]   So I only--
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.840]   I typed my name at full speed and I only got one page.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:15.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.360]   And they also said, didn't they at the presentation,
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.040]   that this is a lot more about caching, isn't it?
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.960]   Yes.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.000]   Well, but that's caching.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:22.960]   That's from Google's point of view.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.560]   No, that's a there side.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.720]   You're still doing a network round track.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.160]   Yeah, the ISP may not like it.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:26.800]   OK, I'm ready.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.720]   OK, here's my conspiracy theory.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.480]   Maybe this explains the deal with Verizon.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.920]   I would-- I wonder if--
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.760]   because wasn't it after all AT&T who said Google's
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:37.640]   freeloading on us?
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.720]   This was what began the net neutrality discussion
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.000]   years ago, is we don't like it that Google's using so much
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.560]   bandwidth, we want to charge them.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.840]   And I can imagine an internet service provider saying,
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.360]   whoa, you just quadrupled or whatever the amount of data.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.880]   It's a drop in the ocean, very YouTube.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.720]   That's true.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.720]   That's the bulk of Google's bandwidth.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.200]   And that's what makes Google a valuable peering part
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.000]   with people, because they've got so much of that going both ways.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.280]   So Google is now at the stage where they've got enough traffic
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.920]   and they've got enough infrastructure
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:13.280]   that they count as a peer to the internet companies in most
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:13.640]   places.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.680]   And this is why we have Kevin Marks on, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.000]   so when I say something completely stupid,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.720]   you can say, well, and he says it so nicely.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.000]   But they showed it briefly.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.120]   They showed a version of it working on mobile.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.200]   That would be an issue there.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.200]   There's other issues with trying to type on a keyboard
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.800]   on the mobile and having enough screen space left to see more
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:35.320]   than one result.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:39.880]   But that was-- you can see that there's value
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.040]   in doing the autocomplete on mobile.
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.720]   In some ways more than there is in doing it in the browser
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.320]   itself.
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.480]   They did say that they'll be rolling it out on mobile later
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.720]   this year.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.520]   I don't know if that means an Android update.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.720]   I'm not sure exactly how that happens.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.280]   My question, though, is how many people
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.600]   use Google from the Google page?
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.840]   Almost all of us now search from--
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.800]   Leo, I think that's what's going to change here tremendously.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.040]   Is that-- well, number one, I think it's going to change.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:04.640]   You're right.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:05.400]   I never use the page.
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.760]   No, I'm motivated to.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.360]   But number two, by the way, I notice,
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.480]   has a hat tree behind me.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.800]   It looks like I have an antenna in my head.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.280]   I like it.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.960]   It's the Martian effect.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.480]   Yes.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.400]   My favorite Martian.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.320]   I have the waving hair and I have the winky hat ring.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.960]   But number two, I immediately asked,
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.040]   how do I get this into my chrome bar?
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.800]   And I guess, Kevin, I think they said there
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.160]   that they are going to do that, right?
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.160]   But I don't know how you do that.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.240]   How do you put the page worth of information
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.520]   in a pulldown from the bar?
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.280]   Oh, that's interesting, huh?
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.640]   Because you don't want to hear what the page is on.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.200]   You're going to get the page on the lawn.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.840]   Yeah, that's the thing that I have to work on.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.560]   But I'm presumably--
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.320]   you could just do it in a really big overlay.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:42.480]   Well, maybe not.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.240]   If I'm typing it into the page, I'm going to leave the page.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.160]   Leave the page.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.200]   So I could just leave the page.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.160]   It's the Google takeover.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.680]   This is-- ow, it's our page now.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:52.880]   Well, the interesting thing is going
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.120]   to be what they do for the other browsers.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.120]   So--
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:00.000]   This is currently supported in, interestingly, IE8,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.560]   as well as Safari, Chrome, and Firefox.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.360]   It's just Ajax, I guess.
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.080]   So it's not HTML5.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.520]   It's nothing unusual.
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.720]   It's something that any browser does.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.360]   I don't think it's using web sockets or anything like that.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.000]   I haven't actually dug into the code yet.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.880]   But I think it's just doing a series of straightforward page
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.960]   requests, yeah.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.000]   So are you all going to just start using the Google front
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.040]   page from now on?
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.400]   Well, it's interesting.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.640]   I think most people who use the Google front page now
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.280]   are not the power users.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.720]   They're kind of the regular folks.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.840]   And I think that this is going to be a really big jarring
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:34.440]   change for them.
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.200]   And this makes the power users who search from their bar
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.960]   want to go to google.com.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:43.640]   I imagine that it'll come out in the browsers soon enough
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.600]   on mobile as well.
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.080]   They've got to roll it out in those other places.
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.680]   There are so many places that you can search Google at this
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:48.880]   point.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.560]   I mean, very few of us who use the weather single day actually
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.480]   use google.com.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.800]   I haven't seen a Google Doodle unless I actually go there
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.520]   in a long time for that reason.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.880]   I haven't seen the front page.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.840]   Well, maybe this is for those people.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.800]   They had a grandpa on the promo video who just said,
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.880]   oh, this is wonderful.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.200]   I don't even have to have return.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.200]   Woo!
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.480]   It saved me a keystroke in life.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.440]   I hate it to return.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.240]   I love that guy.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.000]   Is it an error?
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:17.840]   Is it return?
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.200]   What is it?
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:20.840]   I love that guy.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.720]   That was fantastic.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.440]   You know, it's very much it strikes me, of course.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.120]   I'm going to say this.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.560]   But it's very much like wave, except the difference
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.040]   is that with wave, things change on the page.
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.960]   A lot of different things in all different places.
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.800]   But with this, you're focused on the text box.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.760]   And you know, the eye tracking charts
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.160]   that they show are really interesting because you're
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.320]   focused on the text box.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.680]   And you're going to-- you know, that really is going
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.360]   to draw your attention to the top couple of results.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.760]   So you really can kind of--
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.640]   Yeah, I noticed that as I was using it.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.760]   I never really did-- somebody had to point out, oh, yeah,
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:51.800]   well, it's updating the page.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.640]   Because I'm looking at the box.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.000]   Right.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.320]   You look in the box and the drop down.
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.840]   So you have the box suggesting text in gray, which you can tab
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:59.760]   to autocomplete.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.360]   You have the drop down changing and suggesting words in it,
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.680]   suggesting whole phrases.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.560]   And then you have behind that the page changing
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.960]   as you select more words.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.600]   So there's a lot going on there.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.120]   So I have to say, I think that it's going to be kind of jarring.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.840]   This is what people complain about in wave.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.120]   Like, oh, there's too many things.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.680]   You know, it's giving me seizures.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.960]   I think this is a little more focused into one area of the page,
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.640]   which is the top around box.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.320]   But it's pretty-- it's real time.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.800]   I mean, it's definitely commitment to real time.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.880]   And it looks like this is how things are going to be.
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.000]   And I can see that if you--
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.160]   see, to me, it's too much work to go to google.com.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.200]   So I'm less likely to do that anyway.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.240]   I mean, it's not going to save me any time or keystrokes.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.640]   But I sure do wish this functionality were available
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.280]   everywhere, because I could see when you start typing stuff.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.320]   And then you arrow key down to the-- oh, no, I wanted that.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.760]   And you've got the search page that you wanted.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.560]   They said-- and they pointed this out--
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.880]   far fewer visits to page two.
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.240]   Yeah, and the problem with putting it in the Chrome bar
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:03.080]   is if I start typing twit.tv, it doesn't know whether I'm
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.320]   typing until I get to a space or to a dot.
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:09.080]   It doesn't know whether I'm typing in a word or URL.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.040]   Yeah, we're better in--
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.400]   So we better assume that it won't search.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.280]   Well, maybe this is the way to force me to search all the time.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.280]   That it goes ahead and gives me twit TWI search results.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:20.760]   And when I finish typing twit.tv, OK, it goes to the URL.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.880]   Can I ask a dumb question?
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.020]   Why did Google do this?
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:25.560]   Kevin, you might have some insight into this.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.680]   Why does Google do this?
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.480]   What does it matter?
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.240]   I think the best thing was the slide Marissa
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.400]   showed at the beginning.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.880]   And she said they've been optimizing
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.920]   and optimizing the middle piece of this, which is how long it
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.240]   takes to get the results back from the data centers.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.440]   And then when they actually watch people using it,
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.120]   it takes them like 10 seconds to type the query.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.920]   Then it takes them 15 seconds to decide which one
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.320]   to click on afterwards.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.800]   And that was now-- because the middle bit was so fast,
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.200]   that was the dominant thing that was slowing down people
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.200]   from searching.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.840]   So by tackling this, they were cutting those two times down.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.320]   That was the justification for it.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.320]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.520]   It's also what happens when you have a vice president in charge
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.360]   of user interface.
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.160]   I mean, you have somebody that high level looking
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.320]   at the user interface.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.880]   You start paying attention to little things
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.920]   like how many seconds they type.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.680]   But the speed of the Google is going to obsess with, yeah.
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.040]   Yeah, always.
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.240]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.400]   This speed is their gospel.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.120]   It's the thing they always emphasize.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.680]   Eric Schmidt's tweet this morning
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.480]   was that we're always been fast and now fast is faster.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.720]   Did he have that weird Hitler mustache when he did the tweet?
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.320]   You guys see that horrible-- we'll talk about it later.
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.800]   That horrible video from consumerwatchdog.org.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.360]   If I were Eric Schmidt, I would be like, wounded.
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.560]   I mean, it was horrible.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.000]   But hold on, we'll talk about it.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:41.520]   Hold on.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.680]   I think I did this.
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.680]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.560]   I was going to say this really emphasizes
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.600]   Google as a service.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.440]   It's a utility.
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.880]   It's an instant gratification.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.240]   We're going to get you where you need to go.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.800]   And it's part of the reason why some people theorize
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.440]   that Google might not be so good at social, right?
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.120]   Because Facebook is about keeping you on Facebook
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.080]   and making you waste time.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.960]   Or Google is about making you save time.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.240]   And is that a cultural class?
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.480]   Oh, interesting.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.920]   This is the thing that they're great at.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:06.720]   And what did Marissa say?
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.240]   She said that Google has one billion users a week.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.720]   And that's more than any other service.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.640]   And that's just not just internet services.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.560]   Am I quoting her right?
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.960]   She said any service.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.080]   So I mean, Google is a utility.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:19.960]   It's a utility.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.840]   And they've known from the numbers
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.840]   that the faster you go, the more business they do.
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.720]   And the more business they do, the more money they make.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.000]   It's simple of economics.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.960]   But I also think it fits into their larger goal, which
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:32.680]   has always been--
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.360]   speed is one gospel.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.520]   But the real gospel of Google is to intuit your intent
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.000]   is to know where you go before you go there.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.920]   So Eric got in some hot water again for saying at IFA
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.080]   that we know where you are and what you want.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.360]   Why does he keep saying stuff like that?
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.200]   Eric.
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.640]   He also said, by the way, he also said
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.160]   that his line about changing your age of 21, which I've
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.400]   said for three years now, he was joking.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.880]   And everybody went bananas on that.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.480]   The line of today that's going to come out, I think,
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.240]   is when Brynn said, we're the third half of your brain.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.440]   Oh, boy.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.360]   And I was talking with Matt Cutts' Twitter
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.600]   saying, how long is it going to be before we get our first--
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.480]   Google's intuit search and privacy story.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.520]   It took one hour, by the way.
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.280]   It's not.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.440]   And he predicted that that quote would be the one
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.640]   that people clom want to.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:22.000]   And especially people wear tinfoil hats.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:22.840]   Google's in my brain.
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.800]   So what is the privacy implication of this?
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.280]   None, more than there already was.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.920]   You can turn off-- the cookies can turn this off--
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:34.800]   or you can get more personalized search and add results.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.120]   And it knows when you ask for pizza,
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.880]   it's going to give you pizza in your town.
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.520]   Or because I went to Ticketmaster recently for the US Open,
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.440]   it knows when I put in tea, maybe I
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.160]   went Ticketmaster.
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.520]   There's some odds of that.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.200]   And that is, in fact, convenient for me.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.680]   Or I can turn it off.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.880]   Gene, do you think it's--
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.920]   the problem is the disconnect between what computers
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.040]   scientists, how they view a computer,
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.560]   and how normal people view mechanistic enterprises.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.640]   I think a normal person goes, well, if Google is predicting
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.000]   what I want, they must know.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:03.960]   And a computer--
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.520]   and right, they know something about me.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.840]   There is no free will, Leo.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.440]   And a computer scientist goes, oh, no, it's algorithmic.
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.360]   And it's not Google, it's your browser.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.360]   And they don't know nothing.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:14.920]   Absolutely.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.320]   I mean, I think it's a little bit of a--
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.120]   I think Merci said a psychic shift.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.800]   There's a psychic shift for the UI.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.800]   But there's also this psychological moment
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.520]   where I think a person who isn't an engineer, computer
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.800]   engineer, suddenly it's just exposing.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.240]   Google is just exposing you a little faster.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.040]   It's guesses.
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:30.520]   You know what I mean?
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.400]   All those guesses exist in the back end.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.400]   This change is just showing you what it knows,
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.840]   which can freak people out a little bit at first.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.480]   Like, oh, they're collecting my web history.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.880]   Well, yeah, web history is one of those features
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:42.720]   I've had for a while.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.320]   Always have.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.240]   It knows your IP address, so it has an idea
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.640]   of your general location.
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.640]   That always has.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.960]   So I do think that it's a little bit of a shift of like, oh,
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.680]   that's--
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.080]   huh, I guess I'm not the only person in the world searching
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.440]   for like, how do I get a quickie divorce?
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.360]   You know?
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.960]   I think normal people, though, think
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.520]   there's a Keebler elf in there.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.760]   And he's writing this all down.
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.760]   Well, that's evil.
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.400]   That's why I think the thing going white
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.880]   is going to be suddenly jarring, right?
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.400]   Right.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.080]   He's used to this thing.
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:11.880]   The elf's not working.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.760]   And he talks some bad word.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:13.520]   Everything goes white.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.400]   It's like, do I just do something bad?
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.960]   That's going to have to be a really interesting--
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.080]   That's interesting, yeah.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.880]   Yeah, the white out search.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.680]   I think it's the ruin of the arena search.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.000]   Don't show me nasty words.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.520]   All I have to do is type arena SLU.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.400]   It doesn't-- I don't even have to say SLU-T anymore.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.800]   And if you type out SLU-T skis, holy, we'll do it, either.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.920]   No, it doesn't get smart about that.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.400]   That they have to fix.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.800]   I'm glad arena was at the event.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.720]   That was a sad thing next to her.
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.200]   We noticed this, yes.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.160]   Wow, that's great.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:44.680]   I mean--
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.680]   Every company learns this at the beginning of AOL,
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:50.080]   very back in the early days, they made breast a bad word.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.920]   And the breast cancer community was, of course,
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:53.720]   properly up at arms.
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.680]   Not to mention foster farms.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.600]   Yes.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.480]   How you going to search for chicken?
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.360]   But you can't search for Jeff's penis posts, either.
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.160]   I can't.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.160]   Really?
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:04.680]   Huh.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:05.680]   No, that's a disservice.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.880]   Well, that's bad.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:07.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:19.600]   Let me just search for J-E-F-F, apostrophe S, P-E-N-I.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.520]   Well, I got small penis jokes ignite airport meltdown.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.720]   I got a repeat.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.800]   And it goes blank.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.280]   There you go.
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.920]   Well, I'm so sorry, Jeff.
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.760]   We're going to have-- we're going to have parents kind
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.720]   of looking over the shoulder of kids from across the room
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.120]   going, I see that screen.
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.120]   That's great.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.080]   What are you searching for, kids?
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.400]   What were you thinking?
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.760]   So if I search for B-O-O-B--
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.640]   oh, there it goes.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.400]   Huh.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.920]   It's going to be a new game.
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.000]   Yeah, now we have the new dictionary of don't-o-word.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.760]   The white words will call them.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.760]   White words.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:56.080]   White words.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:56.600]   White words.
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:57.880]   White words.
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.240]   All right, well, I mean, we took 10 minutes.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.400]   We've discussed the whole thing.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.200]   Is there anything more to say?
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:08.520]   Well, I think there's some subtleties to this.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.160]   The thing is that Google has said in the past
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.320]   that 20% of queries at any given time
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.040]   are unique they've never seen before.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.040]   Wow.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:18.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:19.560]   That's--
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.200]   That's a stat that they published several times.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.680]   And I think I can find science.
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.920]   One in five.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:25.720]   Wow.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.840]   Because there's diverse number of things
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.400]   that people type into it, which makes some sense.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.560]   You know, this was always their point
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.040]   about serving the long tail, not just doing the top few
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:34.400]   queries.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.120]   And that was a Google in-depth thing
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.760]   that helped them compete with others.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:39.920]   But this is going to change that,
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.840]   because you're going to get a lot closer to other people's
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:43.840]   queries all the time.
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.400]   This is a subtle effect from that,
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.320]   which is that you're gradually being pushed into the things
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.080]   that other people have searched for before.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.040]   And we've had a bit of that with the autocomplete already.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.000]   But this is going to make that much stronger.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.440]   Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.640]   It sounds like a bad thing.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.080]   It sounds like a bad thing.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.040]   I think it's a bad thing.
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.640]   It's suddenly Google is very normative.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.320]   I read a long post about this last night
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.800]   when I was playing with the Google scribe thing, which we
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.040]   could maybe talk about in a bit.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.040]   Yes.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:07.320]   Yeah.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.280]   But that was like--
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.840]   I'm trying to come up with a search
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.400]   that nobody's ever typed before.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:20.920]   Bad boon frenzy inside my pants.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:23.840]   Nope.
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.160]   See, there's a search.
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.160]   So I'm really--
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.160]   Put that quote.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.160]   Put that quote.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.160]   Oh.
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.160]   All right.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.160]   Let's see.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.160]   I have to pluralize.
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.160]   You probably used to play the game Google--
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.160]   What?
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.160]   Leo, F.E.E.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.160]   Is it or to it?
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.160]   It could be fun.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.160]   F.E.E.
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.160]   Is it or?
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.160]   No results found for bad boon frenzy inside my pants.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.160]   I have found the end of the internet.
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.960]   He is a door of bad boon frenzy.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.160]   It's got to be the first time.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.560]   So-- but I just-- it stuns me.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:49.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.400]   It does not sound credible that one in five searches
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.360]   are something Google's never seen before.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.080]   That's one of the stats that stuck with me because it is
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.080]   heartbreaking.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:01.360]   I mean, what are people searching for that's so bizarre and weird?
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.160]   Well, it's just that language is generative and you can stick words together to make
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:06.720]   a phrase that no one's ever said before.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.120]   Well, you can, but it's usually nonsense.
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.360]   Well, no.
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:14.800]   That's the way that language is structured.
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:15.800]   It isn't.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:16.800]   You have clusters of ideas.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:21.000]   The interesting thing they said in response to that was that when they watch people using
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.760]   it, we were talking about, well, this is going to mean that you don't have to just
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:25.760]   get on the first page.
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:29.000]   You have to get on the first three results for the first two letters.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.040]   But they said, people will keep typing stuff and adding words to try and bring the one
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.040]   they want up to the top.
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.040]   Even if it's like forward down.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.800]   They're going to-- I want that further up.
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.800]   I want that.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.000]   And then move it up the screen.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.320]   I think you raise a really important point on the industry here is that for various reasons,
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.800]   we see the defrocking of the SEO wizards.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:52.720]   And now we see how much more personalized search is.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:56.520]   And so it's hard to say, well, I rose you up 10 stops from Gina.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.680]   You did, but from Mark, Kevin, you didn't.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:00.680]   And also, I think you're right.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.480]   What you just said is that the first page isn't even the issue.
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.800]   The first three listings are the issue.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:07.800]   Right.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.400]   And back to your other point, Leo, about going to all the same.
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.680]   It's not just that you go to the same that everyone else goes to because it's personalized.
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.120]   It's going to go to what I've gone to all the time before.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.720]   And someone in Twitter said to me, well, I don't want to go to what I've gone to before.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.720]   I want to be surprised.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.520]   I want to go to do the thing.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:26.920]   By the way, the chat room is explaining to me why 1 in 5 has never before it's been
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.920]   seen in Google.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.320]   Of course, I should have known this misspellings.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.320]   People are surprised.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.120]   It's a message in a different language.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.120]   Oh, no.
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.120]   I think people are idiots.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.120]   That's really the reason.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.640]   Let me-- and now Google does, of course, the spelling corrections.
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.520]   And these work as well in this instant search.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:50.520]   So if I start typing C-A-L-A, calendar properly spelled is the first item on there.
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:59.120]   So the spelling suggestions have now kind of incorporated into the search results.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:05.720]   It doesn't even say, did you mean calendar?
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.920]   So this is-- I think this is helpful.
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.520]   I'll be very curious.
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:14.600]   Somebody asked Marissa, well, how many people in your testing said they didn't want it?
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.120]   And she said some did, but you could turn it off.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:21.040]   I'd be curious to see what the results are in that regard if a lot of people turn it
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.040]   off or not.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.040]   Hmm.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.040]   What else?
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.040]   You know what's amazing?
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.040]   Justin Bieber has JU.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.040]   That's so damn--
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.280]   Not only does the guy have his own racks at Twitter or on server--
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.280]   Yeah, did you see that?
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.480]   He's got like three or four servers.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.480]   That's a problem if--
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.480]   Oh.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.480]   He's got JU.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.920]   Does he have JU for you, Leo?
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:37.920]   Nope.
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.680]   No, he's number two.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.440]   Somebody's been searching a little too much for Justin Bieber.
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.440]   I don't know what to--
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.440]   Justin Bieber, Justin TV, I get--
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.440]   Yeah, I get Justin TV.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.760]   But JU, excuse me, Justin Bieber.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:50.760]   Interesting.
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.560]   I really don't search for Justin Bieber very much.
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:57.360]   Justin Bieber tattooed, if I-- now that's what I want to see.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.960]   Back in the early days.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.960]   I'm there.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:04.400]   I was one of the Jeffs on the first page, but I can't even find myself now.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.840]   But you make a good point because I was typing in Leo and I chose up-- I show up
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.680]   very well if I'm logged in.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:17.240]   But as soon as I log out, it's that stupid, Deutsch English dictionary, Leo.leo.org that
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.560]   beats me every time.
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:19.920]   You win Leo's space.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.360]   I'm Leo in my own Leo's space.
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.360]   I have a life-- life Leo's top result for Leo.
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.360]   Oh, good.
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.360]   For you?
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.360]   Oh, thank God.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.360]   And Leonardo da Vinci.
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.360]   It's a pretty good company.
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:32.360]   Not Leonardo da Caprio.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:33.360]   It's all he's there to.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.360]   He's a pretty good company, too.
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:37.160]   The TMZ searches are coming through, aren't they?
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.920]   All right, I'm just going to shut up.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:39.920]   I'm going to stop revealing.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.760]   It's revealing, isn't it?
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:42.760]   That's very interesting.
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.760]   It's very revealing.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.520]   I'm reading it to you, so I'm going to shut up now.
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.480]   Leonardo-- I get-- Leo gets me first.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.520]   Then Leonardo da Caprio, Leonard Cohen, Leona Lewis, and Leo LaPorte.
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.960]   But that's pretty good.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:55.960]   And--
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.960]   Leo, I don't-- I get you to get your number five.
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:29:59.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:00.960]   I get normal search.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:01.960]   On the topics, right.
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.280]   If I log out, I will get-- and I type Leo.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.200]   I will be sixth down on the list if I log out.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.440]   So it really is paying quite a bit of attention to your search history, obviously, which
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.440]   I should.
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.840]   I wonder-- now, where does that happen?
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:16.960]   Does Google-- is that happening in the server side or client side?
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.160]   Is Google sending to the browser my search history?
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.920]   I guess it-- no, no, it knows it.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:21.920]   Because it's in the server.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:22.920]   Sure.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:23.920]   Yeah, they have it on the server side.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:24.920]   That's one of the settings.
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.920]   Of course.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:26.920]   It's in the dash.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:28.920]   Because you're doing whatever we're trying to do.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.920]   It's just a feat of engineering right here.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.640]   I mean, not to be a total Google fan girl.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.640]   I mean, I am already.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:36.120]   Sometimes I feel bad about being so far up one company's butt.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.960]   But this is a pretty good butt to be up because this is really amazing.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:40.960]   I mean, this is like a--
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:41.960]   Show title.
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.480]   --feet of engineering.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.600]   What's going on here?
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:48.280]   I mean, I'm starting to just get a little experience with non-trivial data with ThinkUp.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.320]   And it's hard and it's slow.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.520]   It's incredible what they're doing here.
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:55.480]   And we have to-- I want to just acknowledge that.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:00.960]   I mean, what's going on is really kind of amazing at the speed that it is.
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.560]   No, it's very impressive.
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.880]   And they talked about some of what they were doing to do this.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.880]   But yeah, that--
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:10.920]   who we were saying, so we suddenly need to have 20 times as many users to do this.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:13.240]   That's kind of scary.
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:18.520]   But they-- what they said was they-- because you're searching queries that are also completing,
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:20.960]   it propulates the cache more quickly.
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:24.720]   So this goes along with the-- there are a few of unique searches thing as well.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.720]   Give me a guess as to what this must cost Google to implement.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.280]   It's got to be costly, right?
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.400]   I have no idea.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.560]   I never actually knew when I was there.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:32.920]   But--
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:33.920]   Right.
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.440]   You know, the point is that it's increasing the amount of traffic to their data centers
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.000]   quite a lot, yes.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.120]   So it's increasing the number of searches measurably.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:42.880]   Right.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.120]   So yeah, it didn't cost them a fair bit to do that.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:53.080]   But the bulk of that is back-end stuff not traffic, I think.
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.920]   The bulk of the cost is running thousands of machines to respond to every query.
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.600]   Because as I said, most of these queries are different.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.840]   So they won't hit the caches.
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:06.800]   I think what you find with this is that the way caching works is you get a--
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.320]   like an exponential thing for it.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.520]   There's a bunch of common stuff that will always be in the cache.
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:12.760]   And then you get rare and rarestuff that's further out.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.200]   And they always work on optimizing the rarest stuff.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.040]   But this will be some of the stuff that's close to the talk.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.080]   Oh, I see Kevin.
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:25.120]   So the more they force you toward a known, good, non-typo search, the more likely it's
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.080]   cached in a way, the more efficient it can be.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:27.720]   Yes, it might save you.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.960]   It might save the money.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:29.840]   I get it.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.760]   There's still more searches.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.480]   And they said there was a bunch of other cleverness going on.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.040]   But that was the gist of it.
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:40.240]   I also think maybe they're imposing a different deadline.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.480]   Because they have deadline-based--
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:45.800]   to do Google One Boxes and things, they have deadline-based rules that says this box will
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.920]   only appear if you can generate results quickly enough.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:53.360]   So they may impose a shorter deadline for this search and then give you a slightly longer
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:55.160]   deadline for the full search.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:58.480]   Because you've noticed that if you do the auto-complete and then you hit return,
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.760]   it will sometimes change what the first result is.
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:06.320]   But if they can cache 80% of all searches and they can take half of the searches that
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:11.520]   they're getting and move them into that 80%, that should be significantly improved.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:15.000]   I'm not sure it's 80% but, yeah.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   Well, it's one in five.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.320]   Well, yeah, but it depends whether that's one they've never seen before as opposed to
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.320]   they wouldn't necessarily cache.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.320]   They don't cache because we see it rarely.
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.320]   Or the 80% exist.
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.320]   Well, let's say it's half.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.320]   There's a walk across that quite halfway down that.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.320]   Right.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.320]   What's the impact on AdSense?
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.320]   AdWords.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.320]   AdWords.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.320]   That was interesting.
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.320]   So the AdWords still appear.
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.320]   They're still making those show up.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.440]   But some of the impressions may only be fractions of a second.
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:41.400]   And so they said they were going to modify the web dashboard.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:45.240]   It tells you what you're adding when you're buying Ad impressions, what you got.
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:49.480]   And they'll modify that to give you some information about how much time is spent on
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.480]   them.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:55.840]   But as it's paper click, it doesn't actually affect what you pay for your ads and what
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.520]   the Google was representing off and add so much.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:03.080]   If you type in used Carlio, you see stuff locally immediately.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.880]   Now you see.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.080]   And there it is over on the right.
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:07.080]   All the stuff.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.080]   Yeah.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:09.080]   You get the right ones to get the blue ones at the top.
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:14.400]   But if I just now type carriage, is it going to see if it thinks I'm mistyping it?
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.400]   Now it does.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:17.200]   Now it changes to car carriers.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:20.960]   So if I did that fast enough, that might be a split second that I saw the local used
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.960]   car dealers.
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:22.960]   Yes.
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.360]   So presumably they'll be some correct.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.120]   It's not an impression base.
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.560]   It's a CPC base.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.560]   It's clicks.
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:30.560]   Okay.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.120]   It doesn't actually structurally change their model much.
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.120]   That's right.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.120]   That's right.
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:37.560]   But it will change the...
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:44.000]   It will change your measure click through rates if you're getting fleeting impressions
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   that aren't clicked on.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   Right.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.600]   So it may potentially change in that way.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:50.240]   This is stuff they're going to have to work out and understand.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:55.080]   And there's a whole sort of second order group of people who work to try and optimize
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.080]   behavior in this.
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.440]   And they're going to have to learn a whole bunch of new heuristics and tricks on that.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:02.120]   I mean, one thing that we were talking about the personalization thing, I mean, one thing
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:06.240]   that is different is that they now have a much better idea of what you're doing.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:10.040]   Previously they would show the search results and they would instrument some of them to
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.720]   see which one you clicked on.
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:15.240]   So they could do the bounce back test and those kinds of things.
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:19.400]   With this they have a much tighter loop as you're typing, you're pausing, you're typing,
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.800]   you're pausing, and a better sense of what you're doing.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:26.680]   And they're gathering that each character typed and then the arrow keys and whatever's
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:27.680]   going on.
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:33.120]   So they should have a much better metering of each user in that sense, which they don't
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.600]   tend to use individually.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.520]   They will average that out to prove search overall.
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:41.880]   But there is certainly more information going back to them about the search as well.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:45.920]   You want Fast Gena's already published an article on how to get the most out of Google
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:46.920]   incident.
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.760]   Now that's Fast Gena.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:54.120]   We're going to talk about that Google scribe and I'd still want to show that ad, the scary
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:36:01.000]   ad that was up on Times Square every few minutes to terrify you about Google and Eric Schmidt.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.160]   We're going to do all that in just a bit.
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.160]   Kevin Marks is with us.
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:06.120]   He is at the site of the Google event at the Museum of Modern Art.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.120]   Thank you for being here, Kevin.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.280]   We're so glad to have you.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:16.000]   From the Luftan's executive lounge in beautiful Newark, New Jersey, Jeff Jarvis is here and
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.080]   from her bicycle lab, Janet Tappani.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.080]   This is where she repairs the bikes, ladies and gentlemen, and writes the software and
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.640]   the articles.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:28.720]   We're glad you're all here and we want to mention our friends at squarespace.com.
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:31.760]   Squarespace is where amazing websites begin.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:37.600]   It's hosting plus software to make a really great experience for people who want to create
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:38.600]   a website.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:42.720]   If you have an existing site, by the way, you can easily move your Squarespace or your
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.280]   site over to Squarespace.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:49.440]   Especially when I talk to people like Vox users who are being disenfranchised right now as
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.160]   Vox shuts down.
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:57.040]   Yes, six-part will move you over to TypePad, which is not a bad solution, but you might
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.080]   want to look at squarespace.com.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:03.920]   Squarespace.com is I think kind of state of the art modern.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:04.920]   It's more than blogging.
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.480]   It is for any kind of a website.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:12.440]   A lot of photographers use Squarespace because they have got great portfolios and photo albums.
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:18.320]   They have features that are unique to Squarespace, the great iPhone app, the social integration,
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.080]   the stats.
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:23.320]   The most of all, I really like to point people towards the templates.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:28.520]   You start with a great designer template, but the customization is so easy with point
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:32.400]   and click that you can make it look like anything you want.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.800]   That's why no two Squarespace sites look alike.
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.920]   If you go to the examples, you get an idea.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:37.920]   They're all unique.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.120]   They're all beautiful.
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.400]   They just do such a great job.
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:47.480]   Squarespace sites start at $8 a month, but you could try it free for 15 days right now.
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.480]   That's nice.
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.480]   This is called the NYC Grid.
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.240]   Looks like it's a photosite.
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.240]   This is Squarespace.
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:55.320]   They've got Google Maps embedded.
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.320]   They've got photos.
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.080]   They've got a gallery.
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.080]   This is an example.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:03.280]   That's just one of many great Squarespace sites on the examples page.
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:08.120]   If you go to squarespace.com/twig right now, you can get 15 days free.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.040]   You don't even need a credit card.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:16.200]   If you decide to buy, you can start sign up for as little as $8 a month and use the word
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.760]   twig as your promo code.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.680]   You'll save 10% off the life of your site.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.240]   10% off every month.
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.240]   Plenty of bandwidth.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:28.840]   True cloud hosting means if you ever get hit by slash dot or dig with a twit effect,
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:29.920]   you don't have to worry.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.280]   There's bandwidth to spare.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:35.240]   Statistics will let you know where all those hits came from.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.760]   Great content management solutions too.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:42.120]   Because you can use CSS and JavaScript, there's really nothing you can't do with Squarespace.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.120]   Give it a try for yourself.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.800]   You'll see what I mean.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.320]   Squarespace.com/twig.
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:52.280]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.720]   Back to the conversation on Google.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:59.080]   Kevin, you said you were interested in this scribe technology, which now it came out yesterday,
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:03.400]   but now I can see it's got a little bit of the Google instant built into it.
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.400]   Tell us about scribe.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:10.440]   Well, scribe is applying the same kind of also a complete thing, but to you typing.
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:15.800]   So, as you write, it suggests the next word for you to say.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:20.000]   You can hit tab to get the word or you can choose one to five.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.960]   So if you start typing a sentence, it suggests the next thing.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.600]   It's also, are they vacuuming?
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.000]   I think they're cleaning up behind you.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.800]   It's not back in the market.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:29.800]   I'll try to put the mic in place.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:30.800]   That's okay.
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.760]   This is why we know where that sound is coming from.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.840]   You know, it works in Gmail.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:40.680]   You could put a little bookmark in your browser and then when you click it, you'll have it
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.840]   in your Gmail.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:46.880]   I don't know if somebody would actually open this as a word processor exactly.
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.400]   Yeah, I don't think so.
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:52.760]   It works in any text area that bookmark can activate in any text area.
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.560]   I mean, it's fun, right?
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:59.520]   But I don't know that it's exactly something I would use when I'm writing on the web.
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:04.720]   So I think it's what it does and I read a long blog post in this last night.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:13.840]   So I could type eight now and it would jump and fill in baboons in my pants.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:20.120]   And see, even something as weird as that, it kind of knows where I'm going.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:27.720]   So the bookmark let you drag to your toolbar and then anytime you have a text window open
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:33.160]   in Chrome or whatever browser you're using, it looks like I don't know if we've lost
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.800]   Kevin or not.
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:38.920]   It's like I hear his audio, but I don't hear him.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:43.440]   I guess that's they're cleaning up in the Lufthansa lounge as well.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.280]   All right.
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:48.880]   Are you still there, Jeff?
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:49.880]   I'm still here.
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:50.880]   Okay, good.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:53.120]   I'm just going to get Kevin back on real quickly because he was going to talk a little bit
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.880]   about Google Scribe.
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:55.880]   It's a labs feature.
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:58.480]   It's not necessarily something anybody would really want to use.
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.320]   It'll stop the thing that tells you anyway.
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.560]   It's the instant search.
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:02.560]   It's not.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:06.280]   Well, it's the underlying stuff is similar.
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:11.160]   The structural language model is the same idea of auto-completing what you're doing.
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:14.200]   But doing it when you're writing, as opposed to doing it when you're typing a query, is
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:15.200]   a different thing.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.480]   But it has similar problems.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:21.480]   The problem is that I was citing Orwell and Fran and things there is that it makes you
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:22.480]   write cliches.
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.400]   It makes you write something that everyone else has written before.
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:28.400]   It's just like the search makes you search for people of search for before.
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:33.400]   And so part of my worry is that we've got Google running this system over the net to
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:37.760]   try and decide what you're going to say, what your next word is going to be.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:42.840]   At the same time, we've got all the spammers constructing text that is generated by a
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:48.560]   very similar process where they're sitting there writing a machine that looks at what
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:52.000]   people say and then predicts it's trying to make you look human.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.320]   And so we've got this two robots battling over what it means to be human against each
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.320]   other.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:01.160]   And in the middle, we're sitting there going, well, I'm trying to find myself here.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:07.800]   So I'm slightly nervous about that precisely because it has this weird convergence effect
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:12.400]   where of normalizing everything, which is the opposite of what you want to do when you're
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.400]   actually writing.
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:19.440]   You want to be able to bring your...
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:22.320]   Say something that people haven't seen before, to let unique queries.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:25.360]   When you're writing something, you want to come up with the phrase or the expression
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:28.680]   or the idea that hasn't occurred to people before, rather than just repeating the cliches
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:29.800]   over and over again.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.800]   So that...
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:35.320]   Yeah, that's a sort of weird heart, I would have been to worry about.
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.400]   But that was the thing that struck me when I saw that.
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:43.000]   Yeah, you wrote a good blog post actually on it on your blog, a Péasapigni.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.400]   If Google predicts your future, well, it'll be a cliches.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:49.040]   That's a great headline.
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.040]   I love that idea.
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:55.760]   I mean, you really do want to reward the unique turn of phrase over just encouraging people
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.120]   to echo the cliches, right?
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.360]   Yes, exactly.
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:01.680]   I had editors who used to do that.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:04.800]   I remember when I was a People magazine, I said that...
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:09.960]   I can't remember what it was, but my mom was a pot calling the kettle metal and the editor
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:14.800]   wanted to make it black and I said, "No, that's the point."
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:21.400]   You also quote George Orwell, Kevin, in his book Politics of the English Language, in
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:22.480]   which he said, "I love this."
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:27.280]   He talks about modern writing at its worst.
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:32.440]   He says, "Catsists and gummy together long strips of words which have already been set
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:38.480]   or already set in order by someone else and marking the results presentable by sheer humbug."
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:43.320]   I think a lot of...
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:48.600]   I watched my high school age son write and that's exactly the process of an inexperienced
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.120]   or novice writer.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:54.000]   The first thing that jumps into your mind, which is usually a cliches or something you've
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.280]   heard before, is the first thing you write down.
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.800]   I almost came into high speed chase.
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.040]   Yeah, high speed chase, exactly.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.040]   Yes.
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:08.440]   Well, I've read to Michael Frane who wrote this wonderful book, The Tin Man in '65.
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:10.520]   Which was imagining a machine that would do this.
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:15.920]   His thing was constructing newspaper stories about royal occasions and he said, "There
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:20.320]   are all these boilerplate phrases that you just pluck out and stick together to do this."
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:21.320]   One of his...
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:25.360]   He said, "Whenever you see the word fireman in the newspaper, it will be followed by wearing
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.360]   breathing apparatus."
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.960]   It's true.
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:37.240]   Eric Schmidt, when he was speaking at IFA, says, "The next step of search is doing this
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:38.240]   automatically.
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:43.160]   When I walk down the street, I want my smartphone to be in search doing searches constantly.
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.160]   Did you know?
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:45.160]   Did you know?
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:46.160]   Schmidt said."
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.160]   I think...
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.160]   That's not it, it's all annoying.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.160]   I want to throw it out the window.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:54.760]   He says, "This notion of autonomous search to tell me things I didn't know, but I'm probably
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:57.560]   interested in is the next great stage of search."
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:58.560]   Do you agree?
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:44:59.560]   Well, Kevin's gone.
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:00.560]   I'll ask you, Jeff.
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:01.560]   Do you agree?
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:04.480]   To some extent, yeah, but I think you have to turn it on and off.
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:07.680]   You're not going to use it all the time, but when you are walking down the street, I think
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:10.320]   what's happened to our whole idea of facts now?
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:11.320]   Did you know?
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.320]   Did you know?
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:14.040]   Well, but we say that to our friends.
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:15.040]   True.
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:16.040]   We...
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.040]   We...
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:18.040]   True.
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:19.040]   reflexes now to go find out.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.040]   True.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.040]   True.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.040]   That's, I guess, the whole idea of augmented reality browsers.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:23.040]   You're looking at something.
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.040]   Did you know?
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:25.040]   Did you know?
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.040]   Well, he said it's augmented humanity.
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.040]   Oh, dear.
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:31.240]   He said in the talk that man and machine make each other better.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.120]   I mean, it is a little sci-fi.
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.120]   And it does scare people.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.640]   I had a discussion on Twitter today on the word creepy and creepy is just this ridiculous
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:39.800]   word that means nothing.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:40.800]   It's purely emotional.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:41.800]   Right.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.280]   But when they say things like that at Google, it does creep people out.
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:45.520]   Well, you want creepy.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:46.880]   Let's watch this video.
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:48.840]   Oh, boy.
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:54.080]   You can see why I think sometimes people have this visceral reaction to what Google's
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:55.080]   up to.
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:57.960]   Although, I think it is the people who think there are elves in the browser, right?
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:01.120]   And I all that say too, those who watch this remember that this is some reputed to be
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.120]   from an organization that's backed by Microsoft.
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:05.280]   Yeah, that's what we were talking about on Twitter.
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:09.800]   We were trying to figure out why is it the consumer watchdog has such a hard on for Eric
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:13.600]   Schmidt because they really portray him as evil.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.720]   He even has a little Hitler mustache in this thing.
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:18.360]   And it's hosted by Edelman PR's service.
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.080]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:23.760]   And it uses Google Analytics and Google's cookies.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:27.440]   Now that I like.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:34.160]   They showed this ad there was a 15 second version which aired in Times Square over and over
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:35.160]   and over again.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:39.320]   And that's really what bugs me because I think if you and I see this ad, anybody who listens
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:46.560]   to this show sees this ad, we're not too, you know, we know what the threat is and whether
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:47.560]   it's risky.
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:52.320]   But I do worry a little bit about people who don't have much background in the story.
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:55.400]   And I get email all the time from people say, why do you talk about Google so much?
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:57.600]   You're trying to steal my brain.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:59.720]   That's where I'm going to Germany right now to talk about that.
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:02.640]   And they go back duty on Google.
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:04.640]   We're there.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:05.640]   I think it's evil.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:07.640]   Yeah.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.880]   So let me see if I can I could show the 15 second version, but it's so much more fun
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:13.360]   to look at the full length version.
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:17.960]   And let me see if I can get the full body scan working here.
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:22.200]   And I'll play it for you.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:28.320]   This is not the version that shows on Times Square, but it gives you the full idea.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.400]   And it's by the way, it's on YouTube.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.400]   That's even better.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:35.240]   It's an ice cream truck.
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:37.640]   It's a free ice cream.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.320]   That's the evil air cream.
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:41.320]   The ice cream.
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:44.920]   Hi there, boys and girls.
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:48.280]   They should know there's no such thing as a free ice cream.
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:51.760]   Give me a dozen full body scans.
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:52.760]   No evil.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:53.760]   Come on kids.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.200]   Get your ice cream.
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:59.200]   I already know your favorite flavors.
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:04.080]   Now hold still while we collect some of your secrets.
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:08.800]   And if there's anything you don't want anyone to know, well, you shouldn't be doing it in
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:10.280]   the first place.
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:15.680]   So why is consumer watchdog doing this?
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:19.160]   I mean, this is an ad hominem attack against Derek Schmidt.
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:23.200]   They're arguing for the do not follow registry, which of course is also known as trade off
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.200]   cookies.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:25.200]   Yeah.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:48.960]   Do not
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:51.240]   the rose foundation.
[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:53.800]   And I think that's the connection to the Microsoft.
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:57.800]   Well, it's also just the consumer watchdog group, whatever that group is, it's done stuff
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:58.800]   with them as well.
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:02.040]   And well, is there anything wrong with having a do not track registry, a government run,
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:03.040]   do not track registry?
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.360]   Well, I'll talk about that.
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:05.360]   How would that work?
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:06.360]   What does it mean?
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:07.360]   Do not track?
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:08.360]   I can say right now, don't track me.
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:09.560]   I can turn off cookies.
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:12.640]   I can put on the browser window that doesn't have any tracking.
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.040]   You can do it, can't you?
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:15.760]   It's easy to do.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:20.040]   If I'm far more doable than me having to go register somewhere with my name and email
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:26.880]   address, which by the way is what this had once you do is given your name and email address.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.880]   Which I didn't bound to the cookies in the first.
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:31.880]   Yeah, that's kind of weird.
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:35.360]   So yeah, so I think that this idea of, I mean, it sounds good.
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:39.880]   Do not do not call this do not track list, but it doesn't mean anything.
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:46.280]   So it seems to me just pure anti-Google hype.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:57.120]   And if you Google as I have done Rose Foundation, Eric Schmidt, Microsoft, you'll see the Nexus.
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:59.400]   And it's just, it's a little bit convoluted.
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:05.000]   So it's a little hard to try to figure out what's going on, but it sure feels like someone
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.720]   has an axe to grind rather than a legitimate privacy concern.
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:16.760]   Will this add fall on foul ground or are people going to believe it?
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:19.640]   Is it persuasive, Gina?
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:22.400]   It's a little over the top, I think, to be persuasive.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:27.360]   But it does seem to be the story that the media likes and that people like to figure
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:30.280]   out a reason why this is all so scary.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:33.800]   It's the scary future where ever big brothers watching.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:35.240]   But yeah, I don't know.
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:36.240]   That's the first time I've seen it.
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:39.280]   I haven't seen the entire thing, but it seems a little too over the top, I think.
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:42.040]   Is this airing in Times Square at on TV also?
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.040]   Or just on a phone?
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.280]   I don't think they could afford TV time.
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:53.160]   Cecilia Kang writing for The Washington Post says that the person to look at is John Simpson
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:57.320]   who runs, I don't know if he runs Consumer Watchdog.
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.320]   Yeah, I guess he does.
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:02.880]   A 62 year old veteran journalist with a deep suspicion of big business and a mission to
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:08.680]   break up the search giant.
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:12.800]   Simpson lost two jobs during restructurings.
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.920]   Yeah, he works for Consumer Watchdog.
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:19.840]   It's an interesting article.
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:23.680]   Simpson does deny that this is a battle he takes personally.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.520]   You become convinced something is this a quote?
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:27.600]   You become convinced something is wrong with corporate America.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:32.160]   If someone who has loyally worked for 30 years can be thrown out on his ass.
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:37.720]   So it sounds like he maybe is a little upset with losing his job because of Google.
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:39.720]   What am I reader?
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:46.760]   It sent me a link to something called techrights.org which tries to dissect the motive here between
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:51.040]   this grassroots enterprise and grassroots.com and who's after what the history is.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:55.640]   This is an absolute case where you just want some more transparency.
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:52:02.080]   And if Edelman is behind it again, like they were behind the I Love Walmart tour, then
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:05.240]   this does not serve them or their clients well in the long run.
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:10.240]   Simpson was the one who organized the anti-trust press conference with lawyers from Microsoft
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:13.800]   Yahoo! Amazon and other Google competitors.
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:16.520]   He petitioned the Justice Department for an anti-trust investigation.
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:23.920]   So this guy has really got a bone to pick with Google.
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:29.040]   As long as people, my concern is a lot of, for instance, as I said, I get a lot of email,
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:32.840]   especially from the radio show, I should pull one up.
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:38.520]   But for people who really think Google is watching them, who is actively watching them.
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:40.680]   Well, have you seen the one Google more?
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:41.680]   That's the plan.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:42.680]   You've seen that video.
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:43.680]   It's about three years old.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:44.680]   No.
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:45.680]   That one is actually better done than this.
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:48.880]   But it starts out saying this and this and then it goes, and they're part of the CIA
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:52.480]   and they have it and it starts going very tin foil and hush.
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:57.800]   But that one is actually better done than this one, which is just weird.
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:01.400]   Well, I guess we could ignore it then.
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:03.480]   I hope we can ignore it then.
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:06.920]   Well, but it plays into the creepiness factor.
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:13.920]   One of the things that Schmidt said yesterday, again, was that we can do face recognition
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:16.360]   and show you information about people you walk past, but we're not going to do that because
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.160]   it's creepy.
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:20.960]   So where's the creepiness line?
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:23.520]   I'm not sure if that, yeah, where's the creepiness line?
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:26.400]   Does it decreep it to know that they can do that, but they're not sharing it with the
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:27.400]   rest of us?
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:28.400]   Right.
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:30.200]   Yeah, that makes it so much better.
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:31.200]   Right.
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.200]   That's the thing.
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:35.320]   You'd rather they just come forward with what they know and show it to you versus hold
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:38.080]   back so that you don't feel too bad.
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:41.520]   This is the sort of the thing that gets Jeff so wound up about the street view thing, which
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:45.480]   is that it's completely the UK is the case in point where there is a surveillance camera
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:50.440]   on every corner anyway with people watching it or people able to watch it.
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:51.440]   But you can't see that.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:52.440]   Can't see the results there.
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:55.240]   So you don't know, but they drive it.
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:57.720]   People drive it down the street and put it on the internet so that everyone gets up in
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:58.720]   arms.
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:53:59.720]   Right.
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:01.960]   So, you know, there's the David Brin thing here of the Transparent Society, which is
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:06.360]   if you, he's assumption, this was written 15 years ago, is that we will eventually be
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:09.120]   excavating everything and recording everything and uploading everything all the time because
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:10.880]   the technology went that possible.
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:14.040]   So we want to make damn sure that we all get to see it, not just those who already in
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:15.040]   power.
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:17.040]   That's the, you know, absolutely.
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:18.040]   Absolutely.
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:19.200]   That's a good job of that.
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:20.200]   That's pretty obvious.
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:24.080]   I mean, you know, the government surely has face recognition attached to those cameras that
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:26.840]   are watching everything going on on the street.
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:30.800]   And I pointed out on the radio show that you're, if you're worried, don't worry about Google,
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.440]   worry about your internet service provider.
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:36.640]   It's something like Comcast who has almost 100 million subscribers knows far more about
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.040]   you than Google does.
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:42.080]   And they save it all for several years at the behest of the American government.
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:47.400]   So, so the, my biggest problem with this besides the fact that so obviously at hominem is
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:49.440]   it's really misdirection.
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:54.200]   Pay no attention to what's going on with the government and the, and your internet service
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:55.200]   provider.
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:56.200]   Look at Google.
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:57.200]   Aren't they the bad guys?
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:01.400]   And of course Google, nobody's saying we shouldn't pay attention, but it's not.
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:05.560]   I think we saw somewhat the same thing this week and it may be stretching, but I actually
[00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:10.400]   think that the, that the attack on Craigslist for the sex ads.
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:11.400]   Absolutely.
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:14.360]   It is a similar thing where it is the disruptor.
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:15.360]   People are going after the disruptors.
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:17.280]   Old power is going after the disruptors.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.960]   Sex ads are in lots and lots and lots of places.
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:25.440]   And indeed, Dana Boyd wrote a wonderful piece on Huffington Post that said that by taking
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:28.040]   out this disintermediation, you bring back the mediator.
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:29.200]   In this case, it's PIPs.
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:30.200]   Right.
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:34.040]   And it's already happening by the way, and it's spreading throughout the rest of Craigslist.
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:36.960]   So it's not in the adult section anymore, but it's at other places.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:38.560]   It's in the back of every newspaper.
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:39.560]   It's not right.
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:40.560]   Yeah.
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:45.000]   And so, and so why did they go after, why did both government and media go after Craigslist
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.080]   and not go after religious voice and not go after the newspapers and not go after these
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:49.080]   other people?
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:53.720]   Because, because they don't understand why Craigslist exists and how it operates and
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:54.720]   what it is.
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:55.720]   It scares them.
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:56.720]   It scares them.
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:57.720]   It's not a purely profit motivated company.
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:58.720]   Yeah.
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:04.160]   And it's creepy to the old powers.
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:10.440]   There's a Huffington Post also has a article from Melissa Petro, a former sex worker about
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:19.240]   why Craigslist empowered her to do her own thing versus working for a PIP.
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:25.000]   So what you see, I think, in a lot of these cases is from two different sides demonizing
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.160]   the technology disruptors.
[00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:28.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:29.160]   Right.
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:31.360]   From the one side, it's the kind of anti-corporate, anti-capitalist, oh my god, they're making
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:32.360]   money.
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:33.360]   Right.
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:34.360]   And from the other side, it's the, I'm the old guy.
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:36.200]   We used to be my money, we were making.
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:37.200]   Right.
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:38.200]   And now, not making it anymore.
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:39.200]   And I'm going to try to find some way to go after you.
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:40.200]   Yep.
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:41.200]   Well said.
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:43.920]   I don't think that that's a stretch at all.
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:46.000]   I think it's exactly what's happening.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.360]   And it's happening in every area.
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:48.880]   This is the disruption.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:55.400]   This is the, this is the paradigm shift and the old guy old school just fights as hard
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:57:00.680]   as they can and sometimes dirty.
[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:05.520]   Google settled the pros privacy suit, eight and a half million dollars into a fund which
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:11.040]   will be distributed as awards for organizations that focus on internet policy or education.
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:14.040]   Hey, maybe the consumer watchdog can get some of that.
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:17.480]   Well, maybe they give something to Dana and do something to me doing that.
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:18.480]   Give something to Dana.
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:19.480]   That would be worth it.
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:20.780]   Good thinking.
[00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:22.120]   Good thinking.
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:27.560]   So this was the lawsuit bogus as well, saying that buzz violated users privacy.
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:31.880]   Of course, Google fixed it almost immediately within a week.
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:33.380]   And it's.
[00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:34.380]   That one wasn't the Holy bogus.
[00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:36.280]   Don't you stuff happen that absolutely.
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:41.480]   I mean, and Google said so and although I don't know if anybody proved any harm, certainly
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:43.080]   the potential for harm was there.
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:44.560]   That's the question.
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:48.320]   You know, I was with some people last night who are in the ad, the new ad business, the
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:50.200]   new behavioral targeting ad business.
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:54.440]   And one of them said they talked to a regulator in government in Washington and that they really
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:56.200]   are having a hard time finding harm.
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:58:01.920]   Well, there's a lot of fear and there's things to be careful about and protect against.
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:05.380]   But to try to define the harm is actually extremely difficult.
[00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:06.860]   It's a lot of people saying that's creepy.
[00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:08.420]   Okay, but what's the harm?
[00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:09.420]   Right.
[00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:13.140]   And if you just cut out something because it's creepy, well, yeah, a lot of things are creepy
[00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:14.140]   in life.
[00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:17.220]   If we cut out everything that's creepy, you know, a lot of geeks are doomed.
[00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:18.220]   It's like porn.
[00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:20.660]   I don't know what the harm is, but I know it when I see it.
[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:23.060]   You know, it's if I feel bad about it's a, it's this.
[00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:25.060]   I would never see it.
[00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:27.260]   Well, that Pia Zadora though.
[00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:30.020]   She is hot.
[00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:32.020]   People agreed also to make F.
[00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:35.920]   I don't think she was hot at that, but that let's not start talking about that.
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:41.500]   Google agreed to make efforts to better educate buzz users on issues of privacy and the particular
[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:42.760]   privacy that buzz offers.
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:43.840]   I haven't, I don't know.
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:45.480]   I haven't seen anything along those lines.
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:46.800]   I'm not sure what that would look like.
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:49.800]   Maybe a button that says privacy.
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:52.480]   Why it's important.
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:54.800]   Why they settled this because it's eight and a half million.
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:56.720]   It's chicken feed.
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:57.920]   Get it out of their hair.
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:02.200]   They've got bigger fish to fry course, the state's attorney, general are going after
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:05.980]   him over street view and Texas and so forth.
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:07.840]   So they have, they have other lawsuits.
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:11.280]   That's, this doesn't get rid of all of that for sure.
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:15.620]   Anything else you want to tackle before we get to our tip tool and number of the week,
[00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:18.720]   and we could let Kevin go if, if you need to go.
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:19.720]   I'm fine.
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:21.520]   I switched on to the MoMA Wi-Fi.
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:23.360]   They just granted demolishing the set around me.
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:24.880]   Oh, that's great.
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:26.840]   What fun.
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:29.080]   He stayed till the party was over.
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:30.080]   I know.
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:31.080]   Last one to leave.
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:32.080]   Over.
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:35.160]   Well, there's a, there's a event tonight at one more one minute in San Francisco at
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:36.160]   seven as well apparently.
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:37.440]   I thought that was kind of funny.
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:38.720]   They said that at the event.
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:40.600]   And if you want to know more, we're going to have a little meet up.
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:42.960]   Come on and talk to us.
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:44.120]   Wow.
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:47.720]   I don't think Apple, I don't think Steve Jobs would go to a big meet up to talk about
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:50.200]   the new iPods after the event.
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:51.200]   Wow.
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:54.600]   Now, how many people were at this press event, Kevin?
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:56.360]   Was it pretty well attended?
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:59.280]   Yeah, it was about probably three, four hundred.
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:00.280]   That's good.
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:01.280]   I'm guessing from the size of the room.
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:03.280]   That's an apple size, apple size attendant.
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:04.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:07.920]   And I guess it's open to the public this minute event, right?
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:08.920]   Wasn't clear.
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:10.400]   It really wasn't clear.
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:11.400]   So we'll see.
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.080]   It was open to everybody who watched the stream.
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:15.040]   It's not a very big, it's not a very big venue.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:16.040]   You're right.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.040]   Yeah.
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:20.040]   Have we, did we talk about priority mail last week?
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.280]   I guess we did.
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.280]   We did.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.280]   I watched it.
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:24.280]   I loved, no, I probably got it.
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:25.280]   And boy is it great.
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.280]   I love it so much.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.200]   I moved off of my iMac service, Fast Mail.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.200]   And I've moved to Gmail.
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.000]   I have all my mail going to Gmail now.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   It's great.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   Yes.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   Right.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   Wow, Leo.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.400]   That's a big move for you.
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.400]   It's huge.
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:39.400]   What is this?
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.400]   How long has it been?
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.400]   A couple of three days.
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:42.400]   It's a little disorienting.
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.400]   What's that?
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:48.760]   And when I, by the way, I'm going back through all of Gina's old articles on how to use
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.640]   Gmail better.
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.200]   Thank God for the internet.
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.200]   Nice.
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:56.560]   Finally, I'm reading your, your, your articles about that.
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.560]   One of...
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:58.560]   JK.
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:00:59.560]   JK.
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.920]   I got JK and I got left bracket, right bracket.
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:02.920]   Nice.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:07.480]   It's taken me a while to understand the metaphors different from a desktop client, the idea
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:11.480]   of archive, inbox, yeah, yeah, filters, labels.
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:13.760]   You used to searching.
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:15.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:16.760]   It's very different.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:21.040]   But, but you know, there are now, and analogs for everything that I did with Apple Mail.
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:27.000]   I'm still, I'm still having, maybe this is a crutch, but I'm still having my fast mail
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.760]   download it all and still sieve it and still getting it through Apple Mail.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:34.960]   So, you know, it doesn't look so different on Apple Mail.
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:37.280]   It's, it's, it's good.
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.280]   I like it.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.440]   I'm starting to get the keystrokes.
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:43.880]   What are the keystrokes that we need to do for a Google instant within that fast company
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:44.880]   article?
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:45.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:49.680]   So, tab to autocomplete the next word that's suggested.
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:50.680]   Oh, okay.
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:52.560]   Up and down to move through the dropdown.
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:53.720]   You knew that already.
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:57.360]   The only, the only shortcut I found that they didn't mention during the stream was right
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:59.480]   arrow will launch the unfeeling lucky.
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:03.640]   So if you see the top result is what you want, like if you type twit.tv, you can just hit
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:06.640]   right, right arrow and I'll shoot you right over to twit.tv.
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.640]   Okay.
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:08.640]   That's good.
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.760]   So that was, that was kind of the only one that I discovered.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.000]   Kevin, have you found any other new ones?
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.200]   No, I've known you from those ones, yeah.
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:17.640]   So if you, if you go down and then hit right, it'll send you.
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:18.640]   Yeah.
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:19.640]   Cool.
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:24.600]   So, I think I probably better get on board.
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:28.200]   Get your plane, Mr. Jeff Jarvis, but give us a number before you go.
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:29.200]   I was pretty excited.
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.200]   I got kind of escaped that.
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:31.200]   I lost it actually.
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.200]   I had one.
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:35.000]   I can't find it.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.760]   You know, CNN says senior moments happen more to men than they do to women.
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:39.960]   I don't need senior moments anymore.
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:40.960]   I have Google.
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:43.520]   Jeff, have a safe flight.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.200]   My brain knows where I am.
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:46.200]   It knows what I want.
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:47.760]   It knows what I think.
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:49.520]   Who needs anything more?
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:56.240]   Tell the Greens that you tell those Greens that I will take care of Google.com and we'll
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.240]   type in Twit number.
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:03.880]   I think I think one billion a week should be the number versus white.
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:04.880]   It's white.
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:05.880]   Twit is white.
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.520]   No, no, no.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:10.320]   So one billion, one billion what a week searches.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:16.400]   One billion uses a week compared to half a billion for Facebook a month, a billion a
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.400]   week.
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.200]   That's a good number.
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.200]   Jeff safe travels.
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:25.360]   Jeff Jivers blogs at buzzmachine.com is the author of What Would Google Do?
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:26.560]   I have it right here.
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:28.560]   I never put it down.
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:31.400]   What would Google do?
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:32.400]   Very cool.
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.840]   And I guess Gina in a way you've already done your tip unless you have another one that
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:35.840]   you'd like to lay off.
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.520]   I have one other.
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:40.640]   This is from Kevin Purdy at Life Hacker.
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:43.760]   The priority inbox is really awesome, but you can only get it in the browser so you don't
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:45.760]   get it in your on your mobile device.
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:50.240]   It introduces this what the reserved label important.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:56.760]   So if you just if you do a search for label important in inbox, you can bookmark that search
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:01.640]   on your phone, whatever phone it is, and check your priority inbox that way.
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:07.080]   So and that also works in the Gmail Android client, but you can't save searches there.
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:08.920]   So it's a little hard to get the type that whole thing out.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.400]   So that's a little annoying.
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:14.920]   But you can see your priority prioritized messages using that using that search label
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.480]   important in inbox.
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:18.680]   And I find as I use it and I tell it, this is important.
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:21.600]   This isn't it gets smarter and smarter and more and more useful.
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:23.960]   It's really it's almost like a new metaphor for email.
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:24.960]   I really like it.
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:25.960]   Yep.
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:26.960]   Yep.
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:27.960]   It's pretty great.
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:28.960]   Yeah.
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:29.960]   I do got it.
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:30.960]   Yeah.
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:31.960]   I got it actually almost right away.
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:32.960]   It was it was real.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:35.640]   The fact that you switched to Gmail is kind of a big deal.
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:37.760]   It made you try it out for real.
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:38.760]   I fought it.
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:39.760]   I fought it for years.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:42.560]   I got a multiple Gmail accounts, but it wasn't my main.
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:44.560]   It wasn't where Leo at Leoville.com goes.
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.560]   Now it's where Leo at Leoville.com goes.
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:48.640]   And all my other addresses.
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:49.640]   A couple of tips.
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:53.800]   One is now you can sign up for Google with Open ID, which means you can use your Yahoo
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:59.080]   account to sign up for Google, which is weird, which is a weird recursive like I'm
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:00.800]   just sign up for Google with Yahoo.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:03.040]   But love that they're supporting Open ID.
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:04.040]   I think it's.
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.040]   Yes.
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.040]   Yahoo is the example.
[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:09.320]   In fact, it's great because it just shows how open Google is.
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:12.840]   And the support for Open standards from Google is, oh, it's one of the reasons I supported
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:17.560]   Buzz and I support Google in general is that they always seem to opt for Open standards
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:18.560]   when they can.
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:20.800]   And I know that you're a lot of the reason behind that, Kevin.
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:25.680]   Well, I'm not sure I'm I'm that was the culture that they had before I got there.
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:29.160]   And I helped encourage some of the some of that group to reach out more.
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:32.000]   But it's it's that is good to see.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.720]   I'm hoping they'll do it more generally using web finger, which would mean that you can do
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:39.000]   with any site, not just the ones that have got open ID.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.240]   And that's something that's been working.
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:45.640]   There's a whole bunch of these authorization models that people are working on to to to
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:46.640]   make the stuff easier.
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:48.040]   There's there's a realm of me off.
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:52.240]   If you know that heard of that one, that's Tantex putting that to us today.
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:55.040]   You owe to log into sites.
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:58.720]   So if I can I can log into his site by putting my blog name in because I have a link to
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:01.080]   Twitter, he was the Twitter author login.
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:05.560]   So there's there's a bunch of thinking going on to make this stuff easier and more useful
[01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:08.720]   as part of the problem we've had with open ID is that has been a bit complicated and
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:16.360]   oh, authors been been showing up as as an easier model for doing combined authentication
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:17.880]   and authorization.
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:22.000]   So not just letting you log in, but giving you access to certain things as well.
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.560]   So being able to log in with Twitter has been a powerful part of that.
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:28.480]   So the iteration going at the moment is to try and make that general.
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:32.640]   So it's not just one particular site and to have similar APIs between the sites so that
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.520]   you can get the same kinds of data out of it.
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:39.920]   But this is that certainly the Google Yahoo thing is a definite moving right direction.
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:44.320]   Yeah, I want to find out more about this finger thing at some point.
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:45.320]   Web finger.
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:46.320]   Web finger.
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:48.280]   You've touched on it before so to speak.
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:52.200]   But at some point, let's spend some more time talking about that.
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:56.920]   My tool of the week is actually has to do with Gmail and this new Google voice and Gmail
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:00.960]   and something that you know, I'm sure Gina, all the people who are watching probably know
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:01.960]   this.
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:02.960]   But it was a revelation to me.
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.120]   I use Google voice.
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.120]   I use it religiously.
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.520]   I use it on my Android phone.
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:07.520]   It's just fantastic.
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:11.720]   And of course you could set up Google voice to ring all your numbers.
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:17.280]   And you can also set up Google voice to ring Google chat.
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:23.280]   And what's happened to me all of a sudden is now I'm sitting in Gmail and when my phone,
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:28.360]   I can notice this the other day, my phone rang on my three different cell phones on the
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:29.360]   desk.
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:31.960]   But it also rang in my browser.
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:37.480]   And I picked up the phone in my browser and I talked in my browser and the quality was
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.480]   great.
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:39.480]   I didn't have to hold anything in my face.
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:41.360]   I didn't have to leave my computer.
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:42.360]   This is fantastic.
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:44.880]   Welcome to the future.
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:50.320]   And you know, that was the kind of mini epiphany I had is, well, wow, this really is
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:59.720]   integration because now all my communications, SMS, chat, mail and phone are in this one browser
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:00.720]   window.
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:04.480]   And I figured out, well, you know, I should just keep that window.
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:05.640]   It should just be a permanent window.
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:07.880]   It should be my desktop, shouldn't it?
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:11.280]   Can you write an article about how to make Gmail your desktop?
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:12.280]   That's it.
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:14.480]   Just, yeah, just affix it to your desktops.
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:15.480]   That's what I want.
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:18.040]   Go on to ask phone calls.
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.000]   I am email.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.840]   It also made Chromium make a little bit more sense because now I can see, well, maybe
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:27.760]   you do really want to live in Chromium on a tablet or a netbook.
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:30.560]   If really all of your, it becomes your communicator.
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:35.720]   And I immediately went to my netbook to see if Linux, well, they're moving the chains,
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:36.880]   aren't they?
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:43.240]   See if Linux supported the Google voice calling and it's not great.
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:44.240]   It does.
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:47.120]   There's a plug in for it, but I couldn't really to get it working on a netbook, which
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:48.120]   is too bad.
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.400]   I think the drivers weren't working or something like that.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:51.960]   But very, very cool.
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:59.040]   And I have to say, Gmail now is my kind of my always open page because it's all the communications
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:00.040]   that I do.
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:01.040]   Okay.
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.800]   Well, they're chaining up Kevin Marks.
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.600]   So we, oh wait, but those are the baboons in my pants.
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:07.600]   I'm sorry.
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:10.160]   Kevin, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:13.440]   Kevin's at rivet.com for British telecom.
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:15.920]   We're so glad you wanted to be on and right from me.
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:18.040]   Making things, bringing the browser is something we've been doing for a while.
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:19.680]   So it's, yeah, it's good to do it.
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:20.680]   It's not new.
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:21.680]   Is it?
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:22.880]   Yeah, I just love that idea.
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:26.200]   I don't use, I don't need a phone when I'm on my computer.
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:27.200]   It's amazing.
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:29.000]   I started making calls that way now.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.120]   It was great.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.320]   My son said, where are you calling from?
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:33.320]   My browser.
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:36.840]   I'm telling you for my browser.
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:40.200]   Gina Trapani is a blogger at smarterwear.org.
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:41.480]   She writes for Fast Company.

[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:53.240]   Awesome.
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:54.240]   Awesome.
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:55.240]   So that in time of the show.
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:56.240]   Yeah.

[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:20.400]   Stay tuned.
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:22.400]   Tech news today is coming up next with Tom Merritt.
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:23.400]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.440]   On behalf of Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis, Kevin Marks.
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:26.600]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:30.240]   We'll see you next time on this week in Google.
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:38.680]   I'm going to start and stop my video.
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:39.680]   I want you to.
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:40.680]   Oh, who's that?
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:41.680]   Colleen!
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:42.680]   Colleen!
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:43.680]   Colleen!
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:44.680]   It's Colleen!
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:45.680]   I recognize her.
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:46.680]   Oh, that's awesome.
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:49.680]   I'm wearing the shirt that Colleen gave me.
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:50.680]   Yay!
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:51.680]   Oh, I love my English.
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:52.680]   I love my English.
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:53.680]   I love my English.
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:54.680]   Oh my God.
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:55.680]   That's great.
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:57.800]   So of course Colleen streams these events.
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:00.560]   So when you're watching a Google stream, you're watching Colleen.
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:04.560]   I'm so glad she does because I couldn't fly out there.
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:06.520]   I'm really glad they do it.
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:11.040]   Colleen, do you know if the license is allow allow us to restream because we did.
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.040]   Absolutely no idea.
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:15.720]   But the thing is, I just wanted to add certain times to make sure that other people can see
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:19.960]   the streams and luckily you were providing a stream of somebody watching the stream.
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:21.880]   So you knew it came in beautifully.
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:25.520]   Google's we've always had great results with the Google streams.
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:27.640]   So is that kind of what you do?
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:29.720]   You manage those things?
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:34.800]   One of my many responsibilities is basically Google produced content.
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.880]   It's mostly like internal corporate communication stuff.
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:40.520]   When there's big external events, I make sure that they work correctly too.
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:43.280]   And then I'm working on some other fun stuff on the side.
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:47.240]   Are you actually doing switching and things or are you just supervising?
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:51.600]   So for events like this and for the stuff that's done in the Mountain View campus, they
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:55.760]   actually have a crew where they have a dedicated switching person and dedicated camera person
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.800]   and dedicated audio person.
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:04.240]   And for smaller events, I'm exploring other options.
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:05.240]   Cool.
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:06.240]   That's neat.
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:08.240]   Maybe if we just automated all of it though.
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.240]   All right.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.240]   Love to hear about that when you do.
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.080]   Then I can fire all these people.
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:13.080]   Fire.
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:14.480]   No, no, no, I'm kidding.
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:15.720]   Just kidding.
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:19.400]   All right, so we have thank you very much, Kevin, for letting Colleen pop in there.
