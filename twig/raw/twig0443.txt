[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   It's time for Twig this week in Google Jeff Jarvis, Stacey Higginbotham.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.840]   They're both here. We'll talk about Google's quarterly results.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.280]   How could Google? Google lose money. I don't know.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.080]   Why Nest is now a part of Google instead of an independent alphabet subsidiary,
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.200]   and we visit the star man on his way to Mars. It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.800]   NetCasts you love. From people you trust.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.240]   This is Twig.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:42.240]   Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by CashFly, C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:54.080]   This is Twig, this week in Google, Episode 443, recorded Wednesday, February 7th, 2018,
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.080]   Made on Earth by Humans. This week in Google is brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quick

[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:35.600]   It's time for Twig! This week in Google, a show where we cover not just Google-ish,
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:43.280]   but Facebook-y, Twitter-i, and that kind of thing. Stacey Higginbotham's here. She is an IoT
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.720]   maven, so we also cover a lot of IoT with Stacey. Stacey on IoT.com. Hello Stacey!
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.960]   Thank you for agreeing to appear on our panel at Southby. Yes, March 9th.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.280]   March 9th. Very early in the morning. Yeah, well, you know, that way you have the rest of the day.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.640]   Oh, yes. That's... You can drive your daughter to school and come to the panel and then have
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.680]   the rest of the day to enjoy Southby. Yeah, it's the first day of interactive, and we'll be at
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.400]   Antones, the Capital One House, and we're going to have a panel on security,
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:28.400]   and we've got some interesting guests to be announced, but Stacey's number one in my list.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.120]   Thank you, Stacey, for doing that. I appreciate it. I can teach everyone how not to be secure.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.280]   Put a lot of connected gadgets in your house. Yeah, really. You can come to Antones, I think,
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.480]   we'll be starting around 8.30 a.m. or 9. So come to Antones in the morning. We'll have breakfast
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.760]   for you. You can have something to eat and see that before the festivities of Southby, really.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.040]   Also with us, Mr. Jeff Jarvis, he is from the City University of New York. He teaches journalism
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.200]   there, CUNY. He's actually more than just teaching. He is leading the CUNY graduate program in
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.200]   journalism. No, no, no, no, no, no. Leading. I got a boss. I got a boss. Yeah, everybody's got a boss.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.440]   As I was once told, there's always a man. There's a decent...
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.360]   There's always a man. My boss is a woman. Yeah. Well, you're a woman's the man.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.520]   So confusing, but true. Yeah, I'm not. And meanwhile...
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.160]   No, I mean the man as a concept. Not a man.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.120]   And we have Mr. Rogers as our host today. What?
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.120]   The sweater, kind of, Mr. Rogers. It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood. Hello, everybody.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.120]   I am Fred Rogers, and I'm here to do the show. A big story breaking moments ago. Well,
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.800]   an hour ago, that's moments ago, Nest is done as a corona mottio at Ars Technica as a standalone
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.800]   alphabet company. It's merging with Google. How do you think Stacey, this is your beat?
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.440]   How do you think that changes what Nest's up to and why would they do it?
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.600]   I think this is a face-saving effort. So, you know, 2014, they bought Nest for $3.2 billion.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.520]   That's a lot of money. And so far, according to... I've seen it, they did an interview,
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:15.440]   Nest has only sold 11 million devices. So... And not making their money back, that's for sure.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.720]   Not a lot. Yeah. And so the idea, they're spitting this as, "Oh, we're going to be closer to Google.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.800]   We're going to have access to their AI. And this is going to allow us to better compete with Amazon,
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:32.560]   Echo, and I guess HomePod." But this really is just a face-saving thing. They had access to
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.880]   Google's AI chops. Nest Cam has had that in it for a couple months. They've been putting Google
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:48.560]   Assistant on Nest Cam. So, my hope is that if they do this, they will help Nest maybe launch
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.960]   cheaper products because that's one of the things holding Nest back. And then, too,
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.600]   somebody brought up, and this is a really good question, they were like, "So, when Google bought
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.840]   Nest, we really cared about what was going to happen to our data." And Google said, "We're not
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.960]   touching it. So, what is this?" Oh, that's why they kept it separate.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.720]   Well, it's one of the reasons. But I emailed Nest, and here's what they said.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:17.040]   Ta-da. This is from Matt Plagel, who's an S spokesman. Nest users' data will continue to be
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.400]   used for the limited purposes described in their privacy statements, like providing developing,
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.640]   providing, developing, and improving Nest services and products. But here it comes,
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.360]   as we develop future plans and future product integrations, we will be transparent with users
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.920]   about the benefits of those integrations, any changes to the handling of data,
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.040]   and the choices available to consumers in connection with those changes.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.160]   So, basically--
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.880]   Where do you think that will mount?
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.280]   --that I am at D.O.S.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.200]   Where do you think it will mount?
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:49.600]   I think you could do things like, if they have access to who's home and data from the Nest
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:56.080]   thermostat, for example, you can-- already, you have to manually link that to your Google Assistant.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.240]   It's possible that one day it could just show up naturally. It just kind of gets eaten up into
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.960]   the Google services and happens automatically without you opting in, if that makes sense.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.400]   And then with the desk security system, they're going to have a lot of information about coming
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.360]   and going. And that might actually be good, because one of the big challenges with the smart home
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.880]   today is there's not a lot of context about who's in the home and where they are in the home,
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.760]   so presence in the home. So, this could help with that.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:31.360]   It's not merely the cost of buying Nest. They had virtually unlimited funds,
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:38.160]   a huge influx of resources, Ron describes it. It quadrupled employee head count, it bought Dropcam.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:44.320]   Google bought Dropcam, but they started the deal for Dropcam before Nest was bought.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.520]   But they merged it on that cam.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.760]   Yeah, I don't think they were happy about that.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.480]   Yeah, Tony Fidell left two years after the Dropcam acquisition.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.360]   And at that point, they had two products. They had the Nest thermostat and the Dropcam,
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:03.120]   actually rebranded as the Nestcam. Since they've added under their new CEO,
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:10.080]   one-on-one, they've added the security system, the $300 Nestcam IQ, which I bought and used
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:20.320]   call me a doofus. And it's right behind me. And now I saw it on the Super Bowl, a Nestad for
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:26.240]   Doorbell, which they also had actually a smoke detector. I don't know if you remember that.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.920]   Oh, yeah. The one you waved at it and it disabled it permanently. Yeah, that was good.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.360]   That was useful. In case, while your house was on fire, they fixed it.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.680]   Yeah, when you hear a sound from the smoke detector, wave at it, we won't bother. We just won't bother
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:43.200]   you again. So, they fixed that, by the way. That was an easy firmware fix.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.440]   Hardware software and services will be combined according to Google,
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.320]   all built with Google's artificial intelligence and assistant at the core.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:58.880]   I guess this makes sense. I mean, according to the journal, they'd already combined their
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.920]   supply chain teams two years ago. Oh, well, then they're not going to lower prices. Dang it.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.400]   No benefit to that. Yeah.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:13.840]   What do you think of the Nest products as put your reviewer wig on? What?
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.840]   This is my reviewer. I know. Okay. She's already got it on.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:27.280]   What do you think of their products? I mean, you did call me, I do remember a doofus for buying
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.880]   the IQ. I think you wanted me to buy the lighthouse instead, which I ended up doing,
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:36.240]   and they became a sponsor actually. So, that worked out. I think they have
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:42.160]   they're good products. They're just expensive. You can get very similar products for less.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.840]   And so that's always been the key. We were all in on drop cam when it was still an independent
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.800]   company. We had dropped. We still have a bunch of drop cams all over the place.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.240]   Yeah, but the drop cam started out not crazy expensive. Oh, it's cheap.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:59.600]   You know what's expensive and all of these? And I had never really thought about it until we set
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:05.840]   them up is the bandwidth. Oh, yeah. Yeah. If you set them in HD mode, anything that's always on
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.880]   is going to consume a megabyte, a second all the time. And so you really don't want an
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.360]   always on camera. You want a camera that wakes up sometimes. But but all the nest stuff,
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:21.520]   I think you can because I know because I could scroll back in time for my nest cameras.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:27.920]   And a lot of people like that because the motion detection doesn't always catch things in time
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:34.560]   and restart recording in time on cameras. So I had somebody who was like, oh, the Arlo's are
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:40.720]   terrible because they didn't catch a burglar. But my nest cam did. And so there's trade-offs.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.160]   Now the challenge, what we should be hacked off about are bandwidth caps.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.000]   That's true. If I didn't have a place are anger in the right place.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.200]   But I routinely go over my two or three. No, I have two terabyte a month bandwidth cap from
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:01.680]   Comcast on. So I actually have a second network, which is good for security anyway, for the cameras
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.240]   because bandwidth is, you know, they're just they just eat up bandwidth. On the other hand,
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:11.760]   I do I have to say I do like always on. You're right because what I frequently do with it is
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:16.400]   go back in time. By the way, that's good also for the company because you have to pay for storage.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.960]   That's they're going to get you a month not only to get the $300 for the camera,
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:26.080]   but they're going to get a monthly fee as you record like, here's here's my driveway. I can see,
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:32.000]   you know, what's going on. Somebody's stealing my car right now. So it's kind of fun though to be
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.560]   able to scroll back through this. And this is what always on gives you is this ability.
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.520]   I said what Oh, I guess nothing's happening.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:46.560]   No, no, there's it's not doing it. Well, anyway, you can scroll back in time. Oh, I see here it is.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:54.000]   Yeah, it's slow. Again, that's more my bandwidth issue than than the next cameras.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.160]   Again, anger at Comcast. Yeah, nothing but.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:07.120]   All right, so. It's not going to change how they do business. It's really more. It's a
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:13.200]   financial thing. It's a it's a it's a it's just a logistical thing. I mean, they're just like fine.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.520]   You guys, you're not you're not doing it. Come back in. Otherwise, the other option was they
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:22.240]   were going to sell them. Does it mean Ruth Porret now starts paying closer attention to what's going
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.800]   on? I think she's probably been paying close attention to those other bets for a while.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.920]   So who's in charge of hardware at Ric Osterlo?
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.560]   At this. Ruth's important to Ric Osterlo is now in charge.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.120]   For all.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:39.280]   In Mar one, Mar one was the CEO. Mar one for was was the CEO of Nest. And now he reports to
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.840]   Ric Osterlo. Ric Ocassie, which we don't mind, right? We like Rick. Yeah, Rick's good.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:48.800]   And both Rick and Mar one have telco type backgrounds. So,
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:54.480]   yeah, he came from Motorola. He was the guy who introduced the Motorola X, the Moto X,
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.080]   which I really liked. Yes, we all did.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:04.560]   Another acquisition, which just broke. Well, yesterday. Right before the show.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:10.640]   Well, yesterday. Oh, no, you're right. 653 Pacific. So this morning, VidCon, this is from
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:15.680]   Variety announces the acquisition via common, announces the acquisition of VidCon. That's the
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:22.800]   conference where all the YouTube stars get screaming crazy, mad fans. Jeff, you go every year to
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.400]   VidCon. I go every year. It changed my view of media. It's really a cool conference.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.440]   It's the Flog brothers that own it, right? John and Hank Green.
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.200]   John and Hank Green. And so there's a little Jim Lauterback, our old friend from
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.600]   Pont of History and Jim, of course, his tech TV. My colleagues.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:43.760]   He was running the industry track there at VidCon and I'm on the advisory board for that
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:49.280]   industry track. And then he took over CEO. And I think probably to do this.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.840]   How much money do you think the via-compaid for this?
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:13:00.400]   So it's a good enterprise. They get 30,000 people in Anaheim. I think 40,000 people now
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:07.120]   internationally. 80, 80 sponsors, 45 exhibitors. Now, that's not a CES size by any means.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:14.880]   No, but that's good. It's very good. It's very healthy. I'm sure there's a metric like $10 per
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:20.720]   attendee or something. It's got to be more than that. And I think probably if via-coms buying it,
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:25.040]   it's not just to continue business as usual. They must have plans for the brand.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:32.080]   I would imagine there could be shows. Obviously, the Green one was on video.
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.440]   Yes, they want to do a Comic-Con style expansion, right?
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.320]   Oh my God. My daughter would pay so much money.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.440]   YouTube, it'd be like ice capades, right?
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.200]   Ice capades would tour around with the most recent skating stars.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.520]   There'll be a VidCon Capades.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.840]   There's something about being in the one place.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:58.480]   When they went to Europe, Europe's really going to be pretty much business business.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.160]   Yeah, but VidCon Austin, we've got at least one person going.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.840]   And VidCon Australia got a lot of people out.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:13.120]   The adult companion. Hank Green will apparently be continued to be evolved.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:19.440]   Isn't he the author too though? Did he write the best-sellers, turtles, all the way down.
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.760]   John, his brother wrote that. But then Hank just put it out a novel as well.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:28.240]   They've got the blog brothers, they've got all their educational efforts,
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.000]   they've got all their other things that they do on their own.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.560]   And so that'll obviously continue on their own. I don't understand.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:43.920]   How do you be a best-selling novelist and run a video convention and run this vlog business?
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:49.600]   How? How? It's all I can do to get my clothes on in the morning and come in here.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.400]   I think when you're young, you have a lot of energy.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.040]   Are they young? I guess so. A lot younger.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:00.400]   No one you add to this one because John's latest novel, which I read,
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.600]   which is very good, is about having OCD, severe OCD.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:07.520]   And you think about that burden on top of everything else.
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.400]   So he is OCD. Yes. He talks about this.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:14.960]   Well, apparently he's going to stay with the novels.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.400]   Yes, everybody loves them.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:22.000]   I love them both. They're really quite something and very generous with their fans.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.440]   And my daughter is a big fan of both. She has her autographed bobblehead,
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.600]   Green Brothers dolls. So they are YouTube stars in their own right.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.600]   Oh, absolutely. Interesting.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.880]   And authors. Well, I mean, the YouTube stuff they do, they do the vlog brothers,
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.400]   which is just them talking. Then they have the educational series that they do,
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.680]   which are pretty amazing. What are they called? Stacy? You mentioned that before. I forget suddenly.
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:48.400]   I have? Yeah, I thought you had. I thought your daughter said, "Oh, maybe not."
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.160]   I'm like in, I don't know.
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.800]   Let's see. The most recent post is called "Soddust Bread" in which John discusses the
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.720]   quality of 18th century French bread in the nearness of history.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.640]   Oh, I have, I've referenced these. I didn't realize that.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.640]   Yes, the crash course. They did crash course.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.560]   John does more history and Hank does more science, put together.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.600]   It's a place, you know, where like YouTube videos go.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.760]   Here on this particular YouTube channel, my brother and I.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.320]   Oh, they are, yeah.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.080]   There's two years teaching courses in quick 10 to 15 minute episodes.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.200]   John has taught world history, American history, and some literature.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.160]   Well, Hank has taught biology, ecology, and general chemistry.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:30.000]   Now, when people ask us why we do this and how we want these things to be used,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.240]   we don't really have a coherent answer. We're just trying to create educational content
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.000]   in the hopes that it will be useful to people.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.520]   That's pretty altruistic.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.880]   And now in 2014, we're teaching new subjects. Thank you, teaching psychology.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.680]   Do they have ads?
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.280]   Literature and expanding upon this topic.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.000]   Oh, I should not.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.240]   Well, let's see here.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.200]   Here's-
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.400]   They can make money. They can make it into YouTube money.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.360]   They can, YouTube ads.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.320]   Of course, they're sure.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.120]   They can get YouTube.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.120]   Oh, I'm YouTube red, so I would never know.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.160]   That's right.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:56.160]   Right.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:56.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.040]   Right.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.120]   Yeah, I don't get to see the-
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.880]   So they make money on this.
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.480]   But I'm sure they make more money on the novel, or Hank makes more money on the novels.
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.200]   And John-
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.240]   You're a licensed to get to movies.
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:08.720]   Movies and-
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.680]   Yeah.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:13.840]   But there's also the merch when you go to VidCon.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:14.560]   Don't forget to be-
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.120]   I am being very crass.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.880]   Of course, who cares if they make money?
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.320]   They're doing wonderful things.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:24.160]   Well, you have to make money even-
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.160]   You have to do wonderful things.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:26.720]   Oh, so wonderful.
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.680]   You have to have money.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.040]   But they don't have to make a lot of money if they're just doing wonderful things.
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:35.120]   Well, the other weird thing is that Hank's and Missoula and John's in Indianapolis.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.320]   Oh, wow.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.360]   That way.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.400]   Wow.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.520]   I didn't know that.
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.000]   Interesting.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.440]   And then-
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.040]   But VidCon's in LA.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.760]   Laughterbacks up here in Half Moon Bay unless he moves.
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:46.080]   Right.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.760]   VidCon is just in LA when it's there.
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.760]   Interesting.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.280]   Yeah, I could-
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:51.920]   You know what I-
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.920]   I'm going to channel Viacom.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.840]   I think what Viacom's thinking is
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.960]   Comic-Con knows how Comic-Con is really
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.480]   branched out all over the world and making a lot of money.
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.400]   There was even a Comic-Con channel,
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.680]   Lionsgate did a $5 a month Comic-Con channel.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.320]   I'm sure Viacom's thinking right down those lines.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:10.960]   Yeah, events.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.200]   And they have other events that won't be in the events business.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.440]   And the events business is a great hedge against pure advertising and pure content.
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.360]   But it's not scalable.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.320]   And that's the challenge.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.640]   Everybody always said we should-
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.680]   Twitch should do events.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.640]   And I just-
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.480]   Again, it's all I can do to get up in the morning.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.200]   So-
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.480]   Highly profitable.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:28.960]   Is it-
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:29.440]   It's probably-
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:29.840]   Yeah, you-
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.200]   Because Gigah Oum did events, right?
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:31.920]   Gigah Oum,
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.840]   our events were hugely profitable,
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.120]   but they were not-
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.720]   You couldn't scale them.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.760]   Because you have a limited-
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:38.400]   Ten quality.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:38.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.360]   Stacey, I think the difference here is though.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.840]   I think you're right on a pure B2B level.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.360]   But on this fan level-
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.080]   Yeah, you could scale-
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.840]   I think the event-
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.440]   The event is a highlight of an ongoing membership.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.440]   True.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:58.160]   And I mean, there's been a couple-
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:58.720]   What's her name?
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.720]   I think it was Miranda,
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:07.520]   or no, it was another YouTube comedian came in to Austin and we paid an exorbitant amount
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.720]   to her standing room.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.600]   You know-
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.000]   Oh yeah.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:10.640]   Oh yeah.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.920]   I say it is like-
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:12.240]   Oh yeah.
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:12.480]   I'm like,
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.760]   Oh, I'm not seated,
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.040]   it's terrifying.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.800]   But standing room at her show,
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.240]   and it was, you know, us and a million preteen-
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.600]   Just to the girls-
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.200]   Set expectations for your South by Southwest appearance with us.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.560]   There will be seating room.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.760]   There may even be empty seats,
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.040]   but I think we will surely have 10, 12,
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.960]   maybe even 15 people in the audience.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.800]   So just to set expectations-
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.200]   There'll be plenty of bagels for everybody.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:41.840]   No, what is it?
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.040]   Breakfast tacos.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.400]   Breakfast tacos.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.240]   I'm not coming if there are bagels.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:46.960]   No bagels.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.080]   Breakfast tacos.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.160]   Or burritos.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:50.640]   In the way.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.280]   No.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.400]   Breakfast tacos.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.200]   I loved-
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.080]   You got to do regional-
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.360]   You still call them tacos, that's right.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.400]   You got to do regional.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.200]   Joanna Stern,
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.040]   she's reviewing Knapples' new speaker,
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.640]   which comes out Friday,
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.680]   the HomePod,
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.680]   and likens it to bagels.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.200]   And says it's three stacked New York bagels.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.640]   And it just shows you-
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.680]   And you know this, Jeff,
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.320]   because you live-
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.440]   You work in Manhattan.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.960]   There's nothing more provincial than a Manhattanite.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:16.960]   What?
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:17.920]   They're provincial.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.400]   No, we are the center of the universe.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.680]   Oh, that's just what you like us.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:21.680]   Oh, yes.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.320]   That's right.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:22.960]   That's it.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:23.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.080]   That's not said-
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.920]   That's the provincial and the egocentric.
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.600]   That's what provincial means.
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.400]   Because we deserve to be-
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.600]   We're the center of the universe.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.560]   What do we need to know?
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:30.880]   Yeah, we are.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.360]   Yeah, we are.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:31.920]   Sure, we are.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.200]   You and the chicken capital
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.560]   and you and the tattoo capital.
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.320]   Yeah, but we at least know
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.640]   that Petaluma doesn't have any cache.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.800]   In fact, worse, it smells like manure half the time.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:44.880]   Our cache is-
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:45.520]   Whoo!
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.920]   If we ever do a perfume-
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.040]   That's organic.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.080]   It'll be Petaluma.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:50.400]   Whoo!
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.120]   Alphabet announces fourth quarter
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.200]   in fiscal year 2017 results.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.400]   We buried the lead.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.000]   Nine?
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.640]   No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.680]   I'm waiting.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.160]   Delete.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.760]   Has to be space-man.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.600]   God, was that amazing?
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.520]   All right, we'll forget Alphabet's results.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.840]   This is no longer this week in Google.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.600]   It's this week in Space Man.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.640]   Wasn't it awe-inspiring?
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.280]   Wasn't it so wonderful to look up, not down?
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.760]   Wasn't it just phenomenal?
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.280]   You had a great tweet, Jeff.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.360]   You said this reminds me of the 60s,
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.320]   where it's hope above and-
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.080]   And what does it say?
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:32.800]   Hate below.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.560]   Anger or hate or just anger-press.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.760]   Anger below, yeah.
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.600]   And it is true, isn't it?
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.440]   And the Guardian wrote a very miserable editorial.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.720]   They were, what a surprise, right?
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.120]   I know you're-
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.480]   You've gone so anti-tech.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:50.720]   I know you're no longer a Guardian fan,
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.880]   but they basically said,
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.680]   you know, there's people dying in Syria,
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:00.160]   and we're celebrating, you know, a billion-
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.000]   The headline literally is why
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.200]   Elon Musk's space launch is utterly depressing.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.960]   Oh, geez.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:07.840]   I know.
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.680]   Come on, no, this was not depressing.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:10.160]   D.G.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.680]   This is moral, watch.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:12.560]   Well, it's just-
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.080]   Oh, there are people dying in Syria.
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.280]   It's not a zero-sun game.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.720]   We have enough to do both.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.600]   Trust me.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.200]   This is a fraction of the cost.
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.160]   It's a non-no.
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.360]   So-
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.480]   So we integrated the schools and had tang at the same time.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.120]   That's right.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.480]   That's right.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.240]   Thank God for that.
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:28.640]   So this-
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.720]   Elon is, by the way,
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.400]   if there's one takeaway from this,
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.920]   besides just excitement over,
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.680]   you know, just the gorgeous miracle of it,
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.000]   is-
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.680]   Elon's the best-best marketer in the world.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:42.960]   Oh, God, is he brilliant.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:43.680]   So, geez.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.880]   Before he goes on-
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.800]   Before the flight,
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.600]   he goes on the Today Show yesterday and says,
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.000]   "Well,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.840]   the engineers tell me two chances out of three
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.600]   is just going to blow up right there on the pad.
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.760]   I'm thinking I'm optimistic 50/50.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.160]   So now you have to watch, right?
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:00.640]   Right.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.760]   We're like, oh my God,
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.280]   it's going to either kick off in the awesome-
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.880]   It's going to explode in the awesome-
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.680]   It's going to be the biggest rocket ever exploding on the pad.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.040]   So you have to watch.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.920]   You watch, and it's perfection.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.600]   There's 27 engines.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.160]   Even one of them is off by one millimeter.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.280]   The rocket doesn't go up.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:17.920]   It goes, "Whoop!"
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.760]   Perfect.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:20.880]   Straight up in the air.
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.720]   Then, the Pies de Résistance,
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.560]   as the three boosters come off,
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:31.840]   the two side boosters land like freaking synchronized swimmers-
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.000]   Like flash gorton time.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:34.640]   Shh!
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.320]   What did happen to the main booster?
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.520]   I never saw a report.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.120]   It did fall into the ocean.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.280]   It didn't make it.
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.840]   And fortunately, no pictures to spoil your memories.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.120]   Yes.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:45.840]   And you know what?
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.320]   This was still a total success.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.240]   But the best part-
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.840]   When I read this a month ago that Elon said,
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.080]   "I'm going to put my roadster on this."
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.240]   I thought, "Oh yeah, come on, Elon."
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.800]   It's going to have a dummy in its spaceman,
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.880]   and it's going to be playing in a loop.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:03.760]   David Bowie's
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:08.320]   spaceman is ground control to Major Tom.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.600]   Okay, I thought he's like a good-
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.400]   Oh, I did Starman.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.760]   Starman, not Starman.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.320]   Starman.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.600]   So I thought, "Okay, fine."
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:14.720]   So he does it, right?
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.280]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:18.480]   What I didn't know is that when the capsule gets into Earth orbit,
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.760]   the fairing come off,
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:24.640]   and the star man and the Tesla are floating in space-
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:28.320]   Oh, coincidentally, there happened to be cameras all around it.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.200]   Yeah, of course.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.600]   With the lighting just like perfect.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.240]   Well, the lighting provided by the sun and the Earth-
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.960]   I mean, it's stunning.
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:42.160]   And of course, it's a subtle ad because there's the Tesla logo on the steering wheel.
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.400]   He could have put the Tesla logo on the screen.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.840]   Instead, he puts Douglas Adams' great words from
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.720]   H.E.K.K.S. Sky to the Galaxy, "Don't Panic" on the screen.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:54.560]   And we're just watching this, and I want this as a screen saver.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.200]   I mean- Oh, I do, too.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.520]   Well, I put my favorite picture just up on the chat, Leo.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.160]   Oh, good.
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.920]   Oh, my favorite Starman picture is there on the chat.
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.080]   It's just so stunning.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:09.360]   And by the way, a massive ad for Tesla, ultimately, in a way, right?
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.720]   So Elon-
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.680]   That's just-
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.720]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.760]   Isn't that the well-
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.600]   So right now, for those of you on audio right now,
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.640]   it's the side image with the Earth in the background,
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.160]   just driving along cruising past the Earth, unbelievable.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.040]   Isn't that gorgeous?
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.880]   And the Earth, of course, the star man is in Earth orbit,
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.680]   so the Earth is slowly setting out of the day.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.200]   Now, now he's on his way, right?
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.040]   They're going to send that to the asteroid belt.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.520]   Yeah, it was a, I guess, it was a little off the plane trajectory,
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.280]   so it's going way past Mars, almost a series, into the asteroid belt.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.200]   And Elon's saying all these things like,
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.280]   "I can't wait two million years from now,"
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.600]   and, you know, alien archaeologists find this.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.800]   What are they going to think?
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:49.280]   And-
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.040]   So the asteroid's going to bang it up?
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.680]   Well, there are those who say it won't-
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.080]   Yeah, it's going to get pulverized,
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.680]   as it probably will by space dust.
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.200]   So how does it-
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.560]   So this is the question I really-
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.560]   I was looking for a story on this, and I didn't see it.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.560]   It's just Jeff's favorite from-
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.440]   From uh, 4okoches.com.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.800]   And your dog recognized it immediately, I think that's interesting.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.080]   She's very intent.
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:12.560]   She's-
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.720]   She said, "I see a dog in space. I'd like to do that."
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.920]   I-
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.040]   I want to know how the-
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.400]   The camera's transmitting.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.720]   That's a lot of data to come down from space.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.760]   I-
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.160]   I know we have satellites sending data all the time.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.280]   All made up, Stacey.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.400]   We didn't go to the moon.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.760]   The tassel's not up there.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.880]   It's all in a studio somewhere in California.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.000]   It's too perfect.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.440]   I was- I really wanted to read like what kind of uh,
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.880]   communication set up they have.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.840]   So that was just my-
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.440]   So how long the batteries are going to last?
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.760]   And is it still broadcasting?
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.200]   It'll- I mean, it's kind of pretty big battery pack in that thing.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.320]   I imagine it is.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.560]   Of course, by the way, I understand they're in a vacuum.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.720]   So you can't hear it.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.800]   It's uh,
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.800]   John just showed me the circuit board, uh,
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.880]   that has the music loop on it,
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.040]   and it has printed on the circuit board
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.040]   made on Earth by humans.
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:01.840]   Just in case.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.600]   Just in case.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.880]   We drew-
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:05.440]   We drew-
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.000]   Eager.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:06.560]   Eager.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.040]   It's going to come in a lot of Eager jokes.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.520]   It's going to come back and be looking for a supercharger,
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.240]   things like that.
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:12.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.480]   It didn't hit the orbit that they planned?
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.880]   No, it's slightly off.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.440]   Like, that's okay.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.160]   It doesn't matter.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:18.800]   That's what they were doing.
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:19.840]   It was fine with that.
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.760]   Yeah, they're testing the rockets.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:22.560]   I mean, they don't-
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:22.960]   Right.
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.240]   You know, that's nothing.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.520]   This is a-
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.360]   This is a massive success.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:27.920]   You couldn't-
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:28.560]   Yes, it is.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.160]   Uh, yeah.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:30.560]   You're right.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.440]   That should be the lead.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.320]   Because-
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.360]   Sorry, but we had to.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.600]   This is a science-loving show.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.160]   But it's also-
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:36.160]   No.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:36.720]   It's a-
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.360]   It's a-
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:37.360]   It's a-
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:37.360]   It's a-
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:38.320]   It's a-
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:38.880]   It's a-
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.960]   We got an answer on the chat room,
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.080]   saying that SpaceX paid NASA to use their TDRS network.
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.440]   That's where the-
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:45.760]   Yeah.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.040]   That's where the pictures are coming from.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.560]   Yeah, I mean,
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:49.600]   it's not that far from Earth.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.840]   You won't see pictures now, right?
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.360]   I mean, it's not going to continue to stream.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.520]   Well, that's what I wanted, but yes.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.400]   That's what I'm asking us.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.200]   How long did the streaming come in?
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:57.760]   No, I'm sure.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.160]   John's going to tell me he's our SpaceX.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.520]   Elon tweeted the last picture recently,
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.680]   because as it gets outside away from the Earth,
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.320]   yeah, it can't.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.120]   You know, it's not.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:07.680]   I mean,
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:08.640]   they're not going to spend money
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.440]   sending-
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.080]   Beaming back the same picture.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.680]   Although, if he gets-
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.440]   If the spaceman gets to Mars,
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.520]   I wouldn't mind seeing a little Mars.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.320]   Yeah, you want to-
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   Mars-
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   Mars-
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   Mars-
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   Mars-
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   Mars-
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   Mars-
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   Mars-
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   Mars-
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   Mars-
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   Mars-
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   Mars-
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   Mars-
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   Mars-
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   Mars-
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   Mars-
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   Mars-
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.360]   Yeah.
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.960]   Uh-
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.200]   Okay.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.400]   Oh, the network provides six megabits per second,
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.600]   and 800 megabits in the KUKA bands.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.280]   So now I know.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.560]   Now I feel like better.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:31.920]   How about this picture?
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.000]   Give Apple Maps another try, they said.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.520]   It's gotten a lot better, they said.
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.200]   A dog.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.560]   There's so many jokes about this.
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.320]   Wow, that last picture is amazing.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.320]   Oh, let's go see it.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:42.880]   Oh, we got a-
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:43.920]   Elon Musk Twitter.
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.280]   Yeah, it's Instagram, actually.
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.160]   It's Instagram.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:46.480]   Okay.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.000]   Jeez.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.840]   It really does-
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.680]   Just bring back the blue marble,
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.920]   you know that everybody talks about, and-
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.960]   You get a great sense of,
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.000]   "Oh my God."
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.240]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.680]   It's going off in a space.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.160]   The last picture of Starman and Roadster
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.360]   en route to Mars orbit,
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.640]   and then the asteroid built.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.320]   Wow.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.840]   Wow.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:14.720]   And of course, the Earth is receding in the distance.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.600]   Yeah, I want that as a desktop picture.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:19.920]   Yeah, that is-
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:20.960]   That is something.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:21.920]   And of course, again,
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.320]   he's in a Tesla.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.920]   Yeah, listen.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:26.880]   I mean, come on.
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.800]   What-
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.040]   I mean, you know, if Pepsi did that,
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.120]   people would be infuriated.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.080]   If he was holding a Pepsi in his hand,
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.400]   people would have hit the roof.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:41.200]   But we don't-
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:41.680]   We don't-
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.360]   Somehow, Elon, we don't mind.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.400]   Oh, here's the-
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.840]   This is also from his Instagram.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.320]   Here's the image of the circuit board
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.880]   made on Earth by humans.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.480]   Now, they only make more perfect as if-
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.240]   as if Starman had brought out a-
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.280]   a flamethrower.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.720]   Boring machine flamethrower.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:01.840]   My other tweet-
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:05.120]   My other tweet was that's the biggest damn flamethrower ever made.
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.400]   As soon as it was going off.
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:06.800]   Here's the-
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:12.080]   Here's the picture of the two rockets landing as if in ballet.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:15.760]   And you know,
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.560]   whatever the Guardian says,
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.160]   "Yeah, we've got troubles here on Earth."
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.120]   Uh, and we're-
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.240]   You know, but-
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.440]   Science is important.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.040]   You know what?
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.880]   I wouldn't even argue that this is science.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.040]   It is, but that's not even important.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.880]   Inspiration is important.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:35.280]   One of the ways you solve problems here on Earth is to remind us-
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.080]   we're all on this little blue marble in the middle of nowhere-
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.080]   all together at once-
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.160]   that we are-
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:46.640]   we as humans have aspirations that are phenomenal-
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:50.000]   and that we are capable of amazing things.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.200]   All of that-
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.080]   some school kid is seeing that launch,
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:57.360]   and as I did when I was a kid watching Gemini and Apollo-
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:57.840]   Mm-hmm.
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.160]   And getting excited about life,
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.920]   about what's possible, about-
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:02.720]   yes, stem,
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:03.920]   but-
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.280]   but even more than that.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.400]   I think this is huge.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.400]   I think it's fabulous.
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.760]   I tweeted this,
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.000]   but I will say that my daughter was like,
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:12.640]   "This is awesome."
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.880]   But now he's littering in space.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:15.920]   She's very concerned.
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:16.960]   Well, yes, no-
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:17.600]   We had a whole-
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.000]   It's okay.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:18.960]   We had a whole discussion about-
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.600]   It will be worse in Earth orbit.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.160]   Yeah, it's-
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:22.400]   Yes.
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:22.880]   It's going-
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:23.440]   There-
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.240]   every flight does environmental damage.
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.640]   Think about the amount of fuel it's consuming-
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.880]   the pollution that that causes.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:31.760]   There's a lot-
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.480]   in fact, some have said that SpaceX's launches
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:38.560]   are just barely offset by how much energy Tesla's have saved.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:39.680]   So how?
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.600]   That's a point.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:41.920]   But-
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.560]   but again, it's not a zero-sum game.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.680]   No.
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:46.560]   You know, the other thing that-
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:47.840]   with this anti-corporate-
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.960]   and I do- I just still love the Guardian, but there-
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:51.760]   sometimes-
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.520]   It's just an op-ed.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.360]   I don't know if it represents their entire-
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.520]   No, they've been going so anti-techily.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.400]   When I- next time I see them,
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.840]   I'm going to beat them up a lot of them.
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:01.040]   But anyway,
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:04.480]   it did occur as I'm doing research on this notion of the mass.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.080]   I was reading some stuff.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.480]   It occurred to me that if you look at some of the exploration
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.000]   back in the day,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.520]   whether it was-
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:18.000]   the pilgrims actually being subsidized by venture capital of the day,
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.080]   the Hudson's Bay Company into Canada,
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:23.280]   the Indian venture for Britain was-
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.520]   the venture started as corporate.
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.800]   The future was explored by companies and by-
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.480]   by capitalists of a sort.
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.000]   - Imperialists. - Imperialists.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:32.480]   - That's what's happening now.
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:33.440]   - Imperialists.
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.640]   - Yeah, and then we've learned-
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.360]   - All the bad things that come-
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:36.720]   all the bad things that come with it.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.080]   Actually, it's an interesting point,
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.120]   because imperialism-
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:42.880]   and it did create horrific disruptions
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:46.400]   that we still suffer from in the Middle East and Africa and elsewhere.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:46.720]   - Yep.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.280]   - Was also a civilizing force.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.000]   So, yeah, I mean, it's not completely-
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.160]   it's not black and white.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.440]   Here, but I did not know this.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.640]   Did you know this, John,
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:02.320]   that on the dashboard of the Roadster is a matchbox Roadster
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:05.040]   with a tiny star man in it?
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:05.600]   - Oh, no.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:05.600]   - Oh.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:11.840]   - And in the matchbox Roadster on the dashboard is another-
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:12.480]   even time-
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.360]   no, I'm just joking.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.360]   - There was also somebody else-
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.400]   - There was some other-
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.160]   - Roadsters all the way down would be very good.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.040]   - It would be very good.
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:19.680]   (John laughs)
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.600]   - There's also some kind of new mechanism
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.000]   to try to store all the, all the risk knowledge
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.240]   and a new format was put on the Roadster.
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.920]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.120]   - Yeah, I wonder what else is-
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.800]   - Just put Wikipedia on it.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.360]   - Put a little bus drive with Wikipedia on it.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.200]   That would be easy.
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:39.440]   Not that aliens or anybody were getting it would be able to read it,
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:42.320]   but at least, you know, kind of fun to say you did it.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.400]   There isn't the equivalent of the big gold disc
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.600]   that was on Voyager.
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.200]   - No, but there was a little disc.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:47.920]   What the hell was it?
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.440]   Oh, hell, I saw the story.
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.640]   - I mean-
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.840]   - With some kind of new format for, but it didn't store much.
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:57.360]   Here's from the Verge, SpaceX,
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.720]   Flight included a copy of-
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:01.280]   - There we go.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.480]   - The Foundation novels.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.360]   - Oh.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.240]   - Yeah, so-
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.440]   - What did store much?
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:08.080]   - On a arch storage disc.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:08.960]   - So they're-
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.160]   - So it's not the DVD-
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:10.720]   - That's the whole-
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:11.680]   - That's the whole-
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.080]   - Not the Will Smith DVD.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:18.320]   It's a 5D laser optical quartz storage device
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:22.480]   that is meant to be able to survive even in the harsh conditions of space.
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:31.120]   So the Arch Mission Foundation's goal is to preserve libraries of human knowledge for
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.160]   interstellar travel.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:36.320]   So that's what you're talking about, the Arch Mission Foundation.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:36.800]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:37.280]   - Very good.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.400]   Good searching.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.920]   - Arch Atram, they're the best.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:40.960]   - That's good, Chatham.
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:41.280]   - Yeah.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.000]   - Barry.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.080]   - So I bet we're going to find other things,
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.720]   you know, the Pepsi and the Love compartment after all, you know?
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:48.880]   - I don't mind if it's in the Love compartment,
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.040]   it just doesn't become an ad for Pepsi.
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:51.840]   - Yeah, I know.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:52.320]   I know.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.000]   - And you know, for some reason,
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.080]   nobody seems to mind that it's an ad for Tesla.
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.040]   - No.
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.320]   - It's a subtle ad.
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.080]   It's his $90 million rocket.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.760]   - I was about to say, he built a game.
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.240]   - He could have put concrete.
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:05.840]   It's much more, frankly, inspiring that he-
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.600]   - What he did was much more inspiring.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.360]   - Yes, and it has a sense of humor.
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.560]   - Yeah, you got to admire Elon.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:16.320]   He thinks outside the box to say the least.
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.040]   - King Elon.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:22.000]   - No, I've now come to the conclusion after-
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.040]   Okay, so now we learn Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook hired a pollster.
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:30.400]   I think that's more common than you know.
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.200]   - I think it is.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.880]   - Far more common than you know.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.840]   - Corporations off, well, we know that, for instance,
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.720]   the board of Uber, when it was trying to get rid of Travis Kalenek,
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:42.800]   commissioned a survey to find out how people felt about the CEO.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.360]   And that was some of the ammunition they used
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.840]   when they approached Travis and said, "You got to go.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:48.880]   Look at your numbers."
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:52.400]   - But I just found out about a major tech executive.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:57.600]   I won't say who, who has his own, who commissions his own political polling
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:58.560]   and polling in the country.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:58.960]   - Okay.
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.880]   - Why does he do that?
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:06.720]   - I think wanting to get the zeitgeist and understand how to
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:07.840]   cause change and things.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.880]   I mean, these folks do fancy themselves
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.640]   not as a big company of the future, right?
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:16.320]   And so they want to know what's what?
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.200]   - I guess public opinion is part of business.
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.360]   You know, you do.
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.000]   - Yeah, it is.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:28.560]   - And the ebb and flow of the economy is certainly something you'd like to be able to
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.360]   prepare for.
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.960]   So I understand that.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.080]   But I think it's interesting that this pollster,
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:38.320]   Tavis McGinn, who actually was a market researcher, he wasn't,
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:42.800]   he didn't go to the standard polls to hire somebody.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:47.040]   This was a guy who worked with advertisers on marketing campaigns.
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:50.800]   But he was asked during the interview process,
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.600]   "Would you like to track the public perception of Mark Zuckerberg?"
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.000]   This is April 2017.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.560]   And, you know, so already Facebook's in trouble for the election, right?
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.560]   This is already they're getting heat.
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.920]   And Mark was on his tour, right, where he was the listening tour,
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:11.760]   where he was kind of doing a, what quasi-political thing.
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:17.280]   McGinn told the Verge, "It was my job to do surveys and focus groups globally
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.200]   to understand why people like Mark Zuckerberg,
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:23.440]   why people like Mark Zuckerberg, whether they think they can trust him
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:27.440]   and whether they've even heard of him, not just in the US,
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.800]   but it's especially important outside the United States."
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.600]   And it turns out he did the same thing for Cheryl Sandberg.
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.560]   And one of the things they had him survey was,
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:43.120]   "Do you associate Facebook's COO, Cheryl Sandberg with Facebook
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:47.120]   or would lean in an option B, her personal initiatives?"
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:53.200]   Obviously trying to figure out, "Hmm, is Sandberg becoming more famous than we are?"
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:58.320]   I don't, I spent, anyway, the reason I brought it up is I feel like
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.800]   we already know Dwayne Johnson wants to run for president,
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.800]   Oprah Winfrey wants to run for president,
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:07.920]   guarantee you Bloomberg, Zuckerberg, and others want to run for president.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:13.440]   Celebrities and technologists, both are looking at the White House
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:16.640]   and starting to be their BDIs on it.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:22.320]   And I do not want a billionaire or a famous person to be elected
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.560]   just because they're a billionaire or a famous person.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:29.200]   Oprah, I know Oprah doesn't want to run, Mark doesn't want to run,
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.360]   nobody wants to run until they run.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:35.680]   You know, it reminds me of, okay, I'm just going to say it,
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:40.240]   Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, because you don't have the real power,
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:42.000]   isn't the president, what's happening is...
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.600]   It's all a performance, is it?
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:43.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.680]   I don't know.
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:46.640]   That's maybe true.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:50.640]   I mean, I think Jeff and I, as Democrats, when Obama's elected,
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.440]   we had high hopes.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:54.560]   And just as every president before him,
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:00.480]   he went in with hopes to change the world and ended up being able to do very little because
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.560]   of a lot of things.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:03.440]   Right.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.640]   And that's life.
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:11.040]   You go in with big expectations and the world and experience kind of beach it down a little.
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:13.920]   Actually, Trump may have been more effective, frankly,
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:16.080]   in his first year than Obama was in his first year.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:16.960]   No.
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:17.840]   Okay.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.280]   Talk me down.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:19.760]   Okay.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:22.240]   Nice try for going for the concrerian, genuinely.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.040]   Oh, but no.
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.720]   Yeah, I'm like, he did.
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:25.920]   One, look at all the legislation.
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.040]   He's done with the EPA.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.480]   Look what he's done with...
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:29.600]   Well, he's afraid a lot.
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:30.080]   Yes.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:34.640]   Look what he's done with life taunt long appointed justice appointees.
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:41.280]   If you want to blow up a system, it is much easier to blow something up than it is to build something.
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.000]   Oh, there you go.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:42.800]   Just ask the internet.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:43.520]   That's the excuse.
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.720]   It's not...
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:45.840]   It's true the internet too.
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.480]   It's easy to tear down Egypt.
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.760]   It's harder to build it back up.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:53.920]   So I'm listening to Ron Churno's grant biography right now.
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:55.200]   Yes.
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:40:03.120]   And it is striking how up through the Civil War, he was just a horrendous loser.
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:07.760]   He was a nice guy and a chump and he kept losing money on business venture after business venture.
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:14.800]   And yet the man became the head of the army in the Civil War, accepted the Appomattox
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:18.720]   defeat and became president of the United States.
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.840]   Not to mention he was a drunk.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:21.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.480]   Yeah, that'll be interesting.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.760]   That'll be a great book to read.
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:30.000]   He churn out wrote the Hamilton book, of course, and it is very good.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.200]   It's depressing actually at the beginning.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.360]   Oh, Jesus, another thousand dollars gone.
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.200]   You know, Grant was a complete loser.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:35.520]   Yeah.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.560]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:40.160]   So yeah, it's not as if presidents came from being...
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.120]   Oh, no.
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:42.800]   We've had some bad people in the country.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:43.680]   Many, many bad ones.
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:45.920]   Was he a bad president?
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:46.320]   I don't know.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:46.800]   I don't know.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.720]   That's a funny point though, right?
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.040]   Was he?
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:49.520]   I don't know.
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:50.000]   Not there yet.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:50.400]   I don't know.
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:54.880]   He was affiliated with Scandal, but I have no idea if he was a bad president.
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.240]   I mean, how do you measure a president?
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.120]   That's the other thing.
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.080]   I mean, like what...
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.200]   Oh, we're in hell now.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:40:59.840]   You measure a president's population.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:40:59.840]   Oh, we're in hell now.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.040]   That's...
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.400]   I mean, there's lots of...
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.560]   You see the new floor for which to judge.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.120]   Sorry, people.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.080]   I know I get in trouble.
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:11.360]   Hey, when we have our military parade in July,
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:14.080]   you're going to be the guy standing in front of the tank.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:16.000]   I love a parade.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.360]   So...
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:21.840]   What do we want?
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.200]   Talk about alphabets revenue.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:23.760]   Let's take a break.
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:24.080]   Let's go.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:24.880]   Let's go back to it.
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:25.600]   Okay, welcome to the tour.
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.720]   We should get to it.
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:27.920]   Yes, this is wrong.
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:30.640]   There is some stuff and actually even related stuff,
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:34.640]   because alphabets had to pay $9.9 million in tax.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.840]   Explain to me how that happened.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:37.280]   I can explain.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:38.880]   That's what I figured you could.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:39.760]   I can't explain.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.120]   Well, after this message...
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:44.160]   They actually lost money because of it, but not really.
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.640]   Revenue is up.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.320]   Profits are down.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:53.120]   It all has to do with $9.9 billion in income tax.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:53.680]   But first,
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.680]   or corporate tax.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.240]   Do you call corporate taxes income taxes?
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:58.800]   I guess not.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.280]   No.
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.560]   They're just corporate taxes.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.680]   Corporate taxes.
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.360]   Corporations, even though they're people,
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.640]   don't have income.
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:08.400]   See, that's how you have to do it, Jeff.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.280]   You're going to just...
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.400]   The shots need to be subtle.
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.480]   Just like...
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.760]   It's a little subtlety.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:16.320]   It's like, that's about as subtle as my hair.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:17.280]   Come on, Leo.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.240]   Absolutely.
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:21.440]   I've been thinking about dog whistles.
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:24.000]   I'm in the market.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.960]   I just figure, you know, if we could come up...
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.880]   See, that's what we need to do.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:30.240]   We need better dog whistles.
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:31.760]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.520]   That is not what we need.
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:34.080]   Okay.
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:35.600]   That's part of our problem.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:36.160]   Let's go.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:37.520]   Advertising.
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.640]   Okay.
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:45.040]   Next time you're ready to buy a house,
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.560]   can I rake your recommendation?
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:49.120]   Actually, I do notice interest rates.
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:52.000]   One of the reasons stock market plunged last week
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.120]   is because the market was convinced interest rates would go up.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.480]   The Fed has already said we're going to raise them a few times.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.680]   It's a good time maybe to refi.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.600]   You don't even have to be in the market for a house.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.680]   I notice a lot of houses on the market though right now.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.640]   This would be a good time.
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:07.840]   Good time to buy.
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:08.640]   Good time to refi.
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.760]   And if you do, I want you to remember this address,
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:14.080]   rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:19.120]   See, this is a mortgage entirely online mortgage approval process.
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:23.360]   It comes from our friends at Quicken Loans, who are absolutely great.
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:26.480]   Number one in customer satisfaction, eight years in a row,
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.800]   according to JD Power for mortgage approval.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:33.120]   Even with all those awards, they weren't satisfied.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:34.080]   Don't you love that?
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.560]   They said there's something wrong with the mortgage approval process.
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:37.920]   It's dated.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.040]   It needs a client-focused technological revolution.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:43.200]   And they created rocket mortgage.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.240]   You could do the whole thing.
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.960]   Oh, I'd like to just say the Super Bowl ads for rocket mortgage.
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:49.280]   Go see the website because they're hysterical.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:53.040]   Histerical with Keegan Michael Key.
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.960]   Just doing a great job.
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:57.280]   Anyway, they created rocket mortgage.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.800]   You can do it entirely on your phone.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:02.240]   No, there's no jargon, no mystery.
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:07.440]   You simply set up an account rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.160]   Give them some basic information.
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:11.040]   You don't even have to look it up.
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:11.920]   I know you know it.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.160]   Your name, your address, your birthday, your social.
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:17.360]   They have relationships with all the financial institutions.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:20.080]   Once you give them permission, just the touch of a button,
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:23.200]   they can pull the information they need to make you an offer.
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.880]   Based on income assets and credits within a couple of credits,
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:30.240]   within a couple of minutes, they'll analyze all the home loan options
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:33.840]   for which you qualify and they'll give you several to choose from.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:34.880]   You choose the down payment.
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:36.240]   You choose the term.
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.120]   You choose the rate.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.200]   You get the mortgage.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.960]   Then and there you're approved.
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.560]   That's just a complete revolution.
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:45.840]   Rocket mortgage from quick and loans.
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.280]   You apply simply.
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.920]   You'll understand every step of the way, fully, no jargon.
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:53.600]   It's all completely clear and then you mortgage confidently.
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.080]   To get started, go to rocketmortgage.com/twig
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:57.680]   and do it anyway just to watch the video.
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:00.160]   The Super Bowl I was so funny.
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:04.240]   Rocketmortgage.com/twig=housinglander
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:07.920]   licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access.org.
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:09.360]   Number 30, 30.
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:10.960]   Rocket mortgage, quick and loans.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:16.400]   Thank you for your support this week and Google.
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.240]   Did you either of you watch the Super Bowl?
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.160]   Most of it.
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:23.760]   Tivo did a funny thing.
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:27.360]   You know, they have a skip commercial button and it's not for all shows.
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:30.480]   But if you Tivo a show, some shows, I guess they have to have permission.
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:32.560]   You skip the Super Bowl and go to the commercials?
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:32.880]   Yes!
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.200]   Oh, brilliant.
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.080]   Wasn't that brilliant?
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:36.560]   That's cute.
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:38.240]   So instead of skipping the commercials,
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:41.280]   you press D and it skips all the football.
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.080]   I go right to the commercial!
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:44.880]   That's brilliant.
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:48.480]   So Lisa and I, the day after the Super Bowl, we watched it, but I had to work and stuff.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.720]   So we watched, but it's the day after.
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.400]   I said, let's watch the commercials.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.520]   Let's watch the Super Bowl.
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:58.320]   We sat down, I had it on my Tivo and we, within, it took us only, you know, maybe 15, 20 minutes.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:45:59.920]   We saw all the commercials one after the other.
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:01.280]   This was the best floor in your view.
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:01.600]   Tied?
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:04.080]   Oh, with Dave Harbor?
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:04.480]   Yes.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:05.440]   Stranger things?
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:05.760]   Okay.
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.520]   He did his Stranger Things dance in one of them.
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:08.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:08.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:08.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:09.120]   Yeah.
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:09.120]   Yeah.
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:09.120]   Yeah.
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:10.400]   He was so cute.
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:11.440]   Oh, he was almost good.
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:16.480]   The thing that, reason I think, tied one is because after that, you thought every commercial,
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:19.200]   what Ty did was they set it up that we were going to,
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:21.680]   every commercial is really a tied commercial.
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:25.920]   And so they had parodies of all these commercials and it was really a tied commercial
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.080]   because everybody's wearing super clean clothes.
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:31.280]   And so they set it up so that everything you saw from then on, you thought,
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.480]   is this a tied commercial?
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:36.320]   They got people, every single commercial thinking, is this a tied commercial?
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:37.120]   And some of them were.
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:42.480]   So it must have cost them $10 million because it's $5 million for half a minute.
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.640]   And nobody was eating pods in any of them?
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:48.080]   No, they didn't even mention tied pods, but you know what?
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:48.400]   Fine.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.120]   Who?
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:51.280]   I wouldn't expect them to.
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:52.240]   No, no.
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:53.360]   It's a tie-dad.
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:55.360]   So what did you, you said you liked?
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:56.400]   I liked the Amazon.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:56.960]   Amazon?
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:57.760]   We have, we have one.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:57.760]   We have one.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:58.240]   We know.
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:46:58.720]   We know.
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:46:59.760]   Should we play it?
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:00.560]   Yeah, let's play it.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:02.400]   I think it's a program for us.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.000]   Because it's very funny.
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:08.480]   But we're talking about this on Windows Weekly.
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:11.920]   And I think that maybe Paul Therat got it right when he said,
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:13.440]   "Okay, fine.
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:18.960]   For us who know who Echo is, that was funny.
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:25.440]   But no one else, oh, it's in the culture now, I think.
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:26.240]   Talk to people.
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:28.480]   He said nobody understood what it was for.
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:33.280]   Let me see if I can find the full ad because there's a lot of,
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.880]   it's in the rundown, I think.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:36.240]   Well, but there's teasers.
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:44.240]   Let me see if I can find Stacey.
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:44.800]   Sorry.
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:48.080]   Nope, that was again, still working on the caffeine withdrawal.
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:50.560]   Oh, you're still doing that?
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:52.240]   God, I thought you'd be off that by now.
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:53.840]   No, I have to do it for several months,
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:55.040]   but it's getting so much better.
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:56.640]   Like now I'm totally awake for you guys.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:59.200]   It's just, normally I have coffee beforehand.
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:47:59.440]   So.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:03.040]   YouTube Super Bowl ad views were up 16%,
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:07.120]   we're about to make it 17% with Amazon's Echo ad,
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:10.240]   the most watched ad on YouTube.
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:11.040]   How about that?
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:17.520]   Number two, Groupon, which was a terrible ad.
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:20.800]   Who even knew Groupon was still in business?
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.280]   Right?
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:25.600]   That is a lot of people felt.
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:27.520]   Yeah, so maybe that was a good ad.
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:29.760]   Then the Pepsi ad, which I don't remember,
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:30.960]   oh, it's all the generations.
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:33.120]   It's a lot of people watched that.
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.040]   The Bud Night again, stupid, the end,
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.720]   I hope to God of Dilly Dilly.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:38.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:39.440]   Let me go to YouTube,
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:42.880]   because that seems to be the place to go for Super Bowl ads, apparently.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:46.160]   And see if we can find this Amazon.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.360]   So Jeff Bezos was in it,
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.120]   which is uncharacteristic for him, isn't it?
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:49.600]   Very.
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:55.440]   I said it was a victory lap for Amazon's Echo.
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:56.720]   I think it was, I think it was, yeah.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:57.440]   So I think you're quite right.
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:59.120]   Mm-hmm.
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:06.400]   Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi has now passed the longest speech.
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.320]   She's still talking.
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:09.920]   She's still talking more than seven hours.
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:13.520]   This is her DACA, is it a filibuster officially?
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:14.560]   No, I think it's not a filibuster.
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:15.520]   It's just a speech.
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:16.480]   It's a long speech.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.400]   Seven hours?
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:19.280]   Mr. Chairman.
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:19.280]   Yeah.
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.760]   In Austin, it's 60 degrees with it.
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:24.240]   Alexa?
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.600]   Amazon's Alexa lost her voice this morning, causing a way to...
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:28.560]   Alexa lost her voice.
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:29.360]   There's Jeff Bezos.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:30.240]   Possibly as possible.
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:32.000]   He looks good too, by the way.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:33.600]   He's wearing his...
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:36.400]   He now realizes I look good in a vest.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:36.960]   His...
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:38.240]   His sun valley gear.
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.320]   He's wearing exactly the outfit.
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:41.120]   Isn't it?
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:43.040]   That's the vest.
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.600]   He wore it in some valley that makes him look buff.
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:49.280]   Still doesn't have any hair,
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:51.120]   but he's also the richest man in the world.
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:53.360]   So I think he's extremely attractive.
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:53.760]   I'm even...
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:55.520]   Turned on.
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:56.800]   Like a lost her voice.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.000]   How is that even possible?
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.440]   We have the replacements ready,
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:00.560]   just say the word.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:01.760]   You're sure this is going to work?
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:03.280]   This is my favorite part.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:04.000]   Yeah, this is going to work.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:04.560]   This is going to work.
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:05.120]   Very well played.
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:11.840]   Alexa, show me the recipe for a grilled cheese sandwich.
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:12.880]   Pathetic!
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:14.560]   You're 32 years away!
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:15.680]   The first Gordon Ramsay.
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:16.880]   You don't have like a grilled cheese sandwich.
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.960]   Its name is the recipe, you...
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.760]   Like how far is Mars?
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:22.480]   Oh crap.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:23.680]   How far is Mars?
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:24.800]   Well, how am I supposed to do?
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:25.680]   I don't have a bidier.
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:27.120]   This guy want to go to Mars.
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:28.240]   Is that Missy Elliot?
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:29.120]   Who is that?
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:29.520]   It's not even...
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:31.120]   I'm sorry for my lack of knowledge.
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.000]   I'm not too old.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.600]   I think that's Tiffany Haddish.
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:34.080]   Haddied?
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.240]   No, no, she was the group on Lady.
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:36.400]   This...
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.040]   Oh, that's right.
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:37.600]   That's right.
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:38.240]   I know that's right.
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:38.880]   You really not.
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:40.000]   I'm not asking you anymore.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.080]   I want to...
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:43.120]   Cardi B says...
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:43.840]   Cardi B?
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:44.480]   That's who it was.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:45.120]   It's the last one.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:45.840]   Okay.
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:47.120]   Watch the set the mood.
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:48.320]   Now setting the mood.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:49.760]   You're in the bush.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.680]   And you're just so dirty.
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:53.440]   I'm so sweaty.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:56.240]   'Cause it's hard in that bush.
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.480]   Like, rebush, reboot.
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.400]   You're like, "Let's play some country music."
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:00.960]   Oh, girl.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:02.400]   I don't dance now.
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:03.840]   I make money moves.
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:06.000]   No, no, like the country music.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:12.320]   Like...
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:14.240]   ♪ I'm being the nothing gets so much ♪
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.840]   ♪ I'm not the part of me ♪
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:17.360]   What's it called, Brandon?
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:19.680]   I'm afraid Brandon is a little tied up.
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:21.440]   Anthony Hopkins.
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:24.080]   But do let me know if there's anything I can help you with.
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:26.240]   And Peacocks.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:26.800]   Jessica?
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:29.040]   Oh, that's good.
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:31.120]   Good boy.
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:32.880]   Thanks guys.
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:35.280]   What's with the nobody that does it better music?
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:37.840]   Is that just to say nobody does it better than her?
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:38.560]   I guess so.
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:39.440]   Yeah, not Google.
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.440]   I thought it was good.
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:44.320]   It's notable for a couple of reasons.
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:46.240]   Well, yeah, because it's more than 30 seconds.
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:46.720]   That's...
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:47.840]   And it's stars.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:48.960]   They got a pay of people.
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:50.560]   It's 30 second ads.
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:52.720]   And they showed that entire thing.
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:56.160]   So that's $15 million in ad time alone.
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:57.680]   Add the stars.
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.440]   You're well over $20 million, right?
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:00.080]   In production.
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.080]   For one ad.
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:06.000]   I don't know if instead of talking about what Echo can do,
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.320]   it doesn't at all talk about what Echo can do.
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:08.880]   I guess it shows me.
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.400]   No, it makes me echo part of our lives.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.480]   It makes the alien part of our lives.
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:15.200]   Well, it shows you what people are doing with those.
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:17.440]   Yeah, because he was listening to the country music.
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:18.160]   And...
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:20.960]   Tell me how to make a grilled cheese sandwich.
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:21.840]   Okay, how to make a sandwich.
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:22.960]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:24.960]   But I think it really is a victory lap.
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:28.960]   It's more we know, you know who Jeff is,
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:34.560]   you know what Alexa is, and it's great, isn't it?
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:35.360]   It's just great.
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:36.960]   That's really the ad.
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:41.840]   Well, and in the numbers...
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:42.720]   Tell me if I'm wrong here,
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:43.360]   but the numbers...
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:49.600]   Echo has a major contribution to Amazon's sterling quarter.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:49.840]   Yeah.
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:52.720]   And yes, that's right.
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:54.320]   Huge sales for the Echo.
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:53:01.040]   And one week later, 41.1 million views on YouTube.
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:07.040]   So you had 100 million Super Bowl watchers give or take seeing it.
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:11.680]   Maybe with a half attention as they dip into their hummus.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:14.080]   I'm sorry, bourbon hot wings.
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:14.960]   K so.
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:15.440]   K so.
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:22.160]   But 41 million people saw it out on YouTube, went and found it and watched it.
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:23.520]   So that's the magic now.
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:25.760]   Yeah, that is the magic now, isn't it?
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:26.880]   That's what you're going for.
[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:30.640]   So what did you all think of the Dodge Ram ad?
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.960]   Offensive?
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:34.320]   Yep, I agree.
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:36.400]   But I talked to a lot of people and said,
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:37.200]   "What are you talking about?"
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.080]   It was very positive.
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:42.080]   It was Martin Luther King talking about serving.
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:43.440]   So the text was great.
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:50.880]   But it was in service of, yeah, a lot of serving people,
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:52.960]   but ultimately of selling a truck.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:54:02.160]   But somebody did a really good cut down or re-edited of it.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.840]   Let me see if I can find it.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:11.600]   Where in which Martin Luther King's actual thoughts about advertising,
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:12.880]   are heard.
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:16.160]   So I'm not going to play the original Ram ad,
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:20.480]   but let's see what Martin Luther King really thought about car commercials.
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:27.920]   "The presence of this instinct explains why we are so often taken by advertisers.
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:33.200]   You know, are those gentlemen of massive verbal persuasion.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:38.240]   And they have a whale saying things to you that kind of gets you in the bind.
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:44.160]   In order to be a man of distinction, you must drink this whiskey.
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:49.680]   In order to make your neighbor as envy as you must drive this type of car.
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:57.040]   In order to be lovely to love, you must wear this kind of lipstick or this kind of perfume.
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:59.600]   And you know before you know it, you just bind that stuff.
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:06.720]   I got to drive this car because it's something about this car that makes my car
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.480]   a little better than my neighbor's car.
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:16.640]   We can add my am sad to say that the nation in which we live is the supreme culprit.
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:20.080]   And I'm going to continue to say it to America."
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:22.400]   Yeah, so there you go.
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:26.800]   That's maybe a little more accurately the Reverend Martin Luther King's opinions
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:28.880]   of advertising.
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:32.640]   I'm sure the King of State had to get permission for that.
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:37.280]   They're very, very judicious about how they allow his voice to be used.
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:41.680]   I know because remember Eyes on the Prize, that great documentary about the Civil Rights
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:42.640]   March and movement?
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:46.160]   Which you could buy at Amazon and is still worth watching.
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:49.840]   You can buy it, but they don't show it anymore because they lost the rights
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.440]   they I have a dream speech, I think.
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:52.560]   Right? Wasn't that the story?
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:57.680]   And they didn't in the Selma movie, they didn't allow his words to be used.
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:59.840]   So basically it looks like they're just profiting.
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:03.120]   Yeah, the family said, "Yeah, ramp trucks, that's a good thing."
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:05.600]   Forget that march on the bridge thing, you know.
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:15.040]   So I wasn't that offended because they used it, but the message was very strong and very good
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:15.440]   serve.
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:20.800]   You don't have to desire to be rich and famous and popular, just serve.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:22.480]   And you can, so that was okay.
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:26.320]   If you just close your eyes and you didn't see the images of the ramp trucks.
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:31.680]   How about, shall we get to alphabet?
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:32.960]   alphabet's revenue.
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:36.400]   This weekend.
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:41.280]   We talked a lot about the advertising on Twit before the Super Bowl.
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:43.200]   So I think we can wrap it up a little bit.
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:48.480]   Alphabet's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 results.
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:56.640]   Revenue 32 billion, this is three months, 32 billion dollars.
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:59.280]   That's a growth of 24% year over year.
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:00.800]   Not bad.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:06.000]   The operating income was up 24%.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.720]   The net income was a loss though.
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:09.840]   They lost three billion.
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:10.240]   Why?
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:12.160]   Because they had to pay.
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:14.800]   Well, that doesn't make any sense.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:20.160]   Nine billion dollars in taxes, it wouldn't have, it wouldn't have, well, maybe it would
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:21.600]   race their entire profits.
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:26.720]   Revenue from Google Properties, 22 billion from Advertising, 27 billion.
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:30.160]   Other bets, revenues, a mere 409 million.
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:31.600]   That's the nest, right?
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:33.040]   That's the nest and everything else.
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:36.480]   Other bets, not exactly huge revenue.
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:40.320]   So they're operating income 8.7 billion.
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:43.040]   The operating loss for other bets, almost a billion.
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:47.440]   916 million dollar loss for other bets.
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:48.320]   That's why you're-
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:49.440]   That's less though.
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:50.000]   That's-
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:50.640]   That's down.
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:51.920]   They have lost this down.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:52.480]   That's down.
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:58.800]   From 1.08 billion a year ago.
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:05.760]   So really the thing that you want to pay attention to though is the ad network, right?
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:08.240]   Oh, and cost for acquisition.
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:12.720]   Total acquisition costs when skyrocketed, right?
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:13.600]   Went up a lot.
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:19.120]   And so that's something a cause for concern for the market.
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:26.160]   Total acquisition costs as a percent of advertising revenues, 24% compared to 22% last year.
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:33.680]   And then the paid clicks, the change from Q3, they're still going up,
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:36.320]   but the acceleration has gone down.
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:40.800]   18% increase over year over year in aggregate paid clicks.
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:44.800]   That includes Google properties and the ad networks properties.
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:45.920]   By the way, it's interesting.
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:52.560]   Much more growth on Google property clicks, 19% than paid clicks on network properties,
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:52.800]   9%.
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:59:00.720]   Aggregate costs per click, negative 6%, 6%, drop of 6% in the cost per click,
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:04.800]   7% of Google properties and an increase of 1%.
[00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:14.720]   So the big input effect was the 9.9 billion in tax, but that's the tax that they pay to repatriate
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:18.960]   all that money that's been stored overseas.
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:19.840]   How much did they repatriate?
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:25.520]   I was wrong by the way, a few weeks ago on Apple, I gave the tax, not the amount they were.
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:31.360]   Yeah, the 38 billion in tax brought back to $250 billion in offshore.
[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:36.800]   So it's 50, whatever 9.9 billion is 15% of, because somebody do the math.
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:39.440]   It's more than 100.
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:40.960]   That's why God invented jet reform.
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:42.720]   More than $100 billion back.
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:44.880]   Let's put it that way, roughly $100 billion back.
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:51.600]   So what will they do with it? Not clear. Apple has said we will spend all of it.
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:56.880]   And I think Google will have to do the same because the money has to be allocated either
[00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:03.760]   to revenue generating expenditures or paid to the shareholders.
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:09.120]   Apple's going to give a lot of it in dividends and stock buybacks to shareholders.
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:10.720]   Stock buybacks benefit shareholders.
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:16.000]   I've learned from, and I'll give him credit again, Horace Deadeu at Asymco, who explained all of this,
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:22.320]   stock buybacks help shareholders because it means that value of one share goes up,
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:25.040]   because it's a bigger percentage of the company.
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.120]   And of course, dividends directly in the pocket.
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:32.960]   You can't just spend the money on something fun.
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:35.840]   You can't put a rocket into space.
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:39.280]   You have to do something that's going to benefit shareholders ultimately.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.240]   So, and the definition of that varies widely.
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:49.520]   I think Apple is spending some of that money, 30 billion on a new headquarters in Nevada,
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:55.120]   but that's going to house their call center and save money, I guess, in the long run because it's cheap.
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:57.760]   Google's going to spend 2 billion buying and it's building in Chelsea.
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:59.520]   Yeah, did you see that?
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:01.200]   Is that an effective building?
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.000]   An effective building.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:02.560]   The next door building.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:03.440]   Do you know that building?
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:04.000]   It's one behind.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.840]   Was it Chelsea Market? Is that what it's called?
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:06.720]   Chelsea Market, right?
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:11.280]   So, they're in their port authority building, which is the huge full block building where
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.560]   Google's New York headquarters is.
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:15.600]   They keep on getting more space in that and it's huge.
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:16.800]   It's an entire New York block.
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:20.720]   And because New York is the center of the universe, our blocks are really big.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:26.320]   It's the second largest acquisition deal ever in New York City.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:26.560]   Yes.
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:27.760]   Behind that is Chelsea Market.
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.520]   It looks like San Francisco.
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:33.920]   It looks kind of like the San Francisco Armory, which is currently the home of kink.com.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:36.320]   It's actually an old Nabisco factory, I believe.
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:37.680]   Is it a Biscuit factory?
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:38.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:39.440]   Oh, Nabisco.
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:41.360]   We're back to the beginning, huh?
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:43.040]   I think it was Nabisco, yeah.
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.560]   Wow.
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:45.760]   Now, Mondale.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:46.720]   Now, Mondalez.
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:47.600]   What is it pronounced?
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.080]   Mondale.
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.840]   Oh, is it Mondalez?
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:50.320]   I don't know.
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:52.720]   I don't think they make the best practice.
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:53.200]   Yeah, Nabisco.
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.120]   It was Nabisco, yeah.
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:56.080]   Okay.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.800]   The ground floor is a lively meandering hallway filled with food shops, restaurants,
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:00.960]   obviously.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.000]   It is very good.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:02.400]   Very good.
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:02.960]   It's like fun.
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:03.440]   Is it like the ferry building?
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:05.600]   Yeah, sounds like that.
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:06.320]   Or Laysal.
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:11.440]   Since you have to put this in your provincial terms, yes, I guess.
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:11.920]   Exactly.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.240]   I'm like, I'm just going to keep doing this all day.
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:16.240]   The Food Network.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.680]   The Food Network is in there.
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:18.320]   Oxygen.
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.320]   YouTube had a lot of space in there.
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.360]   Major League Baseball.
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.920]   I did the YouTube maker of spaces in there.
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:26.560]   Will they kick all these people out and just put all YouTube in there?
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:27.520]   I write it all Google in there.
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:28.640]   I don't know.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.400]   I think by bed as leases go,
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:35.600]   same thing with the Port Authority, but I also know that for instance, Cornell,
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:39.600]   which has a new campus on Roseborough Island in New York,
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:43.280]   their temporary space while it was being built was in the Google headquarters building.
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:43.520]   Wow.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:48.320]   Google has tons of space and you need more obviously.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:49.280]   Yeah, they're growing.
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:50.720]   Getting bigger.
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:57.120]   Is this the same Douglas Hofstadter as wrote Goedle Escherbach, John?
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:59.680]   Do you know Doug Hofstadter wrote in the Atlantic?
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:00.480]   Must be.
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.480]   The shallowness of Google Translate.
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:05.440]   The program uses state-of-the-art AI techniques,
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:08.640]   but simple tests show it's a long way from real understanding.
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:09.600]   Actually can't be.
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:13.680]   Is it or is it not?
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:14.320]   I don't know.
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:15.280]   Anyway, it's--
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:15.840]   That's the bio.
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:16.640]   Look at the bottom of the storage room.
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.200]   Look at the bottom.
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.080]   See if there's a bio.
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:18.800]   See?
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:22.000]   Jeff's giving us a little lesson in media literacy.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:22.640]   It shouldn't be.
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:23.360]   It shouldn't be at the top.
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:24.400]   So you say, who wrote this?
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:24.960]   I know, because you get it.
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:26.320]   No, you always got a stroke.
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:26.720]   There you go.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:27.440]   I don't want to put something on it.
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:30.160]   Does-- is a professor of-- yeah, it's him.
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:34.160]   He's the author of Goedle Escherbach, the professor of cognitive science
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:36.800]   and comparative literature at Indiana University of Bloomington.
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:39.520]   Very revered man.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:42.800]   That book Goedle Escherbach was very big of my generation.
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:43.280]   Big.
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:45.440]   I was like, I have no idea what you're talking about.
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:46.000]   Good.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.760]   I would say goodle Escherbach, but--
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:48.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:48.880]   Yeah.
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:49.280]   Good.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:53.280]   So oh, if you've never read Goedle Escherbach,
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:57.440]   and you've got a little free time and some extra tabs of acid,
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.040]   you just really have to try it.
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:02.400]   OK, I'll keep that in my agenda.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:05.520]   Next time I'm bored.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:07.680]   See, see, it is-- here's what's happening.
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:08.640]   Here's Stacy.
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:11.040]   Leo and I really are really living in the '60s right now.
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:11.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:14.400]   Space shots and turmoil.
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:15.920]   Now the drugs come in.
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.520]   We're too old for the sex.
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:20.880]   But other than that, total of the '60s stuff is coming out.
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.560]   Basically, it's the only thing we remember.
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:23.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:27.120]   And the '60s were so good to professional women.
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.480]   So I'm going to let y'all relieve it,
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.680]   but I'm going to stay up here.
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:31.040]   Oh, that's fine.
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:31.600]   That's fine.
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.240]   Yeah.
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:32.720]   Yeah.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:33.280]   Well, the '50s--
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:34.240]   Well, the '50s.
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.920]   I have to say, Stacy, the '20s
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:37.280]   tens haven't been much better.
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:41.280]   It's not like any era really was a golden era.
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:41.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:41.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:41.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:41.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:41.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:42.400]   We're quite--
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:46.880]   But I have much more opportunity now.
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:47.440]   Yes.
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:48.240]   That's true.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:48.240]   True.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:48.720]   True.
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:52.240]   Thanks to the hard work of your sisters
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:53.120]   in the '60s.
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:55.600]   Actually, people like my mom and my grandmother.
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.160]   That's right.
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:56.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.360]   They both were totally--
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:57.360]   Yeah.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:58.320]   That's not forget.
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.520]   OK.
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.080]   Let's not forget.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:01.120]   I'm not saying to stay--
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:03.200]   I'm not doing an nostalgia with the '60s.
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:05.200]   I'm just saying that it's just flashback time.
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.560]   Got it.
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:07.200]   That's all.
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:12.160]   We could flashback to my childhood or my teens in the '90s.
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:13.600]   Yeah, no, that wasn't a good era.
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:14.800]   Oh, no.
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:16.320]   John Perry Barlow has passed.
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:16.880]   Yes.
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:17.520]   Oh, no.
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.120]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:19.760]   Oh, no.
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:20.960]   That makes me so sad.
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.480]   Ben Hill for quite some time.
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:26.320]   John Perry Barlow was a grateful dead lyricist.
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.800]   We're the great gentleman of the open internet.
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:32.640]   A classy guy, a Montana rancher who also helped
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.800]   founded the Electronic Frontier Foundation
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:39.120]   and did so much to promote the free internet.
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:40.640]   Buddy, wasn't that old?
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:43.280]   No, he was-- he'd been ill.
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.920]   In fact, we went to a really wonderful benefit for him
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:49.040]   in San Rafael last year with--
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:54.240]   Bobby Weir of The Grateful Dead and Ramblin' Jack Elliott,
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.040]   Sean Lennon.
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:58.720]   It was a really amazing tribute to him to raise money
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:01.120]   for his hospital bills because he had been--
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:03.280]   What was the beginning of his ailment, do you know?
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.840]   Just piled on.
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.440]   I know, but I don't know where it started.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:11.200]   It says in his obituary, he'd been dealing with one health
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.520]   issue after another in recent years died when he asleep.
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:15.920]   He was only 70.
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:16.320]   You're right.
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:17.600]   It wasn't very old.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:23.600]   He led up a very energetic life and maybe he just
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:25.920]   burnt the candle faster than some of us.
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:30.640]   He was a fellow student at the Fountain Valley School
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:32.880]   in Colorado Springs with Bob Weir,
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:35.440]   so they went to high school together and were, of course,
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:36.640]   friends for years.
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:41.360]   He wrote many of the dead's iconic songs with Weir,
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.880]   including "Cassity, Throwing Stones,
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.320]   Hell in a Bucket, Lost Sailor,
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:47.360]   Saint of Circumstance, Black-Throated Wind."
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.280]   The music never stops.
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:50.960]   It looks like rain, Mexican-like blues.
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:55.280]   It was really fun to hear Bob Weir and his pickup band play
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:07:00.800]   many of those songs for the tribute there.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:02.800]   And John joined it via Skype.
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:05.840]   He joined the well in 1986.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:06.720]   I was there too.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:08.720]   Then four years later, 1990,
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:10.960]   founded the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.680]   He and Mitch Capor
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:16.000]   and John Gilmore,
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.480]   who was one of the cipher punks.
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:21.200]   And EFF, of course, remains to this day,
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:25.600]   a great fighter for the freedom of the internet.
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:28.000]   Many of us remember John Perry Barlow's.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.560]   In fact, I think you asked me to get him to read it again
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:32.240]   when I interviewed him on "Dranglehead."
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:32.240]   I did.
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:33.200]   I did.
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:33.680]   What was the...
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:36.560]   We the people of the internet.
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:36.880]   Yes.
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.160]   Did he do it?
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:39.040]   He didn't do it, right?
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.280]   He kind of...
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:41.680]   I don't know.
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:42.960]   We'll have to go back and find it.
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:45.440]   He finally did redo it.
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:45.840]   Yeah.
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:47.200]   He kind of poo-pooted.
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:48.000]   He was embarrassed.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:48.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:51.600]   But then I think he recognized how much it meant to people.
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.280]   It was the first...
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.240]   It's a wonderful document.
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:55.920]   It is a wonderful document.
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.840]   Kind of the first kind of statement that
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:00.640]   something was happening.
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:09.040]   That it was a nation of its own, sort of, right?
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:13.120]   The Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace.
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:15.360]   Written in doubles.
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:20.000]   Governments of the industrial world, you weary giants.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:20.800]   Give us some more.
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:21.200]   Give us some more.
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.080]   Give us some more.
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:22.480]   Give us some more.
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:23.360]   Do it for John.
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:24.080]   Do it for John.
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:30.560]   Governments of the industrial world, you weary giants of flesh and steel.
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:35.200]   I come from cyberspace, the new home of mind.
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.520]   On behalf of the future,
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:41.440]   I ask you of the past to leave us alone.
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:44.240]   You are not welcome among us.
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:47.680]   You have no sovereignty where we gather.
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:52.160]   We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one.
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:58.800]   So I address you with no greater authority than that which liberty itself always speaks.
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:01.120]   It's just beautiful.
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:01.840]   It does.
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:04.160]   I can't do it justice because it's so great.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:06.080]   And maybe I could find him reading it.
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:09.920]   He did finally read it about two years ago, I think.
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:20.560]   Anyway, I was privileged to have met him many times and talked to him and
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:20.800]   view him.
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:21.280]   Yeah, I was in here.
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:23.680]   I went to early loggercons with him.
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:26.240]   He was just a true, wonderful gentleman.
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:33.760]   I remember going to his home for a meeting of the EFF and others.
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:40.000]   Yeah, he was graceful, brilliant, fun, funny.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.960]   Yeah, gentlemen to the very end.
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:47.040]   We're really going to miss John Perry.
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:49.840]   I think it might be the last post that he put up on Facebook.
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.280]   It's just a beautiful little picture.
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:53.120]   I presume it's a granddaughter grandson.
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.640]   I'm getting a breast, I think.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:59.200]   And he loved his daughters dearly.
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:03.040]   The Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace.
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:16.080]   As written by John Perry Barlow at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on February 8th, 1996.
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:25.600]   Governments of the industrial world, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:37.920]   cyberspace, the new home of mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:41.520]   You are not welcome among us.
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:46.720]   You have no sovereignty where we gather.
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:53.920]   We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you with no
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:59.280]   greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks.
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:08.480]   I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:15.200]   tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us,
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:22.240]   nor do you possess any methods of enforcement. We have true reason to fear.
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:29.760]   Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:36.560]   You have neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you.
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:46.000]   You do not know us nor do you know our world. Cyberspace does not lie within your borders.
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:52.720]   Do not think that you can build it as though it were a public works project.
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:12:03.440]   You cannot. It is an act of nature, and it grows itself through our collective actions.
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:12.400]   You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you create the wealth of
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:19.120]   our marketplaces. You do not know our culture, our ethics, or the unwritten codes
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:27.680]   that already provide our society more order than could be obtained by any of your external
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:35.520]   impositions. You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve.
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:45.680]   You use this claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don't exist.
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:53.440]   Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will identify them and address them
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:13:03.200]   by our means. We are forming our own social contract. This governance will arise according
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:09.360]   to the conditions of our world, not yours. Our world is different.
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:20.800]   Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought, itself, a raid like a standing wave
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:29.200]   in the web of our communications. Hours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere,
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:38.960]   but it is not where bodies live. We are creating a world that all may enter
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:49.120]   without privilege or prejudice, accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:58.240]   We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere, may express his or her beliefs, no matter how
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:04.560]   singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:15.760]   Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not apply to us.
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:26.240]   They are based on matter. There is no matter here. Our identities have no bodies, so unlike you,
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:34.320]   we cannot obtain order by physical coercion. We believe that from ethics,
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:40.240]   enlightened self-interest, and the common wheel, our governance will emerge.
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:46.400]   Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions.
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:56.080]   The only law that all of our constituent cultures would generally recognize is the golden rule.
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:02.640]   We hope we will be able to build our particular solutions on that basis,
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:08.400]   but we cannot accept the solutions you are attempting to impose.
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:16.000]   In the United States, you have today created a law, the Telecommunications Reform Act,
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:22.400]   which repudiates your own constitution and insults the dreams of Jefferson,
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:33.600]   Washington, Mill, Madison, Duttoqueville, and Brandeis. These dreams must now be born new in us.
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:43.520]   You are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a world where you will always
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:53.440]   be immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:16:01.520]   you are too cowardly to confront yourselves. In our world, all the sediments and expressions
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:10.560]   of humanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole, the global conversation
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:20.160]   of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings beat.
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:28.000]   In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy, and the United States,
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:37.280]   you are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at the frontiers of cyberspace.
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:48.240]   These may keep out the contagion for a small time, but they will not work in a world that will soon
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:57.360]   be blanketed with bit-bearing media. Your increasingly obsolete information industries
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:06.640]   would perpetuate themselves by proposing laws in America and elsewhere that claim to own speech
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:17.360]   itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be another industrial product
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:28.960]   no more noble than pig iron. In our world, whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:37.680]   and distributed infinitely at no cost. The global conveyance of thought no longer requires
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:46.560]   your factories to accomplish. These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:55.360]   same position as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had to reject the
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:18:05.440]   authorities of distant, uninformed powers. We must declare our virtual selves immune to your sovereignty
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:15.280]   even as we continue to consent to your rule over our bodies. We will spread ourselves across
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:23.520]   the planet so that no one can arrest our thoughts. We will create a civilization of the mind in
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:32.000]   cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:45.120]   Davos Switzerland February 8, 1996 and read in New York City, July 30, 2013.
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:51.040]   So he wrote that 22 years ago, John Perry Barlow. Thank you for joining that.
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:58.640]   Yeah, well worth playing it. John Perry Barlow, I'm really touched today at the age of 70.
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:05.040]   I'm glad he recorded that and thanks to Idealog and the Q department for a department of records
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:10.960]   for making that recording and for posting it on Vimeo, you can find it on Vimeo if you search for it.
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:16.000]   I did ask him once to do that and he did say, "Ah, you know, I find it a little embarrassing or
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:23.040]   a little embarrassed by it." But it is definitely a relic of the early internet, 1996.
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:28.160]   But you know, after we need to remind ourselves, yes, as I'm listening to it, I'm thinking,
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:34.320]   "Oh, yeah, so then I realized, no, that really is the spirit of the internet and is still potentially
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:37.040]   what it should be. And that's what we still want to capture and preserve."
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:40.000]   That's what Kevin Marks does.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:52.160]   I'm like, "Oh, this feels so naive almost today." And we have clearly lost, I mean, the idea of ethics
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:57.760]   and civility, you know, in self-governing communities, no, that's not happening.
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.760]   Well, I think it's temporary.
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:00.720]   You need to still have a chance.
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:01.360]   That's the point.
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:01.920]   Yeah.
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:07.040]   It's temporary, but I'm hoping it will reassert itself.
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:19.120]   Yes, so sad to read Cindy Cones' obituary. It's at EFF.org, John Perry Barlow.
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:30.320]   Yeah, what a great man. And one of many of his generation who really gave us this internet.
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:35.280]   We are still just bits. And we, you know, I'm really glad we have it.
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:39.120]   And we have a lot more to do, I think, to preserve his vision and their vision.
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:45.680]   I put two pictures of them up in the chat just sort of the robust John to remember.
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:51.760]   Yeah. Yeah, he's been ill for some time. And he's been posting on Facebook, though.
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:54.960]   And I guess that's, I gather that's where you got these. He's been posting pictures
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:59.760]   for a while of this is...
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:00.880]   So John was a rancher.
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:03.680]   Right. Oh, I love this picture. I saw this.
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:09.600]   There's one. That's a late one with him and Bobby Weir enjoying a burger.
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:13.440]   That's probably not so long ago. I saw that recently.
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:18.800]   This is the picture I prefer to remember of John as the Montana rancher with his rifle on his
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:26.160]   shoulder and an early Macintosh on a fence post. Whether he's about to shoot it, I don't know.
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:36.480]   But yeah, John was one of the people from the 60s, Jeff, who never stopped living that life,
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:39.360]   you know? And I think it took him early, sad to say.
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:47.280]   But yeah, nice, nice image from John. There he is with his daughters, beautiful daughters,
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:55.600]   who loved him dearly and his ex-wife and yeah, Elaine Barlow and Justine and Leah and a winner.
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:59.520]   So for some of you in the audience, I know that
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:06.320]   it's been quite as meaningful, but it's a tribute worthwhile to somebody who really did help us.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:16.320]   Yeah. Here's the picture from the concert. They got together and there's Sean Lennon on the right
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:22.800]   and Bobby Weir with the beard and his Jerry Garcia t-shirt. This was an amazing show. I was
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:28.560]   so glad we got to see that and it was at Sweetwater in Mill Valley and a very small venue
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:34.720]   to see such great artists. Really, really a lot of fun. So thanks for that, Leo. Yeah.
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:43.120]   Okay. Sorry, guys. Oh yeah. So do you, when Stacey, when you hear that declaration of
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:46.320]   independence for cyberspace, does it sound like an antique to you?
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:56.560]   It sounds ideal. No, it doesn't sound antique. It sounds like the beginning of an era when
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:06.400]   everyone's hopeful and now we're living in what became of that era. So I think certain principles,
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:13.040]   like I had this great vision for IoT based on the open web and that's not happening.
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:17.760]   And the open web has been killed. I know, Kevin, you know, we could talk about this forever.
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:24.880]   Really? Is it dead? It's dead for most consumers. And so the question then becomes,
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:27.040]   Oh, God. You mean Facebook is the internet?
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:34.080]   For people? Yeah, Facebook, Twitter, all of these things are the internet. And if you go on your
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:38.880]   phone because most people access the internet through their phone, the phone is a terrible
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:44.800]   ecosystem for that. So yeah, I would argue that- The voice will probably be even more closed,
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:45.600]   right? Stacey?
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:55.520]   Voice is hideously closed. And the networks we're setting up right now for connected devices are
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:24:02.560]   they're not closed so much as they're just so fragmented, you can't pull anything together to
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:09.120]   make it meaningful. Like I wanted there to be standards so my sensors could talk to my other
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:13.440]   sensors and it would be very easy to pull things together. Yeah, no.
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:22.640]   And that is like the, you know, I wanted the hyperlink of things. So you could actually
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:29.040]   create cool stuff and that didn't happen. And I had all these like long tail visions and again.
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:30.880]   We still have to fight for it though. That's the point.
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:32.720]   And I do, but-
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:37.200]   You know, it's a star man and then it's star man over here.
[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:42.800]   It's still a baby. I mean, that was only 22 years ago. It's still a baby.
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:49.600]   I don't know if it's a baby. I think technology has grown up very fast and we're in,
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:56.320]   I mean, I don't want to think about internet years, right? But I think I feel a little dismayed.
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:57.600]   I feel like we've-
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:58.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:03.360]   If you read Tim Wu's The Kill Switch, basically what he described has happened.
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:04.960]   Yeah.
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:11.120]   And he, in the book he likened it, if I remember correctly, to the early long distance,
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:15.840]   or just telephone companies, where in the early days there were many, it was unregulated,
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:21.680]   it was vibrant and exciting and innovative, but eventually, you know, the big company,
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:27.600]   Ma Bell came in and squeezed it and took control of it and it went from being open to closed.
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:32.800]   And Tim Wu predicted several years ago, the same exact thing would happen to the internet.
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:37.280]   But he also pointed out that it's a pendulum and it swings.
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:40.880]   Yeah. And it's not just the internet. It's also society itself.
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:41.200]   Yeah.
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:44.400]   And during the research I am on this notion of the mass, I read a Frank.
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:48.960]   The New York Times in 1949 did like a 20 page section on this new thing, television.
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:55.280]   Fascinating, just amazing to go through. The ads are spectacular.
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:26:01.120]   If you have a few minutes, go to the Times, full archives, and I'll find the date for it if
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:07.200]   everybody wants it. But Frank Stanton wrote a piece talking about media now and how media
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:11.520]   had to appeal to everybody. They had to make things that everybody would like.
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:15.360]   That was the business imperative because that's what mass media meant.
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:21.280]   Or past that, the store talking to me, getting about VidCon that people can create.
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:24.720]   Yeah, they're making some junk now, of course they are. So did they were the first books,
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:29.920]   so did they were the early TV. But I disagree with Stacy. I think we're very, very early days still.
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:33.040]   I think that we can still grab on.
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:39.520]   I think there are plenty of places to create, plenty of opportunities to go beneath the
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:46.080]   commercial surface. And I think the web has made that easier. But I think it's always going to be
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:55.440]   an alternative vision or activity. So to dig in, to dig underneath and to really play with
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:01.360]   the open internet as it is, I think is going to be very much a hacker mindset, very much an
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:06.720]   alternative. Think about like zines back in the 70s and 80s, right? It's going to be that kind of.
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:11.360]   Yeah, but I also think I'll go overboard Stacy, which is what I do.
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:18.000]   Let's go back to the Hudson's Bay Company. The pilgrims were not a religious venture,
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.720]   as Boucherry and Evasen points out in his book. They were an economic venture. They were backed
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:27.520]   by capital. They were here to take riches back to Europe and to hell with the natives.
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:31.440]   And it was impurely accurate. They were here for the cold of all things.
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:36.240]   Yeah, we were wrong. We did have a nation of principles that rose from that.
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:40.960]   Yeah, it took a few hundred years. It took a lot of time. It took it took oppression. It took
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:46.000]   difficulty. But something rose from it that had principles that we fear now we're losing.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:52.000]   I'm not ready to give up. I'm depressed too. I agree with you, but I'm not ready to do that.
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:59.840]   And I'm just what will it take to see that and when will it happen? And that's the other question.
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:04.480]   I'm going to be too old to see it. Your daughter, I hope we'll see it. But just remember,
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:10.640]   Star Man is above. Thank God. Star Man is above and rapidly leaving this
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:19.200]   orbit. Get the hell out of here. I'd rather be an asteroid belt.
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:25.840]   Rod, new people. To bring us down to Earth Sunday was Facebook's 14th birthday.
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:32.960]   And Mark Zuckerberg posted his thoughts in which he admitted many mistakes.
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:38.640]   It's a moment to reflect. He says on how far we've come from that dorm room at Harvard
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:42.000]   and how far we still have to go to bring the world closer together, a moment to think about
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:47.520]   what we need to do better. People ask what I've learned along the way. I was 19. God.
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:51.920]   When I started Facebook and I didn't know anything about building a company or global
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:57.200]   internet service over the years, I've made almost every mistake you can imagine. I've made dozens of
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:02.080]   technical errors and bad deals. I've trusted the wrong people. I put talented people in the wrong
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:07.040]   roles. I've missed important trends. I've been slow to others. But it's marked in a 12 step.
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:10.000]   I've launched the product after the product that failed. They're all there.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.160]   Practice self-flagellation over there. Oh, is it time for self-flagellation? They're all doing it.
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:18.400]   They're all doing it. Yeah. Maya, kalpa, maya, kalpa, maya, maxima, kalpa.
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:22.560]   The reason our community exists today, not because we avoided mistakes. Oh,
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:26.560]   wait a minute. Here's the turn around. It's because we believe what we're doing
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:31.440]   matters enough to keep trying to solve our greatest challenges. Knowing full well will
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:35.280]   fail again and again, but that's the only way to make progress. Isn't this what they've been
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:41.120]   saying all along, which is? Okay, this is Mark. This fails fast. Yeah. I mean,
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:47.920]   let's revoke everybody's privacy on Facebook. Oh, God. I didn't mean to do that. I pushed
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:53.760]   this button instead of that button. It's like, wait, my bad. I know it's not my bad.
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:30:00.160]   So I'm like, eh, maya, kalpa. I don't care. We're still early in this journey. We'll keep
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:05.520]   work, compare this to John Barry Barlow on Barry Barlow. We're still early in this journey,
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:09.360]   and we'll keep working to improve. That focus has always been our strength. And that's what
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:13.920]   this year is all about bringing us closer together with our family and friends matters.
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:17.760]   And 14 years in, I'm proud of what we do and grateful to be a part of something so meaningful.
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:21.040]   It's an honor to be on this journey with you, blah, blah, blah. Yeah, it's very kind of a
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:27.600]   pabble. But I don't know. It doesn't. It's your right. It tested well. It tested well.
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:34.640]   The pollsters said, Mark, this is the, you should release this. I would love for Mark to be sincere.
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:41.440]   And I wish that people in charge of our companies, we can hate Travis Calicanic all we want.
[01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:45.280]   But he was sincere. But he is sincerely an asshole.
[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:49.360]   But he was sincere. So you could see him coming. Yeah, you knew it.
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:54.480]   Well, I think Stacy, I've been many years since I've met him face to face, but I think
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:58.400]   I think Zuckerberg is sincere about the relationship. That's my question.
[01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:02.960]   World's a better world. The problem is I think that their definitions, I wrote about this
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:08.400]   two weeks ago, I think their definitions are too simplistic and shallow and temporal.
[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:15.600]   And yes. And the problem is, I've talked to people in various of these companies.
[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:21.440]   And I think they think that they've oddly for a company like Google that has become a mobile
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:25.520]   company and a car company and everything else and Facebook has become a VR company and all this
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:32.800]   kind of other stuff. They're so wed to the data they have that they're the bad assumption that's
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:37.360]   built in there is that their tools are done. And we're just listening to what people are doing.
[01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:40.720]   Well, they're doing what they can with the tools you gave them. And the tools are too
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:45.920]   simplistic. And you have to have a much richer and more nuanced view of what community is
[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:52.160]   and what society is. And you've got to, that's not about throwing stuff against the wall and
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:58.080]   failing. It's about having deeper thoughts about what you can do with this power.
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:01.440]   And that's where I get disappointed. I don't think they're thinking big enough, actually.
[01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:09.040]   Numbers are down this quarter. And some say it's, I think Facebook says it's the change in
[01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:14.640]   algorithm. And we're giving up some daily active users. We're giving up some time spent reviewing
[01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:21.520]   to be more responsible. War others say, Hey, it's Facebook on its way out finally.
[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:27.520]   Boy, did you read the article or the tweet actually storm from the from funnier dye?
[01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:32.720]   How Facebook is killing comedy. This is actually an interview with Sarah as well.
[01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:40.880]   So right. Split cider. Mike Farah, the CEO of Funny or Die wrote on Twitter, Mark Zuckerberg
[01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:46.320]   just walked in and laid off all my friends. He didn't, of course, but he says there's simply no
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:54.160]   money. Actually, his colleague, Matt, Matt Klinnman wrote this on Twitter. There's simply no money in
[01:32:54.160 --> 01:33:00.480]   making comedy online anymore. Facebook completely destroyed independent digital comedy. And we need
[01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:07.360]   to effing talk about it. So they, so this is the interview with Klinnman. I put this up on the
[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:13.840]   on the run. I said skating. But it's interesting if you look apart from the news world, now you look
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:18.480]   at the comedy world and the impact. It's let's just call it the content world. And I feel like I
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:23.680]   dodged a bullet because when Facebook started doing live video and everybody said, Oh, you got
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:27.360]   them. I was trying to talk into it. I was. I would quit on Facebook. Go to, you know, I got,
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:32.160]   I'd heard the same arguments for YouTube. This is this is Klinnman. The whole story is basically
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:37.280]   Facebook gets so much traffic that they started convincing publishers to post things on Facebook
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:41.520]   for a long time. That was fine. People posted things on Facebook. Then you'd click those links,
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:48.240]   go to their websites. But then gradually, Facebook started exerting more and more control of what
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:54.320]   was being seen to the point that they, not our website, essentially became the main publishers
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:34:00.640]   of everyone's content. Today, there's no reason to go to a comedy website that has a video. If
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:05.280]   that video is just right on Facebook and that would be fine if Facebook compensated those companies
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:11.040]   for the ad revenue that was generated from these videos, but Facebook does not pay publishers.
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:20.000]   So there's no more money to make content. Cracks. Same thing. And people had a funny
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.520]   comment about, no, the oatmeal did a funny comic about this a while back.
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:26.800]   Gosh, he ought to try to find him.
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:30.880]   He feels bad because he says people blame the companies. He says, I'm a labor dude. I'm a proud
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:36.160]   member of the WGAE. I'm more than happy to get mad at management about something. But that's not
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:41.920]   the problem. The problem is Facebook is our editor and our boss. They decide what's successful
[01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:47.120]   and what isn't successful via seemingly meaningless metrics. They hide behind algorithms. They change
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:51.760]   constantly. And it seems to me they're not favoring things that are high quality. They're
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:56.320]   favoring things that are clickbait, things that are optimized for Facebook, low quality things that
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:35:01.520]   appeal to the lowest common denominator. And honestly, just things at random.
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:09.600]   Facebook has this is the thing. This is in direct opposition to the hope we all had in 1996 with
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:15.360]   Barlow wrote the Declaration of Independence of Cyber Space. Facebook has created a centrally
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:19.840]   designed internet. It's a lamer, crappier looking internet. It's just not as cool as an
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:24.960]   internet. It is a big chaotic space filled with tons of independently operating websites.
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:29.360]   We're able to make a living because they make something cool. People want to see.
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:35.920]   I dropped that comic in the chat.
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:42.320]   Let's look at the oatmeal. Let's see the oatmeal. Let me do it because I can use my magic powers.
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:44.160]   So cool.
[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:51.200]   AKA my Microsoft Surface Studio and zoom in on it here. Let me copy this.
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:59.920]   Every time I look at a page now on Microsoft's Edge browser somehow Chrome pops up and things
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:05.680]   thing. You know, the web looks much better on Chrome. Reaching people on the internet.
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:11.520]   How it used to be. Come on over. I've got some neat stuff here. Matt's website email.
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:18.240]   NetVibes. Remember NetVibes? RSS. Yeah. What happened? Actually, follow me over there. It'll
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:22.480]   be easier for us to reach each other. Facebook. Welcome new active users.
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:27.280]   Where we're at now. Hey, I made some new stuff. Can you show it to my followers?
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:36.080]   Facebook. Doors, door locks engaged. Oh, F promotion. Boost this post for $10,000 and
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:43.520]   reach a fraction of your followers. Isn't that bad? That's where the moral hazard does lie
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:48.960]   for both companies, but especially Facebook. Yeah. Both companies, you mean Google and Facebook?
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:52.240]   Yeah. Yeah. But especially Facebook. It is definitely more.
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:55.920]   Clinton says Facebook's running a payola scam. You have to pay them if you want your own fans
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:59.520]   to see your content. That's basically what the oatmeal was saying. Yeah.
[01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:11.120]   In some ways, that's true. I mean, I'm lucky. You're lucky because our audience isn't as
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:18.000]   Facebook focused. But if you were like, if I were a blogger about family life or something like that,
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.280]   I would have to be on Facebook. I guess you would. But at your peril.
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:28.960]   Well, yes. But there, I mean, like many moms who, you know, let's say I'm doing a recipe blog.
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:32.720]   Those people aren't always on Twitter. So I would.
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:37.040]   Did the all Jeff go out of business because of this too, you think?
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:43.360]   All who? A.W.L. All the all. I think. A.L.L.
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:50.720]   I think it's. No, I'll tell you why the all went out of business. I just went to their website
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:54.160]   and it got taken over by an AT&T ad. Okay.
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:38:01.600]   The at least Facebook doesn't do that. Well, that and that is the issue is that the advertising,
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:07.680]   we still are trying to replicate a scarcity based ad model and abundance based world.
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:14.320]   Prices go down, desperation goes up and you can't get enough audience to the ads when there's
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:18.720]   there's unlimited competition. And the first things that go away, by the way,
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:27.360]   are things like the all which are nichey, cutesy, fun. They don't have the resources or
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:31.040]   funny or die or cracked. They don't have the reason. Because advertisers and agencies are
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:35.200]   stupid because all they'll buy still is volume when they should be in a different world where
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:38.080]   they value something like the all because it's could have a different relationship.
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:43.040]   Don't get me started on that one, boy. I don't know. I mean, people who read the all are probably
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:47.760]   not your ideal consumers. Yeah, no. But but but but we have the same problem.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:52.400]   No, we have the same problem with that buys for two because we don't have the mass numbers.
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:54.800]   We don't get those big. You get them right.
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:39:01.120]   I'd adds. But when people but when people try as they go, wow, we've never had such good results.
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:05.520]   Thank you for teaching us. We'll use these lessons. I know. They immediately.
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:11.680]   I can name them. You know them. You've seen them on shows over the last 10 years.
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:16.560]   And now you see them on Super Bowl ads. Yeah, I think I'm going to shave on my mattress.
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:22.000]   You see them on Super Bowl ads with my with my special snacks that come.
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:29.040]   I really. Yeah. Well, but okay. But that's I don't mind. No, no, I actually don't. You're right. I
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:34.720]   know Stacy, right? I don't mind that. That's success. And there's always going to be another
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:39.440]   company that I can help make into a bigger company. I'm not complaining. We actually,
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:43.040]   it's interesting. I think really, if there's anything going on in podcasting,
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:47.200]   the softening of advertising podcasting, which is as far as I could tell, universal,
[01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:51.200]   is because just so many podcasts. Well, so many. And I saw it. By the way,
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:54.400]   I think you're announced all the time. Yeah. If you're listening to this show, still, thank you.
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:58.800]   Because I know that just as they say on an airplane, you have many other choices.
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:07.680]   Thank you for flying air, Twit. No, it's true. And man, they're really good.
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:16.560]   That's the hard part. Like, sorry. We went from, we went from like just a few things that,
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:21.360]   but there's a lot of really good shows there. I'm sorry. It's in fact, it's, it's kind of like
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:29.440]   it happened with peak TV with Netflix and HBO. And we're now in peak, I think peak podcasting where
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:34.240]   there's too. There's so many good shows, many, many great shows, much more deserving, frankly,
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:37.920]   than any of my shows are just buried because nobody finds out about them.
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:41.440]   There's simply is not enough time. Yeah. There's,
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:45.120]   this is where I think the problem is that an information based, so the one problem is an
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:50.640]   abundance versus scarcity based model. Another one is a, is a, is an attention based versus value
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:58.400]   based model. And attention is not the only asset out there, but, but it's what we're all fighting
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:03.200]   for. And there's a limit. So what do you think of a wired decision to go behind a paywall?
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:07.520]   So I'm going to go ahead and do my, my, my number of the week since you asked.
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:10.720]   Well, you could save it if you want. We'll, we'll save the discussion for that.
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:12.800]   We'll come back to that. We'll come back to that. Yeah. Let's come back to that. Because it's
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:17.280]   related, right? Just very, very much. And by the way, as long as we're talking about the good old
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:26.000]   days, here is thanks to CERN, the very first website, actually, let me, let me do it.
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.800]   A nicer font than it was. Well, no, let me do it this simulator. This is a 300-bod
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:37.760]   simulator, the world wide web. This is Tim Berners Lee in 1989, his first generation.
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:43.280]   And it really looks a lot like Gopher, right? I mean, it's a text base. He was a physicist
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:49.200]   at the particle accelerator in CERN, Switzerland. He had one of Steve Jobs' beautiful, but poorly
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:57.040]   selling Mac, next cubes. And he said, I think I could write something that would be able to
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:02.720]   let my colleagues and I share our physics papers and comment on them,
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:10.160]   cross-link and so forth. And so he created something he called the world wide web.
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:14.800]   And this is it, the very first page. CERN is brought it back, info.cERN.ch.
[01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:19.760]   And you can browse it. It really is very much like Gopher, frankly.
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:25.040]   And it's, and what's nice is they've simulated a 300-bod modem as well.
[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:28.320]   Oh, the sound of days.
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:33.520]   No, I don't have a sound. You can get your modem sound on YouTube.
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:39.520]   Should you want the modem sound? Yeah, yeah, that's pretty cool. The world wide web,
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:46.320]   we have come a long way. Let's see. All right, let me just quickly say, oh, I should mention
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:51.040]   the rumor and it's not a fact, but it's an interesting rumor that Google is going to launch
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:59.520]   a streaming gaming service. Let me find the article here because I skipped, I skipped past this. Yeti
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:04.000]   is the codename. This comes, of course, from Jessica Lessons, the information.
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.480]   She's found a way. Don't even see this is the problem. We go to the Verge article, but it really
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:13.040]   comes from the information. But what's the information cost? 400 bucks a year.
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:20.160]   $400 a year. I subscribe. I do too. It's behind a paywall. And so, often what will happen is the
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:27.280]   tweets and the Facebooks and all that, they have to mention the Verge's rehash of what,
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:31.440]   to their credit, the Verge says it's from the information. Service code. They know they're
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:35.920]   getting the traffic. Yeah, but a mirror Friday, of course, it was great sources, Kevin McLaughlin.
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:40.640]   The service code named Yeti would put Google at the forefront of a nascent part of the video
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:46.400]   game business streaming gaming. It's a hundred and nine billion dollar video game market.
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:51.680]   The company is developing a subscription based game streaming service that would work,
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:58.160]   well, hard to tell on Chromecast, maybe. I bet though, more likely a Google made console
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:00.640]   still being developed according to people with knowledge of the project.
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:07.440]   So that's an interesting new business for Google. They'd be going up against some pretty big
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:13.760]   competition on that. And companies that went out of business, what was the first one of these?
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:19.520]   I'm trying to remember the name of it. It was pretty cool and they ended up folding,
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:27.920]   getting sold off for scrap. We'll be getting the HomePod on Friday. We can do a head-to-head
[01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:34.560]   comparison against the Google Home Max, the Sonos One, bigger speakers, but those who have played
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:39.760]   with it and the reviews have started coming out on Tuesday say it sounds amazing for its size.
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:42.720]   Amazing. Yes. Well, this is the Google product.
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:45.920]   Like it should. No, this is the Apple HomePod.
[01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:50.640]   350 bucks. It's got Siri built into it. It's direct competition for Google Home.
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:54.640]   But it's not. It's a bit. It's yeah.
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:58.720]   It's really an Apple even doesn't want to position. Actually, truthfully,
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:04.480]   I think what Apple's doing is interesting. They don't want to position as another
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:08.960]   echo or assistant in the house. They don't have the ability.
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:14.400]   No, I think that they weren't even aiming at that. They want to reinvent sound. They want to
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:20.160]   reinvent speakers. Remember how we've been talking so much about computational photography? How
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:27.280]   a smartphone can do so much more with a really simple, inexpensive lens because of the software
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:32.960]   and the hardware, the processing that can make a better image in the Google Pixel 2 is amazing
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:38.960]   in that regard. Apple wants to do the same thing with speakers. This computational audio, I believe.
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:44.240]   And so one speaker does what we got out of college. We had to have eight speakers around the
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:50.240]   apartment. And if you had a eight of this speaker, they would all know about each other and automatically
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:56.400]   shape the music to fill the room in a unique way. And the only reason I think this is because
[01:45:56.400 --> 01:46:01.520]   Renee Richie from Macbreak Weekly and I'm More and others went to Apple for a briefing.
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:07.200]   And Apple really, they showed him the testing rooms. They really focused on the acoustics.
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:12.240]   And I got the message that you should stop thinking left, right stereo.
[01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:19.520]   You have to have two speakers left and right that one speaker with computational audio
[01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:26.880]   can give you a full sound. Do you believe that? Well, I'll find out Friday. But the people I've
[01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:35.280]   read, like Neeliah Patel, who is an absolute stereo nut, a speaker hound, was raving about this,
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:41.040]   which really surprises me. Really, did you have quadrophonic on the day? Oh, you bet. Of course,
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:47.440]   you did with a little joystick. You could make the music go around and around. That,
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:53.760]   funnily enough, really was as its successor and surround sound. And I, you know, all of my stereo
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:59.920]   systems now have a center channel left, right and rear speakers. Music isn't mixed for it, but
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:06.560]   TV is some music is mixed for it. So I'll be very interested. I, that's what I'm going to say about
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:10.960]   it. And again, we don't have it yet. So I can't say, I think it's interesting because I think
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:15.440]   that Apple's going for not just another voice assistant. I think that's secondary to what
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:19.680]   Apple's really trying to say is computational audio. We could do something different.
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:27.600]   But is that on? Thank you, Mars. That's not, that's not sustainable long term, because it's a
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:31.040]   tech knife. It's a wonderful technology. Others won't figure out how to do it too. Yeah.
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:34.880]   The whereas the assistant has a relationship with you that you started to depend upon. That
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:39.440]   is going to be higher. Apple has a better relationship than the assistant. Apple has
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:46.960]   Apple has the ecosystem. Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. The dog disagreed with me. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:52.000]   Apple. Another dog was an Apple fan. No, dog has Apple has, Apple has,
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:58.560]   dog has ecosystem. That's a bigger play. So I was going to talk about that just in context of
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:07.440]   Apple's health moves because I think Apple is really good at some things and really terrible
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:14.000]   at others. So if you think about the relationship I might have with Apple as a consumer of digital
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:21.760]   services, I loathe them. But as a consumer, as a repository for my information, it looks very
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:29.040]   interesting as a health consumer or as a place to store my contacts. So I think that's kind of an
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:34.160]   interesting, I don't know, bifurcation. I don't know if a lot of other people have this, but
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:39.840]   the things that make Apple awesome privacy, etc, are good in some spheres. And the things that
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:45.520]   it's so terrible at like cloud services make it really bad and things where I want it to predict
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:50.400]   what I want and deliver things to me. Maybe, maybe, and that's why Siri isn't as a big a part of
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:54.480]   this play as it could be. Remember that Apple Music, according to the Wall Street Journal,
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:49:01.120]   is about to beat Spotify in the US. They're growing at 5% a month now, Spotify only 2% in the page
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:06.800]   tier. Who is buying this? I can't understand why you would want to. It's an ecosystem. It's an
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:14.560]   ecosystem play. If you have an iPhone, an iPad, a Mac, and now the HomePod, the HomePod only works
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:20.160]   with Apple music. Well, I know, but that's to me like a huge reason not to go into that ecosystem.
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:25.520]   Unless you're already in it, in which case, it's like, the balmy waters of Apple, I'm just going to
[01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:32.640]   lie back and let go. I think she was upset because I was trying to say something. And then,
[01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:37.520]   you know, we stop and she's like, Oh, no, you're paying attention. Stacey.
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:40.560]   It worked. And now she's fine.
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:47.280]   Cartiogram study, by the way, says the Apple Watch can detect diabetes with 85% accuracy.
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:55.760]   That is amazing. This is a clinical study. This is another holy grail of wearables is
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:50:02.880]   this massive and growing rapidly market of type two, type one, type two, the first place
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:07.760]   or ongoing blood sugar. 14,000 Apple Watch users. No, it's not blood sugar because Apple Watch
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:13.520]   doesn't have any blood sugar capabilities. No, using the heart rate sensor, it detected that
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:20.320]   of 14,000 users. 462 of them had diabetes. 90 Oh, women, I'm sorry.
[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:28.720]   abnormal heart rhythm, 97% accuracy, sleep apnea, not apnea, 90% accuracy, hypertension, 82% accuracy.
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:34.160]   But diabetes, that's the holy grail. You get that and it's 85% accurate.
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:40.160]   Now, well, it's not the holy grail because the holy grail is actually insulin detection without
[01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:47.120]   blood sugar. Blood sugar. I didn't even know. My mother was a diabetic, told her, well,
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:52.000]   obviously, when she got it, type one, but the new monitor that you leave on your arm,
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:56.000]   did you know about this thing? No. Oh, it's still intrusive. I didn't know about it.
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:00.400]   It's still intrusive. Phil Lippon was wearing it. Yeah. But it constantly checks in.
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:06.160]   It's very bad in your finger. I'm a type two diabetic early stages. In fact,
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:08.800]   so there's two things to say here. One early detection is huge.
[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:15.760]   Yep. And that's what this does. That's what this does. But the being able to measure it constantly
[01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:22.080]   is huge too, because then you could start making correlations between behavior, blood sugar.
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:28.480]   You can respond to problems with your blood sugar faster. This is all going to be, this is all
[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:36.800]   very important with a hundred million Americans with prediabetes or diabetes and 25% undiagnosed
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:43.760]   according to the CDC. And for people who deal with aging in place or with kids,
[01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:48.880]   this actually gives you the capability to monitor them from afar. Very interesting. Yes.
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:54.320]   Very interesting. Or A, sorry, not this, but a connected device that...
[01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:59.520]   Well, and this is another one, Jeff, like computational music that Apple can't patent and own.
[01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:06.640]   But there are a lot of Apple watches out there. It's just one more reason to come on in.
[01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:15.120]   I would buy an Apple watch, if it were slightly less expensive and I didn't have to have the...
[01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:18.560]   I mean, because it only works with the phone. So to buy into the ecosystem,
[01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:21.920]   how much is the watch now? 350, you can get it for you.
[01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:28.080]   So 350 plus an $800 phone to buy into basically something I would want to use only for healthcare.
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:34.240]   It's healthcare prices. Now, what happens is though, it starts that way. That's the whole...
[01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:38.400]   Well, I know. This is the strength right now of Apple's ecosystem play.
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:45.440]   It's just one of many entry points. Most people get in via the iPhone and then they get the watch.
[01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:49.360]   So now you have Amazon, which is going to have a health company, is going to have the drugs,
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:53.680]   has the watch that they've just patented for their workers, which they'll do other things with.
[01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:56.560]   The Amazon ecosystem could be very competitive.
[01:52:56.560 --> 01:53:03.760]   A lot of the music. I think Amazon health is fascinating and I would never bet against Jeff Bezos in any respect.
[01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:10.080]   No. He's impressive. Actually, Amazon's income was pretty good too.
[01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:17.520]   On Twitter this week, we had Sam Maszkowich, Mars Technica, who had the headline of the week.
[01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:24.080]   "Alexa, print money, even Bezos stunned by Amazon's Q4 Amazon.
[01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:30.480]   Keep wearing income. Exceeds operating income estimate by 69% and this is what you were talking
[01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:38.800]   about. The Echo has been very, very good. They don't break out Echo sales, but Jeff Bezos said,
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:47.520]   "Optimistic projections for Echo have been exceeded along with a vague sales figure of tens of millions
[01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:53.120]   of Echo-related devices throughout all of 2017. Tens of millions is an interesting number because
[01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:58.160]   it took Amazon 10 years to sell tens of million kindles."
[01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:02.240]   Yeah, it goes pretty successful.
[01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:09.600]   There was just Sipper, is that the consumer or something, research, something. They did a report
[01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:16.240]   saying that there were 34 million Echo sold. That's tens of millions, yes. It's certainly more
[01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:21.680]   than 11 million all in on net devices. 34 million is nothing to sneeze at.
[01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:27.600]   I am not sneezing. I wouldn't say they've saturated the market. I think there's still a big upside.
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:35.200]   Actually, this one is for you, Stacey. Sprint says they're going to launch the first
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:42.400]   mobile 5G network next year. Do you think this is hype or do you think they'll be able to do it?
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:48.240]   They do have big money with SoftBank now. They do. In 2019 is when we should start seeing the first
[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:56.720]   mobile, the chips for mobile handsets. It's not crazy talk. It won't be widespread.
[01:54:56.720 --> 01:55:00.160]   We're working with Qualcomm and networking device manufacturers in order to launch the
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:04.000]   first really mobile 5G network by the first half of 2019.
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:11.840]   First half, that feels iffy. It's very optimistic. The reason they think they can do that is they
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:20.240]   will actually use existing cell towers, put MIMO antennas, massively MIMO antennas on top of those.
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:29.520]   They can add these capabilities to about half their existing towers. Then they will do these
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:37.360]   macro towers. They'll increase those by 20%. Then 40,000 outdoor small cell solutions. Then
[01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:46.400]   15 strand-mounted small cells in cable boxes. Something called the Sprint Magic Box.
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:55.280]   There'll be a million and it is magical, a million Sprint Magic Box. That's interesting.
[01:55:55.280 --> 01:56:00.240]   That fits because the spectrum, I'm trying to see what spectrum is playing.
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:07.040]   They have the 2.5 GHz. They have about 160 MHz of the 2.5 GHz band.
[01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:12.800]   Okay. That's good propagation. It's not awesome.
[01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:19.280]   It's not 700 MHz, but it's not like 34 millimeter band, which is what some people are looking at.
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:25.440]   Yeah, 18,000 Verizon are going to do millimeter wave. This is a better place.
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:26.400]   I love what we've talked about.
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:34.560]   The CEO said Sprint is the only carrier that doesn't have to compromise with 5G can deliver
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:39.760]   because we can deliver super wide channels of more than 100 MHz while still delivering mid-band
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:43.040]   coverage characteristics. That's the propagation we were talking about.
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:46.160]   That is pretty powerful, awesome stuff.
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:53.520]   I got rid of my Sprint phone years ago because they just really fumbled the future with YMAX.
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:56.240]   I would love to see them come back. Competition is good for everybody.
[01:56:56.240 --> 01:56:58.000]   It'll be good. It'll be very good for a world.
[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:09.080]   -All right. Let me see. I'm just making sure that we haven't missed any big big big stories.
[01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:16.020]   -Google has a new access chief. I only bring it up because they announced it today after the earnings.
[01:57:16.020 --> 01:57:21.060]   I'm thinking, "Hey, the Nest News came out today." Oh, no, they announced it yesterday.
[01:57:21.060 --> 01:57:26.580]   So apparently-- -The new chairman of the board too.
[01:57:26.580 --> 01:57:29.560]   -The chairman of the board. -The chairman of the board too.
[01:57:29.560 --> 01:57:32.560]   -So he's left entirely now? -I think so.
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:35.560]   -We'll see that out as chairman. -Maybe he's going to MIT.
[01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:41.840]   -Yeah. So access is new chairman is trumpeted at the--
[01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:44.680]   -Or CEO. -Oh, I'm sorry. You're right, CEO.
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:47.560]   -Google has a new chairman. -Google has a new CEO.
[01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:56.960]   -Dinesh Jane or Denny, as he's called, he was CEO at Time Warner Cable, and he's the CEO of Access.
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:57:59.120]   -All right. -Which is amazing because you probably
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:02.560]   wouldn't leave Time Warner if Google Fiber were dead.
[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:06.160]   -Yeah. -Or maybe you would. I don't know.
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:08.560]   -I would leave Time Warner.
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:10.400]   [laughter]
[01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:15.880]   Time Warner Cable was bought as part of the chairman's stuff.
[01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:19.840]   -I know. It's spectrum. -So he probably needed a new job anyway,
[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:21.720]   because you don't need two COOs.
[01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:24.680]   -Yeah, that's true. -I don't know.
[01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:28.360]   -Eric was not chairman. He was executive chairman, which was a kind of--
[01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:30.760]   -Oh, that's right. -Crapped title.
[01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:34.480]   -Okay, thanks for clarifying. -Yeah.
[01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:40.160]   Let's wrap her up here, coming up our number, our tool, our thing.
[01:58:40.160 --> 01:58:43.160]   But first a word from WordPress.
[01:58:43.160 --> 01:58:48.800]   Love WordPress. You know, building something new, something others can connect with.
[01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:50.680]   It's a lot easier if you have the right tools.
[01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:54.040]   I don't care if it's a house or your new website.
[01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:57.960]   I love WordPress.com. We're thrilled to have them as a sponsor.
[01:58:57.960 --> 01:59:00.360]   We use WordPress. I use WordPress. I don't--
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:03.080]   Who's the we? I use WordPress.com every day.
[01:59:03.080 --> 01:59:05.720]   It's where my blog, LeoLaport.com is.
[01:59:05.720 --> 01:59:10.680]   And whether you're looking to create a personal blog, a business site, or both,

[01:59:41.480 --> 01:59:45.240]   By the way, those business plans, hundreds of plugins and themes.
[01:59:45.240 --> 01:59:48.440]   I immediately turn on-- For everything I've said about Google AMP,
[01:59:48.440 --> 01:59:51.720]   of course, I turned on the AMP plugin on my WordPress site.
[01:59:51.720 --> 01:59:54.600]   So it loads fast on mobile. Of course I did.
[01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:57.560]   I've got HTTPS automatically.
[01:59:57.560 --> 02:00:02.200]   The Akismet blog plugin is the best way to kill spam
[02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:06.280]   ever, anywhere, on your blog. I can go on and on. Great plugins.
[02:00:06.280 --> 02:00:09.160]   And a great support team of real WordPress experts.

[02:00:27.560 --> 02:00:28.600]   It's the other way around.
[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:33.560]   All of the world has websites that are run 29% of all--
[02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:35.080]   Just like it says there.
[02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:37.560]   WordPress powers 29% of the internet.
[02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:39.400]   Thank you. Can't start it today.
[02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:41.080]   Math is hard.

[02:00:55.560 --> 02:01:00.680]   I have a couple of things I'm going to mention and then we'll get to Stacy's number.
[02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:03.160]   I just-- Stacy's thing and Jeff's number.
[02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:06.200]   I just have to tell everybody to read this article in The New Yorker.
[02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:08.600]   I think it's available for free without a subscription.
[02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:10.600]   Why paper jams persist?
[02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:16.360]   And it's actually not about like paper jams per se.
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:25.720]   It's about technological issues proposed by paper jams and the fascinating industrial design
[02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:33.560]   that goes in to preventing paper jams in your fax machine and your copier--
[02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:34.040]   Good work.
[02:01:34.040 --> 02:01:38.520]   Yeah. I don't know.
[02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:41.640]   Chester Carlson. Chester Carlson, whose name was just passed by,
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:45.000]   is an important inventor because he invented the zero graphic process.
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:45.320]   Yes.
[02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:48.360]   And by the way, Xerox 3.0 more.
[02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:50.520]   No. Isn't that sad Xerox now and by--
[02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:53.240]   It's a Chinese holding firm or something.
[02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:54.680]   Fuji. I don't know what Fuji is.
[02:01:54.680 --> 02:01:55.960]   Japanese. Japanese.
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:01:57.640]   They used to make film.
[02:01:57.640 --> 02:02:00.680]   Fuji film? I think it's even the same Fuji.
[02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:01.720]   No one knows.
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:02.200]   No one knows.
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:02.840]   No one knows.
[02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:04.600]   No one knows. Xerox Park gone.
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:06.600]   Sad.
[02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:08.040]   Yeah, it was such a fun amusement park.
[02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:09.720]   I used to love to go there and ride with the kids.
[02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:10.680]   Xerox Park.
[02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:14.840]   So it's just one of those pieces that only New Yorker could have on--
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:23.240]   Joshua Rothman on the kind of the engineering challenges proposed by paper jams.
[02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:23.960]   Don't you love that?
[02:02:23.960 --> 02:02:26.440]   Go ahead.
[02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:26.680]   Yeah.
[02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:31.080]   No, I was going to reminisce a minute.
[02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:32.680]   About paper jams or Xerox vaccines?
[02:02:32.680 --> 02:02:34.280]   Yes. Paper jams.
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:34.680]   Go ahead.
[02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:39.640]   So way back when what got me into all this whole technology thing,
[02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:41.720]   I'm going to date myself very badly and Stacy,
[02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:44.680]   you were not allowed to say the verses when you were born.
[02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:50.200]   But in 1974, I was at the Chicago Tribune and I was the guy in the newsroom,
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:52.360]   wasn't scared of computers because I was 21 years old.
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:55.080]   And I trained everybody on the computers.
[02:02:55.080 --> 02:02:56.360]   It was a brand new big thing.
[02:02:56.360 --> 02:02:57.800]   New newsroom never had such a thing.
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:02:59.640]   We didn't know what a cursor was, had to do all that.
[02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:01.240]   So I was the guy who knew the computer.
[02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:02.760]   That's what got all this started.
[02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:04.520]   The problem was people in the newsroom would think,
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:06.520]   "Oh, if you know how to do computers,
[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:09.240]   you must know how to get a paper jam out of the copy."
[02:03:09.240 --> 02:03:09.880]   Oh, God.
[02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:12.760]   Were you the key operator?
[02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:15.320]   Were you? He says, "Call key operator."
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:16.760]   Yeah, I know, exactly.
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:17.160]   That's right.
[02:03:17.160 --> 02:03:18.120]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:20.360]   I was the keyless operator.
[02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:26.200]   Paper jams have bedeviled mankind since paper movement has been invented.
[02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:27.960]   Yeah. I mean, even modern printers,
[02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:29.400]   or you think this would be solved or...
[02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:30.840]   Oh, no, no, no.
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:32.200]   Constantly tortured by...
[02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:39.240]   There's actually Xerox had a facility they called the Paper Torture Lab.
[02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:44.360]   And it's fascinating.
[02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:45.960]   It's just...
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:47.080]   Oh, man.
[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:48.920]   I just love these kinds of think pieces,
[02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:51.160]   because it's about stuff, minutia,
[02:03:51.160 --> 02:03:53.640]   that actually is quite interesting.
[02:03:53.640 --> 02:03:59.160]   One other thing which is that Google is now putting...
[02:03:59.160 --> 02:04:02.360]   There's a Google research app called MotionStills,
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:03.720]   and they've added...
[02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:06.360]   Which is a good thing to have on Android anyway,
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:09.480]   but they have now added to MotionStills in AR mode.
[02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:14.600]   So you can place not as cool as the Star Wars figures,
[02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:18.920]   generic figures into your world.
[02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:20.040]   Actually, I'll show you,
[02:04:20.040 --> 02:04:21.160]   because I think I...
[02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:24.040]   Let me see if it got to my Google Photos here.
[02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:26.760]   I did a couple of videos in the driveway.
[02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:30.040]   Oh, it's not on my Google Photos.
[02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:30.840]   Why isn't it?
[02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:31.480]   It shouldn't it be?
[02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:33.400]   It's on your Nest Cam.
[02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:34.760]   Maybe one day they'll be together.
[02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:40.280]   Well, I can show you, I guess, on...
[02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:41.400]   I don't understand why...
[02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:45.000]   I guess it stays in MotionStills until you save it,
[02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.800]   I guess, is the depressing fact of the matter.
[02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:50.280]   So I'll just see if I can...
[02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:51.640]   Oh, maybe I didn't save them.
[02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:52.200]   Oh, even worse.
[02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:53.880]   Sorry, well, I'll just have to do it.
[02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:54.840]   So let me put a little...
[02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:56.680]   A little...
[02:04:56.680 --> 02:04:57.000]   I don't know.
[02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:57.640]   You can't see it.
[02:04:57.640 --> 02:05:00.440]   A little dinosaur somewhere here.
[02:05:00.440 --> 02:05:01.000]   There you go.
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:02.200]   Oh, it's a gingerbread man.
[02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:03.800]   You can't see it though,
[02:05:03.800 --> 02:05:05.160]   because of the angles.
[02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:06.440]   But I can make it really big.
[02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:08.040]   Yeah, there we go.
[02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:08.440]   Yeah.
[02:05:08.440 --> 02:05:10.520]   They've got a dinosaur.
[02:05:10.520 --> 02:05:12.920]   I can place a dinosaur right there.
[02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:15.400]   There's the dino.
[02:05:15.400 --> 02:05:16.600]   You can make him really big.
[02:05:16.600 --> 02:05:18.760]   Really small.
[02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:20.840]   It's not like this.
[02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:21.800]   You record that or what you do.
[02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:22.680]   Yeah, you record it,
[02:05:22.680 --> 02:05:24.120]   but of course, if you don't save it,
[02:05:24.120 --> 02:05:26.440]   like a nitwit, there's an alien.
[02:05:26.440 --> 02:05:29.000]   There's a robot.
[02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:30.040]   Are there nitwits in there?
[02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:30.680]   Yeah, me.
[02:05:30.680 --> 02:05:33.080]   I like the giant chicken.
[02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:34.600]   Anyway...
[02:05:34.600 --> 02:05:35.880]   I thought the chicken was cute.
[02:05:35.880 --> 02:05:36.600]   Yeah.
[02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:37.240]   Stupid.
[02:05:37.240 --> 02:05:38.120]   Still stupid.
[02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:39.080]   Yeah, still stupid.
[02:05:39.080 --> 02:05:41.000]   No, I didn't say it wasn't stupid.
[02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:42.920]   So check out the MotionStills app.
[02:05:42.920 --> 02:05:44.280]   You've got some new features.
[02:05:44.280 --> 02:05:47.880]   And now Jeff, your number of the week.
[02:05:47.880 --> 02:05:51.000]   So, Wired just put up a pay wall.
[02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:51.960]   They've joined the...
[02:05:51.960 --> 02:05:53.080]   Yeah, the craze.
[02:05:53.080 --> 02:05:54.040]   The craze here.
[02:05:54.040 --> 02:05:54.920]   So disciplined.
[02:05:54.920 --> 02:05:56.840]   Well, yeah.
[02:05:56.840 --> 02:05:58.040]   So, and, again, I'm not...
[02:05:58.040 --> 02:05:59.960]   Listen, if you can pay charge,
[02:05:59.960 --> 02:06:01.160]   you can charge us wonderful.
[02:06:01.160 --> 02:06:03.240]   But, so last...
[02:06:03.240 --> 02:06:05.160]   Less than two weeks, I've been doing a little test.
[02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:08.600]   And every time I get hit by pay wall,
[02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:10.760]   I'm now recording what I would have to spend.
[02:06:10.760 --> 02:06:13.000]   So the way Wired's doing it,
[02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:14.280]   you get like four articles,
[02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:16.600]   and then you just can't read anymore, I think.
[02:06:16.600 --> 02:06:17.080]   Right.
[02:06:17.080 --> 02:06:17.240]   Right.
[02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:19.400]   And then what happens is I'll follow a link to something and say,
[02:06:19.400 --> 02:06:20.120]   "Oh, you've gone through.
[02:06:20.120 --> 02:06:22.120]   You've already just gone through half your articles."
[02:06:22.120 --> 02:06:24.040]   Well, I didn't want to use it for that.
[02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:24.520]   Right.
[02:06:24.520 --> 02:06:25.000]   Right.
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:28.120]   So now I added up in less than two weeks.
[02:06:28.120 --> 02:06:31.480]   $3,070.57.
[02:06:31.480 --> 02:06:33.080]   Oh my God.
[02:06:33.080 --> 02:06:33.640]   Yeah.
[02:06:33.640 --> 02:06:37.880]   Well, I actually spend, is about $248 a year.
[02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:39.880]   I bought The New York Times, The Washington Post,
[02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:41.000]   and Talking Points Memo.
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.960]   Wired, $20.
[02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:45.320]   Economist, $152.
[02:06:45.320 --> 02:06:46.920]   Bucks, New Yorker, $90.
[02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:48.120]   Atlantic, $25.
[02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:49.400]   Stretatchery, $100.
[02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:50.520]   Business Insider, $100.
[02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:52.360]   Wall Street Journal, $444.
[02:06:52.360 --> 02:06:54.280]   So you're including like the big...
[02:06:54.280 --> 02:06:56.040]   Like, Stretecory has a big subscription,
[02:06:56.040 --> 02:06:57.400]   like the information.
[02:06:57.400 --> 02:06:57.640]   Yeah.
[02:06:57.640 --> 02:06:59.320]   Because I hit it and I want to read it.
[02:06:59.320 --> 02:06:59.800]   Yeah.
[02:06:59.800 --> 02:07:00.440]   Yeah, I can't read it.
[02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:01.320]   Let's head for it.
[02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:02.680]   "Be medium, $60.
[02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:04.760]   Can that my local local paper? 50 bucks.
[02:07:04.760 --> 02:07:07.880]   The burgers, the news.
[02:07:07.880 --> 02:07:09.400]   Ain't nobody gonna do that?
[02:07:09.400 --> 02:07:10.280]   No.
[02:07:10.280 --> 02:07:11.400]   No.
[02:07:11.400 --> 02:07:11.800]   And...
[02:07:11.800 --> 02:07:14.440]   Oh, I counted to Stretecory twice.
[02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:14.760]   Okay.
[02:07:14.760 --> 02:07:15.720]   Just subtract $100.
[02:07:15.720 --> 02:07:19.320]   So $29.70.
[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:21.880]   So, and that's just two weeks.
[02:07:21.880 --> 02:07:23.080]   And I'll hit more of them.
[02:07:23.080 --> 02:07:25.480]   And God bless them.
[02:07:25.480 --> 02:07:27.640]   They've all got to try to figure out how to make a living.
[02:07:27.640 --> 02:07:29.480]   But this notion of selling content,
[02:07:29.480 --> 02:07:30.440]   my content is valuable.
[02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:32.280]   You should pay for it for a whole year.
[02:07:32.280 --> 02:07:34.120]   When I only want a little of this or that,
[02:07:34.120 --> 02:07:36.040]   and no micro payments aren't the answer either,
[02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:37.640]   because A, we're not going to do it and B...
[02:07:37.640 --> 02:07:40.760]   It's too expensive.
[02:07:40.760 --> 02:07:43.880]   So it does raise enough money.
[02:07:43.880 --> 02:07:47.400]   So when people come after me about paywalls,
[02:07:47.400 --> 02:07:48.200]   I'm just going to say,
[02:07:48.200 --> 02:07:50.680]   well, $3,070.95.
[02:07:50.680 --> 02:07:53.160]   Not going to do it.
[02:07:53.160 --> 02:07:54.680]   That's my number.
[02:07:57.160 --> 02:08:00.600]   Yeah, that's kind of as an independent media person
[02:08:00.600 --> 02:08:03.640]   who wants to reference stuff and bring stuff.
[02:08:03.640 --> 02:08:06.440]   I have done these same calculations and...
[02:08:06.440 --> 02:08:08.280]   But we both...
[02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:11.000]   We're all understanding though of the conundrum.
[02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:12.200]   And I do.
[02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:13.240]   I mean, I buy...
[02:08:13.240 --> 02:08:13.720]   It's pathetic.
[02:08:13.720 --> 02:08:17.720]   I spend at least $1,000 a year on subscriptions
[02:08:17.720 --> 02:08:20.120]   for various news things.
[02:08:20.120 --> 02:08:23.480]   Yeah. I make a point of buying things like the information,
[02:08:23.480 --> 02:08:25.960]   not because I need to, really,
[02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:27.640]   because I can get that information.
[02:08:27.640 --> 02:08:30.680]   As you see, everybody re-hashes it anyway,
[02:08:30.680 --> 02:08:32.200]   but because I want to support Jessica.
[02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:35.000]   I buy Ben Thompson's Stratecary.
[02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.800]   I buy Paul Therat's blog.
[02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:40.760]   But there's a limit.
[02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:42.760]   And truth is most of the time,
[02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:46.280]   you just want to casual article here, article there, right?
[02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:49.160]   I pay for Stacy's newsletter because it's free.
[02:08:49.160 --> 02:08:53.400]   It is free, but you have to give me your time in eyeballs.
[02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:54.680]   Click on my ads.
[02:08:54.680 --> 02:08:55.560]   Yeah, but does that work?
[02:08:55.560 --> 02:08:57.720]   That's... I mean, you wouldn't want to charge for that, would you?
[02:08:57.720 --> 02:09:02.840]   I decided no, because I have a hard time asking people for money.
[02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:03.800]   Me too.
[02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:05.480]   Exactly.
[02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:08.440]   Really, it all boils down to that, doesn't it?
[02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:09.640]   I can give you...
[02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:11.080]   You can give all sorts of...
[02:09:11.080 --> 02:09:12.760]   You know, it's democratic, blah, blah.
[02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:14.040]   It's just I don't want to ask for money.
[02:09:14.040 --> 02:09:16.520]   That's not my thing.
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:17.160]   I'm awkward.
[02:09:17.160 --> 02:09:18.600]   So...
[02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:19.800]   Me too.
[02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:23.640]   Stacy, you have a thing for us?
[02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:26.360]   I did have a thing, but it's not set up.
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:28.440]   And until I get it set up, I'm not going to tell you about it,
[02:09:28.440 --> 02:09:30.040]   because why would I do that?
[02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:33.480]   So until that, I have a book.
[02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:35.400]   And I'm pretty sure everybody knows this book.
[02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:36.920]   So it's old.
[02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:38.360]   It was published in September.
[02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:39.720]   Do you guys still want it or not?
[02:09:39.720 --> 02:09:40.760]   Yes, I want it.
[02:09:40.760 --> 02:09:41.880]   Okay.
[02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:45.080]   It's Autonomous by Anna Lee Newitz.
[02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:45.880]   Didn't know about it.
[02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:46.440]   Which...
[02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:46.680]   See?
[02:09:46.680 --> 02:09:47.160]   Really?
[02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:47.720]   Nope.
[02:09:47.720 --> 02:09:48.840]   Okay, this is fiction.
[02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:50.600]   Did I spell autonomous right?
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:51.400]   I don't know.
[02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:54.520]   Um, it is awesome.
[02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:58.040]   It is an amazing book about the future.
[02:09:58.040 --> 02:09:59.320]   There's like stuff for everybody.
[02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:00.360]   There's robots.
[02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:04.840]   There's like robots can buy human to bring computing interactions.
[02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:07.880]   There's IoT.
[02:10:07.880 --> 02:10:10.360]   Like there's hacker collectives.
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:11.560]   It's awesome.
[02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:13.320]   It's just a good book.
[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:14.920]   It's so cool.
[02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:15.720]   Oh, no.
[02:10:15.720 --> 02:10:16.840]   She is the founder of I09.
[02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:17.640]   Yes.
[02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:18.440]   Oh, that's right.
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:18.840]   Okay.
[02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:19.240]   Yeah.
[02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:19.880]   You know her.
[02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:20.280]   This is...
[02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:21.160]   Well, I know of her.
[02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:21.880]   I know the name.
[02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:22.520]   Yeah.
[02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:24.920]   She's the culture editor at Ars Technica now.
[02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:27.400]   And she was the founder of I09.
[02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:28.520]   And she's an amazing...
[02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:29.160]   She's written a...
[02:10:29.160 --> 02:10:32.040]   I actually read her book about what happens when
[02:10:32.040 --> 02:10:35.880]   the apocalypse happens and how to human survive.
[02:10:35.880 --> 02:10:37.000]   That's a really good book.
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:37.880]   But this is fiction.
[02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:40.840]   And it's just a really...
[02:10:40.840 --> 02:10:41.960]   It's a good book.
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:42.920]   You should listen.
[02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:45.160]   I'm going to get it on Audible in a couple of weeks.
[02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:46.520]   When I get my credit, let's listen.
[02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:48.120]   Here's autonomous.
[02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:49.320]   A novel.
[02:10:49.320 --> 02:10:51.880]   To float in congruously at top the waves.
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:55.560]   Spread next to her in the bright water
[02:10:55.560 --> 02:10:58.840]   was an undulating sheet of non-reflective solar panels.
[02:10:58.840 --> 02:10:59.880]   Oh, I love that.
[02:10:59.880 --> 02:11:02.840]   Jack made a crumpling gesture with her hand.
[02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:05.960]   And the solar array swarmed back into its dock,
[02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:08.680]   disappearing beneath a panel in the hall.
[02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:10.280]   Is she in a virtual world?
[02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:11.960]   Sub-scatteries were charged.
[02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:14.120]   Her network traffic was hidden in a blur of...
[02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:14.360]   All right.
[02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:15.400]   I'm buying it now.
[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:15.880]   I don't care.
[02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:16.360]   I can't wait.
[02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:18.600]   A blur of William Gibson.
[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:19.800]   That's Cadillac.
[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:20.360]   Yes.
[02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:22.520]   No, it's a great book.
[02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:26.840]   And it makes you think about what makes an...
[02:11:26.840 --> 02:11:28.680]   Humans and autonomy.
[02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:30.920]   She's a bio-hacker.
[02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:33.960]   I mean, it just like all the threads of your future
[02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:36.760]   that we all kind of talk about and think about.
[02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:38.360]   It's like in a nice story.
[02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:41.000]   According to it, is it all dystopian or...?
[02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:45.400]   It's like now, Jeff, actually,
[02:11:45.400 --> 02:11:49.160]   because there's an underground collective of people who are trying to...
[02:11:49.160 --> 02:11:51.080]   It's a huge IP...
[02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:54.680]   The evil and the story is IP lawyers.
[02:11:54.680 --> 02:11:56.280]   And anyway...
[02:11:56.280 --> 02:11:58.920]   I think Annalie Newitz should be on triangulation.
[02:11:58.920 --> 02:12:00.200]   Oh, she should.
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:01.160]   She's so amazing.
[02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:02.280]   She's such a good writer.
[02:12:02.280 --> 02:12:03.640]   She's such a big thinker.
[02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:05.080]   Yeah, we're going to contact her.
[02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:08.120]   And if your friends of Annalie tell her,
[02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:09.240]   we're looking for her.
[02:12:12.040 --> 02:12:16.440]   It covers robots, future drugs, slavery, and patent reform.
[02:12:16.440 --> 02:12:17.080]   The big four.
[02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:18.440]   Yeah.
[02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:22.120]   Oh, and it doesn't even talk about AI and what makes a human a human.
[02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:22.920]   Or what gets...
[02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:23.400]   I'm sorry.
[02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:27.800]   Bots becoming autonomous and their rights.
[02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:28.920]   Oh, it's so good.
[02:12:28.920 --> 02:12:32.440]   It also has, according to reviewers, a weird romantic subplot.
[02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:33.880]   Oh, it does.
[02:12:33.880 --> 02:12:36.360]   Yeah, some people may not go for that, but...
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:38.680]   You know, I didn't mind.
[02:12:38.680 --> 02:12:39.240]   I didn't mind.
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:42.520]   You don't have to call yourself it.
[02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:43.640]   Unless that's your pronoun.
[02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:45.880]   That could be.
[02:12:45.880 --> 02:12:46.280]   I don't know.
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:50.440]   It is Stacy Higginbotham.
[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:53.480]   She's at stacyoniot.com
[02:12:53.480 --> 02:12:57.960]   at Gigastacy on Twitter and is just fantastic.
[02:12:57.960 --> 02:13:03.160]   And we can't wait to have some time with you in Austin
[02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:05.000]   at South by Southwest on March 9th.
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:05.960]   I'm really looking forward to it.
[02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:07.080]   Oh, jealous you get to be together.
[02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:07.960]   Jeff, you should come.
[02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:08.760]   It's not.
[02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:09.560]   Come on down.
[02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:10.600]   Oh, with that.
[02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:11.560]   You can bunk with me.
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:14.040]   With that and the breakfast tacos.
[02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:15.480]   Breakfast tacos.
[02:13:15.480 --> 02:13:18.680]   Like, it's a B&M breakfast tacos.
[02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:21.560]   What kind do you like Stacy Higginbotham?
[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:21.720]   Or...
[02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:23.640]   Um, I like...
[02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:25.080]   Well, I like B...
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:26.920]   I do like B&M cheese breakfast tacos.
[02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:27.800]   I love that.
[02:13:27.800 --> 02:13:28.280]   That is...
[02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:29.880]   Do you have that after the event?
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:32.440]   Just bean and potato and cheese?
[02:13:32.440 --> 02:13:33.240]   Very good.
[02:13:33.240 --> 02:13:33.800]   That's good.
[02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:34.280]   That's good.
[02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:34.520]   Yeah.
[02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:37.240]   Is it from Torcheese?
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:38.200]   Are we getting it from Torcheese?
[02:13:38.200 --> 02:13:39.160]   Is that what we decided?
[02:13:39.800 --> 02:13:41.160]   So, I...
[02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:43.880]   You know, Torcheese is good for breakfast tacos.
[02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:49.960]   I would actually do Taco Deli because I like their beans better.
[02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:52.040]   And I like their donut sauce, but that's just me.
[02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:53.080]   Uh...
[02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:54.440]   Donut sauce.
[02:13:54.440 --> 02:13:54.920]   Donut sauce.
[02:13:54.920 --> 02:13:55.880]   Donut marilla.
[02:13:55.880 --> 02:13:57.720]   Taco Deli.
[02:13:57.720 --> 02:13:58.520]   I'm gonna...
[02:13:58.520 --> 02:14:00.680]   We're going there handcrafted tacos in Austin.
[02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:03.640]   Feel good food.
[02:14:03.640 --> 02:14:04.360]   We're going there.
[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:06.040]   So, Carson, you're making a note of this, right?
[02:14:06.040 --> 02:14:07.160]   You're in charge.
[02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:08.760]   And they're pieced with good, Jeff.
[02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:09.400]   Ooh.
[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:10.760]   We have all of those.
[02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:11.320]   Oh, I've got those.
[02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:14.200]   Ooh.
[02:14:14.200 --> 02:14:19.720]   Okay, kids, if you come to our event,
[02:14:19.720 --> 02:14:24.200]   I can almost promise you we'll have breakfast tacos for all.
[02:14:24.200 --> 02:14:26.120]   Unless more than 10 people come.
[02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:30.760]   Okay, maybe I should rephrase that.
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:31.960]   Breakfast tacos for 10.
[02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:35.080]   And then we'll see how many other people come.
[02:14:35.080 --> 02:14:38.600]   I'm trying to bribe our way into a giant.
[02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:40.040]   We want to fill in tones.
[02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:44.440]   And by the way, that panel will not be streamed live
[02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:47.240]   because of its ungodly early hour, but we will.
[02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:51.400]   We will package it up as a Twitch special.
[02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:52.680]   So we will have it on the Twitch network.
[02:14:52.680 --> 02:14:54.760]   You can watch if you can't make it to Austin March 9th.
[02:14:54.760 --> 02:14:56.760]   Plan on it.
[02:14:56.760 --> 02:14:58.120]   Is it true Ruby's is closing?
[02:14:58.120 --> 02:15:00.120]   I just saw that.
[02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:01.480]   I just drove by there.
[02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:02.680]   So I don't know.
[02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:05.240]   I have not heard this.
[02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:07.320]   Okay.
[02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:08.520]   Oh, they're cutting up.
[02:15:08.520 --> 02:15:11.880]   Yes, they're cutting back on hours to permanently close.
[02:15:11.880 --> 02:15:20.840]   Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at the City University of New York,
[02:15:20.840 --> 02:15:23.640]   which is near one or two great eateries as well.
[02:15:23.640 --> 02:15:26.760]   It's in the center of the friggin universe.
[02:15:26.760 --> 02:15:28.760]   Time square, baby.
[02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:32.920]   Ground zero for all that is culturally important.
[02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:35.560]   And that's why Jeff is so important to us.
[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:36.680]   We love having you on the show.
[02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:38.440]   Thank you, Jeff, for being here.
