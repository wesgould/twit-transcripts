[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.960]   popular tweeter when it comes to bar me bar drinks and stuff so people really

[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.040]   coming to us all the way from the south bay where he is in sconce Kevin Marks
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.960]   dot com in his beautiful garden nice Kevin good to see you you can't see much
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.560]   the garden because I'm just have to sit near the house now the Wi-Fi is not as
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.520]   good on his laptop okay that's okay it's working that's all I care about while
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.280]   we were in the middle of Windows weekly you know the speculat we all knew Apple
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.880]   had to do an event or we had planned to do an event this month but we the
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.880]   speculation was they would do it October 27th because their earnings was
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.520]   scheduled for the 27th they moved it back yes indeed Apple just sent out the
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.400]   invite I did not get one in case you're interested hello again it says join us
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.760]   for a special invitation only event at the Apple campus at one infinite loop
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.680]   in Cupertino on Thursday October 27th so if you had October 27th on your
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.440]   pick six congratulations and I we all assume that Apple will announce new
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:44.200]   MacBooks not probably new iPads be very interesting though see if they do new
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.920]   Mac pros which hasn't the Mac pros haven't been updated in three years the
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.560]   Macbook pros are only a year old lots of rumors about what that I know this is
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.720]   twig but that's a big story for for our everyone everyone yeah it's funny
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.120]   because we were talking about with Paul and Mary Jo on Windows weekly about
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.920]   Microsoft announcement the day before and Paul said yeah well what he believes
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.800]   Microsoft was doing was trying to figure out when Apple's announcement could be
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.120]   because the worst thing possible we for Microsoft to have a hardware event same
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.440]   day right no one wants to have an event the same day as Apple so you know
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.560]   Google waited till after the Apple event Microsoft kind of threw a you know a
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.480]   dart at the map and set at the calendar and said well we're pretty we think we
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.520]   can get October 26th and they did they did because unlike Apple Microsoft
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:43.040]   likes to mail its invitations out more than one week at the time unbelievable
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.720]   Apple can do that though Apple knows people jump on a plane and come and see
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.880]   them yeah they'll pay twice as much for their ticket because it's last minute
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.640]   booking but you know what that's what happens anyway so there's there's a
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.960]   story and actually there's a big Google story breaking right now from the
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:07.200]   Wall Street Journal looks like Google is gonna do what Apple wanted to do a web
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:13.160]   TV service and according to the journal will be a relatively low cost 30 to 40
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:19.080]   dollar service and the journal says they've signed up at least CBS for this
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:25.800]   planned web TV service it'll be on the YouTube platform likely to debut early
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:32.920]   next year so is this like a hulu type thing on YouTube I'm thinking it's more
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.760]   like PlayStation view okay are you familiar you're familiar with that right
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:44.120]   Kevin Tofol talks about it all the time until him though I had no idea that
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.240]   you could actually get TV over PlayStation views so I was like oh that's a relatively
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.480]   new offering from Sony and it has the advantage of getting live locals in
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.120]   some but not all markets and that's really the cord cutters dilemma is you
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:05.000]   know you can get most of what you want in terms of HBO showtime even CNN and
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.920]   ESPN without a cable television or or an antenna but you can't get ESPN yeah you
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:19.800]   can on sling box oh okay sling box sling box TV I'm pretty sure is the is the
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:26.040]   is no that makes sense I was thinking without having to buy like new equipment
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:31.200]   right well yeah I mean this is the issue of course and the only reason sling TV
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.000]   has it is because ESPN is so powerful they're one of the few channels where
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.960]   they can thumb their nose at the cable companies most channels like if you're
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:44.320]   HGTV or you know the Oprah channel you don't dare do deals over the top deals
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:50.240]   like this because you don't want cable companies to get mad at you but if your
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:55.840]   ESPN which is the most demanded and the most expensive it's like five dollars a
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.680]   subscriber yeah they have they can say because what you know is your cable company
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.880]   gonna say oh well we've decided not to carry ESPN anymore yeah good luck so
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:15.160]   sling TV has AMC CNN ESPN HGTV actually has a fairly good selection that's that's
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:21.320]   sling orange for $20 a month $40 orange plus blue gives you even more
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:28.400]   including by the way the playoffs baseball I was thinking Bravo bravo I know
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.840]   well and I'm all about the A&E the high-class channels actually AMC would be a
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.440]   big one for me because that's walking dead man men that kind of thing Bravo is
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.680]   the real housewives franchise it only sounds classy and they know they all
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:49.920]   were they want you know they used to be class no there's no money in that it's
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.520]   whether they were they were supposed to be like fine honest when they were
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:58.040]   right yes they were any yeah hey the real housewives will go to you know the
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:05.120]   opera yeah the real the real housewives of the Sydney Opera House so the new TV
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.960]   service according to Wall Street Journal is also near agreement with 21st
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:15.320]   Century Fox Walt Disney which is interesting because Disney is you know
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:21.040]   very tight with Apple obviously Steve Jobs was the number one's a shareholder
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.080]   in Disney and now of course his widow Lorraine is the individual shareholder
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:32.800]   in Disney in be interesting the new service which the journal says is called
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.120]   unplugged aims to be a low-cost option targeting consumers who have either
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:42.200]   resisted to traditional pay TV or cut the cord during due to rising
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.720]   subscriptions cost $25 to $40 a month for a skinny bundle so it's very much like
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.960]   PlayStation view looks almost identical to but CBS is a big deal
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:56.680]   PlayStation go ahead oh I was gonna say I don't think CBS CBS on Hulu or is it
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:02.960]   ABC it's ABC Fox comedy central but I don't think CBS is part of that the
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:08.960]   Reiki is is is not so much like getting how I met your mother mm-hmm but getting
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.760]   live locating the Academy Awards and the Super Bowl and the local news and
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:18.600]   stuff like that the local news local new I don't care about local news
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:24.520]   court cutters don't watch the local news maybe maybe that's well they can't
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.880]   that's the whole point PlayStation view though that's one of the things is
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.400]   interesting about you does give you local news in San Francisco and a few
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:37.280]   other markets so you that's I mean that's that's their claim to fame we're
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.760]   really what it's it's interesting I mean this is moving along this is moving
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:47.680]   along this is uh court cutters are are not quite so in the out in the cold as
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.800]   they used to be and it's interesting that Google apples been trying to do this
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.480]   with Apple TV for the longest time the funny thing is Google doesn't really
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:01.520]   have its own hardware platform but we're talking about this yesterday YouTube's
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:07.760]   everywhere yeah including Apple TV mm-hmm so it would be interesting is how
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:13.360]   Apple responds to something like that but I mean it won't is is YouTube on fire
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:17.640]   does Amazon actually deploy YouTube I think you have I think YouTube's like
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:22.920]   ESPN you kind of have to yeah this has been Google's stealth entry into all
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:28.560]   this because for instance if you buy me muse my movies on the Google play
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:36.000]   movies you can watch those movies on YouTube on the YouTube app so oh oh you
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.160]   oh you can know that I didn't know that till yesterday Renee was telling us or
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:47.920]   maybe it was Andy yeah so that's kind of this little wedge that that Google's
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.720]   able to remember the YouTube was not on Apple TV for the long for a long time
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:58.640]   I don't I've never I've never bought into the Apple ecosystem so yeah Apple TV
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.480]   was never something that I was like oh let's do that yeah YouTube is on Amazon
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:07.640]   fire devices says say we're lying in our chatroom okay I thought it I thought
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:11.320]   it was but I'd certainly wondered because because Amazon seems to be very anti-Google
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.920]   in that respect well there yeah an anti-apple remember Amazon won't put its
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:20.360]   app on well they say Apple keeps our app off of it's so bad for consumers you
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.560]   know these companies I guess they have to look out for profits blah blah blah
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:29.080]   but it's because of things like this you can't get apples stuff on anybody else
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:34.560]   you can't get Amazon stuff on Apple so people end up buying two things but
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.840]   you can't but there's nothing's W Amazon putting up on Android and Chromecast as
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:42.480]   far as I know but they just haven't bought it and well and so that's so the
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.920]   the one of the questions in Apple and Amazon differ on this one of the
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.840]   questions was is it Apple it's keeping Amazon off of the Apple TV or is it
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:54.320]   Amazon refusing to make one for Apple TV both sides say it's the other side but
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.800]   the fact that but I think that you that's an interesting data point is that
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:01.760]   Amazon does not make something for Chromecast or it doesn't put Chromecast
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:08.160]   in its app so right so that doesn't sell the chrome that's right will sell
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.960]   anybody else won't sell Apple TVs either I went to the either now oh wow I
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.200]   think not they're very limited in what they'll sell I didn't realize that let
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.560]   me see maybe they I might be wrong if I search for Apple TV I get an ad for new
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:30.240]   Firestick TV with Alexa remote I get an Apple TV mount but yeah no I don't I
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:36.000]   don't see any Apple TVs they'll sell Apple products but it looks like looks
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.840]   like if you go to Amazon they really want to study a fire TV don't they they do
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:48.320]   yeah and accept well it does sort of half make sense yes it's a double
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:52.280]   sword isn't it you know Amazon it has content to sell if I've got a prime
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:57.280]   subscription I should be able to watch Prime or my Grimcast right yeah that's
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:04.680]   that's it's on Roku that's where I watch it it's on Xbox it's on my web TV it's
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:11.800]   yeah it's on my Sony so that's very strange well in Amazon has an app on the
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:17.800]   iPad or it initially I mean it was pretty oh no it took time to put it in
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:22.160]   yes movie the video app on the iPad and you still can't buy anything because it
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.360]   doesn't want to go anything they'll never let you buy anything they don't
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.120]   want to get 30% to Apple they do the same thing with Kindle and Audible you have
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:34.000]   to go to the web to buy things yeah well that but that's that but you don't
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.840]   have to do that on Android Kindle and Android you can buy things straight in
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:41.880]   the app because Google doesn't impose that so yeah it's not that it is it is
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:48.440]   just pure oh we want you to buy our thing so it's so it's our supposition our
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:55.560]   proposal that the best way to right now for the moment to buy movies or TV shows
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:00.200]   or rent movies or TV shows do it through Google that'll give you the widest
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:07.280]   array of devices you can play it does it give you the ability to download no
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:13.960]   onto a tablet I don't I don't believe so who does let you do that a Google
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:20.360]   I can really Google okay so if I like a cash like a cash you don't yeah you
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:26.800]   don't get to like because on an iPad I can download to my Amazon video library I
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:31.600]   can actually download my Amazon content okay on to the iPad and watch it like on
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:38.680]   an airplane or in the car if it's my kid you know yeah so the movies will have a
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:43.200]   little like download button next to them in the okay app okay okay okay you can
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.360]   catch them and hopefully for a flight or whatever yeah okay good okay that's
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:51.920]   good that's key Google has announced speaking of new Google features a fact
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:16:00.640]   check feature on Google news yeah it might be too late this is the most
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:05.600]   fact challenged election in history but also it wasn't clear how they were
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.880]   deciding who's a fact check and who isn't well they're looking for special
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.520]   fact check markup in your page but then they're at some point they're deciding
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:17.800]   whether your fact checks are a fact here in Africa are they crowdsourcing like
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:22.120]   the facts they're using claim review yeah they're using they're using some
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.680]   special markup that you put in your page say this is a claim review type of
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:31.120]   markup and so you can and so you can you can say you can say this is a fact check
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:35.960]   right but they haven't I haven't read I haven't actually looked in detail but
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:40.320]   they haven't said you know how they decide that your that your fact-checking
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:45.240]   is is facty enough for them so this is interesting I didn't even know this
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:52.080]   this existed this is a markup for claim reviews or fact checks so it has a
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:56.880]   property for the item that's being reviewed the body or the review it has
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:01.160]   all of the you know this is really interesting the intended audience and
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.960]   embedded audio object this is a classic scheme of thing of having a million
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:11.800]   properties in the yes million what a award won buy or for this item fictional
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:17.080]   person connected with the creative work example of work file format funder
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:24.680]   genre has part some part of this has oh my god this is crazy this is why we
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:28.320]   I say yes so this is well this problem with schemers that inherits everything
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:34.160]   so oh okay so so claim review has just has one property claim reviewed but then
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.160]   it's all part of things from creative work for it got it so the claim review
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.400]   specific stuff is just claim reviewed item reviewed review body review rating
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.360]   all right well yeah no the others just reviews that's a classic review mark
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:51.520]   up you would do the claim reviewed it is a piece of text as well so oh I see so
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:57.200]   this is the only unique thing is this yes he's a text huh that's interesting
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:01.400]   we're excited to get you see the growth of the fact check community says Google
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:07.680]   and to shine a light on its efforts to divine fact from fiction there is
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:12.760]   apparently an international fact checking network and more than a hundred active
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:21.040]   sites according to Duke University so you'll be able to I'm sure political
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:24.320]   effect is in there yeah political fact yeah I'm sure there makes more sense yeah
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:27.600]   they're the best known right out of that's a Florida what is it the towel I
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:34.040]   see yeah are they are they huh and there I was Jeff were here a funded or
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:39.680]   affiliate he knows he knows the whole I know yeah for more information okay so
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.800]   that's good that's nice it has a little late we could have used some fact checking
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:50.480]   a little earlier I really wanted someone to create an echo skill that it would
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.640]   listen to the debate so like you could turn it on for the debate and then when
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:59.800]   someone says something wrong it would just go well yeah they're say something
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:04.920]   appropriate how awesome would that be that'd be great skill you could also
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:11.920]   turn it on at dinner parties that would be oh totally a flyer flyer I I wonder if
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:16.040]   you can do that with echo can you just can you say to echo okay now listen to
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:20.720]   everything from now on and then respond no Alexa will tell you who won the
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:25.840]   debate according to venture beat oh and you know what if you ask we actually did
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:30.600]   this this morning if you ask who is winning the election she will tell you
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.920]   the polling the latest polling data which is kind of useful which poll though
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:38.120]   who does she use oh I don't remember yeah it's really there's quite a huge
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:44.320]   difference there is there was a great story about how one African-American
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:49.760]   guy in like Ohio who's a Republican was skewing yeah the LA tie the LA times I
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:56.200]   think data I was well I know this from radio ratings for years and even back to
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:01.040]   tech TV tech TV had such a small audience that our ratings were very
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:05.160]   volatile and I was finally explained to me well that's because there's really
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:09.240]   only one family with a people meter that watches tech TV if they don't watch that
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:15.280]   night you're in your ratings are gonna go way down
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:22.960]   like they had all the power did you send them flowers no we don't know who
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.760]   it is in fact one of the things you sign when you get a people meter or an
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:32.160]   arbiter and diary is a agreement not to tell a soul especially not the TV's
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:37.200]   radio station that you have one of those because of course you you'd be
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:42.040]   offered cars those cookbooks and topo Chico samples you're getting or
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.680]   nothing nothing they be they be coming at you
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:53.200]   well that was a thing with the record business in the UK what they used to
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.640]   have they used to survey some of the shops to see what the sites were and that
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.480]   would define the charts right and and they've and of course the which shops it
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.520]   was leaked and so they would employ people to go and buy things just from
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:07.880]   those shops same thing happened the US and and of course we know that the New
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:13.000]   York Times bestseller list is is I think we're sorry routinely yeah yeah oh yeah
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.600]   yeah especially by political books yeah yes I have I have friends who are best
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:24.280]   selling authors and there's a whole strategy there oh really oh yeah and do
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:29.480]   you think that's how they became best selling authors I think their books are
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:38.800]   high quality and I but I think getting their fast is the key so that first week
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:42.960]   you do it and then it kind of builds on itself it's kind of like if you're a
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.640]   podcaster and you want to have an audience that downloads it before you go
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:51.560]   on iTunes I would never do such a thing so you could be a new and notable I
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:56.600]   know I really don't do that never did that that's terrible there remember that
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:03.920]   just mayo story this is like a mini Theranos yeah just mayo which is a
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:08.360]   Silicon Valley startup that makes an eggless mayonnaise it's not just as in
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:14.240]   only it's just as in justice but the problem I haven't tasted I don't know if
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:20.640]   it's good or not but they really wanted to get it into whole foods and so what
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:27.120]   they did is they had employees go out and buy tons of it oh yes I remember this
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:31.680]   yes so I thought you were gonna tell me they actually had eggs in there and then
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:36.040]   I was good that was that was that would be a mini Theranos that's where my
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:39.360]   brain went no no it's not it's not actually probably that would have been
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.560]   a mini Theranos yeah it's not really a mini Theranos it's like a mini Wells
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:49.480]   Fargo but in this here's why it's a yeah right yes here's why it's an issue is
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:53.680]   because of course they have venture capital and they're showing in the in
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.960]   the pitch sheets they're showing these incredible sales and a number of the
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:02.040]   investors well some investors actually did the due diligence and turned them
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.680]   down and a number of them feel like they were maybe manipulated a little bit
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:12.240]   that's actually an ongoing story I don't know the full details of that yeah so
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:20.080]   yeah so it's an all it's a long-standing tradition gotten by your books let's
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:25.920]   see that was fact check well said you were asked didn't someone say that like
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.120]   half the votes in the debate were Twitter bots there was there was some
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.400]   story about that this week as well half the debate what do you mean the bots
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:37.600]   the tweets debate tweets yes there were some like debate tweets who got the
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.440]   most tweets and then then someone didn't understand said oh wait a minute like
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:44.920]   there's a giant army of Twitter bots that are sitting with the hashtag to try
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:49.760]   and I'm don't get me started on Twitter again it just drives a crazy but it's
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:55.320]   terrible here's the biggest problem with Twitter is that people give tweets any
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:00.000]   credence at all even if their bots are not
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.160]   but you need my polls that I do on Twitter aren't scientific no
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:13.400]   but even but so one you know I mean every it's I think this is changing I
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:17.200]   think it's rapidly changing and I think you know the the other story that broke
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:22.200]   this week about the Twitter sale is that sales force apparently considered the
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:27.240]   massive trolling on Twitter to be one of the reasons not to buy it Disney - Jim
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:32.360]   Kramer I don't know how reliable source he is he says I was told by a sales
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:37.200]   force that it was the trolls on Twitter that really scared them off which kind
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:42.840]   of makes sense to me but I think I saw on Twitter Quentin Hardy over at the
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:47.520]   New York Times dispute that a little bit yeah there's plenty of other reasons
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:51.640]   not to buy Twitter yes it was it was more of the stuff that the show was was
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:57.800]   saying why are you buying that yeah yeah I you know yeah but the real problem is
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.080]   not throw I've come to the realization the real problem isn't that this there's
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:06.960]   trolling on Twitter the real problem is that the media gives a single tweet huge
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:11.680]   weight companies give tweets huge weight that's why companies for so long
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.040]   customer service if you wanted to get anything from customer service don't
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:21.600]   call them tweet them as if that's a magically wonderful power it is it's not
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.640]   powerful it's so powerful it's powerful because we give it power and the media
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:30.040]   gives it power but honestly any dim bulb can go say something on Twitter
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:35.320]   but it's but that's the point is that is yeah any and they do all the time and
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:40.040]   they do take on some of them don't right so that so it's not just that somebody
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.560]   says I'm gonna Twitter it says something says something on Twitter and then that
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:47.920]   get shared and spread because it's striking yeah but it all comes down to
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:54.720]   people paying attention to this noise box that is Twitter and no no no yes
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.960]   you're mistaking the form of the content for the form there but they're
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.680]   paying attention to something that somebody has said it just happens to be
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:05.720]   on Twitter what I'm saying if you said if the same thing happened on 4chan and
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:11.040]   does often people are smart enough to go well that's 4chan even read it they're
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:14.080]   go well that's right it but the point is that things a lot of memes start on
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.520]   4chan and they're now mainstream it's just that they're not at your position
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:20.600]   because they go to Twitter or they go everywhere else but that's but that's
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:26.160]   the point there aren't that many places a 4chan mean can live read it in Twitter
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:32.600]   no they could picked up by BuzzFeed or Mashable or well one of those guys
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:38.120]   yeah the whole the whole a lot of the ideas of you know just the idea of images
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.840]   with big type over them is a 4chan thing that spread out to the rest of the
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:48.080]   web yeah but but you know yeah we've done this I'm not gonna talk about
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:56.560]   the pixel phone yes I'll tell you something I'm mad about so I would not
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:02.000]   want to know I'm asking you the chatroom and everybody else so they said October
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.200]   20th right best as I could tell anybody ordered from Google is not getting in
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.720]   October 20th even if you ordered right away now I don't know because I was in
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:13.600]   an airplane I wasn't able to order later that day and mine's coming November 8th
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.920]   Jason Howell said so he ordered it right away and his is coming next week the
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:26.160]   people were getting their pixel phones tomorrow got it through Verizon oh yeah
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:29.680]   Verizon did tell me because I was in a Verizon store this weekend and they said
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:37.800]   I could come back in Thursday to see it shame on you Google shame on you I thought
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:43.280]   I was getting shame for a minute there shame not you shame on Google so yeah
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:47.640]   Fred so I went over to Jason when's your pixel coming next week mine's coming
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:51.560]   November 8th but but Frederica our office manager who's a Verizon customers

[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:03.400]   famous for with its next his phones for not cow towing to carriers BS is
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:07.440]   apparently cow towed to Verizon's BS and has given them a one-week exclusive
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:11.640]   that's what it looks like to me now to confirm that I need to ask you chat
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:16.560]   room and anybody watching are who is anybody getting a pixel phone not from
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:26.080]   Verizon tomorrow crickets like I don't know we can't hear the chapter all right
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.800]   now there is an article on Android police which is chairman has just given me
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:34.960]   saying pixel orders are starting to ship from the Google store so some of the
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:40.520]   staff oh good all right so I take it back this is what I was looking for 32
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:46.320]   gigabyte who wants that why would you order that so the credit card
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:51.640]   started to start getting charged last night oh well wait a minute this is their
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:56.400]   evidence credit cards got charged last night they haven't necessarily seen the
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:01.120]   shipping right but that usually means that they're putting it above us doesn't
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:09.800]   it right yeah you're sure yeah should meet yeah all right well I will see you
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:16.280]   get a pixel Stacy no I wasn't really a key I don't see a reason to upgrade my
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:20.640]   phone yet really you and I use her and Android user I'm a Android user so I've
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:26.800]   got the Nexus small the 5X oh it's time
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:31.120]   Kevin are you tempted or you and I can't remember you're an iPhone guy aren't
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:36.800]   you okay I haven't an iPhone that's as Nexus 6 he's got there
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:41.720]   it's a six that's the big old baby I like it why I like it here's okay here
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:45.480]   all right I finally I have a good shame on you that is no longer gonna be
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:51.640]   updated as him next week that's it boom that's your old phone
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.720]   two year old phone is I mean like if my phone were two years old I'd upgrade it
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:59.080]   but isn't that the promise of Nexus is that you're gonna get updates it one
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:02.600]   would hope for more than two years yeah that's yeah that's perfectly good
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:07.280]   updates but yeah but it's got an already so I'm not waiting for an update you
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:11.880]   know he's got new gas so I'm you know it's it's another year before we get a
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:16.200]   major update well there's an update 71 that's it that these pixels are coming
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.400]   with it has the digit their Google Assistant stuff right yeah but nobody
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:26.680]   gets that nobody gets that nobody gets that well every it's exclusive to the
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:31.040]   pixel for now so no no no they said that but it is that just the making a
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.040]   virtue out of necessity because that because they did so hard to deploy
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:38.560]   updates to Android or is this actually strategy well that we debated this
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.920]   actually Jason and I actually looked at the because we were trying to figure out
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.760]   if there was like a hardware differentiator on the there is not you know
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:50.440]   there's not there's a two-line hack that you can do to any Nexus phone and
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:57.080]   get set and get the assistant on so yeah it's just so so they're saying you
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:01.000]   and cool yeah they're just basically saying we're deploying this to our ones
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.120]   first and we'll wait for the viewer to clamor for it and maybe they're trying to
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:11.240]   put some pressure on the other people to update more regularly maybe maybe
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:14.320]   that's the other half of it but presumably they could put it in place
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.800]   services that's the bit I don't understand I didn't think it requires
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:25.280]   no s update so September 2017 the 5x and the 6p go out of support the next
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:30.640]   year next September okay yeah you got till next September this month the
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:35.400]   next is nine the next is five and the next is six actually next is five went
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:42.240]   out last year next is six goes out this month so these are the yeah we need we
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:49.120]   need a new Nexus 7 what does that is that include the security updates for no
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:53.920]   supporters it just no OS updates that's a good question I think security
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:59.280]   updates are provided for three years from release or 18 months from when they
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:07.800]   leave the Google store whichever is longer so security updates I think the
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:15.840]   Nexus I don't know that's a good question hmm don't know that's a good question
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:20.160]   because that would be a reason to obviously yeah yeah you want those
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:27.160]   security updates after stage fright we all are much more conscious of that very
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:30.600]   solid reviews though for the pixel a number of journalists of course had
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:35.720]   their embargoes lifted yesterday and we're seeing Walt Mossberg in the Wall
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:41.080]   Street Journal I think said it's the best the best Android phone or the
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.960]   Android phone you've been waiting for is what the Wall Street Journal said that
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:48.280]   was probably Joanna Stern I was gonna say I think that's Joanna Mossberg is now at
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:53.880]   verge slash recode but he went review as well he loved it too nice about it yeah
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:58.200]   there have been some like a very nice phone I agree it's just it's it's pretty
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:04.280]   expensive pretty and I don't feel quite ready to drop a thousand dollars on a
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:11.280]   phone at the moment right I mean who like normal people are normal people even
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:16.080]   clamoring for an update I feel like two years is about the accepted life of a
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:20.040]   phone right so I mean that's the thing this you know this one is two years old
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.240]   and still feels good because it was a top-range and I did spend a thousand
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.880]   dollars or nearly not quite but like seven or something two years ago and it
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:31.720]   was and it's been a good phone so that's if I bought the you know one of the
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.320]   older slower ones two years ago and I was due of an update from the from
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:38.960]   Verizon or something then I'd probably go and look at it because then you don't
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:43.440]   see the price in the same way is there a technical reason for that Kevin I
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:49.080]   mean you know Apple does the same thing with its iPad and its iPhone and so
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:53.160]   forth is it that the newer versions of Android wouldn't run well on the Nexus
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:57.440]   six or there's some hardware missing from an X is six that it needs or is it
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:02.240]   just planned obsolescence um it's probably just more the number of
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:07.360]   configurations they want to spend time on testing but you know a lot of it is
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:11.280]   just like we've decided to draw a line you know so like they they decide to
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:16.040]   stop updating Chrome on versions of Mac OS before 10.7 or whatever it is
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:20.520]   there's some we'll tell about eight now they've so that they've they've just
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.920]   arbitrary said okay we're not gonna bother updating things more than
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:26.160]   X versions old and I think it's that same kind of policy to try to limit the
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:31.080]   number of cases they have to deal with it just kind of hurts my I don't think
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:35.480]   it's how it was yeah I think I mean that's the point I mean the weird thing is
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:39.400]   you know the new one is nice I'm sure it's lovely and it's sure it's a bit
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:43.280]   better than this one but this one has a 4k screen it's got a great camera it
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.800]   doesn't seem to start it when I'm browsing the web or doing things with it
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:51.640]   okay I don't I didn't do much gaming with it but it seems to cope so it doesn't
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.240]   feel like this one is you know people have moved beyond its capacity it's the
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:59.880]   thing I was expecting to sort of be that I must buy this was the was the VR AR
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:03.320]   stuff but they haven't made it you know why they've shipped that they haven't
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.320]   made it as much of a big deal about it and it doesn't seem like there's a I
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:10.280]   must have this app thing there that makes you want to buy the phone as far as I
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:16.120]   can see Daydream is looks just like a Google cardboard in a nicer container
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:20.400]   well but I mean with a nicer frame rate and bit you know so they have improved
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:27.760]   the technology yeah it does work better the late C is lower the the gyroscope
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.840]   stuff is low latency so that the head turning feels better so they they have
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:37.440]   improved a bunch of stuff but you still need you know a reason to be using VR
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:43.920]   stuff in the first place where I'll just be in giving killer app yet I can't
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:52.160]   be the one I can't either for VR yeah I've kind of I'm kind of starting to turn
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:57.440]   into a VR skeptic to be honest with you join the club really you feel it's a
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:03.280]   warm and cozy that's just because you're in Austin really you feel that way too
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:08.320]   okay because I get I people argue violent with me saying oh you know you're just
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:12.760]   missing the the point but I just feel like I have all of the you know I have
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:16.960]   the vibe and the rift and all that stuff and I just I don't see a lot of I don't
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:22.600]   get have a internal drive to go use it yeah I've in maybe it's because I'm not a
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:26.880]   gamer and because I don't want to walk around with something on my face I like
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:31.160]   gaming but I think gaming is just as compelling on a nice screen that's fairly
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:37.580]   close that's just as just as immersive and a lot less at nausea inducing yeah I
[00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:44.280]   do think I think I think that you know it is it does make the gaming more
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.680]   immersive and it enables some different slightly different kinds of games though
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:51.800]   I'm not sure we've fully seen those yet I recognize that it may just be that
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:56.000]   that maybe we just haven't gotten to that but it but it's also you know the
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.720]   game people are getting grumpy because they've got to develop for different
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:04.840]   platforms as well that's the other part of it right I was really enamored of it
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:08.440]   when I first got it and we I spent a lot of time in there but I kind of got
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:12.720]   over it I am a gamer I love gaming but I just kind of got over it and maybe it's
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:16.400]   just a lack of the killer app maybe we just we'll see that sometime at some point
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:20.560]   I think I will say I someone in the chat room set up but I totally agree with
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:25.720]   them AR like augmented reality is more compelling yes just yeah and not not
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:32.080]   because of Pokemon go although yay you still playing that okay my daughter is
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:38.400]   10 if you loves it we do it together you walk you to walk and stuff exactly
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:44.280]   it's cute um so yeah I'm I'm pro AR for like especially industrial and I think
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:48.000]   it's the world gets more complex it becomes really interesting to see like
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.520]   how you can combine things but again that's not really consumer yeah but
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:55.480]   that was the thing I was surprised about with with the pixel phone because I was
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:59.760]   expecting it to be more AR ready than it is yeah and have you know I've been
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:03.080]   I've been saying this for a year but have two cameras on the back so that you
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:08.560]   can do stereoscopic straight through and then overlay on it and that and that
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:13.280]   that would give you you know quite a lot of power with it and you can you can
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:18.280]   you can do that but all the Google headsets they've shipped cover up the
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:23.240]   camera so you can't do that the only one that does it is the the virus or the
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:28.320]   Oculus one of the I think oh hello did you pay your hands in tuna fish before
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:33.320]   doing this cat like attack your hands I love your hands there's something the
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:39.560]   keyboard next something about your hands I really messages what's it called
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:51.560]   the the viewmaster one the viewmaster cardboard thing does have is transparent
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:57.960]   on the back and does do overlays oh okay well see I feel like Google yeah cuz
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:02.520]   Google does a lot with overlays and a lot with pushing information through your
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:07.000]   phone it like AR-esque kind of things anyway so I always thought that you're
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.280]   right they would be a natural kind of contender to offer something the
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:16.600]   viewmaster is totally AR it is not in fact VR and it's very cool I really like
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:25.360]   it I mean well okay car said you get it for your kids it's VR you got VR for
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:31.600]   your kids see I think the viewmaster is kind of very interesting you don't you
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:36.520]   think it's it's it's more VR than they are they they're building it is VR and
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:41.000]   visiting the places you've always dreamed of so there is this which is the kind
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:47.280]   of a Google cardboard yeah but then there's also it is both okay but then
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:51.760]   there's also this really I think cool thing where you can you put a disc down
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:56.600]   and doesn't see things spreading above it yeah yeah Carson you have it right
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:00.240]   yes yeah you're right I haven't used the disc in a long long
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:07.440]   I mean I'm not saying I'm not saying cool at first I'm not so what they built
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.080]   with it was necessary the right answer but the point was they actually thought
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:13.520]   about I can pull video through an overlay stuff on top of it right and I
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:17.520]   think we would be getting more of that from from from Google because they have
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:21.000]   bought magic leap and there's a bunch of stuff we know that's sort of they're
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.520]   thinking about there it's just really it's just too much magic leap no they
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:29.440]   have a big investment in they oh okay I was like holy what no just a big
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:33.920]   big chunks magically yeah okay they effectively I mean I don't know what
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.880]   they're stuck with their percentages but they're they have such a large
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:41.000]   percentage is effectively yeah I think they have with an active control but
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.480]   they have but up that's the thing I was expecting more in terms of hardware
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:47.320]   readiness in this cycle and I guess that isn't happening this cycle so we're
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:51.640]   gonna wait for the next cycle so yeah we're it's too early it's too early yet
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:56.560]   but a lot of it you know we're putting this is the magic this is the magic leap
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:02.920]   demo when every time I see this they say shot directly through magically but
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:07.120]   and they didn't do any special effects but so when I see this I get very
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:11.960]   excited about this I mean this is very cool here's a for some for some reason
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:16.600]   is a woman working at a computer and she's got a a galaxy or a solar system
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:24.080]   floating above her for no reason maybe she's doing research on the motion of
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:28.360]   the Sun I don't know but you would think she would then look at it well she's
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:33.000]   not she's not one where he has been headset yeah yes well that's true although
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.120]   didn't they say magically won't require a headset I thought that was perfect no
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:42.760]   oh well that's what I'm saying I mean the thing is if you've got the camera on
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:45.920]   the back on the screen you can do it you can just do it straight through and
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.840]   you can do that with the phones now that's you know that's what pocketman does
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:55.320]   but you could what you can do is also you know if the point of having two
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:58.800]   cameras is a it gives you stereo stuff view as a human so you can go straight
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:02.960]   in your eye but also it can means you can reconstruct depth from it so because
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:07.880]   you've got two cameras that you that you know the spacing between them it can
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:11.520]   reconstruct the depth of where you are and decide what things are in front of
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:17.440]   what things are behind this is this is a wired story about magic leap that
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:24.440]   they got a demo nobody else had this had a scene but it's it's pretty cool
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:31.400]   pretty cool so you know I'm I'm willing to stipulate that we are just such early
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:35.280]   days of VR and AR it would be foolish it'd be like somebody saying in the days
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:40.760]   of the Atari 2600 all video games nobody's ever gonna play those it's just too
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:45.560]   early right but except that you know I've been watching VR demo since like 1988
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:52.680]   so that's the problem yeah yeah we haven't made a lot of progress and the same
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:56.560]   scenarios are there in people's heads but but that maybe we just started to see
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:00.600]   them realized a lot of it is Neil Stevenson isn't it we can blame right
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:05.440]   right it's actually I loved you know President Obama did an interview with
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:09.740]   Joey Ito of the media lab it was published in Wired magazine and the very
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.960]   first thing out of his mouth I was so impressed and obviously I mean it's his
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:17.680]   science advisors even said my science advisors tell me but he said you know
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:23.640]   the problem we have is that we have this vision of VR and artificial
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:28.280]   intelligence that comes from science fiction of this generalized intelligence
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:32.640]   like how my thousand or Star Trek he says that's a long way off but
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:36.640]   specialized AI is around us all the time now and that's where that's where
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:41.160]   you know things are happening right now we shouldn't we shouldn't base our
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:47.560]   judgment on what's gonna happen with AI and I think this extends to VR and AR as
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:54.160]   well based on our science fiction based expectations the hollow deck is a way
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:58.440]   off doesn't mean we're not gonna have some sort of useful AR sooner right yeah
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:02.840]   well we have useful we have useful AR today actually in industrial uses
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:08.400]   people are like doing it all the time right so let's take a break Stacey
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:15.480]   Higginbotham is here from Stacey on IOT the IOT podcast and this week in Google

[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:55.680]   and loans dot com slash twig yesterday was supposed to be an earnings call from
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:04.720]   Yahoo but they said zip it they did not want to talk no doubt about the really
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:11.120]   horrific news about Yahoo lately even Verizon says this could affect our deal
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:18.800]   they've asked for a billion dollars off the 4.8 billion dollar deal Yahoo of
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:26.160]   course as we all know was hacked four years ago I think no two in 2014 and that
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:30.800]   at least half a billion of its email accounts were released the company says
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.840]   it was state sponsored hacker although I've never heard a state sponsor hacker
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:42.880]   trying to sell this stuff on the darknet and that's what happened and then the
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:46.040]   question is well when did they learn about it and the evidence is they might
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:49.920]   have known about it as early as June or July and neglected to mention anything
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:47:01.280]   hoping not to scotch the sale oh oh oh oh then we found out that Verizon although
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:07.360]   they had fought court orders in the past had a secret court order asking it to
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:12.320]   sift through Yahoo mail not Verizon Yahoo through sift through Yahoo mail
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:18.080]   looking for a digital signature of a bad actor and even though they'd fought
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:21.560]   such orders in the past and lost they decided well let's not bother with that
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:26.760]   and at first we thought that the story was writer's story was that they had
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:31.080]   slightly modified the spam filter to find this turns out maybe that was a lot
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:37.960]   worse than that they wrote a poorly executed rootkit like malware put on
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:43.560]   their own servers and some say put all of their users at risk with this Alex
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:49.080]   Stamos who was their chief of security back then apparently was shocked to find
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.360]   this we get it first they thought they'd been hacked and then they were told by
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:56.880]   the company oh no that's our stuff he left shortly after and went to Facebook
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:01.720]   where he's running security anyway I'm not surprised given all of that that
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:09.360]   Yahoo decided not to pull a Trump and not show up for its earnings call what
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:12.160]   were the earnings though I think they would I don't know see I don't know how to
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:17.600]   judge these earnings I don't know what this even means but I'm not an investor
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:21.400]   so I mean they made money right
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:25.680]   job has made money they've made money for a while right they met their earnings
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:29.680]   gold they by cost well that that doesn't necessarily mean they made money yeah
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:35.280]   it depends on how high the goals were yeah right and and how much the costs that
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:41.760]   were cut analysts expected 14 cents a share instead they did 20 cents normally
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:45.280]   in a normal environment that would be really big news in the stock market
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:50.320]   would have gone up a lot but that result according to a recode is
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:56.160]   primarily due to cost cuts and not business growth right the adjusted
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:01.640]   aptid abit abit the which I forgot what that stands for but earnings before
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:07.560]   income taxes depreciation and amortization man you're good I took the
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:15.640]   chartered financial analyst exam what what yeah I started out I know I wanted
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:19.880]   to be a better financial journalist oh that's smart that's really smart did you
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:25.040]   do you people call me dumb Leo I never know you're very smart so you took
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:29.560]   classes to do that I studied on my own but it's a pretty intense it's like
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:33.320]   stats and accounting yeah so you know what it is and you even know what I
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:40.400]   stands for their Iba was down from 244 million to 229 million which really
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:47.680]   means that their CFO Ken Goldman did some clever creative accounting to make
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:52.760]   it look better than it really was revenue in mobile video and native rose
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:58.200]   the big money makers decline is advertisers fled and traffic declined although
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:02.520]   some wag on Twitter said there must have been a big bump actually and ad sales
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:06.040]   when everybody logged into Yahoo to change their password to lead their
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:12.080]   cat this is not show up in the numbers display ad revenue down 7% search
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:16.720]   edge in revenue just wait a minute Yahoo has search engine revenue yes they do
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:22.440]   but it was down 14% yeah they don't they cut deals with like it's big advice
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:27.720]   makers and it's being yeah they're being resellers that's what I know the
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:32.360]   Firefox defaults to Yahoo search yeah but y'all search comes from Bing right
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:39.680]   y'all doesn't run its own search engine yeah it's a mess okay well I I decided to
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:43.080]   look up the termination fee for the Yahoo Verizon deal just to see oh I'm
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:51.440]   curious myself so tada it's 144.8 million but if that is Yahoo paying for
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:59.080]   Verizon if there's car oh Yahoo pay Verizon Yahoo must pay Verizon in certain
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:03.120]   circumstances I don't have to ask you that question are these the you know and
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:07.920]   in Verizon see a attorney a count general counselor said this is a material
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:12.920]   these are this is material so that's code for this might have something this
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:16.920]   might give us a reason right and if the purchase agreement is terminated by
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:22.520]   Verizon due to breach of agreement Yahoo is supposed to reimburse
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:26.760]   Verizon's expenses and the amount of 15 million so its question is is this a
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:30.200]   breach of the agreement and I think here would be the here would be the
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:35.240]   question what did Marissa Meyer know and when did she know it yes God that would
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:39.480]   be material because if she knew about the hack and didn't disclose to Verizon
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:43.360]   before the sale well that's it yeah but I think what Verizon is going to do is
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:47.400]   they still see value in Yahoo they're just gonna they're gonna say well okay
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:50.800]   we're either walking you give us a hundred some million dollars or you take a
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:56.640]   billion off the top and if I were Yahoo I'd be like yep whatever you want whatever
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:05.680]   whatever you want so Yahoo is investigating itself there are also
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:12.160]   shareholder lawsuits national security issues
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:17.760]   Cara Swisher says in other words Yahoo sale limps forward which is in keeping
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:22.720]   with how it's been going on for years now but at least it's consistent although
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:27.800]   I will miss the Meyer Goldman quarterly earnings show which seems to have closed
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:34.840]   without one final performance there Yahoo what's funny is Yahoo has these all
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:40.560]   these long-term deals all over Silicon Valley so they still Yahoo billboards and
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:45.920]   when you go to a 49ers game I'm sad to say our season tickets are in the Yahoo
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:52.760]   section and you have to go up an escalator that periodically goes Yahoo
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:58.360]   and whenever something good happens I can't remember what it is they blare
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:05.840]   that through the stadium speakers it's like it's crazy wow they sold out that is
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:09.960]   really impressive and it's a long-term contract they probably already paid for
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:17.640]   it so not only the 49ers stink but we have to put up with Yahoo if they're so
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:21.840]   terrible you don't have to put up with Yahoo that I've only been to one game the
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:26.200]   one game they won this season so there you go the first day when they're
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:29.320]   opener for reasons no one understands and then proceeded to lose every game
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:34.120]   after that the 49ers are just help me out here baseball football they're the
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:40.440]   football they're the Yahoo a football okay okay just checking oh man I have to
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:46.680]   ride a purple escalator to go to the game it could be an ass geeves escalator
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:55.480]   it's practically as bad oh Lord oh Lord so
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:54:01.240]   Verizon is kind of making noise I think hitting that they could pull out really
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:07.280]   is more about what how low can we get this price well yeah I mean it's like
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:11.000]   Yahoo has the ad technology that I mean I don't know
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:17.160]   Verizon's been buying all sorts of crazy stuff so this sure now I thought we
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:21.280]   would have a nice conversation with Jeff Jarvis and the gang on this one because
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:29.480]   he is our moral compass but I'll ask you to there's a there's a bit of a brew
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:35.120]   ha ha brewing in Silicon Valley right now because Peter Teal the venture
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:39.120]   capitalist who spoke at the Republican convention on behalf of Donald Trump
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:47.920]   and who's funded the Hulk Hogan lawsuit that put Gawker out of business has
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:54.200]   pledged one and a quarter million dollars to the Trump candidacy now some might
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:59.600]   say in fact I might be one of them well that's his perfect right Trump is the
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:03.440]   nominee of a major political party in the United States whatever you think of
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:11.480]   him or his you know politics and but there are those and so Teal who was an
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:17.760]   advisor and not on the board but an advisor for a Y Combinator they've been
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:22.360]   calling for his ouster there Sam Altman the CEO of Y Combinator wrote a
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:29.360]   stirring defense of the First Amendment and said no you know while while we're
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:38.160]   no fans of Donald Trump we don't see any reason to dump Peter Teal leading
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:44.040]   Gizmo to say Sam Altman should resign and we should mention that Ellen Bao Ellen
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:50.160]   Powell who made me remember ran Reddit for a while and now runs something runs
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:59.960]   and was in a nonprofit wrote a piece on medium in which she said because of
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:10.200]   why Combinators support of Peter Teal we can't be a part of why Combinator
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:17.600]   anymore so it's it's it's wild they said they went with why Combinator
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:20.840]   themselves but would work with companies they fund so they're they're basically
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:24.680]   saying we don't trust your met your management structure because Teal is
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:28.200]   on it so are they not gonna have Facebook because Teal is on Facebook's
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:34.640]   board well and mark there's a good question Mark Zuckerberg also asked about
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:40.720]   all this in a leaked memo so he didn't this is in a public statement
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:45.680]   defends keeping Peter Teal he's on the board he is on the board he is on the
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:50.960]   board he is on the board it's it's get this I think yeah right he was the first
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:57.440]   investor right I saw the social network I know the history he said it's diversity
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:03.320]   here's the post which is not again not come not public was an internal a company
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:06.920]   post but of course those things don't stay in private I want to quickly address
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:10.200]   the questions and concerns about Peter Teal as a board member and Trump
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:14.960]   supporter we can't create a culture that says it cares about diversity and then
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:18.880]   excludes almost half the country because they black a political candidate there
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:22.760]   are many reasons a person might support Trump that do not involve racism sexism
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:27.680]   xenophobia or accepting sexual assault it may be because they believe strongly
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:30.960]   in smaller government I don't think Trump said anything about that a different
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:35.200]   tax policy health care system religious issues gun rights or any other issue
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:38.840]   where he disagrees with Hillary that's ultimately wife what Facebook is about
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:45.200]   giving everyone the power to share experiences in any way it's diversity so
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:51.040]   now I okay I normally would shut up here but I don't want I want I want I want
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:54.720]   I'm gonna say this ahead of time before you guys are put on the spot I think
[00:57:54.720 --> 00:58:00.600]   that's right I think Peter Teal however you feel about Trump should not only
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:06.080]   have the right to donate but it what how would we feel if a company kicked off
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:10.520]   a board member because he gave money to Hillary Clinton so Mozilla did that with
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:15.920]   Brandon what's his name that's right Brandon Ike yeah okay so I think there's
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:20.760]   a big there's like a is it a red hearing is it a straw man straw man let's call
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:24.640]   a straw man where do we figure this out okay so
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:32.720]   still hearing it's draw hearing here we go I think up until the sexual assault
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:38.880]   kind of comments surfaced people were hey this dude's kind of maybe not my style
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:42.840]   maybe he treats women really craply blah blah blah I think
[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:50.200]   disagreeing with someone's politics and then standing up against someone who is
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:54.400]   I'm just gonna say a reprehensible human being who is attacked half the
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:59:00.200]   population it's kind of like say it's it's kind of like saying and I'm not
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:03.920]   gonna go I'm going all Godwin here but it's kind of like saying did you support
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:10.960]   Hitler and if Trump is accused of a crime so he's got several lawsuits against
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:15.280]   him their civil lawsuits I believe then it becomes kind of a different story
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:19.640]   because boards and board memberships they do have like moral hazard clauses
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:24.560]   but he but he is not a criminal action that's a civil action well that's what
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:30.440]   I'm saying I agree if if if Donald Trump were those comments were total moral
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:35.840]   hazard oh I agree to I mean so that this is the very weird position we're put
[00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:41.680]   in because yes of course and if you were third party candidate yeah everybody
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:46.920]   would go but he's not he's the candidate of the Republican Party there has to be
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:54.320]   like it in it again I am totally fine up until like a lot of that came like
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:58.800]   there was actual proof that this guy is kind of morally hazardous right is is
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:02.640]   that bad we kind of knew it but we didn't have proof that's where I feel
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:11.080]   like things start to diverge into can you really support someone who is kind
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:16.400]   of a really awful human being and there's proof of it and I'm not even talking
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:23.280]   about his politics like for Joe McCarthy he I mean he had a political stance I
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:27.880]   mean and I guess you could art actually can argue that no I was gonna say you
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:32.360]   could argue that it's like Kennedy sleeping around but it well just you know
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:36.760]   if Kennedy were a rapist then maybe I'm really torn on this because of course I
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:43.040]   you know what you say has a lot of merit and we're put in a very awkward
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:48.360]   position because the Republican Party has nominated this this person if you
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:54.200]   were a serial killer I mean the man don't know don't doesn't I mean but that
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:57.920]   that which change that does that change it can you fire Peter Teal because he
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:04.000]   has poor judgment and political candidates well I think it's different
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.320]   if you'll have given a million and a quarter to the Republican Party did the
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:12.600]   RNC that would be fine that'd be okay I mean no I mean it'd be a bit better yeah
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:17.600]   but but the other thing is that Teal himself has said all kinds of strange
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:22.160]   bizarre things too you know he did write the article for Cato saying that the
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.720]   rot said him when women got the vote no those kinds of things you know that's
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:30.680]   he has he's on record of supporting a lot of very strange things and
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:34.040]   explicitly I'm discriminating against women but they but this didn't come up
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:37.800]   until he gave a million and a quarter well no I mean that but well that you think
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:42.760]   that's the last straw on a continued I think it's question Peter Teal for a
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:48.520]   while saying we have a commitment to diversity and and so we're backing this
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:54.680]   guy who is an extreme sexist and has a bunch of very weird views is a is a
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:57.800]   slightly odd thing to do I mean it is the challenge is yet where do you cross
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:01.720]   the line how do you how do you tolerate the intolerable and broadly I think
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:05.200]   people should have the rights they have political views but it doesn't necessarily
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:08.880]   mean they should be free from other people deciding what to think about
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:14.080]   the basements but I mean if Teal gave money to David Duke Klansman David Duke
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:21.040]   right okay I think the only point I raise is the fact that this is the
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:25.240]   nominee of one of the two political parties that's what complicates is right
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:30.000]   that's you know that's the bit that's the bit I'm not I'm not that's I'm not as
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   comfortable with that side of it sure but you know there's a lot of strangeness
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   about Teal and and some of the sort of political stuff that that's talked
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.560]   around it in those circles and this is the bit that's sort of this odd is that
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:51.640]   the valley has this uneasy political sort of consensus that does include a
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:58.280]   fairly sort of off the charts libertarianism along with the sort of
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:03.960]   neoliberal consensus end of the the other political spectrum and that's that's
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:07.840]   if you look up you know who the who the valley donates to and who they
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:15.240]   funds there is a lot of this effectively anti-government or entirely was was was
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:19.560]   the culture of the valley for a very long time and so some of this is that
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:25.800]   that part of it moving into the into that orbit but also some of it is just
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:31.080]   like I'm he may just be doing to mess with people this is not clear but he is
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:36.320]   clearly sending a signal that there is a set of things that he decides he wants
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:39.800]   to do and is this I think it's the association of that that's the thing
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:43.880]   that's damaging to to a Facebook and why combinates it it's really interesting
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:49.240]   because it really does echo the Brennan Ike story from four years ago or three
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:54.600]   years ago Brennan Ike donated in support of Proposition 8 which banned gay
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:04:02.320]   marriage and as a result was forced out at Mozilla even though Ike was very I mean
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:07.000]   he wasn't just a kind of figurehead at Mozilla he was very important
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:14.280]   yeah yeah yeah I actually I did not agree with that I thought that was not a
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:18.920]   great decision personally when that happened so this is that see this is but
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:21.840]   I think it's it's it's on it's on a spectrum but it's the same question which
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:30.840]   is if we have in this country and I think we need it the first amendment as
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:35.560]   has been said many times is only defended when somebody says something you hate
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:41.560]   you can't defend it only when people agree with you and and well in the first
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:47.480]   amendment only protects against government intervention I understand but
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:52.640]   we have a culture that you should be in in normal political discourse you shouldn't
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:59.680]   have your opinion if it if it is against the mainstream be held against you that
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:05.120]   that that's part of why we have a two-party system we have if your opinion if
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:08.120]   your opinion is that other people don't deserve civil rights or should be
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:11.880]   discriminated against then it is problematic and and if that's the if
[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:16.640]   that's the baseline you know the reason that people are upset about this is that
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:20.440]   they're saying well as long as the city is a certain bit why company that I don't
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:24.040]   feel that I would be judged on my merits there because he I can understand why
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:27.360]   Ellen Powell would say okay we're not going to deal with why comment anymore
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:32.640]   that I understand she's been you know she first of all her personally she has
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:38.360]   been yeah the victim of some horrific stuff and and as a result I understand
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:41.120]   her sensitivity to this and I can't remember what her organization is but I
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:45.600]   gathered that this was kind of the tenor of the organization anyway was
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:50.040]   included was you know if it's a diverse to the first effect is organization yeah
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:53.600]   was to receive work is to organization so and that's within her rights and so I
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:59.200]   can't blame her but should Sam Altman the CEO of now I understand also like
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:03.560]   his motto would write Sam Altman should be fired at my commentator because his
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:07.120]   motto was one of two feet or two is victims right a guy golfers want to be
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:17.320]   used victims so oh man I this is a mess so if Sam Altman so my as a woman I look
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:23.560]   if Trump is if Trump is able to become president that really says a lot about
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:27.680]   what's allowed in our culture and people can be like no no I still love
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:33.320]   women I would never do that blah blah blah but if you can say those things and
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:37.560]   be accused of those things and still become president of the United States and
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:42.840]   have people stand behind you yeah that's kind of like say I mean that would be
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:46.200]   like giving money to David Duke and electing him president because you liked
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:53.000]   his economic policy right ah he's not great for blacks but you know and I feel
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:58.800]   like people aren't maybe they don't understand the depths of that I really
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:05.040]   don't it baffles me so I don't know yeah well I'm certainly believe me it baffles
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:12.200]   me too but and I'm somewhat arguing this from just yes from a devil's advocate
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:19.280]   position but but I'm a good I'm a I'm a virulent liberal I know plenty unfortunately
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:22.700]   in my opinion know a number of people including family members who are
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:28.400]   voting voting for Trump so I mean you're in Texas I imagine you know a few
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:33.200]   people you see a Trump my parents are voting yeah my dad is so which should
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:40.000]   you fire your father from the family I'm not no because he's a person who is
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:46.120]   not representing anything other than my dad I mean why Combinator the reason
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:50.240]   why people are like saying do this is because they want to say for why
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:56.120]   Combinator to make a stance against Trump's stance on women I know and I
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:08:03.920]   really don't I don't know if I think Teal should be fired I think I mean I've
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:07.280]   always thought Teal was a little I mean once he started C studying you know
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:12.320]   right no I think I think I agree with you and Kevin that there may be larger
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:17.600]   reasons why Teal probably should be ostracized from Silicon Valley but well
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:20.480]   I think that I think it is because it's not usually to examine some of those
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:27.400]   things and that's useful so that's the you know the the so when I was at as at
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:32.660]   Google we were setting up the original Google PAC which was under the old PAC
[01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:35.600]   rules where you employees had to donate and you couldn't just throw company
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:39.800]   money at it before things got weird and one of the reasons we we were doing
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:43.360]   that was because all the Google employees did was donated to
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:47.520]   Democrats and Google as a company needed to donate to Republicans who
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:51.760]   shared their agenda as well to make sure that they could do some kind of lobbying
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:54.960]   this was before Google's lobbying opposition grew to the size it is now
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:09:00.320]   and that was a that was that was very much a culturally we're very much aligned
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:04.520]   with the with the Democrats and and that corner of the the neoliberal thing
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.600]   there are a set of Republicans that that were aligned with us on tech
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:11.360]   policy that we want to work with and you've got a compromise with them on
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:15.360]   maybe some of the other issues because they'd be better than the other person
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:18.200]   running in that Republican primary or whatever so there's there's there are
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:20.920]   things like that with that you end up making those kinds of compromises and
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:25.120]   obviously obviously I've got Republican friends and people all kinds of
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:30.680]   beliefs and that's you know that's that's not something that you don't
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:34.280]   necessarily want to fire you know family members and friends that's on the
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:40.400]   point is if they demonstrably have beliefs that discriminate against
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:46.640]   people and measurably the place isn't as diverse as it could be as it should be
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:50.520]   then that's that's when you start asking about the default assumptions here
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:55.120]   yeah that's that's that's that's that's I think you know I haven't read
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:57.920]   everything that Ellen Powers remember but that's the point she's making the
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:02.800]   point of project include which is her thing is to say it's not just about
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:06.560]   explicit discrimination it's about the implicit stuff that stops people from
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:10.000]   applying and having Peter Thiel and your board of directors is going to stop a lot
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.920]   of women and minorities can apply because that's fair because they're
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:16.080]   gonna be like I don't want to get a fair shake here do I want anything to do
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:20.320]   with this I just I feel like a argument I'm sorry go ahead no I was gonna say
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:25.720]   wasn't that Mozilla's argument with Brandon right that our audience really
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:29.520]   strongly believes and that's gonna damage our ability to I don't know
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:33.280]   server it was just how I wonder it was a staff as well it was it was it was a lot
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:38.240]   of employees are saying this is you know I was a has been the good employer
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:44.320]   of us we've had corporate support we're worried about this and what that
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:47.960]   implies maybe going on behind the scenes or even subconsciously and it makes us
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:54.040]   nervous and Brendan did not do a good job of apologizing expressing that and
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:58.600]   coming through with that but retreated into the I have a first met writer
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:01.840]   what I like blah blah blah which didn't reassure them and I think that's what
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:06.280]   they're to mean being driven out and let me reassure you Stacy I completely
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:09.760]   understand your a hundred percent understand your position and I'm
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:16.620]   equally appalled although I find it ironic that you know
[01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:21.760]   transpacing things like this worst things in my I think he could he'd blow up the
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:26.600]   world yes I think it'd be bad for men and women but but I understand that he
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:32.120]   somehow crossed a very significant line there's proof past week right I mean
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:37.800]   for some people that's all like for some people hearing that yeah is enough
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:44.320]   right I mean it's is it stupid maybe but I wonder if we had some historic if we
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:48.560]   had some distance if we because I'm thinking back I remember Goldwater Johnson
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:56.040]   where Democrats thought Goldwater was you know as bad as Trump and if you look
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:00.120]   back historically you might kind of laugh at that kind of and of course
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:04.560]   Johnson made the very famous Daisy commercial where the kid counts down in
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:11.400]   the nuclear bomb goes off and some say that that's why Goldwater lost but I you
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:14.600]   know I remember my uncle who was in the CIA at the time say I'm not voting for
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:20.840]   that hey see Johnson I mean it was so it was just as I mean and we can go back
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:24.920]   even farther well beyond my memory but into the 18th and 19th century we had
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:28.560]   similar battles over other you know similarly virulent battles and that's
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:33.880]   maybe part of the normal political discussion I mean when 43 44 45 percent
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:40.200]   of the country support this guy this is this is actually Sam Altman's point that
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:44.240]   he makes in his blog post we all we should all feel a duty to try to
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:48.400]   understand the roughly half of the country the things we and by we he means
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:52.160]   the people who support Clinton are severely misguided I don't understand
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:55.280]   how 43% of the country supports Trump but I'd like to find out because we have
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:59.400]   to include everyone in our path forward if our best ideas are to stop talking to
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:03.960]   or fire anyone who disagrees with us we'll be facing this whole situation again
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:08.840]   in 2020 that kind of diversity is painful and unpopular but it's critical
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:13.280]   to the health of a democratic and pluralistic society we shouldn't I would
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:16.640]   urging people for supporting the wrong political candidate that's not how
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:21.320]   things are done in this country I would feel better if we were having an
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:30.520]   honest debate over issues well so what we all well no I know the 43% of the
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:34.400]   country that are voting for Trump in a lot of ways they're not voting for
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:38.240]   Trump they're voting against their current situation or voting against
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:43.960]   Clinton or voting against Clinton and I think that's a really important
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:49.240]   distinction that honestly the people in Silicon Valley are glossing over if 43
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:54.000]   percent of the country thinks utterly differently from them some of that's
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:59.240]   probably because of the advantages or even jobs that have been taken away not
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:03.040]   because of Silicon Valley but it's certainly exacerbated by some of the
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:07.640]   things that Silicon Valley is enabled or benefits that have accrued to places
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:13.000]   that aren't maybe the middle of the country and I don't know so that's
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.000]   what I was trying to get at that they're effectively voting against the
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.640]   neoliberal consensus and for some reason Hillary has seen as more representative
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:23.280]   of that than Trump is because Trump has positioned himself as being an
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:28.440]   outsider despite being a real estate developer with good relations with banks
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:33.600]   who comes to New York but that's you know that those the choice people have
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:36.760]   got and Hillary is seen as representative the establishment and
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:40.320]   therefore you know that's why the speeches to banks were an issue and that
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:43.400]   was there was all that stuff in the in the in the primary as well that some of
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:49.360]   that has stuck and so that's a that is I think the divide that we're not quite
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:55.040]   seeing because the parties have both been in the neoliberal camp for the last
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:15:00.560]   20 years and that opposition has not been had a way to express itself so so to
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:05.640]   some extent Trump is writing that and then there's the I need to move to some
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:08.520]   brilless of that I don't actually have a glowing white mouth yeah I like it it
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:14.000]   actually is very timely it looks like you've been you know you've got a gag and
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.720]   then there's the opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal by computer science
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:23.120]   a Yale computer science professor and quite highly respected computer science
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:28.280]   professor David Galertner learner Trump in the emasculated voter he he says
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:33.360]   voting for Trump he's by the way this is for Trump is like throwing a gin bottle
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:37.720]   through the the windows of the White House and something he really wants to do
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:44.360]   so I it's just I don't I you know I think most of us are just can't wait till
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:47.960]   this is all over but I thought I should raise this because this is it I know
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:50.720]   people say well that's not a tech issue it is a tech issue because here we have
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:55.600]   white comment and are one of the premier startup schools in the country and
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:00.280]   highly respected in the middle of embroiled in this and Peter Teal who
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:07.320]   whatever you think of Peter Teal is one of our most successful investors in
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:16.680]   tech weird Samsung has asked and demanded that YouTube remove a video of a
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:25.160]   grant theft auto mod that involves using a note seven as a bomb this it turned this
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:29.880]   is a mod for a grant theft auto five that turns the galaxy note seven into an in-game
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:37.680]   weapon and Samsung has issued a DMCA takedown I guess it does does the mod does
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:47.160]   have the word Samsung it's clearly a note seven right so and they succeeded this
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:50.560]   video no longer available due to a copyright claim by Samsung electronics
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:58.920]   you can you can run Samsung but you just can't hide I am intrigued by this idea
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:03.080]   of the airports letting you try like Samsung setting up trading stations and
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:10.200]   pop-ups I love that I feel so bad for Samsung I do too and I love the note seven
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:17.320]   my oh my so my mother and my mom and dad both have notes Evans they they upgraded
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:22.560]   the first time and now my mom is like she's kind of in the point where you will
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:28.720]   pry this from my cold dead what she still has it she still has it and my dad she
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:32.560]   she's like your father has drunk the Kool-Aid he's turning it in and I'm like
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:38.120]   no no no no get your mom to turn it in you have to turn it in and she's oh my
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:42.440]   god all right let me let me explain we think we know now what's happening and
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:45.200]   we've had some very interesting conversations about this including yesterday
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:49.960]   with Steve Gibson and on Sunday with Ben Thompson's to techery Ben it was Ben's
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:54.200]   opinion I think he's right that the reason that the even the replacement ones are
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:59.800]   broken is it's a fundamental flaw in the way the battery was made not just the
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:03.800]   one made by the Samsung affiliate which is what they originally thought but all
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:09.840]   of them they put too much battery in too small a case and the compression on the
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:15.840]   layers in the battery is causing plating to occur and the lithium ion
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:24.200]   plating around the insulator is causing short circuits in other words all note
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:30.760]   sevens are potentially bombs and no note seven is safe and your dad and your mom
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:35.440]   should absolutely send her's back and I feel for I love the note seven what a
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:39.680]   great phone what do I tell her to get she's also upset because one of the
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:43.680]   games she's on she's at a high level and that's gonna reset again do I think a
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:48.840]   complete one-for-one trade and get a hundred bucks from Samsung if she gets a
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:54.560]   Galaxy S7 okay which has never had any problem it's been out for six months or
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:58.840]   seven months now it's a wonderful phone it is effectively a small note seven
[01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:02.760]   without the stylus is she really attached to the stylus she's attached to the
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:07.440]   large size because I guess she's a little smaller if she really wants a large you
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:11.840]   know what get her and get her an iPhone 7 say oh no it's a note 7 they just
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:17.840]   change the note to I okay she's she's not stupid okay she is a little weird
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:21.720]   about this but she's not a dumb lady she should look at the galaxy S7 because
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:25.120]   it's it's just as good a camera it's the same screen it's just it is a little a
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:31.800]   little not a lot a little smaller right it's a it's a very nice phone and it's
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:38.080]   basically the note seven was a slightly enlarged S7 otherwise what do you think
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:44.080]   it's not it's just a bit shy six yeah yeah yeah the note seven was 5.7 the S7
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:49.600]   was 5.5 I think it's right it's small difference this is a little bit that's
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:52.240]   the issue doesn't have a stylus it has a curved screen though it looks like a
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:56.400]   little note seven mm-hmm so which is there another Android phone with a
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:00.600]   stylus that's worth looking at anyone there is another one and I'm trying to
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.400]   remember it's not I don't know if it's worth looking at I think LG makes one
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:11.640]   with a stylus I look LG style too has the same screens as oh yeah it's this
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:21.560]   what's it called the stylus - yeah that looks like it yeah 5.7 inches 13
[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:30.680]   megapixels 3000 milliamp hour battery just came out in June you know what
[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:36.440]   that's the one to screen though I think right it's OLED yeah mono IPS sorry it's
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:40.280]   an LCD but it says 720 by 1290 which I but I think the note seven was higher
[01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:45.680]   isn't that yeah but this is still pretty high yeah I mean it's she won't notice
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:48.840]   that difference especially yeah let's just strapping it to your face it
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:53.960]   doesn't matter yeah right okay that's one to look at
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:57.760]   yeah I just want to look at okay I'm gonna move this on brother so that I
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:00.560]   okay so you're umbrella while you're moving air Braila I'll talk about our
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:05.000]   doorbell and we will continue on I have to oh yeah you could get an older note
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:10.240]   actually that's a good point get the note five I love the note five but actually
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:18.160]   is that gonna be supported oh I don't know it's not I don't know you know I
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:23.380]   have a note five lying around I could send it to you the note five was
[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:27.940]   beautiful I liked the note five a lot stylus that's the one where if you put
[01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:31.740]   the stylus in wrong it broke it it's that the one that you would get would be
[01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:37.780]   one with a broken I still think we need no nicks I said I like that size I mean
[01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:41.820]   I know I'm the no I fought every notes is the note one I and I was mocked when I
[01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:45.380]   first got the note people thought I was that big thing was a slab of meat your
[01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:49.620]   health and I loved it and I always loved it in fact I love the note seven and I
[01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:53.620]   was I wept well I didn't really wait but that's what I said but the next is that
[01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:57.260]   what I brought next to seven is the next size up it's it is seven inches it's you
[01:21:57.260 --> 01:22:01.140]   know it's two inches bigger it's a great thing to use particularly if you've got
[01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:05.340]   you know poor vision but it's the same it's basically the same size of a
[01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:08.580]   paper that book and weighs less so she wanted this the next to seven they're
[01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:12.740]   discontinue one that the one the dead one yeah yeah I wish Google bring that
[01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:16.800]   back I love that that was an actual seven inch screen especially at that
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:21.080]   price point you know there was I was 239 bucks or something yeah so it's like
[01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:24.940]   what why does that why is that niche gone away that's that that was a lovely
[01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:29.760]   device well I think Samsung's and others still make seven inch tablets I have my
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:37.360]   I use my seven all the time in my studio I put it it's a dedicated a little
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:41.640]   Android app on it that I use for timing my radio show big screen I love it I
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:46.920]   love it it's and it's running fine but it will never be new guy as you say right
[01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:53.000]   no new guy for you guy our show today brought to you by the ring video doorbell
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:00.100]   here's the thing this is a doorbell that ties into your Wi-Fi Stacy is big in
[01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:04.900]   Internet of Things this is my favorite Internet in fact to be honest I have a
[01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:10.120]   lot of Internet of Things things I don't use this one I use every day it
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:13.600]   replaces my doorbell so I unscrew the doorbell two screws two little wires
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.240]   coming out of the jam this is actually a much nicer installation and everything
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:22.000]   you need comes with the ring video doorbell the screwdriver the drill bit if you
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.960]   needed one which you won't and all the other do hickies whoops even a level this
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:30.680]   is the level so he comes out beautiful and and it's actually a nicer installation
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:33.560]   than my original because it has this back plate that you trim the wires through
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:37.560]   and connection to the terminal and then this is the cool thing this is the the
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:42.440]   ring video doorbell by the way this is the original 720p and it has a year
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:47.320]   long lithium ion battery so you can use this on a unwired doorbell as an
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:50.880]   unwired doorbell but if you have a wired doorbell you might want to look at the
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:55.160]   new ring pro which is slimmer smaller doesn't have the battery and has a 1080
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:58.040]   p camera this is a very wide-angle camera so when you tie it into your
[01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:03.840]   Wi-Fi you can see who's ringing your doorbell you can even it's got motion
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:07.640]   detector too so you can see if somebody comes up your your steps you're up your
[01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:12.000]   walk and you can set the sensitivity so which really nice you can set the range
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.560]   you know what it's looking at and how close it also has a speaker in a
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:20.920]   microphone so as somebody comes up your steps you can say I see you it's
[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:25.160]   will be great for Halloween you will have so much fun with this it also scares
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:28.740]   away bad guys because they often come up to ring the doorbell to see if you're
[01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:34.460]   home before they burglarize your house it will also allow you to tell package
[01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:38.700]   delivery people hey just leave it on the porch there I'll be right out thank you
[01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:42.740]   and keep an eye on that package and the beauty is you don't have to be home you
[01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:47.140]   could be anywhere in the world as long as you get online the app is for iOS and
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:52.100]   Android they have a Mac app as well I think there's a new Windows app too so
[01:24:52.100 --> 01:24:56.780]   you can I can even see previous videos so when the dogs you know when we're on
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:25:01.980]   vacation we're in Russia I can see if the dogs that are actually came as she
[01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:07.820]   said she would pick up Aussie you know and what time she came I can it's almost
[01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:13.660]   like a log of everybody who came and went with video now they've got a bunch

[01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:50.020]   the most why is it the nest the most widely used IOT device what do you think
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:56.140]   so knows that's not an IOT device is it an internet it's an internet connect
[01:26:56.140 --> 01:27:06.020]   to speaker yes yeah all right I guess you're right nest echo echo if they sold
[01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:11.820]   three million nobody knows how many nests is sold how many echoes echoes was in
[01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:15.860]   the millions - right three million is the best guest that must be the best
[01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:20.380]   selling yeah that's kind of amazing because well I don't know how many
[01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:24.140]   Phillips like Hugh bulbs have sold I feel like there's got to be like a
[01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:28.700]   million of those out there right oh I don't think so that's a special
[01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:32.940]   product who wants colored lights but they have they have connected lights that
[01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:37.540]   aren't colored and then oh no look at things like tile tiles 40 million in
[01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:42.700]   revenue which means they've sold millions of connected Bluetooth
[01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:50.100]   trackers as they've sold a million and a half okay well okay so okay yeah I don't
[01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:53.580]   know I don't know if it's ring every set how many doorbells they've sold it's a
[01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:56.980]   lot more expensive than the track the trackers 30 bucks so it's a lot more
[01:27:56.980 --> 01:28:01.420]   yes expensive I don't think Jamie said how many they sold they're definitely
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:05.060]   the number one in that category oh they own the doorbell category yeah yeah
[01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:11.500]   they own doorbells yeah they own the doorbell man they own it for consumer now
[01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:15.660]   and I don't know if I get in trouble for saying this but there are other doorbells
[01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:22.660]   that are nicer or nice that are sold not direct to consumer what do you mean
[01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:27.900]   like sold to who my favorite of all video doorbells and you got to tell me if I'm
[01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:33.260]   getting in trouble here is the Vivint video whatever opinion you want VIV ENT
[01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:38.260]   didn't VIV ENT but they are a security company and you pay them monthly
[01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:42.260]   oh it's a serious system and they and then you pay a monthly fee and I wish I
[01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:45.980]   knew who manufactured that doorbell because it is they have
[01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:51.100]   buffering none of the other doorbell companies offer this but it's when the
[01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:56.060]   doorbell rings or when it detects motion it pulls the last three seconds
[01:28:56.060 --> 01:29:02.500]   before the actual doorbell yeah I mean that's good it is well wait a minute
[01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:05.660]   though the ring would do that because it detected the motion so it as soon as
[01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:11.540]   somebody comes up here okay walk they're recording right depending on how you
[01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:18.660]   have your I guess I guess somebody could like do a ton of title through but I
[01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:22.180]   get when I look at my ring most of it is motioned that most of its people walking
[01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:26.340]   by or cars pulling up and stuff like that and only a few of them are actual
[01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:29.700]   rings because you get everything that's moving around there if you turn that on
[01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:33.860]   which I did I and I have the stick up cam that's in my backyard it actually I
[01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:37.140]   just got an email today saying I need to recharge the battery and it's been up
[01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:42.460]   for two months oh that's good so you didn't get the solar panel for that I
[01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:45.820]   have the solar panel but I was curious how long the battery would last because
[01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:50.940]   not everyone's gonna get the you're doing research good for you okay that's not
[01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:58.380]   my informed opinion so are you gonna watch the election on Twitter or you're
[01:29:58.380 --> 01:30:02.780]   gonna watch it on TV debate or debate or the election the elections coming up
[01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:06.820]   you know November 28 all you Trump voters get on out there if I watch
[01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:09.660]   your anything it'll be on Twitter but I probably won't watch the video of it
[01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:14.700]   live BuzzFeed's teaming up with Twitter on election night election as well okay
[01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:19.940]   yeah and now that's interesting because didn't they have Bloomberg the Bloomberg
[01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:27.220]   stream they had the Bloomberg stream for the for the debates yeah so maybe
[01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:30.540]   there okay so that gets and also the tech news stream those are things we saw
[01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:33.340]   popping up this time last week that's right oh yeah that's right so that did
[01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:44.620]   so that deal is over so now it's gonna be BuzzFeed interesting huh BuzzFeed and
[01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:50.980]   Twitter it's you know Twitter it's I so that so the sale is I don't know what
[01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:55.940]   it's up in the air because everybody who was interested is now dropped out and
[01:30:55.940 --> 01:31:00.380]   yeah is the Donald Trump of tech companies well but and yet and yet this
[01:31:00.380 --> 01:31:04.020]   is when they're shining right is during these kind of political events like
[01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:10.220]   debates and then election night this is where Twitter really shines so that was
[01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:14.340]   so that was the you know what we're saying last week is the value is that
[01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:20.180]   they give context to live events and they and they amplify memes so there it
[01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:25.900]   is it is often better to actually just watch Twitter then watch the TV to
[01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:29.820]   get interpretation of what's going on because if you've if you've got a sensible
[01:31:29.820 --> 01:31:33.500]   number of people you're following or if you just watch the trending stuff you
[01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:37.740]   will pick up what's a summary of what's happening along with the jokes and
[01:31:37.740 --> 01:31:41.820]   things about it too and that that is that is their big advantage that that is
[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:44.900]   the thing they have that that Facebook doesn't have and Google doesn't have so
[01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:48.540]   if anyone was gonna buy Twitter as I said before it would be YouTube because
[01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:52.300]   the correlation with live video makes sense it is it is a media company isn't
[01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:57.700]   it and the other one that somebody proposed last week was Bloomberg could
[01:31:57.700 --> 01:32:01.460]   actually buy it and that would fit both those criteria the criteria of needs to
[01:32:01.460 --> 01:32:05.300]   be a Wall Street person who would impose financial discipline that everyone was
[01:32:05.300 --> 01:32:11.020]   talking about but also is all about real-time information and media and
[01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:16.460]   because the Bloomberg terminals the information is interesting so that was
[01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:19.340]   that was one that's like I hadn't thought of that yeah and so the partnership with
[01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:23.900]   Bloomberg TV was was an interesting market there so that I'm not sure if
[01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:26.860]   Bloomberg's interested I want to take that on but if that was that was like a
[01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:31.140]   they could probably afford it or at least they could raise the money to do
[01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:34.660]   it and they would fit in with a big chunk of their core business which is
[01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:38.380]   making sense of the world in real-time so that was that was one that sort of
[01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:43.100]   made makes more sense than Disney say and I still think YouTube is an is another
[01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:46.820]   natural correlate but the challenge there is fitting the two companies together
[01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:54.460]   Twitter has also turned on live streaming via periscope and more than just
[01:32:54.460 --> 01:32:58.500]   streaming from your phone they want to get the pros involved because you could
[01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:06.620]   stream from a lot of professional gear well you can do that plug in we could do
[01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:13.980]   it we could plug our you could send into that I assume yeah I actually don't
[01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:17.340]   know if they support our streamer which is the elemental but if they didn't they
[01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:20.940]   sure should because that's a very popular one or take it straight out of the
[01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:26.900]   TriCaster that's really boy that you know for somebody like for a company like
[01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:31.740]   ours it's really interesting all those different ways we could get to people
[01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:37.380]   and that you know yeah after I said all those bad things about Twitter that would
[01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:40.940]   be very interesting wouldn't it there you go well that's the thing the
[01:33:40.940 --> 01:33:44.420]   compelling thing is you're watching the video and you're commenting it and
[01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:48.940]   seeing the responses in real time on your phone at the moment you do that by
[01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:52.100]   watching the TV and using your phone watching TV using your computer whatever
[01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:55.340]   but bring it into the app makes a certain amount of sense it doesn't
[01:33:55.340 --> 01:33:58.340]   necessarily mean that with the only way you watched it but it would mean you
[01:33:58.340 --> 01:34:02.500]   could carry on watching things when you're in those those multiple contexts and
[01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:05.620]   so that's that that made sense for the football game stuff it makes sense to
[01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:11.380]   take a look at it here's the BBC World Service on periscope describe the
[01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:15.420]   conditions as the worst you'd seen now this is a radio feed right this is an
[01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:18.740]   audio only feed but they're showing they're doing video as well as audio
[01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:22.020]   they showed this game isn't that interesting I mean that's kind of what
[01:34:22.020 --> 01:34:29.140]   we do isn't it well then I was it's a conference when Bob Lord who is in
[01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:32.780]   charge of security a Yahoo was speaking and my plan was actually to periscope
[01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:36.700]   his talk because they weren't live streaming it and then people could
[01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:43.940]   actually talk and comment on it I don't know I I think Twitter has sitting so
[01:34:43.940 --> 01:34:47.860]   much information really not just information I think that they if they
[01:34:47.860 --> 01:34:52.780]   could just figure it out that they're they're sitting on something very
[01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:57.380]   interesting but so is Facebook right it's a race between Twitter Facebook and
[01:34:57.380 --> 01:35:02.420]   YouTube it is but the piece that Twitter does have is the sort of live
[01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:06.300]   contextualization the interactivity the built-in the ability to have the
[01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:10.700]   conversation about it and they are better at that than than anyone else and
[01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:15.100]   it was the thing that you know it was a thing that I realized a few years ago
[01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:18.540]   when the role wedding was on and I was like the role weddings on why would I
[01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:22.380]   watch that it was like I'll watch that live because British Twitter will be
[01:35:22.380 --> 01:35:27.100]   really funny especially especially what do they call those hats the
[01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:33.460]   attractors the the fast-to-taters yes and it was I was sitting there watching
[01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:36.620]   it with you know the family stayed up because it was a royal occasion we had
[01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:39.540]   a drink and had a laugh and they were like why are you laughing so much so
[01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:45.140]   that I'm reading the funniest people in Britain mock this but this occasion
[01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:49.420]   well what it is that what a valuable thing if you could take something that
[01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:54.380]   no one would watch otherwise and by adding your secret sauce all over it
[01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:59.900]   make it compelling shark NATO do you remember shark NATO was it two or three
[01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:05.580]   I mean people were yeah hate watching that for I know some respects it makes
[01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:11.540]   more sense it doesn't mesh well with network television because in the US
[01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:16.140]   you got three times and so two thirds the country is going no spoilers don't
[01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:19.780]   tweet about it and you know when they do the voice of the American
[01:36:19.780 --> 01:36:24.420]   they vote they're basically saying East Coast vote West Coast you know if you
[01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:26.980]   you can vote but that means you will be able to you'll spoil the show for yourself
[01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:33.020]   so making making it sort of a parallel naturally live thing like that makes
[01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:37.620]   more sense but in a country that has a more unitary time zone like the UK or
[01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:42.380]   France or Japan having that everyone's watching the same thing at once makes a
[01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:46.540]   lot more sense and so there's there's a sort of natural correlation you as I
[01:36:46.540 --> 01:36:49.940]   follow enough British people on Twitter that I get a sense of what's on TV in
[01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:55.260]   the UK about what people are mocking or when the Great British Bake off has
[01:36:55.260 --> 01:37:00.020]   drama good Lord I just read article in New York Times that said the Great British
[01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:06.620]   Bake off is bringing baking back to Britain his cake isn't spongy enough do
[01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:10.420]   you watch it I've watched I've watched once because everyone was so excited about
[01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:16.300]   it and I was like no well the problem I'd have with it was
[01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:21.020]   make me want to eat sweet treats not those sweet treats good Lord oh really
[01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:25.900]   that wasn't good I mean you're British you're not you you're not allowed to have
[01:37:25.900 --> 01:37:32.380]   a they do French things and other things as well they're mostly like
[01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:38.820]   angel or spongy cakes that aren't really cake consistency with like cream or fruit
[01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:44.300]   jams and weird I don't it's not how do you watch it you watch it on BBC
[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:52.340]   America Netflix oh yeah Netflix I guess I'll be watching yeah is there a lot of
[01:37:52.340 --> 01:37:57.220]   fun to involve it's on PBS now as well I think but it never sees behind okay oh
[01:37:57.220 --> 01:38:00.380]   yeah I don't know if they do it did I don't think they have a lot of fun
[01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:06.540]   dot or fondant or whatever in British baking no it's a bit I had was not that
[01:38:06.540 --> 01:38:09.940]   was not there it was sponge cake sponge cakes are famous each week is themed so
[01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:12.740]   each each week they have to do a spot certain class of things so there'll be a
[01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:16.220]   bread week and there'll be a patisserie week and there'll be a iced from the
[01:38:16.220 --> 01:38:24.420]   how about pesto and sundried tomato palm years or savara was gently cream

[01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:04.620]   off the rails the point about bake-off is that it does have all these people
[01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:11.020]   commenting along with it and yeah I could tell it was on to this up this afternoon
[01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:14.860]   and here this evening the UK because I can see all this afternoon across the
[01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:18.020]   stream I'm like all right there's a there's a new episode outside because
[01:39:18.020 --> 01:39:20.760]   everyone's grumbling about Paul Hollywood flirting with the with the
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:26.500]   bakers and things 150 page report released Tuesday by the Center for
[01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:31.540]   privacy and technology at Georgetown University Law School found the FBI
[01:39:31.540 --> 01:39:40.900]   databases facial recognition databases have 117 million Americans about half of
[01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:49.420]   all adults that means half of all of you are in this database and very few
[01:39:49.420 --> 01:39:53.580]   oversights or limitations on how it's used how it's searched who looks through
[01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:58.980]   it is that a problem or does it just make police better please say it helps us
[01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:03.540]   we don't have to do racial profiling because the computer doesn't know
[01:40:03.540 --> 01:40:07.940]   well you're in this is your driver's license right there's a I was about to
[01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:12.020]   say your computer is trained in a different way but did you see so tie that
[01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:17.540]   information to the vergis story about Baltimore police feeding their database
[01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:22.380]   into social media companies like Instagram and Facebook to get actual
[01:40:22.380 --> 01:40:27.100]   identities and suddenly can you see that did you pull up the link for that I
[01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:30.500]   will Facebook Twitter and Instagram sent feeds that help police track
[01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:39.620]   minorities in Ferguson and Baltimore yeah yikes so I mean and you know the
[01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:43.460]   companies were just exposing their API's and the the other you know this the
[01:40:43.460 --> 01:40:48.860]   specialist company Gio Fedia Chicago based company that says it analyzes it
[01:40:48.860 --> 01:40:53.540]   it takes them data via API without you know doesn't go to Facebook say hey can
[01:40:53.540 --> 01:40:58.100]   we just do socially a profile your it just takes the feed and then analyzes
[01:40:58.100 --> 01:41:02.940]   the post deliver real-time surveillance information for 500 law enforcement
[01:41:02.940 --> 01:41:06.260]   agencies so they can track and respond to crime I don't get it what are you
[01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:12.580]   gonna tweet hey I just robbed that lady down the street some people do that yes
[01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:16.700]   there are there are people who would put that on Facebook so I'm all for this
[01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:20.780]   because this is gonna this is gonna eliminate the stupid criminal from the
[01:41:20.780 --> 01:41:25.100]   gene pool yeah but then you get then you're selecting for smarter criminals
[01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:33.180]   this is like only taking half the penicillin oh my god I never thought of it
[01:41:33.180 --> 01:41:37.940]   that way but it's um it is you know that's when I saw the cops have hundreds
[01:41:37.940 --> 01:41:42.540]   to 17 million faces my first thought was like I bet my exactly saying is that
[01:41:42.540 --> 01:41:48.580]   all yeah yeah why are why is it why are there why isn't everybody in there well
[01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:51.460]   there's a lot of young people who haven't taken driver's license photos how many
[01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:56.980]   how many states don't there's only a certain percentage of states that
[01:41:56.980 --> 01:42:02.300]   actually you have a picture on your Texas driver's license Texas is one of the
[01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:08.100]   states that do feed into this I'm totally in this database yeah yeah huh
[01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:12.540]   well if you don't do anything wrong you have nothing to fear yeah if you don't
[01:42:12.540 --> 01:42:16.540]   do anything wrong and you don't tweet about it you have nothing to fear
[01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:20.220]   uh-huh what if I buy a burner that's not just
[01:42:20.220 --> 01:42:28.260]   cash you've been watching the wired the wire the wired the wired is different
[01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:35.740]   how about this one Joe Biden says we're gonna get them Ruskis the CIA
[01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:41.740]   according to the vice president is preparing for a major retaliation against
[01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:45.580]   Russia for hacking the DNC
[01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:54.780]   why would you say that Joe Joe why would you say that
[01:42:54.780 --> 01:43:02.100]   so the director of national intelligence one of our favorite admirals James our
[01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:08.180]   clapper the guy who said no we're not spying on any Americans no issued a
[01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:11.780]   statement that pointed his finger at Russia for attempting to interfere with
[01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:16.420]   the 2016 election leaks he said are consistent with the methods and
[01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:22.700]   motivations of Russian directed efforts president Putin says that's a political
[01:43:22.700 --> 01:43:27.580]   that's a political ploy and then then Biden on one of the Sunday shows meet
[01:43:27.580 --> 01:43:34.620]   the press said yeah we're we're gonna retaliate proportionately
[01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:48.100]   actually they did just arrest this morning or yesterday a guy they think
[01:43:48.100 --> 01:43:55.180]   might be Gucci for two oh yeah didn't we didn't he already get a good for one
[01:43:55.180 --> 01:44:03.860]   good for one okay good for two is the follow-on for Gucci for one let me see
[01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:08.460]   if I can find that story but because they did just arrest you got it there you
[01:44:08.460 --> 01:44:14.860]   go Russian hacker one of the FBI is arrested in Prague we don't know if it's
[01:44:14.860 --> 01:44:18.460]   Gucci for but we think they think according to this story in the New York
[01:44:18.460 --> 01:44:27.180]   Times that it might be somebody involved in the hacking of the DNC
[01:44:27.180 --> 01:44:35.700]   okay okay I'm like I don't know what to say other than yes we have to believe
[01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:44.460]   that Russia's hacking I believe it the man did not resist arrest he was captured
[01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:48.060]   and raided a hotel in Central Prague actually it's only been announced yesterday
[01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:52.260]   was captured a week ago October 5th about 12 hours after authorities heard he was
[01:44:52.260 --> 01:44:57.020]   in the country where he drove around in a luxury car with his girlfriend he
[01:44:57.020 --> 01:45:02.100]   must have had their face must have been in the database man was a Russian
[01:45:02.100 --> 01:45:07.140]   citizen's perspective hacking attacks on targets in the United States can the
[01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:12.140]   arrest was conducted in collaboration with the FBI after Interpol issued an
[01:45:12.140 --> 01:45:21.140]   arrest warrant they think maybe this is the guy who hacked linked in oh and the
[01:45:21.140 --> 01:45:25.300]   arrest occurred two days before the Obama administration said we now know it was
[01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:30.860]   the Russian government who hacked us so I don't know if these are connected oh
[01:45:30.860 --> 01:45:34.340]   no here it is law enforcement officials in Washington speaking on condition of
[01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:39.060]   anonymity said that the suspect did not appear to be related to the hacking of
[01:45:39.060 --> 01:45:46.340]   the Democrats emails or two organizations like DC leaks or WikiLeaks meanwhile
[01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:51.900]   Julian Assange has lost his internet access oh and yeah oh the Ecuadorian
[01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:59.060]   embassy they say the Ecuadorians say we you know we didn't want him to interfere
[01:45:59.060 --> 01:46:04.980]   with the US election not the Julius Julian was releasing emails from his you
[01:46:04.980 --> 01:46:11.620]   know little apart there I don't know and maybe was he was pretty
[01:46:11.620 --> 01:46:16.380]   shouted to something you know yeah maybe and doesn't he do like what are those
[01:46:16.380 --> 01:46:23.700]   called they're not webinars when Julian Assange does them just talk like snowed
[01:46:23.700 --> 01:46:27.540]   in and so they they appear at oh they're doing
[01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:31.980]   yeah I don't know if he was doing anything like that
[01:46:31.980 --> 01:46:36.260]   telepresence robots as he move around on the stage like snowed in us yeah I got a
[01:46:36.260 --> 01:46:39.980]   praise Larry Lessig we love we all everybody loves Larry oh yes he's been
[01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:43.900]   on sabbatical he's been in Iceland I think he was on his way he says I'm on my
[01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:48.380]   way from Iceland to my parents to see my dad who's not doing well posted this on
[01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:53.260]   his a blog Lessig tumbler.com landing in JFK I found my inbox flooded with
[01:46:53.260 --> 01:46:58.420]   questions from one of the leaked Podesta emails this is a email exchange
[01:46:58.420 --> 01:47:05.100]   between John Podesta chairman of the Clinton campaign and a woman named
[01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:08.900]   Neera Tandon
[01:47:08.900 --> 01:47:15.780]   Neera writes about Lessig I effing hate that guy like I'd like to kick the poop
[01:47:15.780 --> 01:47:20.140]   out of him on Twitter but I know that's dumb that was in response to Podesta
[01:47:20.140 --> 01:47:26.140]   saying this an everyday American pompous law professor the smugness of Larry
[01:47:26.140 --> 01:47:30.500]   Lessig now if I were Larry I my feelings might be a little hurt although he
[01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:37.060]   apparently he knows Neera and here's his very I thought very lovely response I'm
[01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:42.220]   a big believer in leaks for the public interest that's why I support Snowden
[01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:47.740]   and why I believe the president should pardon him but Lessig writes I can't for
[01:47:47.740 --> 01:47:50.980]   the life of me see the public good in a leak like this at least one that reveals
[01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:57.660]   no crime or violation of any important public policy we all deserve privacy the
[01:47:57.660 --> 01:48:02.020]   burdens of public service are insane enough without the perpetual threat that
[01:48:02.020 --> 01:48:07.300]   every thought shared with a friend becomes Twitter fodder Neera has only ever
[01:48:07.300 --> 01:48:11.620]   served in the public and public interest sector her work has always and only been
[01:48:11.620 --> 01:48:16.500]   devoted to advancing her vision of the public good it is not right that she
[01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:21.600]   should bear the burden of this sort of breach not only is he not publicly
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:28.340]   offended but he's publicly defending her and and spanking wickie leaks and
[01:48:28.340 --> 01:48:33.100]   indeed you for really out yes oh yeah I guess I shouldn't well he posted on his
[01:48:33.100 --> 01:48:39.380]   blog he's not suppressing it that's a good point but I thought that was what a
[01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:46.420]   gentleman and of course we love Larry Lessig yeah yeah and it was very clear
[01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:50.620]   that they locked him out the debates on very spurious grants earlier yeah yeah
[01:48:50.620 --> 01:48:53.940]   because he was running for president he had a very interesting plan he was he
[01:48:53.940 --> 01:48:58.340]   says there's no way anything can happen till we get rid of this crappy
[01:48:58.340 --> 01:49:02.500]   system of campaign financing so I here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna get a great
[01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:06.980]   vice president it'll be huge should be great he'll be the best ever and then
[01:49:06.980 --> 01:49:11.940]   because no one who actually is running for office will ever get rid of the way
[01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:16.300]   campaigns are financed that's how it you know it's self-reinforcing so I will
[01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:22.060]   win I will eliminate I will institute public funding of campaigns and limit
[01:49:22.060 --> 01:49:26.220]   it for private funding of campaigns fix this whole mess then resign so this other
[01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:31.460]   guy can be president which I thought was an interesting point of view right his
[01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:35.940]   candidacy ended almost before it began well but basically they they changed the
[01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:40.700]   rule three times to stop him showing up in the right primary debates right and
[01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:45.740]   that was and put his point was to do that and then argue the others into
[01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:48.980]   supporting the policy which probably Bernie would have done because it's a
[01:49:48.980 --> 01:49:52.580]   kind of thing he already had something like that in his platform get it on the
[01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:56.380]   agenda absolutely yeah so that that was the that was the point of thing but also
[01:49:56.380 --> 01:50:01.860]   to some extent his point was sort of undermined by the way that the the
[01:50:01.860 --> 01:50:05.020]   primaries went which what which he didn't go with the money which which is
[01:50:05.020 --> 01:50:10.660]   also fascinating in the republican side that the three candidates for the most
[01:50:10.660 --> 01:50:17.300]   money and got knocked out right interesting yeah Jeb Bush yeah yeah
[01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:26.900]   did he has Elon Musk have made his announcement no that's an an hour is this
[01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:32.340]   the one where the the Model 3's or do it no that's on the site never mind
[01:50:32.340 --> 01:50:38.860]   there's supposedly some big announcement apparently it's model 3 part 2 don't
[01:50:38.860 --> 01:50:43.580]   go with a trailer yeah and that will ship in 2020 2020 I don't know what
[01:50:43.580 --> 01:50:48.180]   I'm money now he says take things to another level
[01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:55.780]   oh he's gonna build a second story we have double decker car we should point
[01:50:55.780 --> 01:51:03.620]   out that Stacy and I both drive Tesla's so okay we like the guy let's wrap up
[01:51:03.620 --> 01:51:14.100]   with the a font farewell to Leo Baronek of bolt Baronek and Newman he was an
[01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:20.340]   acoustics designer who with BBN basically designed the internet under
[01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:30.540]   government instruction passed away at the age of 102 so BBN was a really
[01:51:30.540 --> 01:51:35.820]   important Boston engineering company in 1969 they want a contract from DARPA
[01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:40.380]   net to build the first computer based network it came to be called ARPA net
[01:51:40.380 --> 01:51:45.860]   and from DARPA they got the from the defense departments advanced research
[01:51:45.860 --> 01:51:51.900]   projects agency can I tell you that I've been watching the Americans and the
[01:51:51.900 --> 01:51:56.940]   excitement in that show over the ARPA net is just awesome yeah I'm like they're
[01:51:56.940 --> 01:52:00.820]   like the ARPA net it's gonna be big so the Americans take place in in the
[01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:05.460]   60s 1980 no it takes place in the 80s the 80s but there was yeah so it's a
[01:52:05.460 --> 01:52:09.860]   little that's a little anachronistic but okay no no it's no no we call it
[01:52:09.860 --> 01:52:18.860]   ARPA net then there was the ARPA net yes cuz when did it become like the
[01:52:18.860 --> 01:52:23.420]   actual internet not not the browser I know this is everybody's like big thing
[01:52:23.420 --> 01:52:26.460]   because everyone's like oh it's the 25th anniversary of the internet no that
[01:52:26.460 --> 01:52:30.460]   was last year that's the web yeah that's the web that's the web no I was oh god
[01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:35.460]   late 80s yeah I think it was called the internet roughly that time as well yeah
[01:52:35.460 --> 01:52:40.260]   is that mid 80s it was still ARPA net and separate Janet Janet and all the
[01:52:40.260 --> 01:52:46.140]   other things we're gonna get together okay yeah okay and then the NSF controlled
[01:52:46.140 --> 01:52:51.740]   and ran it all yeah until them until the early 90s when they said okay do
[01:52:51.740 --> 01:52:56.500]   whatever you want yeah National Science Foundation anyway Leo Leroy Baranek
[01:52:56.500 --> 01:53:02.220]   of Barrett bolt Baranek and Newman Wow did he see a world that changed from his
[01:53:02.220 --> 01:53:08.020]   birth in 1914 to his death this week oh that was the beginning of World War one
[01:53:08.020 --> 01:53:14.780]   right yeah yeah what what a world what a world what a world yeah I also read a
[01:53:14.780 --> 01:53:17.780]   great essay about how the Soviet invented the internet and why it didn't work
[01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:25.300]   which why why did it because they have open standards basically and they it
[01:53:25.300 --> 01:53:29.980]   didn't work because they were too busy trying to keep it secret in fighting
[01:53:29.980 --> 01:53:34.380]   amongst bureaucrats and so it they're one failed because they were behaving to
[01:53:34.380 --> 01:53:38.540]   like proprietorally and you know competing with one another and the
[01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:41.700]   American I succeeded because they were behaving more socially and sharing with
[01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:45.860]   one another so it's but it's a great article it's worth reading by Benjamin
[01:53:45.860 --> 01:53:49.340]   Peters who's basically been researching is written a book about it and some
[01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:54.540]   rice is looking to it into very nice article but there was basically secret
[01:53:54.540 --> 01:53:59.340]   Soviet research program for to try and build the sort of country-wide network
[01:53:59.340 --> 01:54:04.700]   but but it was got it got squashed because the people running the different
[01:54:04.700 --> 01:54:07.060]   organizations didn't want the information to flow they wanted to pick to keep
[01:54:07.060 --> 01:54:12.060]   control in South Korea to Russia Internet reads you and to some extent
[01:54:12.060 --> 01:54:15.140]   you know that applies to the British experiments with packet switching as
[01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:19.380]   well because they were done under the auspices of the the extension of the
[01:54:19.380 --> 01:54:23.420]   war program which which was very secretive and so that was not recognized
[01:54:23.420 --> 01:54:25.980]   in the same way that often it was because often it was done in public so a lot of
[01:54:25.980 --> 01:54:29.820]   it is about actually publishing the protocols and the work you can do so
[01:54:29.820 --> 01:54:33.260]   other people can adopt it too and that didn't happen with a lot with but the
[01:54:33.260 --> 01:54:39.060]   Soviet one and with the ones this is a book how not to network a nation that's
[01:54:39.060 --> 01:54:42.700]   the book that's the book that's the book and the thing I wrote was the
[01:54:42.700 --> 01:54:54.580]   God's Cooling Aeon which I just Chuck it oh yeah I know it's Eon.co is it a it
[01:54:54.580 --> 01:54:59.300]   was a magazine it's a magazine but don't they also or am I thinking of Kwanter that
[01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:04.340]   does the licenses the articles out to other publications even does too there's
[01:55:04.340 --> 01:55:08.060]   that there's a license there's a republish this on the side thing that's because they're
[01:55:08.060 --> 01:55:15.260]   not profit the Soviet intern yet they called it that is a good title in turn
[01:55:15.260 --> 01:55:21.260]   yet he's not good I love it what I'm gonna read this is by the guy who wrote
[01:55:21.260 --> 01:55:24.860]   the book actually yes it's a very good article it's very well done and nicely
[01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:33.980]   everything so yeah it's very good a Eon.co very good stuff and boy watch out
[01:55:33.980 --> 01:55:38.940]   October 21st if we can't reach an agreement these guys are going on strike
[01:55:38.940 --> 01:55:47.820]   any guesses these are the guys who voice video games unless an agreement is made
[01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:52.180]   this week between sag and after and a coalition of video game companies by the
[01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:56.660]   way I'm a sag after member disclaimer here so if they go out on October 21st
[01:55:56.660 --> 01:56:03.300]   I'm gonna have to stop working on video games or work still working at all
[01:56:03.300 --> 01:56:08.220]   well I got a support of my cat cross my own picket line so you have to stop
[01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:10.800]   playing video game that's it I'll stop playing video games
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:17.020]   yeah by the way they earn more than a hundred dollars an hour plus benefits and
[01:56:17.020 --> 01:56:21.420]   that's the minimum many make much much more money in fact did they get
[01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:25.980]   residuals some do if you're a really good voice over actor
[01:56:25.980 --> 01:56:30.820]   that's what you can negotiate that Mark Zuckerberg is looking for a voice for
[01:56:30.820 --> 01:56:39.700]   Jarvis yes hello Mark what can I do for you today Leo are you auditioning I
[01:56:39.700 --> 01:56:47.500]   would like to be your voice Mark maybe you prefer to have something silly
[01:56:47.500 --> 01:56:54.420]   I don't know whatever way you want it any way you want it
[01:56:54.420 --> 01:57:00.180]   someone put in the chat room and it's worth maybe saying David is it I don't
[01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:03.660]   know how to say his last name but the founder of PC world Mackerel this is a
[01:57:03.660 --> 01:57:08.740]   great article by our friend Harry McCracken I don't know when Benel passed
[01:57:08.740 --> 01:57:17.180]   he passed at Tuesday night oh well then that is a big deal David is well known
[01:57:17.180 --> 01:57:22.340]   by anybody who's ever read a magazine he was the founder of PC magazine PC
[01:57:22.340 --> 01:57:28.140]   world and Mac world and a really a great guy and everybody who's worked in this
[01:57:28.140 --> 01:57:32.860]   business as a tech journalist if I never met the man but everybody who's worked
[01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:39.900]   in the business certainly knew of him he edited and starting in 1975 mitz Altair's
[01:57:39.900 --> 01:57:43.220]   newsletter about their computer computer notes which is probably the
[01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:48.260]   first personal computer magazine started personal computing wonderful
[01:57:48.260 --> 01:57:52.740]   magazine co-founded PC magazine and PC world which were at each other's
[01:57:52.740 --> 01:57:59.020]   throats for many years during the 80s and 90s and then Mackerel Harry wrote a
[01:57:59.020 --> 01:58:06.300]   very nice tribute to David Benel passed at the age of 69 on Tuesday and of course
[01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:14.180]   Harry Neum very well he worked PC world for 13 years yeah kind of a legend in
[01:58:14.180 --> 01:58:18.900]   the business so one more thing for me to throw in was the article I wrote well
[01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:26.420]   this was published today about how the web became unreadable and how did it
[01:58:26.420 --> 01:58:33.660]   become unreadable it's a long story but basically there's a whole series of
[01:58:33.660 --> 01:58:37.100]   choices that designers but you actually see it on that page there the type at
[01:58:37.100 --> 01:58:41.140]   the top is is illegible because it's so gray there's been this trend to make
[01:58:41.140 --> 01:58:47.100]   type grayer and grayer it was that I ate that and so my theory on that is that
[01:58:47.100 --> 01:58:54.740]   it started when when we went from CRTs to LCDs mmm suddenly and with Microsoft
[01:58:54.740 --> 01:58:58.420]   clear type suddenly instead of being fuzzy around the edges all the pixels
[01:58:58.420 --> 01:59:02.780]   were actually squares and also with the clear type and the sub pixel rendering
[01:59:02.780 --> 01:59:08.860]   it went to much crisper letters and so the designers was something like
[01:59:08.860 --> 01:59:12.780]   everything just suddenly got sharper that's I want to soften that a bit and
[01:59:12.780 --> 01:59:17.740]   they and that at that point they started switching to using slightly less you
[01:59:17.740 --> 01:59:21.420]   know less black and white and more gray on white or gray on gray this is my
[01:59:21.420 --> 01:59:25.580]   favorite passage Apple's typography guideline suggests that developers aim
[01:59:25.580 --> 01:59:31.540]   for a seven-to-one contrast ratio but they stayed it in there on their website
[01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:40.540]   in text that's five and a half to one yep yep I've got to Google say seven to
[01:59:40.540 --> 01:59:45.100]   one and then they have it 4.6 to one you see a lot of great Texas low contrast I
[01:59:45.100 --> 01:59:49.540]   guess yeah so it's a collection of things that there was that initial thing
[01:59:49.540 --> 01:59:53.860]   where people started using grays a lot and then that just became the default
[01:59:53.860 --> 01:59:58.540]   there was Apple pushing very hard for the very thin fonts which makes it even
[01:59:58.540 --> 02:00:02.860]   worse so when they went to have a nowhere like as the system font suddenly
[02:00:02.860 --> 02:00:06.380]   everything went down in contrast enormously but I think a big part of it
[02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:10.940]   is that designers and software engineers who are building these things are sitting
[02:00:10.940 --> 02:00:16.740]   in well-lit offices with very big bright screens and have a huge amount of
[02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:20.700]   contrast headroom whereas when you're sitting out side looking at your phone
[02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:24.940]   so much more of that contrast going away from from the illumination and the
[02:00:24.940 --> 02:00:30.420]   environment you're in right and so there is it's a sort of failure to model what
[02:00:30.420 --> 02:00:33.020]   people are seeing and they're also part of it is that anyone who's working
[02:00:33.020 --> 02:00:37.580]   graphic design tends to have extremely good eyesight right
[02:00:37.580 --> 02:00:43.540]   well and also it's true that black really black black on white white is so
[02:00:43.540 --> 02:00:47.820]   contrasty that it actually can to me it's a little painful almost right but that
[02:00:47.820 --> 02:00:52.260]   that says to me is you should turn the brightness of your screen down oh I never
[02:00:52.260 --> 02:00:56.980]   thought of that the fun is that an office screen you are sitting there staring
[02:00:56.980 --> 02:01:00.540]   into a light bulb those things are in a hundred watts right that the background
[02:01:00.540 --> 02:01:04.620]   aluminum is very strong and the desk the laptops they have ambient light
[02:01:04.620 --> 02:01:08.140]   sensors the desktop things don't right so a lot of people are staring to two
[02:01:08.140 --> 02:01:11.940]   bright screens and they're sort of reflexively compensate in that way so
[02:01:11.940 --> 02:01:16.500]   part of this would be go round and a put sort of a fill light behind your screen
[02:01:16.500 --> 02:01:20.380]   so that it's not the brightest thing in the room but also turn down the brightness
[02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:25.580]   so and or adjust it across the day so that you're not sitting there peering
[02:01:25.580 --> 02:01:29.580]   into this this giant glow because then you subconsciously start doing it wrong
[02:01:29.580 --> 02:01:33.300]   when we redesign our website we got a lot of complaints from people said why did
[02:01:33.300 --> 02:01:35.820]   you use a white background it's too bright it's too bright it's too bright
[02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:39.860]   and I think you're right I mean I but you can't really tell your users oh just
[02:01:39.860 --> 02:01:43.220]   turn your monitor down you knit with your white is too but but that's part of the
[02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:46.100]   problem is that they've had to turn it up because all these other sites are
[02:01:46.100 --> 02:01:50.020]   using grey oh just to read the grey oh yeah you're like the equivalent of a
[02:01:50.020 --> 02:01:55.500]   loud commercial in the middle of a TV yeah so we die we use we get some tea
[02:01:55.500 --> 02:02:02.340]   and we died at all a little bit yellow yeah I mean so I'm happy with like the
[02:02:02.340 --> 02:02:05.300]   if they've got a brightness issue turn down the white don't bring up the black
[02:02:05.300 --> 02:02:10.860]   to grey that's you know even if that's your issue making the black sort of you
[02:02:10.860 --> 02:02:16.740]   know 45% white doesn't actually help as much as turning the white down to a more
[02:02:16.740 --> 02:02:21.060]   neutral color so that's it people look at this and say I can produce the
[02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:23.700]   contrast and they do it the wrong way and that's just a sort of weird fashion
[02:02:23.700 --> 02:02:27.260]   that we've got into so I'm pushing back against that but the other half of it is
[02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:31.900]   that the contrast ratios we use to measure are based on foreground color
[02:02:31.900 --> 02:02:37.900]   over background color with a modifier but the point is if you don't take into
[02:02:37.900 --> 02:02:41.900]   account the weight of the font how wide the individual strokes are then you're
[02:02:41.900 --> 02:02:46.860]   missing a lot of the actual contrast and standards the accessibility standards
[02:02:46.860 --> 02:02:51.460]   we use don't think about the the font weight and font width at all or they they
[02:02:51.460 --> 02:02:55.180]   talk about it in sort of yeah so that's that's the example it's like that these
[02:02:55.180 --> 02:02:58.860]   are both notionally the same contrast if you measure them by the ACAG thing
[02:02:58.860 --> 02:03:02.340]   because that just specifies foreground to background color but in practice the
[02:03:02.340 --> 02:03:05.980]   one on the right is much dimmer because the font verticals and horizontal are
[02:03:05.980 --> 02:03:11.820]   much thinner and that's that's that's that's part of the problem is is that
[02:03:11.820 --> 02:03:16.860]   we've we've now have more control over typography but we're using it in silly
[02:03:16.860 --> 02:03:22.260]   ways we're using it to make things too thin and less legible all right I love
[02:03:22.260 --> 02:03:26.900]   that you exist I know isn't it great isn't it great I love it and it's not
[02:03:26.900 --> 02:03:30.500]   gonna be grumpy with me for the rest of the week but it's follow follow Kevin
[02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:36.260]   on medium yeah follow him on medium and by the way indie web.com now right
[02:03:36.260 --> 02:03:41.980]   dot org oh dot org I somebody got the cop dot com damn the wide ago it's an
[02:03:41.980 --> 02:03:47.020]   ISP that has gone out of business living. Indie web is people focused alternative
[02:03:47.020 --> 02:03:52.060]   to the corporate web let's let's make the web the way it used to be the content
[02:03:52.060 --> 02:03:56.660]   is yours you're in control and yet we're all talking with one another it's a
[02:03:56.660 --> 02:04:01.060]   great site and you guys have the homebrew website club meetings on a regular
[02:04:01.060 --> 02:04:04.940]   basis next meeting is coming up tonight Bellingham. There's some tonight well
[02:04:04.940 --> 02:04:09.780]   some we've missed the ones in England and Germany but Portland San Francisco and
[02:04:09.780 --> 02:04:12.180]   Bellingham. No they're not there's that's wrong we need to fix that it's not
[02:04:12.180 --> 02:04:15.420]   Portland San Francisco but there are other ones going on Portland San Francisco
[02:04:15.420 --> 02:04:19.020]   are actually next week we move that but it could change the homepage. Very good.
[02:04:19.020 --> 02:04:27.100]   Stacy what do you got for us as a pick of the week? Ooh Ooh Ooh I have two things
[02:04:27.100 --> 02:04:31.700]   well okay are you gonna be bad at me for showing you two things? No I'm the
[02:04:31.700 --> 02:04:36.500]   the show is yours go for it. All right here we go I've got to turn the light on
[02:04:36.500 --> 02:04:43.860]   so this is the hue brighter colors lamp and this is always so fun to like do
[02:04:43.860 --> 02:04:48.980]   anything under like not to rest. I'm like ah what am I doing I don't even know
[02:04:48.980 --> 02:04:55.660]   oh I'm adding a room you would think I would know how to do this okay here we
[02:04:55.660 --> 02:05:01.980]   go I am excited because I used to have so the first initial hues came out and
[02:05:01.980 --> 02:05:06.100]   they were they didn't do greens really well so it didn't allow you to do
[02:05:06.100 --> 02:05:10.060]   beautiful turquoise colors like this and here's my.
[02:05:10.060 --> 02:05:16.060]   Ooh see I don't know if that comes out this is this is hard. The white
[02:05:16.060 --> 02:05:18.740]   balanced fights with it turns it turns it turns it turns it turns it turns it
[02:05:18.740 --> 02:05:21.900]   like it's gonna it's gonna perpetually so you can kind of see it against my
[02:05:21.900 --> 02:05:28.260]   shirt maybe. And so now you've got that so this now makes the hue light bulbs as
[02:05:28.260 --> 02:05:32.220]   good as the life ex bulbs in my opinion unless you like really hate hubs like
[02:05:32.220 --> 02:05:38.500]   Kevin Tofol hates hubs so these new if there even richer colors on these new
[02:05:38.500 --> 02:05:42.460]   hue bulbs is kind of what you look for on the box but this is like convinced me
[02:05:42.460 --> 02:05:45.820]   to go all in on you because now I finally have this beautiful color that I love.
[02:05:45.820 --> 02:05:53.700]   So that's one two is my recipe so I put a video there this is not the best shot
[02:05:53.700 --> 02:05:56.980]   video it is not like super impressive especially compared to like that dude
[02:05:56.980 --> 02:06:04.580]   who did the the Time Warp song on his garage what I don't know okay so this is
[02:06:04.580 --> 02:06:11.420]   these are my Halloween lights and I just basically so my recipe is basically how
[02:06:11.420 --> 02:06:19.340]   do I automate my lights that was it. I was sure it was short but the whole
[02:06:19.340 --> 02:06:23.500]   goal here is before Christmas I want to just help people how I'm doing this so
[02:06:23.500 --> 02:06:27.100]   they could be like boom these are the things I need to do what is the command
[02:06:27.100 --> 02:06:32.500]   turn on Halloween oh turn on Halloween turn on Halloween so I got there's a
[02:06:32.500 --> 02:06:38.860]   couple things here there from what you're seeing in the front there are two GE
[02:06:38.860 --> 02:06:44.380]   outdoor Z wave modules that you can buy you can also use iDevices if you're a
[02:06:44.380 --> 02:06:48.220]   home kit person i devices makes an outdoor module but that's like $75
[02:06:48.220 --> 02:06:52.700]   that's just waterproof right that's the point yeah it's just what it's IP 65 or
[02:06:52.700 --> 02:06:59.620]   something rated so in the GE ones are $35 and I have a lot of them so I want
[02:06:59.620 --> 02:07:04.540]   with GE if you do the GE you're gonna need a hub this speaks Z wave though so
[02:07:04.540 --> 02:07:10.260]   then I use the Wink Hub for mine you could use smart things and you basically
[02:07:10.260 --> 02:07:16.700]   what else am I thinking you connect those to the hub and then the hub talks to the
[02:07:16.700 --> 02:07:23.700]   echo so I set a schedule on Wink and then I also did the echo and so I say echo turn
[02:07:23.700 --> 02:07:28.900]   on Halloween and turn off Halloween and it's done and it obviously could be
[02:07:28.900 --> 02:07:33.900]   more elaborate you know yes yeah this is just a proof of concept well it's
[02:07:33.900 --> 02:07:37.060]   actually okay guys it's my actual Halloween lighting well it's Halloween
[02:07:37.060 --> 02:07:40.680]   you don't gotta go crazy in Halloween Christmas I have nine different
[02:07:40.680 --> 02:07:46.180]   connected outlets plus the music you do really yeah cuz I love Christmas
[02:07:46.180 --> 02:07:50.180]   well I love Halloween too but I think Christmas you should definitely go on I
[02:07:50.180 --> 02:07:54.500]   want to see this now well Christmas so it's it's like I have lights on my
[02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:57.700]   banisters you know and then the Christmas tree gets its own stuff and
[02:07:57.700 --> 02:08:00.620]   then there's the outdoor so some of it's indoors some of its afters alright yeah
[02:08:00.620 --> 02:08:05.820]   yeah I'm not a professional lighting designer and if anyone's really you got
