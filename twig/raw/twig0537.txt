[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:39.120]   Stacy Higginbotham you're pulling a Jarvis I am although I'm in a really nice lounge so it does look nice
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:46.160]   the Alaska Endgate Lounge at Seattle fun it has a fireplace it's kind of like the fancy lounge in
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.400]   Copenhagen wow for those of you guys who are lounge lounge literate well and of course no one is more
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.480]   lounge literate than our own Jeff Jarvis I know them all I have privilege all the medallions
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.640]   Professor of Journalism at CUNY I guess we got to start with the big change in leadership
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.640]   as we ever Google and alphabet I guess Google's not going to change but alphabet is Larry and
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:23.280]   Sergey in their annual letter announced yesterday that they're they're leaving and they're going to
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.400]   let Sundar Pichai has done such a good job with Google over the last few years take over his alphabet
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:38.480]   CEO I have to say I loved in the recode I loved who was it your your former colleagues post
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.520]   saying I don't think it's going to make any difference at all Larry's and Sergey was so
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.160]   dialed out exactly that's what I was going to say what's the big point of this story I know that
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.160]   they're the top two of Google the founders from the very beginning one years ago but at the same
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.840]   time what exactly have they done for the last say let's say five years to where they invested in
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.720]   a lot of stuff that may get killed now yeah yeah from a leadership Sergey for sure has not been
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.480]   very involved Larry's been doing fun projects yeah he's been having a good time uh Larry has a
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.800]   whole floor uh at the Googleplex and in fact you know he was named in some of these Andy Rubin
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.760]   stories and some of the stories about the failure of Google plus and so forth as being kind of
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.440]   instrumental in some of this stuff so I think he has hands on does he is his voice still gone is it
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.800]   back he couldn't speak for a while yeah remember now well no he was he did he didn't speak at an
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.280]   I/O where we were both that he remember that crazy talk it came back to what extent yeah but I
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.400]   just wonder if one of the reasons we don't hear as much about him is because he's not a public I
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.600]   think he hated yeah the the public eye right so a lot of the operational stuff you still
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.560]   think they had their fingerprints on it sir no I don't think so right I don't think either of
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.760]   them really did I know he had a floor and he probably he was probably doing visionary you know
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.880]   this was all about the visionary moonshot stuff he was really crazy that area but I think it's been
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.560]   Sundar driving the big ship for a while well Google for sure and Ruth Porat their C the alphabet CFO
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:21.920]   has definitely had a hand in uh you know making a lean mean company um I also wonder what the
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:28.320]   relationship is between her and Sundar that's a good question I imagine it's I bet they're pretty
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.120]   I would think they'd be pretty in line because otherwise you wouldn't one of them would be gone
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.560]   by now correct me good point correct me if I'm wrong but Sundar Pachai seems like a get-along guy
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.120]   he seems like a very easy-going guy I remember the only time I've ever had any dealings with him is
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:50.480]   when he was still at in charge of Chrome OS and the and the first C48 Chrome laptop came out and he
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.560]   and I had a long talk uh where I was just saying why would anybody want this this is crazy and he
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:03.360]   was instead of getting mad and defending it he was very I thought he was he was very calm and level
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.440]   headed and gave me some very cogent arguments about why they thought it was a good idea and he
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:14.080]   and now he's laughing at it turned out he was completely right uh so I'm in I don't think he seems
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:21.120]   like the kind of guy who uh has any edge he's not imperial I've met Sundar before and he is a
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.320]   delightful yeah yes so I've met both him I've met Andy Andy was very
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.880]   standoffish isn't the right word but if you were not someone he thought he should talk to he did not
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:41.120]   necessarily talk to you um Sundar is a very warm human in person so that's yes yes my experience
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:47.440]   as well and now I have to point out go ahead no all right I'll start I have to point out
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:56.240]   uh that Larry and Sergey still have a majority of stock they have uh votes 85% of the 51%
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:04.480]   so they have yeah if if if sir Sundar does something they don't like or the board does
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.960]   something they don't like they have still they're not seating that kind of control there so I think
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:15.280]   they own like this is 17% of the actual stock but they have 85% of the phone so with that said
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:21.840]   is anything going to change then well that's that's kind of I guess the question that's why I think
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:28.480]   what's in alphabet oh no I think it's gonna be yeah I think we'll see the continuing
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:35.360]   closure of things that aren't working right but yeah I don't think I think it's going to be pretty
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:42.080]   much business as usual maybe a little less hands-on and coddling of the employees I think this could
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:47.040]   this might be a nice cultural and psychological break for the company you know they've also
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:52.160]   didn't they cut back on the number of like meetings and that sort of thing I think this might be
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:58.960]   yeah so this could be a change in leadership signifying a change in overall culture well it also
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:07.040]   okay it also comes at a very uncomfortable time for Google they're under a microscope from Congress
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:13.360]   they have employees who are unhappy they're you know there's there are a lot of negatives right now
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:20.000]   Google and I you know I don't know if Larry and Sergey are the type who don't engage in battles
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.440]   like that but I this is it doesn't seem like a coincidence that they're leaving this is Peter
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:31.920]   Kafka's piece at recode he says if you don't spend much time thinking about Google this will sound
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:36.720]   like a big deal on the other hand it's very hard to say this will be meaningful for Google
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.440]   employees or anyone in the world who uses Google products because Paige hasn't been focused on
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:46.880]   Google's core search advertising business for a very long time he managed a portfolio of what
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:53.920]   the company calls other bets and by the way I think this is what's going to be end up being at risk
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:03.120]   businesses like Calico and Waymo and I wonder if once Larry's you know protection is gone
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:09.360]   if it's gone it may not be gone but if it's gone if Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai might say well you
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:17.840]   know would we be a stronger company if we stuck to our knitting so I think Google has to find out
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.520]   what it's knitting it's in the middle of trying to figure out what it's knitting is going to be
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.800]   as search which is totally still relevant but is going to become less relevant over time
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:32.160]   now that we embed computing in more places if we look at the future of computing
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:40.400]   Google and Google is figuring out where it wants to be in that world is what it needs to do and
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:46.400]   I don't think Larry was helping on the other bets I think he was looking more at what's fun for him
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:53.440]   in what's interesting from his perspective so I'd like to get your perspective on so I just put
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:10:00.000]   up a list of the other bets I'd be curious just to do a quick tour of them and see what your thoughts
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.640]   are you mentioned well X is just the the the the bell labs of Google I think they're going to keep
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:13.280]   that because it's fun Waymo let's start there I do think that there's there there's still
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:21.200]   tops in that field there's not a clear business there at all yet but it's such a tiny tiny field though
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:29.040]   well potentially huge if all automobiles are self-driving in five or ten or even 15 years
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:34.320]   that's the next big thing for Google here's what Elon Musk has said though and I'm not sure he's
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:40.880]   wrong on this one he says it doesn't there's no such thing as a self-driving car software company
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:47.200]   you have to make the cars and make the software because the data that you get from making the cars
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:55.440]   it's a it's a it forms the software it's a it's a virtuous cycle and you can't do one without the
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:01.360]   other so a musk is of the opinion of course he's got a car company that the self-driving vehicles
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:06.960]   are to come from car companies not from companies like Apple and Google and this is the only reason I
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.880]   remember this is because this also comes up with it in the context of Apple like
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:17.280]   can they really be a software self-driving don't they have to make a car right and I don't you know
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:22.560]   Google is Google gonna manufacture car or are they gonna say come along and partner with
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.440]   a car manufacturer like Ford but they are partnering with car manufacturers don't they have a deal
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:34.640]   with Chrysler yeah but is that the same thing yes I think car companies want to outsource this
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:41.440]   aspect of their innovation Google's happy happy to be that partner for them and I also would not
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:47.440]   I would not discount the advantage that Google has from its other machine learning efforts and
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:54.240]   its ways and other properties so yes I think there is definite data coming in off the car
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:12:01.360]   but they can get that through their existing partnerships and I think yeah I second Stacey
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.720]   I know why Elon saying that because he's got this giant car he's got a car company but I don't
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.720]   I don't think he's out of line saying it I don't think he's in fact remember it's a proper
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.720]   competitor thing to say but I don't think he's I don't think he's you know it's always said that
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:19.840]   too if you want to make great hardware you got to make the software it's got it there is something
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:27.040]   to be said for controlling the entire chain and I think if Chrysler and Google try something
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:34.080]   but it's head to head with I don't know Audi VW Audi where they've doing it all the full stack
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:38.240]   that they may have a disadvantage I don't know you're right yeah I don't think I'm always something
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.720]   you sell I wouldn't cut way more with it oh wait well they're not good they're not gonna solve it
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:49.440]   you can't I wouldn't cut it I think it still has my or at loon yes cutting loon is the
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.480]   so these the internet loon is their high flying internet which was originally balloons I don't
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:13:00.240]   know what they're using now but they actually just did too they just announced some sort of deal in
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:08.240]   I think it was Portugal or Brazil huh someplace that speaks Portuguese well there you go it was
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:14.320]   the Amazon actually Amazon Amazon yeah but I'm gonna tell you that's not a big revenue generator I
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.920]   don't know how many people there are in the Amazon but I don't think I think it's more well when you
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:23.760]   get to Africa yeah then you got some you get to parts of India you can get you can get real
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:31.520]   conic scale there and get people on so I don't vote I say hold on I say dump it I say it doesn't
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:37.200]   really matter it's probably not a huge cost well you can't do that what are you know if I if I'm
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:43.040]   analyzing it I would say it's probably not a cost center or a huge cost thing for them and I mean
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:50.320]   all of these are basically hey do you cost more to operate than than the future like they also want
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:56.080]   to see your strategic business Tacy so you're you're a resource the internet is very important
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:02.560]   for Google so based on that if it doesn't cost a lot to do Loon and you get some good publicity
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:07.040]   wins plus you're learning you've got a nice field for bringing internet to hard places I think
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:11.200]   it's a good bet I don't know how much it costs to do Loon but according to their results from the
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:17.040]   last quarter they spent more than 1.3 billion dollars a quarter on bad thought like Loon and
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:22.240]   way of all the bets that's all the bet that's one point three billion dollars a quarter
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:27.920]   more than five billion dollars a year you're going to be looking hard at at these other bets
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.080]   especially with that Larry Page protection we have a board meeting going on I want to hear
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:37.920]   the vote from Ant I say let it go yeah but oh we're tied okay that's so karsten you get to get
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:45.920]   you get to break the tie mr vice president you keep keep our wing aviation I didn't even know they
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:54.960]   had this this is their drone play right yes in Canberra Australia and Helsinki we are missing
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:59.120]   a critical piece of information which is how much they spend on these how much they lose on them
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:03.680]   you know this is what I'm like um I think they keep it because it's a good research bet and drones
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:09.280]   are going to be a big deal I know they're keeping everything right now for me but so what all right
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:15.440]   gentlemen you got to write the 1.3 billion dollar check Stacey I'm just saying I'm on it I don't
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:22.720]   think there could be the delivery business she's lounge living she must have money
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:28.240]   mcconnie i take it rid of it what is mcconnie power i didn't know they had this one either
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:34.880]   it attempts to harness renewable energy from wind by using propellers on airborne kites oh this
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:40.800]   is the kite one the boy this they started this years ago 15 years ago okay i take keep loong
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:45.520]   kill this one kill this one yeah kill it kill the guys we didn't vote on wing
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:51.040]   um i said keep it i said get rid of it it's probably cheap keep it
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:58.560]   and by the way get rid of it again this is the worst board of directors ever
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:05.520]   we have no experience we got to lose we got nothing to lose get in the game
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:13.040]   the worst board meeting ever all right verily this is the life science one remember they kind of
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:21.920]   had already had a loss with the contact lenses uh that they announced surgical robots threaten
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:27.600]   the scan i can't i can't sell this one Stacey i sell it because it's not tied into any of the
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:35.360]   core businesses like drones are interesting because mapping it's data gathering it is mostly
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:40.720]   mapping i think that's important and i think loon is important for internet but verily i'm not
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:45.520]   into plus they just bought fit but they got health data now i don't even remember verily
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:52.000]   yeah it was the diabetes detecting contact lens i think do they have an anti-aging effort too
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.280]   no there isn't that well maybe that is that under verily there is a big anti-aging like
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:01.600]   but this was also larry page never wanted to die but wait wait go to the actual fibrillation
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:07.600]   what's that what's up clever you got a dog you got some skin in that game yeah i do are they
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:14.880]   see is it loomie loomie by pampers yes what is that the diaper that senses yes that's a connected
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:20.240]   diaper the connected diaper does it analyze the poop that's data no i just let you know when
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:25.680]   by the way that is the future there is poop okay hoop analyzing toilets uh is definitely the
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:32.560]   future of medicine verb surgical yeah this might not be the one but they definitely
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:38.800]   had a i just uh larry doesn't want to die a project yeah you can kill that one too
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:44.720]   you can't kill it that's the problem it's gonna live forever all right it's a good one sidewalk
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:49.840]   lab keep it for sure that's all about their business drop one Toronto from it they're getting
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:56.320]   as he are i agree here's kill it well kill it but this is what you kill it you know it's
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:05.200]   where i cover it so it does with the exception of government is always government businesses are
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:10.960]   tough and they're gonna always incite controversy with the public and with your employee base you
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:16.720]   don't get a lot of money out of them google is historically terrible at making user-friendly
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:21.520]   products government stuff has to be very user-friendly look at IBM's like contracts business
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:30.240]   so i'd sell this sucker in a heartbeat whoa tough Ruth is tough i am harsh we should get Kevin
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.640]   rose in here because he was at google ventures he might still be at google ventures and he probably
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:40.800]   has a better idea of all this stuff costs yeah this is tough without a p&l i'll be honest yeah
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.200]   all right speaking of which a capital gngv are their ventures there's all these so that's
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:53.360]   a deep mind deep mind oh ape absolutely this is a uh ape yeah he's not going anywhere i think
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:59.040]   you have to don't you it's the future yeah definitely the future um calico i think that was the keep
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:04.720]   very alive business wasn't it calico is the anti-aging yes i think you could kill that too yeah that
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:08.720]   don't get killed because Larry finally i'm really interested in this one especially Stacy's view
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:15.760]   access what is that that's their fiber business their fiber business so that had a big impact
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:20.960]   it actually lowered fiber costs in places where it went in but cuckoo realized it was horrifyingly
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:30.240]   expensive i still think i think with 5g and new spectrum facility i think they should keep it
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:37.840]   because i think they can actually deliver broadband in more places for less and compete and it's
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:42.800]   such an essential part of all of their businesses that they should keep it and keep researching ways
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:48.480]   to do it better i would have assumed with all of the money google has uh it would be the bigger
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:53.440]   player to help get raw areas more connected that's the old days they already decided not to do that
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:59.920]   what is dead can never die this is this died already years a couple of years ago google basically
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:04.720]   stopped putting in fiber yeah well but they only resale was it was bios they all else is
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:09.440]   banded anywhere but i i still use it right now they keep it because they have a responsibility
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:15.920]   to existing customers well they also they built their yeah they built their own infrastructure and
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:20.720]   i think they're waiting because the technology changed in the middle so in the middle of their
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:27.600]   deployments they one realized their cheap fiber plans were not working out but two we saw 5g
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:33.680]   coming on the horizon and microwave so they own web pass remember and so they so i think what
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:40.720]   they're doing is probably waiting a hot second or five years and you're going to see them redeploy
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:46.560]   with a wireless strategy that's my hunch that's my hope too or well thank you for this episode
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:54.240]   um your roost pore out uh this by the way just in from the google fiber uh press room
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:21:00.640]   they've decided to stop selling the hundred gigabit and only sell the gig i mean the hundred
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:06.640]   megabit and only sell the gigabit so this this confirms what you were saying stacy which is that
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:13.760]   the lower speed plans are money losers uh it's 70 bucks a month and you'll get a gig um
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:20.560]   i wonder though if this is a business i think they've already kind of decided not to pursue this
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:26.480]   but now they're saying they're all in on a gig once you've made the infrastructure investment
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:33.840]   fiber it just runs itself you just cut well it's not a little bit i mean the big the big money is in
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:40.400]   deployment and so the big investments in deployment so keeping it operational makes sense you might
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:46.240]   see them i mean would you see them sell to municipality i don't think so i think that this was probably
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.800]   cheap in fact it might not even be a money loser they probably make their money backs you know they're
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:55.360]   the money's already sunk it's that it was the cost of trenching and putting it all in
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:01.520]   but if you think about it this way too now you have these interesting test markets where if they
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:06.320]   come up with some kick-ass service they could actually deploy something really interesting and
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:12.320]   that's start yeah and pushing the gears to deploy more so i think it's kind of like a bird in the hand
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:17.120]   i like your wireless strategy stacy i like i like that too i think that you know 5g and so on so
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:22.720]   so the alphabet home page is ridiculous it doesn't list any of these ventures whatsoever it's only
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:27.680]   one page plus an investors page and it still has larry's letter starting alphabet
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:39.920]   there will be hind huh you remember the url xyz abc dot xyz abc dot xyz i knew i knew they had
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:46.080]   cute where do we classify google's domain business because that is ridiculously silly sounds no i
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:54.640]   depend upon it i love it i guess really we don't know the answers to these questions not only because
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:59.840]   we don't have the pnl that ever stops us yeah i know we're pundits we're supposed to make up
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:05.520]   answers but more importantly we don't really know what the new google and i'm gonna
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:11.600]   guess there's gonna be kind of a new google what its priorities will be what cinder pachai will take
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:17.440]   what direction i'll take alphabet in here's my my guess is i saw a chart uh i forget who put it up
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:23.840]   of of diversity of revenue and and you know google used to be 98 advertising now i think it's down to
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:31.120]   low 80s i think diversification of revenue amazon is in much better shape for diversified revenue
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:36.640]   across the hostian business and advertising now uh google's awfully dependent upon advertising still
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:41.760]   you know who's advertising industry it's not a bad position to be and lord knows right but i think
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:48.560]   that that's a risky position what what makes it risky if they own it and they're pretty much
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:56.720]   to standard uh because i think um so i went to i went to a thing yeah i went to a thing at uh a few
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:02.960]   weeks ago with um an author record dinner so i won't be explicit but with like five brands there okay
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:10.560]   and three pundits like me and uh the hosts um you know a company that serves those brands
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:16.400]   uh and i was there was uh i'll be blunt there was a nihilism to these guys
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.560]   uh where they didn't really care about quality they didn't really care about news they didn't
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.440]   really care about the things we thought they might care about a little bit just because they're not
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:27.600]   fine they were honest what they said was what they do what they do care about is they have their
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:32.400]   direct relationships with their customers they don't need advertising i think advertising as a as a
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:38.400]   field is going to decline that's my answer and then that hurts lord knows our business media
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.560]   well what is that going to be way but what do you do if you're a startup or you're a young company
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:46.880]   you don't have a relationship you're still going to you're still going to have advertising but it's
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.960]   not it's going to be on the decline is all i'm saying a different pro so let's say let's say
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:57.760]   it's uh you didn't say but let's say it's proctor and gamble established brand i can actually give
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:04.480]   you an example from kimberly clark kimberly clark okay fine so they i okay are they pampers or
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:09.200]   loves i can't remember which diaper is theirs but they've they're also clean eggs and i mean they're
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:15.520]   they're yeah so what they've started doing is they've created a a diaper delivery kind of like there
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:21.280]   used to be one i can't think of diapers dot com and what they're doing is they've they found the
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:26.960]   parents they sell them stuff directly they've cut out the middleman and they love it they don't
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:31.600]   have to advertise to these people and that's their model not for everything but they're not going to
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:37.760]   see everything they're in an unusually bad market because everybody grows out of pampers so how do they
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:42.880]   how do they have to get new customers every few years how do they get those new customers they buy
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:51.680]   mailing lists they do deals with hospitals yeah they do deals with website they buy websites for
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:58.800]   pregnant mothers which is a marketing cost but but that's that um a lot of this a lot of the advertising
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:03.600]   world and i'm working on this with media companies with a group goes directly to commerce
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:10.720]   um you know you buzzfeed is just freaking brilliant at direct commerce and they're not just doing it
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:14.560]   for their own products like their their tasty stuff they're they're doing other things for other
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:20.400]   companies so that's a form of advertising you can argue yes but what the the the holy grail is
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:24.560]   you have a direct relationship i think i love a stasis example because it's it's also an annuity
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:30.800]   business for a few years her example is good but i still like mr leport i think about those smaller
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:36.320]   companies the people that are just getting started the tin person and they'll buy so they'll buy
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:42.080]   direct marketing links i actually was talking to a small company they are a tiny company building
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:49.120]   they're how to squeeze Switzerland i think and they are doing a smart home thing they're doing
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:56.000]   uh the google targeted ads and retargeting retargeting is their biggest sale so they've bought basically
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   bliss and they're doing the retargeting and that but that's small that's in the advertising world
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:09.360]   like a company like kimberly clark or proctor and gamble they spend i mean those are the ones you want
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:13.840]   right you don't want the tiny little startups who are buying for pennies well i'll tell you who
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:18.080]   does want them is that and they're sitting right there in the in the house built by them is the
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:24.560]   twit network because you're your casper and you start on twit and you build up and then
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:29.600]   unfortunately and sadly you go to tv and spend a bloody fortune right but look at all those
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:33.440]   companies that that built direct relationships with consumers harries which i use you know all
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:38.880]   these they all move on uh for my move on but they start central once they start up they uh they
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:44.080]   get that relationship there is you got it you got to have some way to prime the pump but i i think
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:49.760]   absolutely right once the pump is primed and flowing you're probably good yeah as i said it in what
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:54.400]   would google do i think or another book i can't remember what advertising is failure you fail a
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:59.440]   lot but but in an ideal your customers sell you people find you on your own you don't spend anything
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:08.240]   on marketing you need to advertise when that fails and that's failing less and less so if you look at
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:15.040]   the stock market the stock price for google they took uh larry and serge's announcement with absolute
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:21.920]   aplomb that in fact the i guess it went up looks like it so so here's the the price had well but
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:29.120]   this is the five-day price which had tumbled a little bit uh in the midweek actually that's uh
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:34.720]   that's a whole year but let me let me go back to the five-day it had tumbled a little bit midweek on
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:40.320]   monday for some reason it went down and stayed down until the announcement and then it jumped up
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:48.880]   so the stock market likes it whatever that means so here's the question um i think people are being
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:57.280]   uh emotional about this and silly but having said that a lot of people don't like him
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:02.480]   so what would happen to facebook stock would it would it go up without sucker burn or would it
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:07.520]   yes people say no no people say instead no the business dynamics or the same even with that share
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:13.040]   price changing are are the people still considering the fact that they owned that what was it 85%
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:19.600]   of the 51% right maybe that's true that's true stabilizing if sucker burn i think the stock goes
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:27.360]   way up if sucker burn leaves because you could just pile all the problems onto onto the departing back
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:33.200]   of mark zucker burn him played him for everything it's gone right it was same thing when travis
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:38.640]   caloneck was forced out at uber uh it didn't fix it in the long run probably they still have
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:44.000]   problems but but a lot of those you know issues went away when travis went away and i but but
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.320]   there's another there's but there's there's another part of this which is who comes in so you i think
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:54.640]   i'm fascinated by by soon darprichai and saute nadilla right our top notch managers their next
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:59.520]   generation run the company really well top notch managers is shearl that
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:12.400]   ooh sandberg yeah she's always a company of course sir i mean yeah she i i don't so i would say
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:18.560]   soon dar is very much a manager such a is kind of a quiet visionary i'd like he's i don't know if
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:24.160]   he's surprised me so much but he has really moved microsoft very well through some really rough
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:28.720]   yeah you have to give him a lot of credit for the last five years for and he's done it with a
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:34.640]   vision i mean people people don't i don't think they credit him for recognizing what's that vision
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:41.920]   is well he's he's gone all in on the cloud for licensed software and he's got i mean azure has
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:49.040]   done an amazing job and he's done it while also holding his customers hands in a sense he's out
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:55.920]   competed amazon in a lot of ways just by being the enterprise friendly cloud that amazon couldn't be
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:03.120]   and then google's out there with cool stuff but he's also managed to deal with you know all these
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:08.400]   legacy products and keeping i mean he's let's see he shut down windows phone do you shut down windows
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:15.920]   phone i'm trying i know he took the right off a no key so yes he did he took the right off on
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:23.200]   no keyo overture he definitely he never liked the no keyo acquisition and uh i think yeah windows
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:30.240]   phone he such a basically moved them from a software company to a cloud company and i think
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:36.080]   he's still doing it yes i mean do you look at you look at where microsoft is positioning with like
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:43.840]   iot and services associated with that i think i think he's doing really well he's doing it in a
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:51.600]   way that i think is unfortunately for him he's not playing the visionary ceo role and so he's
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:58.240]   he's just getting shit done and who's this so dar pachayor such a nadela sacha nadela well he is
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:03.120]   the visionary ceo is exactly what he is but he doesn't he doesn't he's not like there's a
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:07.680]   credit she's saying i think he's not like all he ever does when he stands up on a stage at a
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:14.880]   microsoft event is spout vision okay but he but it does come to life i think it's pretty clear he's
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:21.040]   the visionary behind microsoft shift he was in charge of azure when he stepped up i think that uh
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.800]   no you got to get no i give you give i don't think you give him operational credit as much as
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:31.040]   visionary credit who microsoft is very strong though maybe maybe and i think sonar pachay
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:38.000]   is is much stronger operationally than he is uh vision as a visionary i agree with you on that
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.880]   but google doesn't need a visionary google just needs to keep this is i think really the bottom line
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:48.080]   google needs a visionary google needs a visionary it's core business is under serious
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:52.320]   threat and in the next i would say 20 years it's going to be gone yes yes that's what i'm saying
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:58.560]   yes it's not gone you guys are saying ads are on the decline that you definitely need to rethink
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:04.160]   things i wouldn't have assumed ads wanted to climb but google's gonna be just fine
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:11.680]   think about so think about how you find information today you you like voice search 50% of their
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:16.480]   search i think two years ago they said 50% of their searches were voice search which means
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:22.960]   i'm coming in i'm asking for information from this entity i'm no longer seeing in some cases
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:27.920]   web results that people are buying okay and yes there's still doing retargeting on things like
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:32.160]   that when people hate it ad blockers i don't know what percentage of their business comes from
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:38.400]   adwords versus uh the other one that's sense that's sense at sense
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:45.840]   retargeting versus buying stuff on google i think google's doing i actually am more bullish on google
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:55.600]   search and ads business long term than that i i don't know how does how are customers going to
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:01.440]   change how they do google has so much data you know i mean look at amazon i mean in fact really
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:08.480]   the there's a lot of if if if amazon's strong google's strong google has as much data about us as
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:13.040]   a supply and abandonment supply well a amazon is taking away advertising google
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:16.960]   they're a new competitor in the market and they're growing there's plenty of way you can make money
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:22.800]   with data that don't necessarily mean display advertising but it's advertising nonetheless b
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:29.520]   um i think that uh it's a supply and demand in this case what i'm arguing is the demand is going
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:34.880]   to decline and prices are going to decline yeah people are not going to want to buy ads the same
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.120]   way they're going to have the direct relationship with the customers think about things like your
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:45.120]   smart kitchen where you're going to have i'm going to see ads on my grocery list and if google's
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:50.640]   not providing me my grocery list in my grocery grocery grocery store is or maybe it's my refrigerator
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:55.280]   company those are people who are going to net those sales we're going to see a diffusion
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:01.280]   of where we're getting our information and it's unclear who's going to own all those platforms and
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:07.200]   google has to stay in the game and also in a market like that what you do is you get market share by
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:11.680]   buying other companies up and rolling them up but with anti-trust they can't possibly do that
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:19.520]   they can't buy app nexus well of course by plexus it's just got bought but we're safely so yeah
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:24.160]   so here's the one business i would keep as far as google which is anything to do with ai
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:30.320]   yep i think google is dominant in ai and has an opportunity to become more dominant in ai and
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:37.520]   whatever replace is advertising is going to depend heavily on data and ai and where's the value there
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:41.600]   is it in the processing power or is it in the data i'm kind of one of those silicon val like
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:46.960]   it's always the two mints just build it and you'll figure out where the value is there's value in it
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:53.280]   especially here's where the value is you got a lock on it and so you're right stacey
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:58.080]   why is why is the customer relationship valuable because you keep it to yourself
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:04.080]   right so you you have you know every kimberly clark knows everything about pampers users or
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:12.000]   loves users whichever one it is but i i think that doesn't help the ecosystem and i think that
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.800]   somebody who knows stuff across product lines is going to be even more valuable
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:22.800]   yep because after all you know you can only grow to some a certain point with existing customer
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:27.840]   data with relationships ultimately you have to beat the other guy you have if you're pampers you
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:33.200]   have to beat loves you have to steal market share from the competition how do you do that if you're
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:38.160]   only data point is your relationship with your existing customers i think there's a huge amount
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:44.400]   of revenue opportunity and ai and data information that's why amazon is betting
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:48.320]   so i was going to talk about reinventing the second but all amazon talked about was ai
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:55.040]   so before so yes but i would also say there's an opportunity that you're missing it's not just
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:37:00.800]   about stealing market share it's also about making your own operations more efficient so if you can
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:07.360]   make your operations more efficient lower your cost of goods sold then you can make higher margins
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:13.040]   on the same product and your market share sure you can go after that but you might be okay not going
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:17.200]   after it and then if you think about using the same amount of data to reinvest in your product
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:23.120]   to make it better you're still going to then gain market share i would think that both coke
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:29.600]   and pepse are really efficient and i know that they desperately would like to take away one point
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:34.960]   of market share from the other guy i i think so they're not so yes but they're taking it away in
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:40.320]   new products and i think that however you do it away and well but you need that data
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:45.680]   and you need those customer relationships to understand where the market is going and build
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:49.760]   those new products where you're going to gain that customer relationships are very valuable i
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:53.280]   certainly agree with that this whole company this whole company's built on the relationship with
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:59.600]   an audience period but i also think it's somewhat limited and i think if you're a global corporation
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:04.320]   there are a lot of other data points you really would like that are external from the things that
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:09.120]   you just know it would mean i think it'd be a big mistake for a company to focus in word and say
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:14.960]   we're just going to be more efficient super serve our customers at least i can't think of a lot of
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:21.040]   companies that have done that and i think amazon's a really good example why is amazon
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:26.880]   why is amazon a juggernaut because they spread and in branch out on this one day
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:30.560]   which is what i'm saying that's what you will need to do so that's that's what they're going to do so
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:36.320]   amazon uses the data it has to launch new products and build on those right it doesn't
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:40.640]   launch new products without the data to support it and they don't buy by the way amazon is notorious
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:45.440]   for buying very little advertising right so the amazon's are the future of the world and i would
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:49.360]   also say that you can only do that if you have critical mess i was able to do that because they buy
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:56.400]   companies and buy more data and expand into other areas uh you have to be pretty big to be amazon
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:02.400]   data well what if what if yes but what if you are google you have the ability to be that big and
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:07.520]   you could also offer that those insights so instead of selling advertising space what if you sell
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:12.320]   insights about the customers back to the companies that need those insights that's what i'm saying
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:18.160]   is that there's huge value in ways we may not fully understand yet beyond advertising and
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:22.080]   what google already knows and what google is getting correct can i ask another question i guess we'll
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:26.640]   just wait for another another 10 years the past before we see all of this happen because none of
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:32.080]   this is out soon right no and not anybody on this panel is going to be the next ceo of google so
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:37.520]   thank god so let me ask you another question yes uh i don't want this to happen and i think it would
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:43.040]   be stupid if it happened and i think it's uh without without reason to happen but if google
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:49.680]   were forced to split up it would be emphasized again set up a order more and i think it's the
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:53.600]   wrong way to go and i think it's the wrong way to go it's not good but if it were and you're
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:59.840]   you're soon to are in charge which way do you what do you want to what do you give up you sell off
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:06.480]   youtube go ahead because that's the first target that's good that's good yep yep i like that there's
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:10.640]   a few you can write do you sell android you can't do it yeah sell android the problem is you're
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:15.440]   starting to cut off data and i mean the whole reason for android the entire reason for android
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:20.800]   is data so you want to be careful you want to be careful about what you cut off and he knows
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:25.440]   better than we do what what is most valuable in that regard but uh yeah i think there's things
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:29.120]   you gotta hold on a double click the ad stuff is the ads you keep the search
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:35.440]   search can look search you're right search isn't let gonna is gonna change and i think you know
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:41.120]   voice search you're right you don't see those display ads but you also do get data from search oh
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:47.520]   god yes and if google continues to be the best place to go to find something
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:52.320]   they're i think they'll continue to succeed and you know that's one reason you maybe could get
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:56.480]   rid of android because you're still gonna get all the searches from android going through you
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:00.960]   and ios by the way and they spend billions of dollars a year to get apple to do that
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:08.400]   so i think they're i i'm pretty bullish on on google and i think it's been awful a lot of stuff
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:15.840]   and still have a very long-term viable business it may not be advertising i guess that's their
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:22.640]   whole problem is we've got to figure out what's next i don't i think you were right stacey when
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:30.240]   you said it's got to be something already in their sphere so i like green self-driving cars are i
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:38.800]   think a little bit a far far afield they're not in their lane oh but i do i think if you look at
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:46.800]   the strategy that google and amazon pursue it's to expand their tendrils into data to get more and
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:53.440]   more data about users that's the only way to go well amazon just wants to sell you more stuff
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:42:01.680]   yeah but again i think uh i think there's a there's a play with the data that's beyond just
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:06.960]   selling you stuff maybe it is just selling you more stuff amazon's using data to build better
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:13.440]   services amazon think about it as a services company so yes so yes they make more money with
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:18.720]   AWS than they do selling things right i don't know if they make more money they may their higher
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:26.000]   profit margins okay it's pretty good balance sheet memorized it's a pretty good that was a
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.320]   good business and it was google related go you guys i know i enjoyed that so somebody
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:36.480]   google you got to give us more major news every week please and we'll cover you all right let's
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:43.600]   uh it's interesting that you bought up satya nadella because he is the third era for microsoft right
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:49.840]   it was gates right then bomber than nadella we're now just entering the third era for the younger
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:55.680]   google it's only 21 years old it was uh i guess you could say it's kind of the third and a half
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:59.760]   wish miss was first larry and serge first yeah but it was really and it was schmitt
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:04.880]   then it was larry and now it's a cinder patchy i think we all agree you couldn't pick a better
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:12.640]   guy to run alphabet yes i don't know who else is out there but i it's sundars the obvious choice
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:20.320]   he's a he's a good choice yeah proven all right let's take a break when we come back there i i want
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:30.400]   to get stacy's take on reinvent amazon every time earlier today mary jofoli was saying i pray that
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:34.720]   amazon because microsoft is praying to starting to do the same thing which is you announced 38 new
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:40.400]   products every time you open your mouth it says it's getting hard this is getting tough but i know
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:44.720]   stacy has her finger on the reinvent pulse so we'll find out what amazon announced yesterday
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:50.400]   i'm not buying that keyboard effect i haven't even cracked up in my deep racer i bought it for
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:54.480]   not how do i get invited to this reinvent would be a good thing to go to 60 that would be a good
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:59.280]   one to go to 60 thousand people went this year you know remars is the one you want to go to what's
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:06.240]   that that's boring it's cloud uh remars is the very fun ai robotics conference
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:12.880]   uh well i was hoping to remind everybody to that uh no no 60 000 people at uh reinvent compared to
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:20.240]   30 000 at microsoft ignite tells you something what am i using right now everybody says leah what browser
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:28.880]   do you use i use brave brave is a better browser that protects you it gives you the best experience
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:34.560]   and i want you to try it because brave is free it can coexist with whatever browser you're using
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:39.600]   on any platform i use it on windows i use it on mac i use it on linux i use it on andra to use
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:48.800]   it on ios you will love brave it's a next generation browser built by a team focused on the things
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:54.320]   you're focused on what if you said if i ask you what are you looking for in a browser performance
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:45:00.880]   yes privacy yes they're making a better internet for you with privacy by default
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:06.320]   and you get complete control over who has access to your online activity and because you're not
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:14.240]   downloading a bunch of junk it's six times faster than competitors i always like to go to the brave
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:20.080]   settings because when you download brave go to brave.com/trit to do it go right into the settings and
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:26.080]   start looking at things because you'll start to get a better idea of what brave can do for you
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:34.400]   for instance the shields the default shield settings for all websites block most ads
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:38.160]   but not brave private ads and i'll show you how you can sign up for those that's controlled in the
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:45.280]   brave rewards setting you don't have to see those blocks cross-site trackers i love this it's https
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:50.080]   everywhere it automatically upgrades connections to httbs by the way these are
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:54.880]   all things that used to have plugins for i don't need to because it's based on chromium you can
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:46:01.600]   use all the chrome plugins but really i only need a couple now like last pass and privacy.com
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:06.640]   you want to block scripts you don't need no script you can i don't because then nothing works
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:13.520]   you can block cookies of course device recognition that's kind of interesting i block all device
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:19.760]   recognition attempts why should anybody know what i'm on i also disallow facebook logons
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:24.720]   embedded posts twitter embedded tweets linked and embedded posts those are just ways of gathering
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:29.760]   information about me choose the search engine you want of course you can use google i like start
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:34.080]   page it's all the google it's kind of like the brave of search engines it's all the google
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:41.680]   without the tracking you also have a brave wallet you can use web torrents it supports a hangouts
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:47.200]   a component to enable screen sharing in the browser i'm going to show you a couple more things that
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:53.360]   i really like in the additional settings of brave this is one i would go right to site settings
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:57.680]   and here's where you could do you know what i hate you know what i hate all those sites that say
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:04.800]   can we give you notifications i just block all of those requests and then if i i've i'd
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:10.240]   allowed a few here i can i can add or subtract them but i don't want to get the requests even
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:16.320]   you totally control that you can say sites can't use motion sensors they can't figure out where
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:19.760]   you're going i don't do that on my desktop but you might want to do it on your mobile device
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:27.280]   you can control autoplay you know i don't like the autoplay who does turned off baby i can go on
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:33.520]   and on and on this is a browser that's built for you gives you settings in every way you want to
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:38.880]   control this brave sync is great because all my bookmarks are automatically copied to everywhere
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:44.960]   i go i just think this is the best browser ever because it's based on chromium it works
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:49.200]   though exactly the way you expect it to it looks just like you expected to
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:54.800]   it the only difference is you unget unmatched speed online privacy and a better user experience
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:48:00.960]   and by the way of course it's absolutely free it's easy to get set up you can automatically import
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:05.200]   it's easy to switch back and forth or just go straight to brave i don't find the need to use
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:10.080]   any other browser but you still can if you're on a laptop or a phone it will save you battery life
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:16.960]   and reduce your data costs i i just think this is the easiest best browser now one thing and jeff
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:21.200]   talks about this a lot that a lot of people are concerned with ad blocking that you're
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:26.640]   taking away revenue from sites you like and nowadays a lot of sites will say hey you're blocking ads
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:31.280]   of course you can disable it if you want but there's also a way you can opt into brave ads
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:36.640]   these are privacy respecting ads and you'll get rewarded with bat tokens the basic
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:43.280]   attention tokens and you can then award them on you can pay it forward to content creators
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:48.000]   so it kind of is the best of both worlds you you improve privacy you fix the web but you can
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:53.120]   also give publishers their fair share of web revenue i think that's a really innovative idea
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:58.320]   created by brand and i think the guy who created javascript co-founder mozilla firefox and brian
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:05.280]   bondi you get private browsing built-in tour so you can get extra privacy private browsing
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:12.640]   most other browsers isn't really private it is on brave so my suggestion go to brave dot com
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:20.240]   slash twit b r a v e dot com slash twit and switch to a better browser brave yesterday was about big
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:26.960]   tech today is about us brave and please use that special url you can i know you're smart you can go
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:31.680]   to brave dot com and download it but if you go to brave dot com slash twit that says hey
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:37.920]   anything so on twig that's good we want to go and let them know actually they they have had a huge
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:42.720]   jump i was just looking at the download numbers of brave browser partly because they went to the
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:48.800]   1.0 the you know the finished version but i think partly because us their their numbers have
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:53.360]   gone through the roof people love army baby well once you use it you tell other people people love
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:50:00.640]   brave thank you brave for your support uh you know what i would kill if i were googled if i
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:09.600]   are i'd kill stadia just stop it now well that's not that's silly no let's let's give it time because
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:16.000]   maybe stadia is the same way pixel four was everybody's going to ride like on it and you're
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:21.840]   right i got it for two weeks and three weeks and in four weeks oh it's great now so did you turn
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:27.200]   on the always on 90 Hertz refresh you can do that if you want but it will hurt battery life i
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:31.840]   i don't see the need you don't need it yet doesn't make that much more different that's what that's
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:36.000]   see that's why people why you get bad reviews because it's little things like that with people
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.800]   boy you don't have 90 Hertz refresh at all times and that like they know like you tell maybe some
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:47.040]   people can't know no they don't most people can't think so uh so i'm curious what uh y'all think
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:56.240]   about these google workers uh google fired uh four employees the thanksgiving four because they
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:51:01.280]   were fired right before thanksgiving a google said because they were accessing data of other
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:07.280]   employees they were tracking them employees were scared once they found out this was happening
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:12.400]   some of google's employees actually moved they're asked to move their location because of it
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:18.720]   uh but these four Lawrence berlin paul duke rebecca rebecca rivers and sofi walled and
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:26.160]   wrote a post on medium in which they announced they're gonna they're gonna sue for wrongful
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:32.000]   discharge because they say it's it has nothing to do with what google says it has everything to do
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:38.640]   with the fact that they are among the group of people who uh want google to adhere to a higher
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:44.480]   standard we spoke up and how do they respond google didn't respond by honoring its values or
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:49.280]   abiding by the law it responded like a large corporation more interested in revenue growth
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:54.720]   than ensuring worker rights and ethical contact google fired us for engaging in protected labor
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:59.520]   organizing that is illegal of course and so that's why they're uh they're suing what
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:05.360]   i don't know what to think here i'm sure i'll get roasted for this but again
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:12.320]   google is a business and even if this wasn't google if this was uh your local i don't know corner store
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:19.040]   that has a staff they would do the same thing if the same type of issues were popping up getting
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:24.400]   access to data that they shouldn't have access to and sharing it and so forth it's business is
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:30.480]   business and if these folks want to sue google have at it you have that power and i hope it works
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:35.840]   out for you i hope the right stuff comes out of it whether it's google was right or whether
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:39.520]   the employees were right i should point out in their medium post the employees wrote
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:45.920]   uh google spread rumors we were rule breaking troublemakers who leaked sensitive information
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:50.720]   that is flatly untrue and in the privacy of our meetings with hr and google's internal investigations
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:57.280]   team the company acknowledged this so there's some dispute over the facts all right take it to court
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:05.040]   karstin did you want to say something your mic's on sorry about that um no i just actually uh i
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:12.320]   had jeff's mic off okay i was okay he wants to apologize to jeff for all to hear yes sorry jeff
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:16.160]   but now that you've heard this we've set the stage what do you think jeff
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:21.040]   i was just making a smart answer mark console um
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:27.040]   side turn his mic off turn his mic up oh no that's that's i think these these cases are as hard as
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:32.240]   trying to get involved in somebody's family squabble and divorce yeah right it's it's um
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:39.040]   it could be either way it could be uh in fact being fired for they were organizing they could
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:42.800]   be violating the rules of the company and as an says you're a company and you and you enforce the
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:50.560]   rules i don't know i've no way to go to the nlrb the nlrb will presumably have discovery uh the
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:55.120]   ability to to say well google let's see the evidence that you that they did what you claimed
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:54:02.640]   so are they are they working with an established because the rules around labor organizing are
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:09.760]   really tough and no you're not allowed you're not allowed to shut down unionization right but
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:15.200]   you do have to follow a lot of rules about how to contact your fellow employees and where to do so
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:21.760]   and so usually if you're because this is not an uncommon tactic that companies use to shut this
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:30.880]   sort of thing down so established unions help people who want to build unions do this the right way so
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:37.760]   they don't run a vowel of their companies so i but i don't know if i don't know which union is working
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:44.160]   with google or or with the people trying to establish unions at google no one denies that google hired
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:52.080]   a law firm that is famous for union busting that's from the new york times uh the way i have no
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:59.440]   yeah they ever have no yeah it's not illegal no one's ever tried to unit unionized
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:04.640]   to it i don't but i have to say i wouldn't i mean i'm an after i i wouldn't
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:11.360]   prevent anybody from unionizing and want to be unionized but uh i mean that that's not
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:20.880]   that's not okay um it seems to be that these four are more concerned about Andy Rubens pay off about
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:30.720]   google's work with cvp about uh putting somebody on the ai ethics council from the anti lgbt
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:36.400]   q and anti-immigrant think tank about developing drone technology for the department of defense
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:42.720]   all of this this litany of complaints is in the medium post um secret project work with the
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:47.440]   chinese government on a search engine that seems to be their chief concern i don't even know if
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:52.240]   they're trying to unionize i don't i i don't know exactly what you know you're seeing
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:57.600]   nlrk when we protect them for this then well that's actually they call it organizing no actually
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:01.840]   wait a minute we participated in legally protected labor organizing fighting to improve workplace
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:07.040]   conditions for all google workers but we also joined together to hold google accountable for
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:11.600]   the impact on our workplace of its businesses decisions policies and practices so they've
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:16.400]   muddied the waters by combining those two efforts yeah well the labor stuff is the only stuff
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:21.040]   they're protected that's right yeah you know honestly this is the problem with hiring smart
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:27.040]   people and it's why i only hire stupid people you want oh they're gonna hit me now excuse me now
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:33.280]   they're gonna organize so really the problem is for google that you've got phd's you've got
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:39.840]   engineers you've got bloody-minded independent individualists right and if they're if they're
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:45.360]   trying to do one of the issues was contractors right so it could be that in trying to reach out to
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:51.280]   contractors uh because they're not protected then they would be using company resources to
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:55.520]   reach out to people because you couldn't find them otherwise necessarily you can only reach them to
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:57:00.640]   google channels right so actually actually in their favor i have avoided this story for a couple
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:05.680]   weeks has been brewing uh and jeff i avoid it for the exact reason you say we just don't know
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:10.880]   we just don't know we just don't know and um but it's interesting that you know in media now
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:16.080]   there's been a rash of unionizations mainly because companies are cutting back and and times are tough
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:19.680]   i don't know how much of a difference is going to make because there's only so much money in the bank
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:24.560]   in a lot of these places uh but it's happening all over the other thing i was at uh an event
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:30.960]   um two weeks ago uh where there it's an unconference and there was a session on on the
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:40.080]   generations so it was it was boomers versus uh millennials versus uh gen z and it was two
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:45.760]   millennials and a gen z were up running the session and i'm of course a boomer sitting there uh uh
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:50.640]   holding up the elementary canal not quitting my job so that you know i can't move anywhere and
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:57.360]   uh there was anger uh one of the people there said uh people liked me yeah one of the people
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:02.080]   there up front said uh well one of the people in the room fell a boomer said well i got this great
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:08.000]   job big place when i was 26 i think i angry and i said i mean it was all friendly but it was
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:13.440]   it was frustration and i said i was assistant city under the shiara tributor 21 and he threw the chair
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:19.440]   still looks good for humor i turned to the guy next to me who was a well-known guy and he said yeah
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:23.920]   i ran the top news show in new york when i was 26 and they said how are we not going to these jobs
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:28.080]   how is this not happening what how are you doing and we were going well we were in a growing industry
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:32.800]   right people moved around and there were openings and we took them and that's what happened and now
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:39.440]   um no we're sitting in the elementary canal man because i'm not going to leave my job and maybe
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:46.080]   i should i'm 65 um uh my sister by the way is five years old she just retired i'm feeling pretty
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:53.040]   jealous by the way i'm not you're feeling Leo old man i would love to retire you can yeah
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:59.040]   uh not yet not oh not for a long time but one of the reasons we got anne mica here is so that we
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:05.200]   have some but some people that do the shows and continue what i think we started uh and i want to
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:10.720]   make sure it continues so i think that's part of what even at google i think there's a generational
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:17.920]   issue happening right about the general the relationship to companies and other generations and kind of
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:28.080]   an anger bubbling up there so i don't i don't want to sound hypocritical but i applaud the employees
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:33.680]   for wanting to try to make a difference at their workplace but at the same time you have processes
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:38.320]   and procedures to try to go through and make sure all of that you know is on the up and up and not
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:45.360]   just some uh riots if you will against your employer you know it's go ahead and try to make a different
[00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:50.640]   set your workplaces it's that's good that's good from around but at the same time don't try to
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:56.480]   destroy the company that's feeding your family either i don't think they're necessarily trying
[00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:01.920]   to destroy it i do think they're bringing issues to the fore that are important and there's only
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:07.840]   well there's some famous phrase or quote about polite women never get anywhere you know sometimes
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:14.480]   you have to maybe not destroy but maybe you do have to be a little bit more yeah thank you i knew
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:23.040]   you would know um so i would say you're accusing me of of i was bothering cliche's Stacy no no i
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:28.720]   just i you're your professor come on that's that's your job to quote pithy places
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:40.240]   to the youngs of the world but yes um so i don't know i i see this in my daughter and i think there
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:47.200]   is very much a generational anger frustration and i think it's well founded in a lot of ways
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:52.720]   there is there is a lot that is not going to happen and there's a lot of despair over
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:01:00.480]   where she's going to end up and i think a lot of people who are young they realize they have to
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:06.000]   start their own thing and do their own thing if they want to get anywhere faster and i will say
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   you know i went into journalism i graduated college in two thousand so i went in knowing that i
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:18.240]   was entering just as the web was becoming a thing and i will say you weren't going to be a print
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:23.280]   journalist or were you i was i was a magazine journalism major i interned at business week i
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:27.440]   wrote for the wall street journal i mean but you also must have known that the web was coming
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:33.840]   through i knew it but at the same time i did i didn't accept a job at business week online when i
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:38.320]   came out of college because i wanted to work for a print publication and this was the year 2000
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:47.360]   and i ended up working for a print trade rather than business week online but the point is i thought
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:53.520]   by the time i was 41 which is how old i am now i would have this cushy kind of features writer
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:59.600]   at a magazine i would have earned it i would have worked my budget yeah but then it's not there
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:07.440]   when i got to fortune four years ago thinking oh i made my cush magazine job i was still writing
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:11.760]   three or four posts a day editing all my colleagues stuff and getting
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:18.960]   shot upon by the magazine staff for not being magazine enough and it was it was very much and
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:23.680]   eye-opening experience because there were there were literally two classes of employees
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:32.880]   and so i mean i wasn't angry i just quit but those are i i get where they're coming from it is
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:37.600]   frustrating especially because a lot of the people who are standing in your way don't get what's
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:43.680]   how people consume media nowadays they're very stuck on their old world views
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:52.080]   okay that's it i battle with a little bit of both of those sides um i look at my children and
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:57.040]   i look at my my oldest boy in particular the one that's in the army that i've mentioned before and
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:02.080]   just trying to get through to him that it takes work it takes work it takes work you're not just
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:06.960]   going to have things handed to you i don't care if you're just washing dishes at your local
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:12.400]   restaurant if you want to move up to the fry cook you need to work for it you need to earn that and
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:20.480]   i struggled with him and his generation just sort of expecting that hey i i i'd deserve this stuff
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:25.440]   even though i haven't worked for anything you need to give me this job or that job or what have you
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:30.480]   and then at the same time i get it from their perspective where they see someone like me that's
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:38.880]   old ish i'm not old um that has this particular world view that it's sort of out of date if you will
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:44.960]   you're just grown up aunt he's a grown up i started twit because i didn't want to work for
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:50.720]   the man anymore i started late in life i was i think in my fifties when i started maybe late
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:58.960]   forties but i also had been rejected by mainstream media so they were stuck in a rubber suit yes
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:04.560]   having been stuck in a rubber suit no actually that uh that i that was a triumph Jeff what are you
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:13.440]   talking about triumph at rubber suit anyway yeah i mean we i don't know we can't we can't really
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:19.440]   come where we gonna talk about reinvent yeah you know let's do this i'm gonna do the change log in
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:24.080]   and add and then we'll do reinvent we'll give you a whole segment how about that stacey hagan
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:27.920]   i don't need a segment i just wanted to be sure if you promised people reinvent that i would
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:33.440]   be ready for it oh get ready get ready but first it's the google change log
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:41.760]   one beat two beats three beats four beats five beats six beats he's going to change log
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:50.480]   he's paying me back for read the rughead i'm getting my i'm getting my payment um the
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:56.160]   google photos has a couple of new features you might be interested in uh manual face tagging
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:05.360]   uh but with a caveat this is from android police google's giving users way more control over faces
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:12.000]   tagged in their photos i see feel like we've always had control i see the faces i name them or not
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:20.480]   yeah uh you can't select the face in a photo manually so you still will have to wait till google sees a face
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:26.800]   and then you can tag it but you can tag it in the photo so that's a bit of a different
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:32.080]   functionality before you had to just go to people and you'd see a whole bunch of faces and then you'd
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:38.080]   say oh i know who that one is uh you can also and this is perhaps more important manually remove face
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:47.520]   tagging from a picture so maybe maybe you don't want to tag rafael nadal or maybe jeff does but
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:53.440]   maybe or maybe you don't want to tag somebody you know but you don't want to violate their privacy
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:59.920]   when you share those photos so that's just a change in how google's going to do face recognition
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:05.360]   in google photos they also are adding and i don't understand this maybe you guys have used it chat
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:13.600]   uh in-app sharing conversations this is what i wanted to know about yeah i haven't i don't
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:20.720]   i'm just this is finally gonna be the one that was the messaging this is this is the messaging app
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:28.880]   for me i'm so excited about this so plus plus plus times plus basically it looks more to me like a
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:36.640]   replacement for instagram or kind of a person-to-person instagram uh combining your photos with i get it
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:44.880]   okay users will be able to share any number of images or videos up to up to 20,000 per conversation
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:51.680]   i'd like to see somebody try to go do 20,000 in one challenge uh you'll be able to create and
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:58.400]   add people to new groups so you can create a group um they'll be a dedicated thread people's comments
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:05.680]   will appear as if they're chat comments in that thread uh it's not exactly a messaging client so
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:09.440]   it isn't really i don't think we can call it a new message sounds like what's up
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:16.080]   yeah it has yes right maybe that's it i like it's more private right because it's there's not
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:20.000]   public there's no public sharing you just share it with a group although people like mike yelgin will
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.120]   probably make that group make it public right you're probably gonna get public somehow yeah i use
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:30.560]   google photo sharing all the time and it's a pain in the butt right because it's you have to make you
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:36.480]   have to share you can share your albums works really well but yeah sharing a photo it creates
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:41.280]   an album with that just that photo yes and now when you do that like i shared at least all the
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:45.600]   time she hates it she says would you just email me the damn picture and i think that's why so now
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:52.160]   it'll be more like a message a conversation a thread um let me see if i have it uh yet i yeah
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:57.360]   never really cared for the sharing feature built inside of photos because of the the way it organizes
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:04.320]   your app i'm seeing create a new share maybe i do have it so there's a new tab it's very slow
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:13.920]   create a new share add a title um tweak test sharing sharing is carrying is it going to do an album
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:22.000]   creating auto no you can do that oh that's the auto updating album so then i would add Lisa's
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.880]   picture and automatically all the anytime i get a picture with her she'd get that i like that feature
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:32.960]   or i can select a photo select select our christmas card okay good which is beautiful
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:39.840]   beautiful christmas card where is it sharing is carrying yeah that's a good name for it okay
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:47.200]   done where is it yeah this looks intuitive oh there it is okay showing is carrying and now what
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:54.080]   wow it's a large it's a large picture you know why there's 26 freaking people in it
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:09:04.640]   half of them want to unionize now i can share it with Lisa and say hey there cutie
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:13.440]   who's laparzat you're sitting in what be your name she's gonna yeah what be your name
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:23.840]   may i may i quote you what be your what be your name okay new phone who this all right so now the
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:28.640]   problem is lisa's gonna say why are you sharing the christmas picture with me i don't know if this
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:35.520]   shared an album or the or like they're now we'll have a chat group doesn't feel like that but anyway
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:42.240]   that's so that's what'll change won't be an album anymore it'll be a thread i like that let's see
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:48.720]   how old so yeah and this is a minor one but if you speak so this hasn't been rolled out yet
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:55.040]   because i'm rolling out for me it's rolling out it's in the process of yeah i don't have it some
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:58.880]   people will have it i don't know if i have it i don't know what that experience was it seems like
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:05.920]   i just try to share something well it seems like i have something new there i just shared something
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:15.360]   with you in google photos okay uh i don't know what to do now i'm i'm actually done with this story

[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:08.160]   some a technology that can make your business better a lot of people use i mean nowadays every
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:13.280]   business runs on software but the problem is a lot of businesses are running on old slow out of
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:22.720]   date buggy software because you know the the boss's cousin's aunt's nephew's friend wrote it while he
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:28.240]   was in college he graduated he's disappeared that was 30 years ago you're still using the software
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:35.760]   the whole business runs on it it requires windows 95 and internet explorer one but hey it's all you
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:43.680]   got but is it is it really i suggest to visit to capterra ca p t e double r a dot com slash twig
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:50.480]   capterra is the leading free online resource to help you find the best software solution for your
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:56.960]   business turns out there is modern software for every business and capterra is the ultimate
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:02.320]   directory with 700 categories everything from digital workplace software to video management
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:08.160]   software to the kind of basic line of business software for things like dog groomers and yoga
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:15.200]   studios and so whatever business you're in capterra has usually like dozens often you know many many
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:21.600]   different apps you're gonna do mind mapping software sure okay so you find a ton of them right but
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:27.920]   you got to narrow it down they've got filters that are tuned to the category so you know you can
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:32.400]   say on premises you could say in the cloud you could say how many seats does it make appointments
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:36.960]   of its dog grooming software what's the breed narrow it down of course you probably want to
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:41.840]   narrow it down also by the number of stars and then you can even make a comparison chart
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:47.920]   four by four side by side and and see it just like in the magazines head to head but here's the
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:54.880]   thing that's so cool that no magazine has one million plus reviews of the products from actual
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:18:00.240]   users capterra does such a great job to vet these reviews so they all come from people who use
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:06.400]   that software and they'll give you everything you need to make an informed decision and by the way
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:11.920]   capterra is free there's no charge never will be for this but if you want to you know say thank

[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:54.400]   selection simplified we when is your flight it's it uh okay we got to get you out of here in about
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:59.120]   45 minutes stacy so we'll we'll i'm aware of that we're going to keep an eye on the clock
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:05.120]   stacy's at the seattle airport if i were there i'd be having a red wine in the hand you know it's
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:09.120]   nice taking you would you mind filling this for me i'm stuck on a podcast we don't know what's there
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:15.360]   i think it's a geeze and crackers too you could go to the bar take us with you yes
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:22.160]   no i'm not i'm not that person oh are you i was like i will show you the lounge because it's beautiful
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:27.440]   oh nice this is the middle area oh it is nice oh here's the espresso bar
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:35.040]   oh wow over that area is where the uh the fire pit and everything are do you have to fly first class
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:41.280]   to get in there how do you get in there i have a lounge pass oh smart person i spend i spend a lot
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:48.000]   of time at the airport yeah it's worth it you are using what do you what is it lounge buddy what's
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.400]   the company that does that oh no i i just have an alaskan because i'm when i'm here last i got it
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:59.760]   i've got alaska lounge and american so nice so if you're i'm traveling that's where you'll find me
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:06.000]   re what was it called reinvent invent invent and they do this every year i remember last year that's
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:11.600]   when they announced that deep racer which was to help programmers learn they had an announcement
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:16.400]   about that this year how reinforcement learning works yeah i have one but i've never used it what
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:22.160]   what was their announcement they're gonna add lydar on top so should you choose to update your
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:28.560]   deep racer you can get lydar coming soon um yeah so i mean i don't know if you guys care so much
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:33.520]   about this but i can put the aws announcements in context with what google does if that would help
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:42.320]   that would be great we care we care deeply but deeply deeply okay so the big the big announcements
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:48.080]   so at this show you usually look for andy jacie's keynote uh he's the guy in charge of aws and then
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:53.200]   on thursday morning so tomorrow morning you'll look for vernar's keynote um andy jacie spent a
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:21:02.160]   lot of time talking about uh sage maker which is amazon's ai focus ai tools uh the coolest tool
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:06.640]   they actually announced something called autopilot and what that does is it takes all the data you
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:12.640]   have in your amazon s3 storage thing and is like no no no no no and then it says i will build models
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:17.040]   based on this which is really hard for people to do so that was a really cool service they can't
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:24.080]   build models on my three storage is totally just garbage oh pile full stuff but theoretically you'd
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:28.720]   open you'd upload data sets that had some value right data sets and they would get that out okay
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:34.880]   so amazon spent a lot of time focused on machine learning probably because google's getting a lot
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:41.360]   of attention for that where amazon is a little bit different is it's announcing higher level tools
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:45.760]   and they made it clearer i think they said 85 percent of google's tensorflow projects are
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:53.040]   actually running on aws so instead of doing their own you know processor for data although they do
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:22:02.240]   have an inference chip um and kind of focusing on an arm chip also a new arm okay that's next up
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:08.800]   okay because i love arm okay so their whole strategy here with data is to go higher level so a
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:13.600]   platform is a service kind of level from google and make it less abstract sorry more abstract i
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:20.080]   guess for people why would you use google's like tpu's if you're gonna do uh tensorflow i'm surprised
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:25.600]   to hear that most people are using amazon right well that's where the data is yeah okay so they
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:31.440]   apply tensorflow to the data from amazon yeah so so amazon boosted sage maker which is their
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:36.960]   machine learning tools that's big big announcement number one number two is they announce the graviton
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:43.600]   two processors which are really a better faster arm based processor that should be cheaper that a
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:50.160]   lot of people can use and that that was that was this compete with tpu what is the point of this
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:56.320]   no the graviton so these are for basic compute loads okay so not so basically it's just it's arm
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:23:02.880]   servers and you can cluster up to sixty yeah yeah cluster up to sixty four of them their low power
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:08.080]   will that mean they're less expensive for us or just for amazon amazon hasn't given pricing they
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:12.960]   should be less expensive they'll also be more energy efficient to run and the nice thing about
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:18.560]   the cloud is a lot of your jobs don't require all of your processing power right you're dividing up
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:23.440]   that processing power using hypervisors and you're like i'll do a little load here and a little load
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:29.760]   there and so arm actually works out well for a lot of the cloud workloads so that's the arm graviton
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:37.280]   two announcement the other big announcement is the amazon nitro service and that is what is that
[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:42.800]   that is their whole new class of services that they're offering that it's not quite
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:49.360]   composable infrastructure but it lets you uh allocate the storage and networking capacity you
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:55.760]   need on demand which is getting closer to this like holy grail of being able to compose your own
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:24:01.200]   infrastructure for your application composing means you kind of piece together as much
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:07.520]   infrastructure as you need you piece together your networking your storage and your compute
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:13.600]   as it needs for the app so think about it this way we have achieved this app explosion we used to have
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:18.640]   gp general purpose computing not sorry not graphics processors we used to have general purpose
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:24.960]   computing and that worked for pretty much everything but now when we get these big workloads in the
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:29.520]   cloud you really want to optimize for them because they're big enough that you can be more efficient
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:34.960]   if you optimize for them and so that's what this is allowing you to do is to even further make
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:40.240]   more fine tuned adjustments for optimizing those workloads so that's that and then what else do
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:44.720]   you want to know about i want to know about the broomball tournament at the las vegas festival
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:53.280]   grounds i don't know about that broomball and dodge ball huh i should tell you break it break it
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:59.360]   in amazon lunch that there are quantum computing efforts as well which will compete again with
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:04.640]   i mean close to this is the developer event it is and it's bigger than
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:11.280]   yeah it's both developers but it's like microsoft ignite is only enterprise class developers right
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:15.600]   they have build for their other developers right this is anybody who builds anything on a
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:22.080]   AWS so it's a huge event everybody uses a w we use a w everybody uses a w s it's a it's a you know
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:30.160]   it's a great infrastructure do you also use um google or microsoft the competitors i mean people
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:34.880]   mix and match these things oh yeah it's very common to see multi-homed clouds but unfortunately
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:39.760]   there's complexity involved and sometimes yeah i'll just say let's you usually run one type of
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:46.800]   job or one type of work loader right app kind of thing in a cloud we use it for load balancing
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:51.920]   for our website we use a w s we also there's other things we put a frankly our whole
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:26:01.520]   uh i hope it's not it's okay to say this but our whole workflow chain is is uh after the fires
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:05.760]   you know we we used to do all our work flow here in the studio and when the studio was off for three
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:13.840]   days we went hmm so uh Russell's our uh brilliant it guy has been moving uh giving
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:18.560]   we don't want use it day to day but we have the capability of using a w s if we're shut down
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:24.560]   to uh we obviously can't shoot the shows but we could the production chain can go up in the cloud so
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:29.120]   things like that uh it's really nice for and the nice thing about a w s is you know we could put it
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:35.440]   we can have it up there but it's not on so it costs us nothing until we turn it on it's nice
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:41.040]   contingency it's nice uh what is your contingency you stole the shoot in your home if you have
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:44.640]   yeah we could do that but the problem is exactly that if we were going to shoot in our house
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:52.160]   we would have had to pack up the like all the assets uh a bunch of computers we had put in a car
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:56.560]   and ship it over and set it up and it would be Russell said it's about four hours but with by
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:00.640]   moving it to a w s we're not using it again we're not using it day to day because it's faster to
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:05.280]   use it locally but we will be it we could if we had to and that's you know it's just a redundancy
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:12.800]   thing. Jason Howell wants me to buy him this so last year they announced the robo racer right
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:20.400]   if you programmed to learn uh a certain kind of reinforcement learning this is a gadget from
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:27.840]   called a composer from AI that lets humans in AI write music together they call it deep composer
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:34.720]   like deep racer shall i play here's Jonathan Colton performing at least they got a good geek
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:42.160]   performer there performing on the a w s stage with with the little ai actually instead of playing
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:46.800]   that it probably shouldn't play that you think i'll get in trouble no Colton would never sue us he
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:54.320]   loves us i made Colton it's not him we're worried about yeah he's a human songwriter thank you so
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:28:02.400]   this song is a cautionary tale there's a science fiction short story about collaborating with
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:07.040]   an artificial intelligence i wonder if this is his uh one two yeah he's sung from portal
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:22.160]   or is it code monkey okay well let me let me play that's if you don't know about Jonathan Colton
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:26.640]   go to his website and download his music i think 70 bucks you could download all of it and i did
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:39.680]   that one time so here's some jazz played by the deep composer
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:48.160]   that is the worst that is terrible okay but it's not as terrible as the pop
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:56.320]   here's pop
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:29:02.400]   that's the most nightmarish hold music i've ever heard it feels like a ai right sounds like journey
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:11.600]   you just insulted journey baby and sounds like journey oh man and here's rock Steve Perry's
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:20.880]   just rolling over in his very metric chamber that's rock yeah and the list of everyone's
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:30.480]   value here a really bad note there yeah not good now see oh again this this all comes back to
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:36.320]   who's training the the ai and how much training are they doing with this because i could see this
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:43.360]   potentially working out but this has a long way this is using your favorite technology Stacy
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:50.080]   generative adversarial networks when gans are notorious when they go wrong they go real long
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:55.200]   when i when i first saw it when gans go wrong that's our show title as you know i just want to say
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:30:03.040]   write it then gans go wrong go ahead i'm sorry go ahead when i first saw this it made me think about
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:10.960]   what was that american gods the tv show i love that show and where where the uh was a technology
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:15.840]   boy at least it's not it's not in the book but the technology boy god whatever he meets up with
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:21.600]   the computer guy that makes music yeah and all i could think about was technology boy whispering
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:26.320]   in this guy's ears tell him that music's horrible and fix it and this is what came out
[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:31.920]   these horrible sammises show is awesome which is that the old gods the north gods even jesus the
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:38.160]   current you know the old gods are being replaced by modern gods your technology got he had de-resis
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:44.880]   and re-resis he's kind of creepy and he's smoking a vape and yeah was it frog toad skins or something
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:53.120]   he was smoking something crazy yeah he is so it was interesting and we talked a little bit about this
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:58.640]   on windows weekly earlier because mary jeffoli was also talking about reinvent it was interesting
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:04.800]   that they're doing this arm graviton too the previous the previous generation was also arm but
[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:09.200]   it sounds like arm in the cloud i remember lonice torvald said for a long time
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:13.760]   lenix isn't going to support arm well until cloud services are based on arm not intel because
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:19.840]   there's no you know it's no way to test what we're doing is no okay yeah that's fair so uh this
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:28.480]   this is actually a big deal um and it is i guess it won't be faster per core but you can multiply the
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:35.440]   cars to 64 floors and you really don't need for every for every workload you don't need intel level
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:39.760]   performance especially when you're in the cloud because the cloud is designed to
[01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:48.000]   take that underlying performance and put a put a layer over it so you don't actually care only the
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:54.240]   hypervisor cares and that's why that's actually why everyone was excited about arm in the cloud the
[01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:59.680]   cloud actually gave arm a chance because most companies aren't going to use the entire intel
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:07.360]   workload and price performance per watt becomes so much more important in the cloud so in in these
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:13.600]   these should be cheaper and what's exciting even more exciting is when you have clouds coming in
[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:20.160]   and buying the hardware at that level you've got the chance for real innovation at the core level
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:26.400]   that you don't have like with intel only intel develops x86 right there's there's one other
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:32.240]   company i don't know if they're still around but well there's AMD too sorry and AMD's doing some
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:38.080]   innovation but with arm you're gonna see companies innovate around that core in a way that companies
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:43.440]   can't with x86 and i think that's really exciting mary joe is great for the cloud guys mary joe also
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:51.600]   saw more is taking a shot at azure microsoft's cloud than at google's cloud azure has arm
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:57.280]   processors right they also use fpgas for different things fpga is their tpu basically
[01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:03.440]   uh an fpga is a generic field pro it's a but it's aimed at the same market that google's tpu is
[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:11.280]   aimed at it they are using it for machine learning yes but they also use it for uh search in i think
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:17.920]   some transactional things too there's uh they're partnering with verizon on 5g with a new wavelength
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:25.040]   service cloud computing over 5g that i just talked to them about that yeah mary joe's got at
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:30.240]   tnt is their partner you think verizon's a good choice here yeah and they're gonna add so we'll
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:35.760]   see more that these exclusive deals are just to be all like woo fancy um we're gonna see them at
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:42.880]   atnt over time they also have kddi today or amazon has kddi verizon uh vodafone and
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:49.840]   somebody else i can't recall and this is basically putting amazon's physical hardware inside metro
[01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:56.080]   data centers atnt's partnership with azure is actually at the ran which is at the cell tower
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:34:01.840]   network this is actually in the city wide data centers which is not as far out to the edge as
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:11.440]   you could go right 28 launches at re-invent uh and and by the way now uh amazon's cloud business
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:20.080]   has 175 different services that they got out of 164 last week so this is a big deal they jumped
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:26.880]   code guru uh which interestingly works with microsoft's github is a automated intelligence
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:35.920]   code review service wow um i mean they're just a ton of stuff so uh amazon really feels like they're
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:46.320]   on the march when when in the process of amazon did they discover a ws and how big it could be
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:52.720]   they launched a ws in 2005 they launched s3 that was their first service which is really simple
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:59.920]   storage um they proposed it so i actually know the guys who proposed it i think it was in oh four
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:05.520]   but think about amazon from day one and i didn't mean that as a that's their thing
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:11.600]   their services business and so when they decided to build a cloud service that was a i think they
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:19.840]   recognized the trend because back in 2005 when they were doing this the big trend was hp and
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:24.640]   i bm talking about grid computing and autonomic computing that's what they called it it was
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:30.080]   they called it instantly provisioned computing so that was already a trend that was happening
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:35.520]   but it still took like a week to get that computing provision so when a ws came up and said you know
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:40.800]   what we're gonna spin this up right away because how much of this do you really want to know
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:46.080]   because i could go on about this forever there's a great a great story about it in the everything
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:53.520]   store the store the book about amazon andy jase who's the ceo says it started at an executive retreat
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:36:00.880]   in 2003 at bayzos house they were doing an exercise identifying the company's core competencies
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:06.160]   and as they went through them they realized you know what we're actually pretty good at
[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:13.920]   infrastructure services we're we understand compute and storage and database what's more he says
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:18.160]   they'd become highly skilled at running reliable scalable cost-effective data centers because
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:23.440]   that's what they had to do for themselves it was at that point jase says without even fully
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:27.360]   articulating it they started to formulate the idea of what a ws could be and they wondered
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:32.240]   is there is there a business here providing the infrastructure we had to make for ourselves
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:36.800]   like a happy accident to other people in retrospect was uh verner foghls
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:44.640]   core to this i don't know um he's definitely he he became close to it if not immediately
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:50.720]   i mean i remember talking to verner about it like 2006 and he was pretty tight tight up on it
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:37:00.000]   they didn't have exactly an aha moment according to jase but they started to think about it as an
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:06.080]   operating system of sorts for the internet so it took them three years from that moment at the
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:09.360]   which is nothing really yeah to roll it out yeah because it's huge
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:17.440]   they i know that the guys who jesse and i'm trying to think of um ben and i feel like it was chris
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:21.920]   did the original memo because you know how you have to pitch a product at amazon with one memo
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:29.600]   and i've seen that but but yeah so and it's not true they actually didn't run amazon stuff on
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:35.680]   aws for a long time they launched aws it wasn't the same thing that was the amazon's back in
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:40.640]   right for a while so that's a common misconception yeah i mean here's a picture in computer world of
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:47.680]   in 2002 quote amazon web service launching but it really was a service that they offered companies
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:53.840]   so that they could incorporate amazon.com on their own site so it that wasn't real it was just embedding
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:38:02.400]   amazon on their sites it wasn't till 2006 that as you say s3 and ec2 came out so that's what a
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:09.040]   success story huh it reminds me a little bit i always think about a compu serve which was at
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:14.880]   on the very early online service created by h&r block when one of their people observed in our
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:22.160]   computers are real busy during the day in round april and it gets pretty slow the right in the
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:26.880]   rest of the time we probably could times that was what time sure timeshare like timeshare that
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:30.720]   and that they still needed maximum capacity at a certain point of the year so they couldn't it
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:35.440]   wasn't like they really had spirit capacity yeah i wonder how they handled that like april 15th
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:40.400]   the copieserv get really slow i don't remember i was a big copy serve user in those days and i
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:48.160]   really remember that um you think one four three five one one three four seven uh ones oh i used
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:53.840]   to remember at seven one three five five one five six comma five one five six never used
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:58.320]   two young never used only jeff and i are old enough to remember compu serve and genie
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:07.200]   did you use genie and uh no genie was for wassus i was did you use mci mail remember in there
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:13.120]   it is a email you couldn't email everybody just other people on mci wow the first internet ad i
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:20.960]   sold the first internet ad advanced publications to mci wow whatever has mci exist even i just remember
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:27.920]   mci being bervinsurf was i believe it was for us was the mci i went in there oh yeah before mci.com
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:32.320]   Verizon so here's how facebook decided to handle thanksgiving
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:43.920]   a chat bot to called lem bot that name's already taken it's a bot that dissects uh apple iPhones
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:50.320]   for recycling but okay so to teach employees what to say a friends or family ask difficult
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:58.800]   questions about the company over the holidays and so there's there's all these canned answers oh boy
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:06.560]   so for instance if a relative says well how does facebook handle hate speech the chitleum would say
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:10.400]   facebook consults with experts on the matter it's hired more moderators to police its content
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:15.040]   it's working on ai despite hate speech regulation is important for addressing the issue
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:21.840]   do they have like contacts in their eyes right just sort of all this information
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:28.480]   memorize this have you been uh it's all coming in the in the in the chip in your head
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:36.000]   yeah uncle of the leo yeah says it just it just uh what what oh yes so uh have you been watching the
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:41.520]   new silicon valley uh jeff almost starts it all is back on the right back no i haven't i haven't
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:47.120]   watched the last one first three episodes are really funny especially the guy with
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:51.600]   you've if you've seen these products it's a chair you strapped to your hinds oh yeah you could
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:56.560]   sit down we handle the show yeah we handle the show oh the exoskeleton thing yeah yeah it's just a
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:41:02.080]   chair and it there's a there's a character that's hysterical yeah but then it kind of starts to
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:08.000]   lose its way a little bit and then it gets better again with russ fest see that's why i haven't
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:14.960]   watched that one yeah um it's it's a teaser for me it's a mixed bag kara swisher has a massive role
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:18.560]   in one of the episodes you see the kara swisher episode that was right before the russ fact she
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:23.360]   can act it turns out yeah i still like you don't think it's an animal you're full of stuff
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:31.440]   they yeah i think that uh i'm trying to remember somebody's on the i guess of the ceo of uh
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:34.480]   pied piper's on the story oh what's the name was her name it's who oh no no no no no no no no
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:39.920]   wojiski was a wojiski she was mentioned they couldn't apparently get susan right so kara goes
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:44.080]   well thank you susan wojiski that was a great presentation and now and they bring on the woman
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:50.240]   who's the investor in pied piper that's right right um good going kara speaking of tv did you see i
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:56.480]   put it on the um on the run down the the kerfuffle over the peloton dystopian commercial
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:42:03.040]   yeah um i didn't bother clicking on it that's been in my twitter feed you know for i want to
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:08.960]   look at that picture it's just opion uh i'm a peloton user so you know and i saw the commercial
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:17.680]   it's a little sexist are we yeah it's a bit sexist yes because she uh is um a mother and a wife who
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:24.000]   apparently was gifted a peloton okay and shoot selfie videos no i'm not even given given gift is not
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:29.920]   a verb dammit gifted you can't say gift no i hate that it's hard to be people say it all the time
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:37.360]   there's what oh gift presenter gifted means you actually are smarter than the average bear i
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:45.520]   should have said given thank you given yes sorry my pedant okay but you were saying she was given
[01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:51.360]   a peloton i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm presented presented with a peloton was it by her husband i don't remember
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:57.120]   as a gift and she shoots video of her getting leaner meaner and sexier and how much she loves
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:03.680]   her peloton i mean i don't that's kind of what ads are ads are by nature that way oh you're in the
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:10.400]   cold aren't you what's the difference between that and the people in the gym doing videos showing
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:16.880]   themselves right yeah and i should point out as dr morpies says at the beginning she's already thin
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:24.880]   and fit at the beginning so she didn't really need but she looks sad and frightened is is that
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:30.160]   that's a that frame grab i don't even you know i mean it you know it doesn't look at that that's
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:36.800]   just a frame to grab i don't know dystopian is that black mirror episode where they had to be on
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:42.880]   the bikes to power the whatever and hope to show up here yeah she's just i'm not gonna play the
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:49.520]   audio that's how she looks she's got her eyes are knitted um and i don't know it's not a terrible ad
[01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:55.920]   uh i don't know where people upset because the husband gave her a gift or she just looks at
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:44:00.320]   the husband said you you know you could use a little weight honey was the implication uh she's
[01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:06.720]   that's not well that's that's a dumb husband right there that is what that is my husband
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:10.000]   i had to ask for my Fitbit and writing twice before i got one
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:16.000]   he wanted your body plausible than i have a little for many accusations exactly
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:25.040]   all right first we lose grumpy cat then we lose keyboard cat twice i'm sad to say little
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:32.720]   bub has passed away he's fully asleep at the age of eight uh she was cheerful and full of love
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:38.640]   writes her owner mike bradavsky lying on our bed with us late saturday night but unexpectedly
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:47.680]   passed away peacefully in her sleep uh little bub is gone we still we still don't have baby yoda
[01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:53.600]   maybe if they'd given her a peloton yeah baby yoda we still have baby yoda though baby yoda i
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:45:03.120]   little bit next thing a cat peloton yeah oh it's on and uh uh stacey you're gonna have to explain
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:08.800]   this to me because i'm too dumb to know what this means t-mobile has launched it's 5g but it's not
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:16.320]   millimeter way stacey to explain this thank you yes it's 600 megahertz 5g um we won't be able to
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:22.800]   use it for a couple more days and what's weird is i have a phone that has a five a 600 megahertz
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:28.560]   antenna the iphone 11 but apparently you have to have a sam sangh five g or one plus
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:35.040]   a five g to use it so four people can use is that because the that's because of the maimo the
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:40.560]   massive multi-maimo so you have to have the right software and the right antenna structure to get
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:47.440]   the massive capacity um so this spectrum is going to be a little bit different do you want to know or
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:54.160]   not how nerdy should i be y'all get nerdy please nerdy with it okay so the set center
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:46:00.320]   megahertz spectrum is the like we've got i think Verizon and AT&T are using 700 megahertz to deliver
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:10.800]   LTE so with 5g the 3gpp standard so the cellular standard the way it gets max capacity so like
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:18.000]   that super gigabit capacity is because you've got large chunks of spectrum like hundred megahertz
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:22.880]   wide chunks of spectrum and you just flood all of that and that's where your capacity is coming
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:30.560]   from so when you're on the 34 gigahertz spectrum that's divided into these hundred megahertz blocks
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:37.360]   down at the 600 megahertz 700 megahertz those spectrum blocks are usually 10 or 20 megahertz
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:44.320]   wide so you have fewer lanes of traffic to deliver capacity and so you may not see your gigabit
[01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:52.480]   speeds so that's why the spectrum now what T-Mobile's doing is what you're going to see AT&T do
[01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:59.600]   later when they start and there's a reason for it it's because that lower spectrum the 600 megahertz
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:04.560]   that goes through walls really well whereas the upper level spectrum doesn't so you can be in
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:11.200]   the open air and get super super fast capacity or you can be like have the coverage so there's the
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:17.920]   capacity versus coverage trade-off that's happening did that make sense it does okay awesome but
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:24.960]   so is this going to be faster um i don't know if it'll be a fact i mean it should it could be faster
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:31.040]   than LTE it really depends on how they yeah T-Mobile's warning people it could be but it might not be
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:37.200]   it probably won't be i mean the issue is if you've only got 20 megahertz of spectrum you're never
[01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:42.240]   going to be able to deliver the super capacity of anyone else's on the network right so if you're
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:46.080]   the only person on that network sure yeah you're probably going to get it faster but you're probably
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:52.000]   not to get the giga break giga giga bit the benefit of 600 megahertz because it's a
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:58.960]   longer bandwidth it travels better it's it's way like yeah wavelength i'm sorry it travels better so
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:04.560]   it gets through walls it it works a bit millimeter wave does not because it's in the gigahertz spectrum
[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:11.360]   and so that's going to just really bounce off of anything i think i said paper so 600 megahertz i
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:15.920]   guess i would imagine in the final deploy you'll see both you're going to see both in the final
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:21.440]   deployment but for now in the lower megahertz again is coverage so you can have your capacity
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:27.040]   you'll have your coverage everywhere inside outside whatever and then the faster the the fatter
[01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:36.000]   wavelength will be uh speed capacity but if it's not faster then what's the point better it so so
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:41.360]   is it lower latency is there some of it so there's okay so 5g does have lower latency there's also
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:46.480]   cost savings to the carrier like you can still cram more bits and ahertz right i'm glad it's
[01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:53.840]   cheaper for t-mobile but what are we here well right so well that's that's good because i mean
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:56.880]   oh yeah they'll lower the prices well no you still
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:06.880]   with 5g you're going to see a boost in like so all of your cellular data plans there's something
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:13.760]   called shannon's law which says you can only cram so many bits per hertz right so this 5g is more
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:20.480]   efficient than lte so that's slightly more so it'll be better i mean that's better technically
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:26.160]   for the carriers but that's also good for you and then the latency is millisecond level latency
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:33.920]   as opposed like single digit millisecond level latency's in tests so should i buy a 5g phone today
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:41.120]   i want my McLaren edition i would wait another year 2020 feels like a good year to buy a 5g phone
[01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:47.600]   and we are going to see some battery compromises i imagine there's it's very complex because everything
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:53.840]   is going to be software defined both on your handset and at the carrier level so this is this
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:57.920]   is going to be a really rough transition i think this isn't something where t-mobile is
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:04.160]   moving all of its customers there this is just no an additional option for people that have the
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:09.440]   type of hardware to be able to pick up that signal yeah and i imagine you'll be kind of like a
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:14.640]   little early beta tester too because you know they don't want to put you don't want everybody on
[01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:19.680]   an iPhone remember when the iPhone came out and AT&T's 3g network was just slammed right no one
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:24.240]   wants to go through that again so t-mogel's gonna do this for like the eight people who have the
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:31.440]   compatible phone see what happens and it's a smart move okay they're the they're really the first to
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:36.880]   roll it out nationwide they've been small installations for Verizon and AT&T all over the country but
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:44.800]   this is an AT&T you i was also misrepresented its 4g as 5g but this is really isn't this the first
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:52.640]   nationwide deployment of of any 5g technology yeah well especially yes and the reason why is
[01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:57.280]   because they're using their 600 megahertz spectrum i can't remember did they i can't remember what
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:51:03.440]   they cleared if that was their 2g or whatever but they cleared some spectrum for this yeah and i
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:09.360]   you know i remember john ledger the outbound ceo uh saying oh good news you know you the iPhone
[01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:15.040]   11 to 600 megahertz but apparently he doesn't have the right antenna so not yet doesn't really matter
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:19.600]   uh boy there's a lot more to talk about i kind of thought it'd be fun but we don't have time we're
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:27.440]   gonna take a break but uh i love i can just leave don't leave stay where you are we want to get stacy's
[01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:34.080]   pick but we will talk about other things we know and save some stories for next time this is true

[01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:35.760]   No I think I'm I'm sorry I think Karsten picked something for me I was going to do something
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:41.760]   different but now I'm really thinking of articles. Stacy we should mention is on her way down here
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:46.720]   to our studios because tomorrow we're going to do our holiday special with Stacy. We're going to
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:53.600]   have Mary Jo Foley who was here earlier today and Laurie. You wore a tie I never crossed I like
[01:54:53.600 --> 01:55:01.920]   to impress dress for the job you want she's. She wants to host with Mary Jo Foley. I do she
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:08.080]   dressed pretty nice too I think there's something to do on you so Karsten set you a very good
[01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:13.840]   article all about your favorite beverage. Yes and I will say I just had this is not my pick of the
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:21.440]   week but I just had a wonderful. Could be a few hours in Victoria it was the Tofino old growth
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:29.040]   cedar chin and it was delicious it tasted like the rainforest no it was good my pick of the week
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:34.960]   is actually not a smart product I if you were following my Twitter this week and I received mine
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:39.280]   and I didn't pack it because it's freaking heavy but this is the Illuminati.
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:52.480]   Help me Illuminati you're my only door. It's an indoor door knob so you know and it has a motion
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:59.200]   sensor on it and a light in it when you get close to it it casts this very beautiful light pattern
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:04.720]   and this has no functionality my my editor when I was writing about it last week was like what does
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:13.280]   it do I'm like it's just pretty just pretty it's unlike so that's it's a fun thing it glows it you
[01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:17.680]   know can light up a room a little bit if you want it to like so you can find the light at the door
[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:22.320]   or something or the bathroom it's not as useful if the room fills a smoke and you need to get out
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:29.040]   quick now I got to say the only thing I like about this is so high tech but the anob is the
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:35.520]   worst possible design for a door knob because if your hands are wet or slippery you can't
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:42.000]   grasp it I like a lever I like a lever door knob do they make a lever they don't because the
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:51.600]   door knob is how this how this casts do they can they gift me with a lever oh I want a lever man
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:57:00.320]   you said this is a very really Jeff's a lever it's a lever it's a lever oh lord anyway so this is
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:05.520]   the product is $50 it's gonna be for a limited time it's just kind of a experiment they're doing
[01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:11.840]   and I thought it was fun and I bought it my cat can first pronunciation is lever second is lever
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:14.480]   well I'm number one then
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:23.040]   how do you pronounce a lumenabe that's it all right
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:32.720]   you're so clever to leave her all right actually leave her brothers right and and
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:39.840]   the shearson Lehman no that's not really um we're gonna have some special locally brewed gin just
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:47.920]   for you tomorrow our local our local gentry and I've hired a attractive young man to make the
[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:56.480]   cocktails not me that that makes me really uncomfortable but no he's attracted to me that's all I'm saying
[01:57:56.480 --> 01:58:02.000]   so you see so did you pack your boxing glove is he fully clothed yes he's not what that we're
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:09.120]   an assless chaps or nothing he's a bartender okay I'm now that I think of it
[01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:15.280]   uh no because we what we wanted to do is because each of you have a different beverage that you like
[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:23.200]   you're a gin drinker uh I believe Lori Gill is a brown liquor she likes her whiskeys and uh
[01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:28.080]   Mary Joker's drinks beer we've got a great brewery over here so we figured we're gonna have a bartender
[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:33.360]   he'll be he'll be mixing them up and we're also going to serve Paul Therat's invention
[01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:39.520]   um the patch two's the actually his wife's invention Stephanie's invention which is a

[02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:59.200]   none of these what is your pick of the week add today pervert um klemson life klemson life uh i was
[02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:06.480]   thinking about this here recently um i'm not in life klemson life yeah because
[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:13.280]   for me i was i was having a discussion with the kids about college and i've gotten to the point
[02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:20.160]   now it's time i can't really push college on them anymore why not i was no guarantee of the
[02:02:20.160 --> 02:02:26.240]   yeah it just doesn't seems like it's it's a feasible thing depending on what you want to do
[02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:32.640]   you know but when thinking about this uh we thought about some friends back home um where they have
[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:37.600]   children that they want them to get the college experience but they have intellectual disabilities
[02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:45.200]   and we told them that klemson life is an is an opportunity and they went and you know checked it
[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:50.000]   out and signed that you learn like what it would be like to be a student at klemson yeah and it is
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:55.440]   they give them a nice educational experience are they on a life skill given your experience is this
[02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:59.200]   is this honest it's legit i don't mention the drinking parties the hazy
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:06.800]   um i'm not gonna go there i'm not gonna go there i just i remember my son went to a c u boulder and
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:12.960]   mm-hmm you know they sold it as a great academic experience yeah i've heard all about boulder oh
[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:17.520]   what a party school that is is klem you wouldn't say klemson's a party school klemson has his issues
[02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:22.640]   i'm not gonna deny that klemson has his issues you know just no sis but when people go to college
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:27.040]   they let their hair down well see and that was my discussion with by the way where your boy
[02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:35.440]   left it there what i'm sorry no that that was part of my discussion with with the boys was i
[02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:40.480]   i would like for them to go to college just for the experience because when i went it helped me
[02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:46.320]   you know further develop skills which is being on my own yes it's a halfway house right and just
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:51.760]   learning what i need to do on my own and need needing to be responsible and not necessarily call on
[02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:58.880]   mom and dad stuff like that it's a very expensive right way house and but at the same time i like the
[02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:04.560]   fact that klemson is offering packages up for intellectual disabled kids and oh that's great
[02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:08.640]   down there and and that's what that's great and that's what klemson life is all about oh that's not
[02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:14.640]   is having those kids and oh i didn't know that yeah so oh differently let's say differently
[02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:19.680]   able differently because one of the things that we see and you know i have some experience with this
[02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:25.040]   with a with a lot a lot of these kids are smart and deserve to go to college but they need different
[02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:29.520]   kinds of scaffolding to help them right through it right different guidance yeah and they have they
[02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:34.880]   have live in assistance oh i gotta find out more about that so they they get a apartment just like
[02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:39.360]   any other college student but again it's all sort of geared it's time to say goodbye to stay
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:45.760]   sitting at home boy i mean is leaving we'll see you in a little bit have a great flight
[02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:48.400]   she's got a tomorrow and a half minutes to pee
[02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:56.640]   and but yeah oh so i didn't realize this is for so as her kids who have some learning challenges
[02:04:56.640 --> 02:05:03.680]   very it's really nice and even um we have a guy named david seville on this part of our football
[02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:09.840]   team and he's part of klemson life but he's one of the most popular people in the organization
[02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:14.320]   because of his energy and because of his experience with klemson life he's been in a
[02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:19.280]   like a great ambassador for the program with with letting people know that hey your kids are going
[02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:25.440]   to be here and they're going to be safe and they're going to learn life skills from beyond high school
[02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:33.360]   and beyond college i love this idea because everybody deserves a collegiate experience you know
[02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:39.040]   like i said i can't push it on my kids far as you know hey you need to go to college to learn
[02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:46.000]   abcd but i do like the fact that you can go into the help broaden your adult skills or more i think
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:50.080]   more schools are doing this now i think this is getting more common which i think is it i argued
[02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:54.480]   in what will google do i argue that you should separate the college into different experiences
[02:05:54.480 --> 02:06:00.960]   and separate the the the growth process of becoming an adult from the educational process and they
[02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:04.240]   don't have to be the same place that's right i didn't go to klemson university i went to
[02:06:04.240 --> 02:06:13.040]   wenget university and my first memory was closing the door and watching my mother my then girlfriend
[02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:18.640]   and my grandmother try about it parking lot that is a tough moment at the very first time
[02:06:18.640 --> 02:06:27.360]   that's the tough moment it got real yeah yeah yeah i'm on my own yeah you know so it's awesome i'd like
[02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:37.200]   to advocate my parents left uh klermont i stopped shaving and grow beard i was 16 years old when i
[02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:41.280]   went to college and my parents dropped me off at the airport at segos because they're good luck
[02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:48.080]   here's your here's your bag here's your ticket i hope it all works out got real man i you know in
[02:06:48.080 --> 02:06:53.520]   hindsight i look at that and go that was an odd thing to do because i remember the difficulty of
[02:06:53.520 --> 02:07:01.120]   dragging my trunk up the steps and i was all alone i come out real real real real real quick
[02:07:01.120 --> 02:07:06.240]   jesus for my daughter we have a caravan of suv's to carry this doctor room when she was in college
[02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:12.000]   it's funny when we so of course when i brought my daughter our first born to college uh her mother
[02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:18.560]   and i and her brother henry we all went we all went out to bard we all got a hotel room we stayed
[02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:23.760]   there for a couple of nights and abby she tried to get me to sign a contract that said after you
[02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:31.920]   drop me off at the dorm you will leave within 15 minutes wow it's a she met it she said okay no
[02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:36.240]   you know mom's trying to make the bed and get her ambition nope that she turned around pushed her
[02:07:36.240 --> 02:07:41.920]   out the door so jennifer and i were reduced to driving around the campus for the next two days
[02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:47.440]   looking for her wondering if she's having a good time she was so happy to get rid of us my mom's
[02:07:47.440 --> 02:07:52.240]   and my grandmother they came in and they you know wiped down the room yeah all of that but
[02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:56.960]   beyond that it was like bye we'll see you do pendulum swings you'll probably
[02:07:56.960 --> 02:07:59.600]   you'll probably move in with the boys for a couple of weeks
[02:07:59.600 --> 02:08:10.480]   uh i want to point out that uh youtube has an interesting tweet today actually was yesterday
[02:08:10.480 --> 02:08:15.280]   i don't know do you remember the rewind last year with the bus the fortnight bus
[02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:20.240]   people thought it was terrible week apparently youtube is acknowledging
[02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:26.640]   so that the the meme that they posted on twitter has a picture of a of a highway sign
[02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:34.800]   2018 rewind straight ahead and then in the off ramp something different for real and then the car
[02:08:34.800 --> 02:08:41.680]   below it youtube this is a meme spring pulling off so apparently they're saying yeah we blew it
[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:46.400]   last year it's going to be enough for something completely different there's there's been a big
[02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:54.080]   reddit movement to not to basically sign a pledge not to watch youtube rewind for the first 24
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:59.920]   hours at least oh was pewdiepie i don't think he was in the rewind last year that's that's a
[02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:06.160]   that's a part of the problem fact here's pewdiepie's uh animated jiff reaction
[02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:10.800]   wait a minute it's not so animated
[02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:20.640]   hmm maybe he's in it this time because that was posted by youtube as well i'm pretty sure i won't
