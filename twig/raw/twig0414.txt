[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   It's time for Twig this week at Google Stacey and Jeffery here. We're gonna talk about all the latest news. A lot of Amazon talk will take a little tour of the new Amazon Spark social network.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   In fact, discover a few surprising Amazon features like the Amazon Treasure Truck. It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   And people you trust.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   This is Twig.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by CashFly, C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   This is Twig this week in Google. Episode 414 recorded Wednesday, July 19, 2017. Never a freshman.

[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google to show we talk about all the cool things happening in the metaverse around us.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Or perhaps we're imaginary creatures and it's the metaverse. It's real. We'll never know.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   But fortunately Jeff Jarvis is here to help us navigate these waters.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Hey Jeff, good to see you for the City University of New York.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Hello, yes. Here I am.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Be careful of the media you love is what your bag says behind you.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   That came from VidCon.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Ah!
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Why would we be critical of the media we love?
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Because that's how you keep loving it.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   I guess considering that you're a reformed comedian.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Hey, that's my marriage.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   [Laughter]
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I have this poster too.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   That's my marriage.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And this is also from VidCon. Go talk to people.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Marty Barry.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Marty Barry.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   That is a great quote and a good poster.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Marty Barry.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   The journalist journalist featured in Spotlight.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And that's what you have to do if you're going to be a reporter.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   He's more of the future in Spotlight.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   He's actually the editor of The Washington Post.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Oh that.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Yeah, so that.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   But what Hollywood says is more important as you know.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   That's Stacy Eganbotham.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   She is the host of the IOT podcast at IOTpodcast.com with Kevin Tofel.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And has a very useful newsletter and blog at Stacy on IOT.com if you're interested in IOT.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And who isn't?
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   And who isn't?
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   It's the next big thing.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I think your husband.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   How can I be?
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Is he critical of IOT?
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   He's OD on IOT.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   He tolerates IOT.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   There's really a lot.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I have the same problem with my spouse.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   There's a limit to how far you can go messing with the household.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Oh yeah.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   So is the problem with your spouse or maybe the problems just with us?
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Because that's.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Yeah, no I don't mean the problem is hers.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I mean there we have a problem.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Yes.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Whether the source of the problem is her or me I would I would say it's almost certainly me.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   But yeah, so it's not that I have a problem with her.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I can't even get my family to do Alexa.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I love it.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Echo.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Echo is awesome.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   And get the family to do it.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   They will not do they laugh at me.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   They look at me.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   They roll their eyes like oh oh oh oh.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I was just demonstrating my new Echo show to some visitors.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   And I called my kitchen and there was somebody in there.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Oh, surprise her a little.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Did you know them?
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Yes, I didn't know them.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   But it surprised her a little Sarah who takes care of us.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   But it was but it was a great demo and then I couldn't turn it off.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   She said oh that's okay I'll entertain.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   So she's quite the singer and dancer.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   So it's perfect.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Oh, excellent.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Speaking of which.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I just want to start here.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Please.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Let's.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   New podcast.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   That's a musical.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   I'm thinking Leo this is your next.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Wait, what is happening?
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   It's musical.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Oh, this is just I know is it a gimla?
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   It's another one of them.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   No, it's public radio people.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Thirty six questions I think.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Or stars Hamilton alum Jonathan Groff who was a wonderful King George III.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I'll be back.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   You'll be back.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Yeah, it was wonderful.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   He's great.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Well, I think you learned a podcast about a couple.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Working out their marital issues through song.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Wow.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   We should do an entire episode in music.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Whether it's Google or Facebook or Apple, we'll talk about it.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Even if it's bad.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Stacy, your turn.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   No, no.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   I don't sing at that time.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I'm telling you this is a fresh, jolted life into the form of a form.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   For example, Zach acres said there's an unlimited amount of ways to go right now because the
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   podcast form is so young and so pliable.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   No, it's old.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   It's old as well.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   I used to be young and pliable.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Yeah, I don't think, you know, okay, how can you mix up the form?
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   How do you mess with an audience in an interesting way?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Absolutely.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   I agree with that.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   That's what's not just podcast, but new media in general gives you an opportunity to break
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   with the past a little bit, right?
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Well, musicals are like the quintessential rom-com.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   So having this sort of thing, like for that story makes sense, I think.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Isn't it the case, Jeff?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   You're old.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Isn't it the case that very often when you get new media, the first thing that happens
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   is that is people try to take the old media and shoehorn it in.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Absolutely.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   We see the future and the analog in the past.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Yes.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   More old school than musicals.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Musicals.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   I know.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Opera.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Opera.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Well, I'm sure they're opera.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   I did not mind the idea.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   In fact, there's a, you know, there's storytelling podcasts, there's a great fiction podcast.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   I don't mind that at all, people putting a music in there.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   No.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   It's very interesting.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   The problem with it is the cost of production on a musical is orders of magnitude higher
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   than just what we do.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   The authorship.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   I haven't listened to it yet.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   You want to try?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   You have to.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Yeah, let me see if I can find it.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.520]   If you search for, if you search on, well, Google Play, they had the song separate from the,
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.520]   from the text.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.520]   So if you search for it.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.600]   Oh my gosh, you guys think of the merchandising opportunities.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.560]   How could I not think of that right away?
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.920]   You could sell soundtracks.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.440]   You could license the rights to songs.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:54.120]   So apparently these 36 questions are 36 questions that will help you fall in love with anybody.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.880]   So that's where the name comes from.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.920]   Let me see though, if I can get the, a little bit of the music.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.320]   Groff is phenomenal.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:07.360]   If you search iTunes or Google Play for the, for that title, the songs are separate.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.360]   All right.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.160]   Here also release the songs from Act 1.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.160]   Is this it?
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.160]   There's three acts.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.160]   Yeah, this is it.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.160]   Here's songs from Act 1.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.160]   I hear you are.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:22.600]   You share a lot in common with my husband, Jayce.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.280]   This is Jesse Shelton.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:31.160]   So if you just have a keyboard, I guess it's not.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.160]   I actually love this idea.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.040]   Here's one of the, the Groff and Shelton.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.680]   Good.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:44.640]   I like this.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:52.920]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:59.040]   But look at, I'm just want to point out the list of people involved in the production.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.200]   You know, written, directed and composed by Ellen Wilder and Chris Littler, produced
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.240]   by Zach Acres and Skip Bronkey, Rangers and Music Supervision by ASHAR, edited and mixed
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.480]   this by Sound Design, mastered by engineer, sound engineering, production management,
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.840]   the production assistant, story consultant, percussion, piano, cello, trombone bass.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.800]   And every, it means well known that a musical to produce a musical on Broadway is significantly
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.480]   more than producing a play.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.840]   And I would imagine some of the same costs.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.480]   Well, that case you also have union costs, which are huge.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.720]   I mean, I just, I think this is a great thing.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.320]   And I hope they can make money and make a, make their way doing it.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.320]   I think it's fantastic.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.320]   Yeah.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.320]   I don't know.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.320]   Are they doing Patreon?
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.320]   I don't know.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.320]   I don't know.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.600]   I just saw there was a wired story about them.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.440]   They did Lime Street before, which was a, I think a fictional podcast.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.440]   It was.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.080]   There's some great stuff going on.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.440]   My mom is a big fan of something called Crime Town.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.560]   Because we grew up in Providence, right?
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.480]   So the first show is about the Providence mafia.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.720]   And they come back to it a couple of times.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.080]   So she's a big fan of that.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.600]   So I love that your mom listens to podcasts.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.600]   That's great.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.200]   That's a gimlet show.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.200]   So that's great.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.200]   I mean, companies like gimlet that have more money than we do.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.280]   Well, actually, I don't know if that's true, but they have more.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.760]   Well, I'll bet you have more revenue than gimlet does now.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.160]   We probably have more revenue than almost anybody with NPR.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.320]   Yeah, I think we do.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.960]   We almost made 10 million in revenue last year.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.160]   And by the way, I love your openness about that.
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.040]   Well, I mean, I don't know.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:39.120]   Lisa doesn't, but she's my CEO and wife.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.360]   But I think it brings the viability when I tell people the story of Twitch in the media
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.720]   world around the world.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.680]   They just, their eyes bug out.
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.680]   Yeah.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.040]   So I look at the shows and I say, look at this.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.040]   This is how you produce this.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:56.320]   This is a new way to think about content and video and audio and a new way to have relationship
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.080]   with an audience and a new way to think about advertising is radio, right?
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.080]   But it works.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.080]   And you're video is different, though, than radio.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.360]   It is different than radio in a lot of respects.
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.440]   We only do a few ads a show.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.120]   The ads are longer than radio ads and they're much more personal than radio ads.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.840]   Our audience is more engaged than a radio audience.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.760]   The ads are much more expensive.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:26.320]   But the ROI is equivalently high or we wouldn't get advertisers sticking around.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.000]   And we do something that nobody does.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.160]   In fact, it baffles people.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.160]   I got it.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:37.200]   We got, Lisa got an angry email from somebody the other day because he said, because we
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.320]   turned down advertisers all the time, we vet them and we turned them down.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.280]   And he said, how dare you?
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.960]   He said, I'm not going to propose my clients to you to have them be turned down.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.960]   That's insane.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.600]   I've never heard of such a thing.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:58.560]   And so what really that points to is that the very big difference is that an advertisement
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.240]   on our shows, and I think this is true of most podcasts, at least if they're successful
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:07.560]   and they do well, is really a recommendation from the host and is based on the tremendous
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.560]   value.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.280]   Which can be based on the trust.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:14.920]   And if I accepted just anything, it would be problematic.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.520]   Because when somebody's unhappy with the product, they blame, they don't blame the product,
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.200]   they blame me almost invariably if it's an advertiser.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.960]   So, so Leo, not speaking specifically, but generically, what kinds of sponsors do you
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.560]   turn down?
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:33.840]   Well, if it's a product I don't like.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.760]   Okay.
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:41.240]   We regularly get requests from antivirus companies and other security products, which we turn
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:46.560]   down because I don't recommend antiviruses.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.880]   It's just a variety of things.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.880]   It's on a case by case basis.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.080]   I wouldn't say it's a category.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.960]   I would say it's not a category.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.320]   It's just, if that's a product I can't get behind that one.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.400]   It's a specifically advertiser.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.480]   So you really just look at it as a basis.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.480]   And it's personal.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.280]   It's personal, which is why they get upset if I say no.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.960]   And it is challenging to say no.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.800]   I mean, we don't want to say, well, we don't like your products to go away.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:16.280]   We have to say, well, it doesn't fit or it's a conflict or Leo uses something else or.
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:23.640]   But anyway, the point, I guess getting back to the 36 questions and the musical is it's
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.520]   wonderful new medium, but like a lot of what's going on in the internet, I think a lot of
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:32.960]   companies start up with no plan or desire or means to make money at it.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.240]   But just the notion, well, let's just take a chance.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.240]   Let's try it.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.560]   Let's see if we can generate an audience, which is great.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.920]   I'm thrilled that there's that kind of experimentation going on.
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:45.160]   But that doesn't mean necessarily they'll be, you know, what's going to survive?
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.160]   What's going to make sense?
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.160]   I think it could be.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.760]   The musical could be much better than the news roundtable, which I've bit all my money
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.760]   on.
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.760]   Isn't there a sing the news program?
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:58.640]   Or is that just something I've imagined in my head for all of my life?
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.240]   It seems like there was a YouTube video.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.240]   Was it?
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.240]   Not a thing?
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.240]   Yeah, I think it was.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.240]   Auto tune the news.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.240]   Auto tune the news.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.240]   Way back in the day.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.240]   Okay.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.240]   Where?
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.240]   Oh, there's.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.240]   I think it might still be around.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.240]   Oh, okay.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.240]   The Gregory Brothers did it.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.240]   Yes.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.600]   So here's the here's an example.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.240]   Actually let me turn up the size.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.240]   It's all solutions.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.240]   I hear a fog court ball.
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.240]   The legislature override a gubernatorial.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.240]   This is an early warning.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:30.440]   I'm not feeling any romance between us right now.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.640]   You got to do it like this.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.640]   This is a pretty remarkable week.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.440]   I'm the gay marriage front.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.040]   First of all, they have a state like.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.040]   So they're auto tuning.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.040]   Neither.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.040]   He's coasting.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.040]   Neither.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.040]   Left coasting.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.640]   In a decision written by a fucking guy.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.640]   Actually.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:54.240]   Those are the Gregory Brothers I think.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.200]   Then there's songified the news.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.520]   This is this is these been doing this.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.520]   Oh, wait.
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.520]   Is that made?
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.520]   I'm going to turn spoken words to song.
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.920]   Thank you for sitting down with me.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:04.920]   Were you ever bullied?
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:05.920]   No, I wasn't.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.920]   Has it happened that somebody has.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.520]   This is Megan Kelly in the present.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.520]   I try and unwound myself.
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:18.520]   I feel like you're trying to get out of bounds.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:19.520]   I don't hard.
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.520]   I don't hard hard.
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.520]   If I was off, I would not have that with this part.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.520]   I don't hard hard hard hard.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:36.520]   I'm not.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.520]   That's pretty good.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.520]   That takes some skill.
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:41.520]   Isn't that just like an AI?
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.520]   No.
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.520]   Oh, I don't think you could do that automatically.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.520]   No, wasn't this like an app pick of yours?
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.520]   Like a couple weeks back.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.520]   I don't think it was anywhere that good.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.520]   No, it wasn't.
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.520]   Okay.
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.320]   That's a pretty skillful thing to do.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.520]   You got to edit and tune it and work with it.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:05.880]   Although this was it this week that we saw that you could now do an AI that can make
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.240]   it look like President Obama is telling you things.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.240]   Did you guys see that?
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:14.400]   Well, this is of course, this is the story in general is we're getting closer and closer
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.960]   to a world where anything can say anything.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.000]   Anybody can be made to say anything or look like they're saying anything.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.560]   I think this is what you're talking about.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.560]   So what was that called?
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.560]   Oh, creaky.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.560]   Okay.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.160]   But you know, there it is.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:34.720]   Scary realistic AI video puts words in Obama's mouth.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.560]   This is I think it's good to talk about this only because I figure it's only a matter of
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:45.840]   time before people are going to start doing this to us, to me particularly.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.840]   And people will believe this.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.960]   So it's important for everybody to know that this can be completely fake.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.040]   Here's an article from Boing Boing.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:57.280]   This is researchers at University of Washington developed an AI model of Obama's lip movements
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:01.560]   so that the bots lips sync up to any audio track.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.560]   Here's synthesizing Obama learning lip sync from audio.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:09.040]   Given this audio as input, it's been less than a week since the deadliest mass shooting
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.560]   in American history.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.720]   Our method produces the following output.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.200]   It's been less than a week since the deadliest mass shooting.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.520]   So this is the actual video and the actual audio.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.720]   For most in all of our minds has been the loss.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.720]   I wish they had picked something a little less.
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.080]   The people of Orlando said ground truth video of Obama saying the same words.
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:30.760]   Especially our friends who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.920]   I visited with the families of many of the victims.
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:33.920]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:34.920]   And one thing.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.440]   Yeah, we saw their results first.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.440]   Oh my God.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.440]   Yeah.
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:42.600]   So so you got to watch this on Boing Boing, I guess.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.240]   But the investment.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.760]   So that fooled me.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:46.760]   Yes.
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.720]   I did notice the lip sync was a little weird, but you see that all the time in video, especially
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.720]   ours.
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:58.120]   So I didn't take and I thought that was the original that they showed the AI version first.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.280]   Wow.
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.280]   Is right.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.280]   See, yeeek.
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.520]   That is yes.
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.520]   Super scary.
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.720]   And so is the next step in something like that to build a neural network that can tell
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.200]   when those are fake?
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.960]   You know how like there's some awesome people who are really great at spotting photo shopping
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.320]   for like Kardashian pictures?
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.400]   Is that like a skillset we're going to have to develop?
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:24.160]   Well, right now the researchers at the University of Washington say it would be easy enough
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.000]   to prove it's a fake with simple tools.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.800]   But I think it's going to get harder and harder.
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.120]   I think that's the real point.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.120]   Yeah.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:37.000]   And in this world of fake news, it's going to get easier and easier to make it.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.120]   That's going to be confusing for people too because we have been taught to trust our
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.120]   eyes.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.160]   You know, pictures didn't happen.
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.560]   If you can't trust the pictures or with a video.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.560]   We haven't.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.560]   We haven't.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:54.880]   I mean, we've been taught by entertainment to suspend disbelief around images and movies
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.640]   and all kinds of things.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.440]   So it always depends upon the source.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.440]   I guess you're right.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.440]   Okay.
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.440]   Yeah.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.360]   But okay, I'll think as a journalist though, and even as a professor of journalism, that
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:13.760]   makes my job like so much more difficult, especially in a rapid fire news world that
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:14.760]   we've been in.
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.760]   Absolutely.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:16.760]   Right.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.760]   True.
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:19.760]   So we need to slow down.
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.520]   We need to have a better system of provenance.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:29.160]   You know, there's some simple tricks when you see a photo that's too good to be true.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.440]   So I was talking to so, so we announced something here at CUNY.
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:38.120]   We're working with store full and moat on basically the first phase of this is a list
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.960]   of all the known really bad fake news sites.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:45.320]   One of the guys was telling me that when they see a really funny, weird, I don't believe
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:49.920]   that picture and they verify that it's made up, then they look on and they see that it's
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.960]   been put on, you know, hundreds of sites.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.720]   And so there are going to be more and more technique and the bad guys are always going
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.440]   to be a step ahead just ask Matt Cuts.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.280]   But we do have technology.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.280]   Right.
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:08.360]   We're going to take this data set and try to see how much prediction we can do around
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.120]   both the type of content that's there and also how it's promoted and things like that.
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.680]   So you're absolutely right.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.120]   It makes it more challenging.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.360]   But that's why there's also always a business opportunity.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:23.320]   Do you know, store full store full as a startup that was bought by News Corp that that verifies
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:28.720]   social content and then sells it to media companies.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.360]   So there's business opportunity there too.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:35.640]   But think, I mean, this gives me many of the October's surprise, right?
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.800]   Because when you're the day before the election, let's say, this is me and the chairman said
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.440]   this and I think it's a very astute.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:47.280]   It's the day before the election and you get the candidate saying something horrible.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.280]   Is there time?
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.280]   Is there time?
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.520]   Is there a phone ring?
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.280]   Turn landline house.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.280]   I'm just ruining everything.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.880]   Wait, don't move Jim.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.400]   Web 1354K says something can turn like that.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.400]   He did.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.400]   He stopped moving.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:11.080]   And imagine a candidate saying something outrageous, everybody falling for 24 hours before an election.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.320]   Or here's another one.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.440]   A candidate could dog whistle something outrageous and then say, oh, no, that's fake news.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.680]   Oh, that happens all the time.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.960]   Remember everybody does something stupid and it's like, oh, my Twitter account was hacked.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:23.960]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.680]   That's the Wiener defense.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.680]   Well, that worked.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.680]   He's speaking of Wiener's.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.920]   Did you see Google Glasses back?
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:39.520]   Jeff is going to get your Google Glass out of retirement.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.400]   I don't even get restarted.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.000]   This is not doing it again.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   No, no, no.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   This is a smart thing.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   This is a great place.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   This is how it should have been all along, right?
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Yes.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   This is how it should have been used all along.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Should have been.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   Yes.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.560]   We are using our show this morning.
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:58.120]   This is a great place for business type computing to go from business to the personal
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.720]   because you get the economies of scale.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:05.640]   You're going to, at a personal level, we just weren't prepared at the social contract level,
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:09.280]   at the understanding of what it was going to take to make this real.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:13.440]   But heads up displays are something that are going to be really useful everywhere, but
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.120]   especially useful in the business world.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.720]   They'll pay the premium price tags.
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.360]   They'll charge the things.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.520]   Now they have a little light that says when you're recording.
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.520]   So, yay.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.320]   We'll learn to see those awkward encounters.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.360]   This is a article by Stephen Levy and Wired.
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.120]   Jack's approach is two different visions of glass.
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:34.240]   On the left, the original vision with Diane Vine-Fürstenberg, the designer and Sergey
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.400]   Bryn wearing their glass at a fashion show.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.560]   And forget that one.
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.560]   This is the one that's important.
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.040]   This is the one that's today.
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.080]   This is a worker at a company called Agco.
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.880]   They make agricultural machinery.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:45.880]   He comes in and works.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:46.880]   No, I had them on the podcast.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:47.880]   You did.
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:48.880]   Oh, that's me.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:49.880]   They came in and worked.
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:53.120]   Puts on glass and says, "Okay, glass, let's go."
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.320]   And I guess what is it?
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:58.520]   So tell me, what is he looking at in that screen over his right eyebrow?
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:04.960]   Oh, either videos or instructions on how to fix that machine or possibly data from them.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.960]   Sorry.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:06.960]   They use the glass.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.240]   I mean, the camera in the glass, do they take pictures or something?
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.240]   They can.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.400]   So, they can take pictures of something and send it along.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.720]   This is actually not...
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.320]   This is actually these sorts of displays have been used for a while.
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:25.360]   It's a tetrapack, the guys who do the little...
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.560]   I can't think of it, non-refrigerated milk packs like the Horizon milk.
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.360]   Those guys actually use a septic.
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.360]   Thank you.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.160]   I could not think of that work.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.640]   A septic packaging, yeah.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:40.160]   So those guys actually use Microsoft's HoloLens to repair and deal with...
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.160]   And that's a VR function.
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.880]   I'm sorry, it's not a VR function.
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:44.880]   It's an AR function.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:45.880]   AR function, right.
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.040]   And so, yes.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:52.560]   This is a similar thing, an Epsom has a whole line for industrial glass type things.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:56.520]   But Google has got so much more a name brand.
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.800]   And B, it's got all these cloud resources behind it, I think.
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:05.880]   So when Google stopped the Explorer program, which is what you've got, your glass and
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.800]   I got my glass under Jeff.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.880]   Later, later the name would change was the Schmuck program.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.720]   $1,500.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.720]   That's how much we were.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.080]   $2,000 for me.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.080]   What?
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.080]   Because I bought the...
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.080]   I got like...
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.080]   Prescription lenses.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.280]   I got a prescription lenses.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.280]   Yeah.
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:28.240]   So that ended January 2015, but according to TechCrunch, they never stopped.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.680]   Ron Miller says they continue to sell glass to businesses.
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.080]   They wanted them.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:39.360]   So the EE, which used to be Explorer edition, is now Enterprise edition.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:43.560]   And they just announced the Enterprise version on Tuesday.
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.560]   So glass never really left.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:49.240]   A lot of companies, GE Healthcare using it.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:53.680]   Glass has been used in the emergency room at UMass Medical School.
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.840]   So it never went away.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.160]   And so it's really interesting.
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.160]   And I guess that...
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.520]   It went away into my closet, I'll tell you that.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.520]   Yeah.
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.520]   But it's not interesting.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:08.240]   So there's a difference between glass, which is really just having a proximate screen that
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:13.520]   you can read without using your hands or looking away from your task versus hollow
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:17.800]   lens, which really, as you said, Stacey, is augmented reality.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:22.680]   Superimposing, say, instructions on top of what you're doing, which I think would be
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.480]   more useful.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:28.240]   So the two things you should just think about is both of them are a form of a heads-up
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.240]   display.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.800]   And both of them are giving information.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:31.800]   Right.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:35.800]   And in the Enterprise context, it doesn't matter if it's like fancy AR information or
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:39.000]   if it's just like...
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.440]   So there's been instructions for how to fix something or a reminder of how many counts
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.120]   for CPR that you've got to do.
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:49.760]   Like I talked to a doctor who did a CPR app for Google Glass.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.760]   And that was like...
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:56.360]   It was basically a reminder for how to do CPR if you needed to.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.360]   So...
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.680]   Well, here's a good example.
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.480]   The rhythm on CPR has changed.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.160]   And we're supposed to now do it.
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.160]   Hi.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.160]   Hi.
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.160]   Staying alive.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.160]   Staying alive, right?
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.160]   So different than the way it was before...
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.000]   I don't know, the rules have changed slightly.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.120]   So you could have the Bee Gees playing in your Google Glass.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.120]   They did.
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.800]   That was part of the app.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.480]   To help you do it in the right rhythm.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.120]   That was part of his app.
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.120]   That's pretty funny.
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.120]   So...
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.400]   I wonder if the Bee Gees approved the use of that.
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.200]   You can't say no once it's out there.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.200]   I know.
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.200]   I'll...
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.200]   You can't tell by the way I use my...
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.200]   I know that.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.200]   That's not the part.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.200]   This is now becoming the musical podcast.
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.200]   See, I'm telling him the musical podcast.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.200]   I'm not in there.
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.200]   Hi.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:44.600]   I'm waiting for the Leo and Jeff Duet.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.200]   Maybe you can argue about data rights.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:57.960]   You don't bring me hard drives anymore.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.520]   What else should we talk about?
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.360]   How about Jason Callicanis?
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.160]   Oh, I put this on there.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.160]   It is...
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.160]   Okay.
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.160]   You're asking nuts.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.160]   You're asking...
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.160]   And I like Jason.
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.160]   He's a character and you're right.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.160]   Oh, but it's...
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:19.440]   So here he is on the Squawk Alley on CNBC.
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.440]   What's he talking about?
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.440]   The new...
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:25.040]   Well, he's back at Google and Facebook saying they're awful.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.760]   He's making fun of Google for the new news feed.
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.240]   We'll talk about it in a minute.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.240]   Okay.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.960]   He's saying that there are terrible partners that...
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:36.160]   Wall Street Journal and Guardian New York Times left them, which is not really true.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.160]   They just...
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.640]   A few of them kind of have a few things, but they're working together.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:43.480]   In fact, I just talked to people who are very happy with them.
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:48.720]   And never really reveals the conflict of interest here, which he still runs the...
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.120]   What does that say he has?
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.120]   Was it a launch?
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.120]   What was it?
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.120]   No, no, no, no.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.120]   No, no, no.
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.120]   It's the other thing.
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.120]   It was on his Kyra.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.120]   Oh, lower three.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.120]   Inside.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.120]   So here's why Jason...
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:03.920]   This is why Jason doesn't like Google, I think.
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.840]   Inside, which is a news...
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:10.560]   Went from being a website with information, kind of a newsletter.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:15.360]   And the reason he had to do that is because it was entirely reliant on Google search results
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.440]   driving traffic was essentially demand media.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.440]   Right?
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.440]   Right.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.600]   Is that unfair to call it demand media?
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.600]   I don't think so.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.600]   Oh, so...
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:25.600]   Because demand media...
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.760]   Well, go ahead.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.840]   It's kind of as a negative.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:34.640]   But the idea was real news curated by real humans and that you would be driven to these
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:40.280]   stories by doing a search for and he had lots of people writing stories about a lot of
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.280]   subjects.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:42.280]   It was demand media.
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.280]   Right.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.280]   You know, other people's stuff, all their people's words were...
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.280]   Right.
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.280]   I guess.
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.280]   Did he do that?
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.280]   If that's the case, that's not so good.
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.560]   But anyway, then Google basically killed him.
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:58.240]   And I think he wrote a piece in his newsletter about that by killing demand media, by deranking
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.520]   it or lowering its rank.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.920]   And so he went to a completely different model and now it's all newsletters.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:08.960]   But if you look at it, you see the idea is similar, which is it's a lot of verticals.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.960]   So these are all...
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:10.960]   Oh, it wasn't Topsy like that.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:11.960]   Guy Kawasaki's thing?
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.960]   There were a lot of demand media.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:14.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:15.960]   A lot of things were like...
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:21.360]   No, because they were an effort to just jump on to cheap content by aggregating or repurposing.
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.680]   He's got a conspiracy newsletter.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:26.560]   He's got everything you could think of as a newsletter.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.680]   His Trump newsletter is updated like twice a week.
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.800]   I wouldn't say that's often enough, fella.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.080]   Now, I don't want to knock Jason.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.840]   I like Jason a lot and he's on their show.
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:35.840]   No, I will.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:36.840]   Because the segment...
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:43.400]   Well, he should really reveal that he has why he has a...
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.400]   Exactly.
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.440]   He should reveal it and the show should reveal it and it becomes more of this...
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.440]   No, Google.
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.000]   And it's just...
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   I get tired.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   It doesn't get us anywhere.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   All right.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   I gave you.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.680]   I have a cool story.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.560]   Well, wait, look, before we do, I just want to get to the news feed thing.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.400]   So they changed when you hit the Google app.
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.480]   I don't know if I've got it or not.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.080]   Used to be now cards, right?
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.960]   I still get my now cards.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:13.800]   I thought it was now cards, but now supposedly it's a personalized stream of news.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.920]   First of all, I want the now cards back.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.760]   No, I think it's better.
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.560]   I still got my now cards.
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:20.560]   I still got my now cards.
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:21.560]   Still now cards, but...
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:22.560]   Wait, is this...
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:23.560]   Still basically, it's just better cards.
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.560]   Wait.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:25.560]   What is on my phone?
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:30.840]   You'd have to get the Google app on iOS or Android and you'd have to get it updated.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.240]   I didn't get an update on the Google app in the last few days.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.240]   Oh, okay.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.160]   Maybe we don't have the latest.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.320]   But I've always had some news.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.640]   I've always had a smattering of news articles in my Google now.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.800]   It's new cards.
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:47.080]   It also shows related to big stories like Trump stories, related stories to it in a carousel.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:51.240]   Is this maybe response to demand for more content in the...
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.240]   Well, so here's the funny thing.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:59.360]   The way the various news sites around said this was they said...
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.200]   TechCrunch called it a "friendless feed."
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.400]   A lot of others said, "Google has to compete with Facebook."
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.280]   I don't think it's competition with Facebook and the slightest.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.600]   It just happens to be another feed that has news in it.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:09.600]   So they call it a news feed.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.600]   I must have it because...
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.600]   I must have it.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:12.600]   Facebook has one of those.
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.600]   I do see a lot more news articles than I used to see.
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:17.240]   There are more news articles that make me sad.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:20.200]   Google has never lived up to the promise of Google now.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.200]   Wait, wait.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.200]   No, no, no.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.200]   I love it.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.440]   No, but it could be so much more.
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.000]   Oh, like what?
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.400]   I mean, Google now, right now, I'm in it.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.720]   I get my news stories that are personalized to me.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:35.160]   So it's got one saying I've shown interest in the Amazon Echo.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.560]   I've got a Tesla story.
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:40.720]   I've got one about dogs because dogs, malware.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.840]   It's a good news feed.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:43.840]   But look...
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:44.840]   It's not in anymore.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.920]   Here's what I have.
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:50.000]   News stories, a giant score, which could arguably...
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.800]   The baseball team could be arguably a news feed.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:58.480]   And then at the very, very bottom, one little tiny card in fine print with a weather.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.480]   That's all.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:00.480]   I get my packages delivered.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:01.480]   You step talented.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.680]   Yes, see, you're not going to get it.
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:03.680]   You've got the old one.
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.680]   That's going to be gone.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.680]   Oh.
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:11.600]   Although it keeps trying to give me recipes and their culinary inspiration card sucks.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.600]   Oh, you do?
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:13.600]   Oh, I don't get that.
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.600]   Sucks eggplants.
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.600]   It's terrible.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:19.560]   For the last months or two in the Google now feed, they've been saying, "Don't see your
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.560]   favorite topics.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.560]   Follow more topics."
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.560]   Remember, what are your interests?
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:23.560]   Come on.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.360]   And clearly they were aiming towards this.
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:33.600]   It disappoints me because I think what now could be is a highly personalized list of all
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:39.280]   the things it used to be, your calendar, your directions to work, traffic, all the things...
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.720]   That's what it gives me.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.720]   Yeah.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:44.400]   It pings me and is like, "Stacey, you should leave now."
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.400]   I don't think you can...
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.400]   Oh, I don't want it to be updated.
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.400]   No, you don't.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.400]   Because now it's just...
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.400]   Because I like it.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.280]   It's like, "Hey, your package is about to arrive."
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:55.280]   And by the way, you should leave in 15 minutes and...
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.280]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:57.280]   That's Google now.
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:58.280]   That's cool.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.120]   Google, don't screw me over.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.680]   How is this useful?
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.600]   I feel like it's going away.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:08.520]   If you go to the bottom, Stacey, and follow topics, you can follow IOT, not that you need
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.520]   to.
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.520]   Oh, dude.
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:11.520]   It knows I like IOT.
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:12.520]   But who needs another new speed?
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.120]   I liked it when it had a few articles.
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:19.280]   If it were really smart and said, "Look, I know these are the four articles you're going
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:20.280]   to say.
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:21.280]   I want to...
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.840]   I must have read those."
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.480]   And then, and your car...
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.120]   I don't see where my car is parked.
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.120]   You know...
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.120]   Oh, I see that.
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.120]   Well, I'm saying I don't think you're going away.
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.320]   You're like, "Stacey, it's going away."
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.320]   So I will say, here's a thought.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:40.440]   Sometimes when I'm really bored, which does happen, I sit there and I like...
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.160]   I'm scrolled through all the stories.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.160]   I want more.
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.120]   And usually I just go to more stories.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.120]   But maybe they...
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:47.120]   I do that all the time.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.120]   I do that all the time.
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.120]   And that's what I'm thinking.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.120]   Maybe they got some telemetry that's...
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.120]   See, I read these stories.
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.760]   That's what I wanted.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:56.560]   And I think they're just making a mountain out of a wall hole.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.760]   But we'll see if I get updated.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:02.160]   And if I do, I'll come on next week and I'll be like, "Google destroying me."
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.920]   And I may be mistaken.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:08.840]   But I'm just noticing, for instance, down in the Android feed, there's no Google Now
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:09.840]   content.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.360]   There's like weather at the bottom.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.960]   On my iPhone feed, it still has some Google Now content.
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:18.840]   But my fear is it's just not been updated yet.
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:22.080]   Well, I can go and customize my feed.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:28.320]   And it tells me, "Oh, Google, it tells me all the things that Google thinks I'm following."
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.960]   And it offers me my commute in places.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:31.960]   Yeah, I'm wondering.
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.760]   I don't see that anymore.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:40.920]   So, I worry a little bit that Google might be turning away from something that they...
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:44.480]   In my opinion, they did a good job, but they never did this good a job as they.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.040]   Now promised more than it delivered.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.680]   There could have been so much more in there.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.000]   And maybe it says a privacy concern.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   It was never personalized for me.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.760]   I was going to do more than I got.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.800]   No, I reveal everything to Google.
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.080]   I hold the nothing back.
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.160]   I've always loved Now.
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.960]   I've always loved it.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.240]   I thought it was everything.
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.320]   I thought it was like the future.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.280]   I was never disappointed.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:12.960]   Chapman says, "I'm doing it wrong."
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:17.800]   So there are icons at the bottom of my Google Now feed now.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.480]   Do you see those three icons?
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:24.640]   The first one's a news feed, but if you click the second icon, I now have calendar, travel
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:26.920]   time, recent orders, all the...
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:27.920]   So what they've...
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.920]   Oh, and I just got a message to hear Leo says, "Welcome.
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:31.920]   Here's what's upcoming.
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:36.360]   Save time with info on your agenda, commute, trips, and day-to-day tasks all right here."
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.800]   So what they've done is they've added a new tab.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:39.800]   That's what they've done.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.800]   All right.
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:42.800]   Hopeful cards.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.680]   In other words, Leo, we both say, "Never mind."
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:46.680]   "Never mind."
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:47.680]   Well, not exactly, never mind.
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.040]   This is definitely a change.
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.400]   So can you get a close-up card?
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:54.480]   So if I over the shoulder shot, yes, not very close.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.080]   But see this at the bottom, there's three icons.
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.080]   Okay.
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:00.080]   This is news.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.160]   This is the old Now stuff.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.160]   And again, I like some more.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.160]   This is a new one.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.760]   This is a clock.
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:07.760]   Introduction to recent.
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.080]   What does that mean?
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:13.200]   See what you found, rediscovered topics you've looked for in the Google app recently.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.200]   What?
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.200]   Oh.
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.200]   That's interesting.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.200]   Interesting.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:19.200]   See all of your history.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.200]   So this is--
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.840]   My history.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:22.840]   Find that page.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:23.840]   Oh, this is good.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:24.840]   Find that page.
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.600]   Want that recipe article or site from a few days ago?
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.040]   Save time, honey, and find it here first.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.040]   Those are history.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.040]   So all right.
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.040]   So I take it back.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.920]   They're doing exactly what I wanted them to do, which is to add capabilities to Google
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:35.920]   Now.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:36.920]   That's erased in the last 10 minutes.
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:37.920]   That's fine.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:38.920]   It's fine.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:40.800]   So you know what would be a fun thing?
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.800]   No, you idiots.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:45.560]   But you know, we're not going to be alone because it defaults to that first tab and who--
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:46.560]   You know, until you know.
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.360]   I just give up the message to me.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.880]   Why I did do that immediately.
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:52.880]   You know what I think that's part of the problem is when you get something new and it has all
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.680]   those blue boxes and say, hey, you can do this.
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.680]   I always ignore them.
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:59.480]   So the fact that it came up five minutes later, maybe some more.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:02.480]   OK.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.960]   So look at the bottom of your Google Now app.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:04.960]   Now this is on Android.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:05.960]   Let me just see what I always--
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:07.960]   I don't have that yet.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.960]   But can I tell you that would be--
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.160]   Eat and drink entertainment.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:13.160]   Yeah.
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:16.760]   So the good news is this seems to be-- yeah, there it is.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:20.520]   This seems to be adding-- it doesn't have the recent one, the little clock, but it does
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:21.520]   have this--
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:22.520]   Oh, wow.
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.520]   Deal.
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.520]   That's very top.
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:25.520]   At the very top.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.520]   There's an inbox.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.960]   You have a weather or eat and drink entertainment and sports?
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:31.960]   Weather, doodles, entertainment.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:33.480]   Click on the right arrow.
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.480]   Click on the right arrow.
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.480]   Oh.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.480]   Oh, my.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.480]   So things should be--
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:42.840]   Nearby forests, entertainment, translate-- oh, wow.
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:43.840]   So this was actually--
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:44.840]   Animal sounds.
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:45.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.640]   We did this actually present it right.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.640]   This is cool.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:49.640]   Animal sounds?
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.640]   What sound does the sheep make?
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:52.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.840]   What sound is the raccoon?
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:57.440]   The raccoon's don't make sounds.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:00.280]   Oh, yeah, they do.
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:04.000]   What-- mookow?
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.400]   That's a whole tab of animal sounds in my Google now.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.400]   Thank you, Google.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.400]   Wow.
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:12.200]   These-- a lot of these are--
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.600]   Where's Danny Sullivan when you need him?
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:21.120]   A lot of these are-- look, weather sunrise, sunset, travel, book
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.680]   of flight, book of--
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.320]   So this is actually adding a considerable amount of capability
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.160]   to Google now.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.160]   All right.
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.520]   They're doing what I had hoped they would do with Google now,
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:29.520]   right?
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.920]   Which was add sheep sounds?
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:31.920]   Yes.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.160]   So not that level.
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.160]   But there's a hamburger menu.
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:36.160]   Very handy, Stacey.
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:39.320]   You don't know when you need that in a argument.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.480]   There's a hamburger menu in the old version,
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.560]   and that's giving me recent.
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:45.640]   So the same thing that you see at the bottom,
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.400]   it's giving me reminders and customize.
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:51.080]   But it is not giving me the option to do animal sounds
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.080]   for which I'm very sad.
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.480]   You're on iOS, right?
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.640]   I know I'm on--
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.440]   Today I'm on the Nexus 5X.
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:56.960]   OK.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:57.720]   Wait a second.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:58.720]   Creepy alert.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.680]   How does it know what shows I like?
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:01.120]   So--
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:02.960]   Oh, because of what you search.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.120]   It's based on your search.
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.240]   So Stacey--
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:08.280]   No, there's some stuff I have never searched for.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.280]   On Android here--
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.320]   But it's right.
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.400]   There's Google, and then there's a search bar,
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.080]   and then there's these icons below it.
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:16.120]   You don't have those little icons below it.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:17.560]   Mm.
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:18.440]   No.
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:21.040]   So I've got weather, eating drink, entertainment, sports,
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.160]   and then a right arrow.
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.920]   And that's what opens up this page.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.520]   Oh, well, you'll get an update then.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.840]   And this has a ton of stuff.
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:29.680]   Including--
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:30.040]   Now, I do get--
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.280]   I get a ridiculous handy whenever I'm out of town.
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.640]   I just click on the eat and drink it.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:33.640]   Because I love that maps.
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.680]   It gives me the nearby restaurants.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:36.720]   Oh, my God.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.480]   You have given your brain over to the Borg.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.360]   I send out message on Twitter, and I'm like, hey,
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:45.280]   what's a good place to eat around here?
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:45.800]   And then I get a message.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:46.920]   You like talking to humans.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:47.880]   You should get that post--
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.200]   I can roll a die.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.040]   Yeah, roll a die.
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:52.480]   There's also-- some of those were Google features.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.440]   So if you just search for roll a die on Google,
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:57.200]   it will do that for you.
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.040]   So this brings me to what Amazon's
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.280]   doing with the--
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:04.200]   I don't want to use the A word, the Aliyosha app.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:04.960]   And this--
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.280]   You're really trying to call it something else.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.800]   Well, it's like a Saturday live routine.
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.640]   Just pick up any word with an A.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.440]   Andrea.
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.040]   Alicia.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.600]   Alicia.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.360]   So if you go to-- now, I'm going
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.960]   to try to remember how you do this.
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:20.680]   Is it less?
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:21.200]   Oh, no.
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:21.760]   Oh, no.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.280]   I don't remember now.
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.640]   There's a new social network.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.200]   Maybe you have to do it on the Android.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.360]   Oh, in the--
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:29.840]   Got it.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:30.760]   The Spark network.
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:31.600]   You know about that?
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.240]   Spark, or is it any time?
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.640]   Spark.
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.840]   I don't have a social network just yet.
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:40.120]   Well, you had-- by the way, could not be more buried.
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.840]   I'm not sure what Amazon--
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.160]   It's not a great app.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.040]   This app drives me bonkers.
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:48.400]   It's overloaded with things to do.
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.480]   So Spark, let me see if I can get it here.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.280]   I'm not logged.
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:53.280]   See, I must have done a--
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:53.760]   Where do I go?
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.560]   Where do I get it?
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:56.560]   Music, video, and books.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.200]   Madam A app.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.160]   Is that it?
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:02.200]   You go to the bottom A app.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.120]   Like, things to try?
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.120]   No.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.440]   So it's no longer-- oh, no.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:06.940]   I'm sorry.
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:07.960]   I know the shopping app.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.440]   Ah, wrong app.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.280]   I did the wrong app.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.200]   Oh, it's the shopping app.
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:12.680]   It's not the--
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:13.560]   It's the shopping app.
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.160]   So you go to the Amazon shopping app.
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.240]   Let's try this over again.
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.240]   We're going to rewind with this show a lot.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:21.080]   And then you go to the hamburger menu on the left.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.600]   It's the Steve Oops show.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:23.920]   Never mind show.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:27.280]   And programs and features.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.080]   Now, when did you ever go to that?
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.000]   I mean, what would you get?
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.240]   I think I have the Amazon shopping app.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:34.040]   What would you expect there?
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:36.080]   Interesting finds, new finds from Amazon.
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.680]   Amazon exclusives, Amazon Launchpad, new products
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:39.880]   with the brightest startups.
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:41.440]   Ooh, I spent a lot of time there.
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.800]   Amazon restaurants, one hour delivery.
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.520]   Did you know they were doing that?
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:46.560]   I don't know that--
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:47.520]   I ordered that all the time.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:47.920]   And then--
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:48.560]   Oh, I found it.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:49.080]   I do have this--
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:50.640]   Amazon Spark.
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:56.280]   And so this is like Instagram of crap to buy.
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.960]   You can now have it by the basis.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.560]   I have Amazon coins.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.560]   What the heck are those?
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.400]   Well, yes.
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.040]   This all sorts of new crap.
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.120]   Outfit compared--
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:09.000]   That's that echo show, the look thing.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.080]   Treasure truck rolling through town
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:14.680]   with one can't miss item at a time.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.440]   Dash buttons.
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.160]   But what's weird is this is so hidden.
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.200]   I mean, the treasure truck was at CES.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.880]   Was that a real thing?
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.080]   Well, I think it's like--
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:24.520]   It's short about a set.
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.120]   It's like the gold box.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:27.080]   Well, here it is.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.560]   Oh, here it is.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:32.080]   Amazon, show my phone again.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.200]   And--
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:33.720]   What?
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:34.800]   There's the treasure truck.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.240]   Hello, meet treasure truck.
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:38.240]   Step one.
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:41.920]   We hand pick one must have fresh, unique thing at a time.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:44.440]   So it first showed headphones and it showed steak.
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:44.800]   Now it's--
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:45.080]   It's like--
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:45.080]   It's like--
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:46.400]   --woot in your town.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:46.880]   It's--
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:47.560]   It's--
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:50.920]   Today on Treasure Truck, we'll send you a text revealing
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:53.200]   that day's offer.
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.000]   And you pick it up.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:54.800]   There is a truck.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.080]   There's a literal truck.
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.960]   And that was at CES.
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:02.200]   So you don't outfit compared to Stacey?
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:02.480]   Wait a minute.
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.400]   I'm still doing trucks.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.840]   No, but I quote it out.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:09.520]   That's the echo look built in that we've known that.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:10.200]   Where would you like it?
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:11.800]   I know they had it on their phone.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.440]   I could totally use that.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:16.760]   So I'm confirming my location on the Treasure truck.
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:20.400]   But I'm going to-- it looks like we're not in your area yet.
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:21.280]   Not in my area either.
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.400]   Never is in my area.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.440]   Sign up for Texas alerts and we'll let you know when we're
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:24.960]   going to do your job.
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.840]   Where is outfit compared?
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:28.600]   Under programs and features, I have a--
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:29.400]   My-- I don't have it.
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.080]   --pamiproducts.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.080]   Oh, under payment products.
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.240]   Internal, not under--
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:34.240]   --not under--
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:34.740]   --on your own.
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.000]   --stated listed next after.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:36.720]   But can you--
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:37.360]   Oh, I don't have--
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.320]   --I got to point out.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:40.440]   This is insane.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:41.160]   Yes.
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:42.040]   It's hidden.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.840]   It's literally-- it's deep within.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:46.080]   And the three of us has different things.
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.000]   If you want to say to somebody--
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   You can't even say--
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:49.760]   --have you--
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:53.280]   So you go to your shopping app just
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.600]   to see what treasures are hidden in yours,
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.120]   programs and features.
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:59.000]   Now, because I've added-- because I've looked at Spark,
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.600]   I know Spark now is in--
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.680]   explore your interest in Spark.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:03.760]   So I can see this.
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:07.560]   And this basically is just people posting crap
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:10.800]   they bought on Amazon that you might then want to buy.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:11.320]   Right?
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:12.840]   Oh, if you're searching for Spark,
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.360]   it's a Sparky.
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.880]   Pork belly burnt ends really is the thing.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.960]   Cubes of pork belly smoked and rendered.
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:21.760]   Well, they had me at pork belly for almost five hours
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.000]   over low temperature before they're slathered in barbecue sauce
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.560]   and demolished by guests at your next party.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:29.280]   That's an ad sponsored.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.360]   Hiking must-have.
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.800]   So this is kind of a neat social network.
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.320]   But how do you--
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:35.160]   So it's interesting--
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.280]   --instead of doing-- pulling a Facebook
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.000]   and breaking this out into an app,
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.800]   they've just embedded a dozen apps inside the Amazon app
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.440]   in a hidden place.
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:48.440]   Oh, and you have to help.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:49.960]   Spark has been only for the iPhone.
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:50.800]   So that's yours.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.280]   That's coming soon.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.960]   That's why-- yeah, sorry, I shouldn't tease you guys.
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.680]   Yeah, that's not fair.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.600]   Dude, I was not looking forward to that.
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:01.120]   I am concerned about that outfit compared though.
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:02.640]   So I'm going to have to look for that later.
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:03.120]   Wait a minute.
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:04.120]   Well, let's do it.
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:04.480]   Wait a minute.
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:04.960]   Let's do it.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:05.960]   You're wearing a t-shirt.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:06.880]   Search for outfit compare.
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:08.480]   Yeah, this is a terrible outfit to compare.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.360]   Well, let me see.
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:10.360]   I wonder if I can do it.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:13.040]   outfit compare, style advice on the spot.
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:15.160]   Can't decide what to wear.
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:16.640]   outfit compare.
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:17.560]   Get started.
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:20.400]   Add two photos of yourself wearing different outfits.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.560]   In a minute, we'll let you know which one looks better.
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:25.000]   Stacey, just search Amazon for that.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   It'll give you the link to it.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.040]   Oh, OK.
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.200]   Well, here, yeah, because if I can do that,
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.400]   then I've got pictures of me now that--
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:34.000]   So just search for outfit compare.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:34.960]   OK, I'm going to take--
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:35.560]   John, come here.
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:37.200]   Take a photo of me.
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:40.720]   I got to get this outfit.
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:41.880]   So get the whole thing, though.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:44.720]   You got to get all of me.
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:45.840]   Including the shoes.
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:46.320]   Back, John.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:46.840]   We're back.
[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:55.840]   Oh, look at that.
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:58.080]   Oh, I can only download it on the app store.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.480]   There's outfit one.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.320]   Yeah, that's nice.
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:02.080]   Nice job.
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:03.080]   Nice job.
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.280]   No, you can load it from your album.
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.920]   You're a library.
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:07.440]   Oh, let's see.
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.200]   I'll find another attractive outfit.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:12.640]   I don't know how I get out of this, though.
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:13.960]   I'm now in the area.
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:16.280]   OK.
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.320]   Oh, no.
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.200]   This is not easy.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:21.640]   This is why you-- this is really just a come on for--
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:23.600]   you should really have the look.
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:26.760]   And they have the reputation as the great UI company?
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:27.360]   Well, no.
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:28.040]   Do they?
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:28.800]   No, they don't.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:29.160]   Oh, they don't.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.760]   They sense that they use all this data,
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.640]   and they're the best when they get everything done,
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:33.760]   but if Jesus, it's never--
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:34.680]   No, they don't have it.
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:37.080]   They have a reputation of telling you what you want to buy,
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.800]   but not that it's a good UI for it.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.720]   I had first outfit, photo library.
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:43.160]   You didn't take it in the Amazon app,
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.800]   but that's OK because you took it because, oh, I have it now.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:46.320]   There we go.
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:47.400]   There's my first outfit.
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.440]   OK, good.
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:52.680]   We consider fit, color, styling, and current trends.
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:55.840]   OK, now I just have to find a picture of me.
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:46:01.640]   Oh, I have a t-shirt that says, you had me.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:02.120]   You had me.
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:04.880]   And you said, let's go to Taco Bell.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.320]   I saw your post.
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:07.600]   OK, here's another outfit.
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:08.200]   This is not as--
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:08.720]   It's anywhere.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:10.800]   OK, OK, here we go.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.200]   You have me when you said that.
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:14.320]   By the way, do you love Taco Bell that much?
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:18.920]   OK, now it's going to compare two outfits.
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:20.760]   OK, sending photos.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.080]   OK, don't miss our results.
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:22.960]   Turn on notifications.
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:26.320]   So I'll just have to wait a little later on.
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:30.800]   I'm going to get a personalized notification, which, by the way,
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.040]   now that I've turned it on, I bet you
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:37.000]   I get more than just outfit notifications, right?
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.160]   I'm just in progress.
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:41.160]   I wonder if Amazon's going to be--
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:42.840]   I wonder if Amazon's going to be in the Taco Bell t-shirt
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:44.680]   at one picture of me in my black shirt.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.760]   There you go.
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:47.240]   Oh, lord.
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:50.320]   By the way, do you really like Taco Bell that much?
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:52.800]   Well, for his joyous fast food, yeah.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.640]   We've got to get him out to it for a little bit.
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:56.640]   It's probably--
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.160]   At least it's probably better.
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:00.080]   You missed-- Stacy, you missed years of us
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.080]   giving free advertising to Chipotle the show.
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:02.520]   Chipotle.
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:05.080]   And then the E. coli thing, and then that was it.
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:05.560]   Although--
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:07.000]   I still would eat it.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:07.560]   You know what?
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.520]   A guy came by from Chipotle corporate
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:13.040]   and gave us five or six--
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:15.440]   take the whole staff to Chipotle certificates.
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:16.200]   No.
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.560]   And we've been eating Chipotle.
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:19.520]   It's fantastic.
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:20.280]   Yes.
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.520]   Guess who?
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:23.000]   Guess who?
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.880]   Was the one who gave all of this attention to Chipotle.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:27.240]   Wait a minute.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:28.960]   My results are in.
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:29.960]   We think-- No.
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:30.760]   Notable.
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.720]   This is so bogus.
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:37.240]   So I'm wearing a black blazer, black pants, black loafers,
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:38.160]   and a white shirt.
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.760]   I think a very nice outfit.
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:44.400]   And the other picture, I'm wearing my insecticide repellent
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:48.520]   clothing and pants and a tilly hat with a camera.
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:51.200]   And it said-- oh, it says it was a close call,
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.640]   but it prefers the tilly hat.
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:55.380]   Oh, man.
[00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:57.680]   I wish I had this app on my phone right now.
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:00.200]   Because I have so many things I could load.
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.760]   You can't-- what happens when you search for it?
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:02.920]   You didn't get it?
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:05.920]   I got it, but it's a website that is only on the app.
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:08.440]   It tells me to download the iOS app.
[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:10.480]   By the way, I accidentally agreed.
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.560]   And now I have confirmed that pic.
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:18.120]   It's going to recommend tilly hats to you for ever, or ever.
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:20.960]   And they're going to follow you all around the internet.
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:25.240]   So the Taco Bell and Petaluma across the street from it
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:28.480]   is the best taco truck in the world.
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:30.120]   It's a place, yeah.
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:31.600]   Elroy's Taco Truck.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.880]   We tell people who visit Petaluma,
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.320]   don't go to any other restaurant.
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:39.840]   Just go to the Taco Truck across the street from Taco Bell.
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:40.720]   I would love to go there.
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.400]   Next time you're here and taking you there,
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.000]   we'll have a taste test.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.160]   You can have a cholipa.
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:46.560]   So my Taco Bell is fast food.
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:48.760]   That's all it is.
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:50.160]   Chipotle's fast food.
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.600]   Chipotle's better than fast food.
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:52.800]   But Chipotle's the best.
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:55.800]   So when I used to love, you see Taco Bell used to,
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:58.840]   what I used to love years past was the Enchirito.
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:00.440]   - Oh, that was good.
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:01.280]   - Okay.
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:02.120]   - It was very good.
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:02.960]   They got rid of it, it was foolish.
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:03.800]   - Okay.
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:04.720]   - And then they had the grilled stuffed burrito,
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:06.200]   which I do like.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.640]   And they've added too much fat into it.
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:10.520]   They have guac and sour cream, which I should say no to.
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:12.640]   But if I say no to, sometimes they leave out the beans too.
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:15.960]   And the beans are the whole reason I eat the grilled stuffed burrito.
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:18.360]   So it's an issue.
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:20.880]   But as fast food goes, it's not bad.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:24.920]   By the way, I just got a text from the Amazon truck.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:25.760]   What's it called?
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:26.600]   The treasure truck?
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:27.680]   It said, "Way to go.
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:29.480]   We'll let you know if we're rolling through town
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:30.800]   with something new."
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:35.280]   So I'm on the treasure truck text list now.
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:38.840]   So that's, I don't you find this.
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:41.880]   By the way, I am endlessly fascinated these days
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.960]   by Jeff Bezos and Amazon.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:44.800]   - I am too.
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:47.400]   - I think he, you know, we live in really interesting times
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:49.480]   where you have people like Elon Musk,
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:50.680]   yeah, we lost Steve Jobs.
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.520]   But to replace him, we've got Elon Musk,
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:54.080]   we've got Jeff Bezos.
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:56.600]   Who else?
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:57.760]   - Jason Calichanos.
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:59.160]   - No, no, no.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:01.120]   - You can't say Larry and Sergey anymore.
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:04.080]   I don't think they're really dialed in.
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:04.920]   - I don't know.
[00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:05.760]   - They're kind of checked out.
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:06.600]   - I think they're checked out.
[00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:08.920]   And Bruce Porret is not a visionary.
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:11.320]   You might say Sachin Adele,
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.040]   but his vision is all in enterprise.
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:15.400]   So it doesn't really interest me at Microsoft.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:18.520]   - I think Larry's probably doing more than we know.
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:20.880]   - Well, I can't get excited about something I don't know.
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:23.480]   So I'm gonna leave him off the list until I do.
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:25.000]   - All right, fine fair.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.280]   - Maybe he's doing something great.
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:27.280]   I know he's building his own--
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:28.120]   - Well, that's hard.
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:29.280]   - Derigible for reasons, no.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.440]   - Zuck, Zuck.
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.360]   - Now, this is an interesting question.
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:35.880]   You put Zuck in that Elon Musk,
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:40.520]   Jeff Bezos team, you put them on that team or?
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.600]   - Yeah, Zuck changes the site.
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:43.440]   - Okay.
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:46.280]   - He changed the site, but does he have an overriding vision?
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:49.840]   - Oh yeah, oh, the connected world, absolutely.
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:50.760]   - Yeah, but that's--
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:53.960]   - When I interviewed him for the book I sent you,
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:56.600]   you'll find out why I argue what I argue.
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:00.240]   And I'm sure he would not do this anymore,
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:03.120]   but he called himself a social engineer.
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:09.920]   And yeah, he's using engineering to affect
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:11.760]   how we can connect with each other.
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.000]   I think that's huge.
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:18.840]   - Ah, do you wanna rebut Stacy?
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:23.280]   - I don't because my last interaction with Zuck
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:26.520]   was like, God, almost 10 years ago,
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:28.680]   and he was so young and so unformed.
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:32.120]   So it was a really--
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:33.640]   - Oh, well, we got the vision.
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:35.440]   He was like a gumbie where they hadn't put
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:36.960]   the face of facial features on him.
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:40.880]   - He was, he was most visionary
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:43.000]   when talking about how to architect Facebook
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.680]   for scalability, and that was where his passion was then.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:48.320]   - I kind of honored that 'cause he's done a great job of that.
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:51.520]   - He was actually more, he was blunt and open then.
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:54.480]   He's more media trained now.
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:55.960]   - Oh yeah, he was blunt and open,
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:58.000]   but he was more blunt and open,
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.080]   but it was about like Memcache D or Memcache.
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:01.920]   - Yeah.
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.520]   - And you know, which I was--
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:06.800]   - I like it, you don't think that he has a vision?
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:08.840]   - I think, here's my thing, I think he has a vision.
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:10.280]   It's creepy.
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:13.440]   - I think his vision is not visionary.
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:14.400]   Does that make sense?
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:16.840]   So when you look at Elon's vision,
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:19.360]   he took science and applied it to some things
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:21.320]   that are pretty freaking far out there,
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:23.680]   and he figured out a way to make
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:26.720]   what people think impossible possible
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.800]   in a way that feels very visionary.
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:31.960]   I'm not actually sure Jeff Bezos has done something like that,
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:34.160]   but what he's done is,
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:37.920]   he's managed to do something really hard,
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:41.000]   which is continuously, he's built a reinvention,
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.680]   a reinventing corporation that is highly effective.
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:47.280]   And he knows that that's what he's doing.
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:48.120]   - And he knows that that's what he's doing.
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:48.960]   - And he knows that that's what he's doing.
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:49.800]   - And he knows that that's what he's doing.
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:50.640]   - And he knows that that's what he's doing.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:51.920]   - I think Amazon's brilliant,
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:54.640]   and I don't necessarily celebrate their vision
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:56.440]   'cause it's clear that their vision
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:59.120]   has been Thompson pointed out as Stretecherie
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:04.120]   is to take a cut of all financial transactions in the world.
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:05.520]   - So do you think--
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:09.240]   - But he's very, very, very good at moving step-by-step
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:11.320]   in that direction, and look at these things.
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.600]   So I think Elon and Jeff,
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:15.160]   look, I feel like we're lucky enough
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:17.200]   to have live in a time with two da Vinci's.
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:21.000]   These, at least business da Vinci's,
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.920]   these guys are really interesting.
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:25.920]   - And we've had one in jobs?
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.480]   - We had one in jobs.
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:31.240]   - We had two in Lorraine, Sergey, in their time.
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:32.080]   - Yep, in their time.
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.400]   - You'd have to add in.
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:37.160]   - I would add in Zach.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:40.920]   - Well, yes, Zach's impact on the world certainly is right.
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:43.320]   - I would add in Ev Williams,
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:45.720]   because Blogger and Twitter,
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:48.200]   though he wasn't the only inventor of both,
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:50.040]   he was the tie between the two
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:52.560]   that really changed my world tremendously.
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:56.040]   - You know, he got me to pay five bucks a month in medium.
[00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:56.880]   - Oh, really?
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.040]   - Wow.
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:53:58.880]   - You know why?
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:02.040]   'Cause he, so Barretunde has launched a pay-by
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:06.360]   behind a pay wall, a blog, an activism blog.
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:09.520]   They're starting to put stuff that I want behind a pay wall.
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:10.360]   It's only five bucks.
[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:12.400]   I get all of it for five bucks.
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:15.400]   I think Ev Williams' vision might actually,
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:17.760]   I know we were skeptical that he could do this.
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:19.360]   'Cause he, he said no more as--
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:21.400]   - I'll never bet against Ev.
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:22.240]   - Yeah.
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:24.080]   - And for change of the world twice, in my view,
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:25.480]   I will not bet against him.
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:26.920]   - Look at this is the front page now,
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:28.080]   medium has changed a little bit.
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:28.920]   It's a little different, isn't it?
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:30.520]   - Yeah.
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:34.800]   - You might like, this has become a very,
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:37.160]   I think, compelling publication.
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:39.520]   - Well, I got to put that now.
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:40.680]   Oh, geez, another.
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:45.440]   And this is, these are things I followed, I guess.
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:47.320]   Here, now, oh, here's the members only.
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:49.760]   Let me click the members only.
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:52.640]   This is stuff that I get because I pay,
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.760]   that's five bucks a month.
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:55.680]   - What's the one on the right,
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:57.600]   the Underground World of Magical Resistance?
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:58.440]   Who's that by?
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:00.280]   - Lee Alexander.
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:01.880]   - I'm right about, I don't, you know,
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:04.720]   this is as recommended by staff.
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:07.120]   Wait a minute, sorry for members only, but I am a member.
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:09.240]   Maybe it, does it not know that?
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:10.320]   I'm logged in.
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:13.600]   Oh, my, yes, as member.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:16.120]   Okay, so there you have some issues on that.
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:17.080]   (laughs)
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:19.040]   Few membership.
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:20.680]   - You can pay us five dollars a month,
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:21.960]   the energy we like. - Oh, yeah, so who's?
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:23.040]   - We'll let you read it.
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:24.960]   - So, selling our grief, America's appetite
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:26.040]   for the traumatized.
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:27.520]   So these are members only,
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:30.200]   see more members only stories.
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:32.480]   Shiny car in the night.
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:33.840]   I don't know, you know.
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:35.560]   - I'm not that bored.
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:36.720]   - You're not that bored?
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:37.560]   You have to be pretty good at it.
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:38.640]   - I have a subscription too.
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:41.800]   I'm still, well, like a lot of this stuff feels very,
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:44.960]   very naval gazing.
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:47.720]   - Yes, there's a lot of that, too much of that.
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:50.840]   - And so I'm kind of like, I can,
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:52.280]   - It's a blog.
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:53.280]   - It's bloggers. - Yeah.
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:55.480]   - Blogging was always naval gazing.
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:57.360]   - Right, so I don't need that.
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:00.200]   I get enough of that, I can get that for free.
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:04.120]   I pay for, you know, good storytelling and journalism
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:08.520]   and I pay for actual books and other things.
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:10.840]   - This is interesting,
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:13.080]   audio versions of some of these stories.
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:15.720]   Is that new or?
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:19.160]   - Yeah, I think it's,
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:20.880]   it might be spoken layer.
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:23.360]   They asked me whether they could do one of mine
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:24.560]   from like months ago.
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:26.920]   - Here, let's do one of Stacey, you'll be interested in.
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:29.720]   Everything you need to know about buying an electric car,
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:31.480]   Alison Moody, a multimedia reporter
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:34.000]   who covers sustainability, let's listen, just to see,
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.280]   so would it be a robot or a human?
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:38.640]   - No, I think, if it is spoken layer,
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:39.840]   I'm not sure about that, but if it is,
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:42.080]   then it's a mix, but they often do human.
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:44.960]   - Everything you need to know about buying an electric car,
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:46.520]   there's a lot to know.
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:50.040]   Here's a handy primer by Alison Moody.
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:51.800]   - That's not a human. - Audio versions are available
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:54.000]   only to medium members. - Yeah, it is.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.960]   - Really? - The internet has been buzzing
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:57.360]   this summer. - Do you think that's a robot?
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:59.320]   - The future of electric cars.
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:02.440]   Last weekend, Elon Musk tweeted a photo of the first
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:04.520]   computer that's a computer. - Oh, it sounds so
[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:06.080]   so manufacturing. - But okay, yeah,
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:06.880]   company before. - Well, it's a little
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:08.760]   stilted, it's not friendly.
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:10.680]   - It doesn't sound like a real person, but yeah.
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:12.400]   - It's broadcast voice. - It's a broadcast voice.
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:14.040]   - I hate broadcast voice.
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:15.280]   - What do you mean? - And you know, I never,
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:16.600]   I never hear it anymore. - Broadcast voice.
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:19.120]   - So fantastic. - You're not broadcast voice,
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:20.240]   you're human voice.
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:22.240]   - I have a little bit of a non-sury in me still.
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:23.760]   I can't, I try to issue it.
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:25.920]   - Don't tell if you have Leo, the only thing you have,
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:27.640]   is speaking with a smile.
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:29.840]   - I do that. - You know how to really well.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:31.720]   - Somebody once called me Mr. Smiley, smile,
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:34.120]   I hurt my feelings. - I would do, I used,
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:36.200]   when I was in San Francisco, I did tryouts to be like
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:40.080]   a movie critic on, you know, KRON. - Yeah.
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:41.560]   - And they'd sit me down and have to,
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:44.040]   you have to learn to read the teleprompter, all that.
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:46.000]   They'd say, "Now speak with a smile."
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.320]   And I can't do that. - Wait, what is speaking
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:50.320]   with a smile? - Well, if you talk like this,
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:52.600]   it just feels pretty darn good about life.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:54.520]   - Oh. - It's like, you know,
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:57.520]   those of us who are happy in the world, we smile.
[00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:59.360]   - Is there a, - And the smile comes through
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:02.400]   in our voices. - Is there a female equivalent of that?
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:04.440]   'Cause that's like Garrison Keeler.
[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:06.600]   - You could do it. - Oh yeah, you can try it.
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:07.640]   - Let's do it right now. - Right.
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:10.920]   - Smile while you're talking, like overly broadly.
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:13.760]   Yeah. (laughing)
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:14.600]   Exactly.
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:17.160]   - Like, I don't know.
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:18.880]   - Just read something, it doesn't matter what you say,
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:19.720]   'cause it's just being happy.
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:20.800]   And then every once in a while,
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:22.960]   you just put a little crinkle in your voice.
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:24.880]   - 'Cause you're so dark. - I'm mastered speaking
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:26.040]   with a smile.
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:27.160]   I'm not sure.
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:29.320]   I'm not even 100% sure what it is,
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:31.680]   but I feel really good doing it.
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.160]   - Yes! - Is that close?
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:35.520]   - You did it! - Ah, yes, you did it!
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:40.400]   - Okay, from now on, we're gonna be the happy podcast,
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:42.680]   just talking with a smile. - We should just call it
[00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:44.760]   this week in smiles.
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:47.240]   Everybody's happy on this show.
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:49.440]   Does everybody in the audience wanna shoot us now?
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:51.320]   (laughing)
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:52.720]   Well, that's why when the guy,
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:53.760]   this was a criticism,
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:55.040]   this was when I was doing the site
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:56.760]   and one of my colleagues said,
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:57.800]   "You're aren't Leo, but you're just,
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:59.680]   "Mr., you're too much smiley smile."
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:01.080]   That was his point was,
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:05.880]   if it's unmotivated, happy, smiley voice, it's fake.
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:09.040]   So you have to modulate, right?
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:09.960]   Sometimes, you know,
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:13.720]   but it's good to express emotions in your voice.
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:16.640]   - I'm not bad at that. (laughing)
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:20.400]   - But it needs to be, yeah, exactly, right?
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:23.160]   - Okay, yeah, I can do it.
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:25.720]   - No, I'm genuinely very happy.
[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:28.080]   - You have a happy voice.
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:29.200]   - I'm a happy person.
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:30.680]   - Yeah.
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:32.280]   - Unless it's-- - Stacey for those ass headaches.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:33.400]   - May I ask you a personal question
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:35.080]   based on last week's show?
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:35.920]   - Yes.
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:37.800]   - Have you done the show with migraines?
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:40.880]   - I have a migraine starting right now.
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:44.600]   - Oh my God, I feel so bad for all of you.
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:46.600]   Are you on the Topo Max?
[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:48.600]   This is a little personal now.
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:49.800]   I know, I don't mean to be too personal,
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:50.640]   but oh, Stacey.
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:52.240]   - I just feel so bad for you.
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:54.520]   I do too. - No, don't do that.
[00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:55.680]   It's gonna be fine.
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:59.600]   And actually, a lot of very nice people from the show
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:03.400]   have sent me all kinds of crazy ideas and stuff.
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:06.360]   And not crazy like-- - No, no, but remedies, yeah.
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:07.720]   - Yes, like, nice, crazy.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:08.800]   - Yeah. - Like, oh, I have to--
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.040]   - Hey, if it works, somebody told me,
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.920]   'cause I've mentioned that I've constantly ringing
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:15.000]   my ears tonight, is that if you put,
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.640]   you fold your, interlace your fingers behind your head,
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.360]   but then you use a thumping with one of them
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:24.320]   against the stem of your brain that it will fix it,
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.160]   but it doesn't. - It doesn't.
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.160]   - I think they just wanted you to make a funny face.
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.160]   (laughing)
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:30.760]   Or a funny little gesture.
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:33.120]   - Dean Adele used to suggest fever-few.
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.560]   Have you tried the fever-few, cure?
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.880]   - I have not tried the fever-few.
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.840]   - I think that's an old-timey remedy.
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:43.760]   - Did they know what causes migraines?
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.640]   - No. - They have many thoughts.
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.800]   It's something about, they don't know what causes them.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:49.840]   But they made a lot of strides.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:52.880]   - They know the etiology, the dilution and all that.
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.320]   Yeah. - I just got them.
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.320]   - I just got them.
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:58.440]   And you might argue they're not full migraines,
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:00.280]   but they were to me.
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:04.400]   But when it leave with still prescription,
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.600]   somebody gave me a couple pills,
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.760]   and it just suddenly, it ended.
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.600]   It was muscle-related. - Oh.
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:12.760]   - And so that alone, well, here was the weird thing,
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:16.240]   that alone, knowing that I could finally find something
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.360]   that could relieve it,
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:22.040]   and be all right, the number I got immensely.
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:24.120]   - Well, I would imagine tension or the fear
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:25.520]   of getting it would tell me. - Tension, yes.
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:27.000]   - Probably exactly. - Exactly.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.680]   - My doctor told me to leave his naproxen,
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:32.640]   told me to, no, I can't remember,
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.240]   to take it or not to take it.
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:36.480]   (laughing)
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:39.600]   He said something about it, I can't remember.
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:43.560]   I think he said to take it, but if he actually--
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.160]   - I could deliver Leo.
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.560]   - I think he said to take, 'cause I like ibuprophy,
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:50.040]   he said, well, you should take naproxen instead.
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.360]   But I don't know if this-- - If toxins rough
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:55.400]   on your stomach, it can be, it can be.
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:58.080]   - But I am taking-- - Meditus-related.
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.920]   - 'Cause he said, you know, you only have
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:03.240]   an 18% chance of having a heart attack right now,
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:05.560]   which I thought seemed high, he said, that's pretty good.
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:09.600]   But, it seemed high to me, but he said,
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.840]   but you should be doing a baby aspirin a day.
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:16.200]   And I don't know if that was related to, like,
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.880]   don't take naproxen, so if you have stomach accept,
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.320]   maybe you don't wanna take naproxen
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.560]   and baby aspirin at the same time.
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.400]   I'll have to ask Dr. Mom. - Just pick one.
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.800]   (laughing)
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:26.640]   - Pick one. - By the way,
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:29.280]   since we've talked about Cardia before,
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:31.800]   this is an announcement today, I just put up
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:34.400]   on the Run Down. - This is a health podcast.
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:35.760]   - It has become a health podcast.
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.480]   - We had this Google analytics story,
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:38.880]   we're coming back to that. - All right.
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:39.720]   - All right. - Well, be well,
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:41.400]   we'll just while we're on health for just one more minute.
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:42.240]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.240]   - And we're gonna talk about a little,
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:45.760]   a live core of the maker of Cardia,
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:48.160]   which we talked about, has teamed up with Mayo Clinic.
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:49.000]   - Ooh.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.800]   - To use machine learning to take their incredible database
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:55.880]   of EKGs now and predict.
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.680]   - Wow.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:58.760]   - Yeah, it's fixed.
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:00.600]   - I talked to a serious company.
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:03.120]   - If you don't, Vik and I talked for about an hour a week ago,
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:04.880]   'cause he'd wonder if he was doing something
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:05.720]   off the record for now,
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:07.880]   some not this one, this came out today.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.280]   - I think this is really cool stuff.
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:13.160]   - And I bought one just to have it.
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.200]   I forgot to ask my doc if he would like me
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.680]   to send him EKGs.
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:17.520]   You have to pay.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.920]   - There's 10 bucks a month if you wanna send the EKGs
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.480]   to your physician.
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:22.560]   - Yeah, my-- - I bet your physician
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:23.480]   doesn't want them.
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:24.320]   - I bet he doesn't want them.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:25.160]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.240]   The physicians are the best sales channel.
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:29.960]   There's something called, I think it's Cardia Pro,
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.160]   which is how the physicians use it
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:35.120]   and they can get, you can send it in every day.
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:37.520]   And it has value.
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:39.080]   I also talked about-- - But you've had AFib,
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:41.200]   so you're definitely a candidate for it.
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.600]   You would want this.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:45.060]   Because this could-- - Oh yeah, I was at the
[01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:46.160]   early diagnosis. - Early diagnosis.
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.280]   And yeah.
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.800]   - I have a family member with--
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.240]   - Issues. - Who has it.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:52.720]   And is asymptomatic, doesn't know when she has it.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:54.160]   - Right.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.040]   - With an older family member,
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.040]   so we've been trying to talk her into it.
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.720]   I don't know if my doctor will let me.
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:03:59.920]   It's your body, you could do it.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.320]   - So this is, we mentioned it before,
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:05.280]   one of the few FDA approved kind of devices,
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:08.920]   medical devices, you know, are emerging.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.920]   It's also HIPAA compliant.
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:12.720]   It's really an interesting product.
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:16.200]   And it's cheap, it's under 100 bucks to buy it.
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.520]   The expense-- - You're talking to me
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.000]   if they want to send it to your doctor,
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.320]   you have to pay a monthly fee.
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:25.280]   But you can also just send it to them and they analyze it.
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:27.400]   And I gather that's how they're getting all this data
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:29.200]   that they're going to share with the Mayo Clinic.
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.280]   It's interesting, you must have been in our,
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:34.560]   in the agreement, which I didn't read,
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:38.240]   saying we might be sharing your heartbeat with other people.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:41.720]   And by the way, Stacey may be helping people in the future.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:43.560]   And I'm okay with that.
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:45.480]   - I am too, 'cause my heartbeat's not gonna be.
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:46.840]   (laughing)
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:47.680]   - Okay, fine.
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:48.680]   Well, I was gonna tell you,
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:51.680]   'cause this was from earlier May, I think.
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:56.160]   Did you see that there is an AI that detects AFib
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.560]   using Apple Watch?
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.800]   - Yes, we talked about that.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:04:59.640]   But that's-- - Okay.
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.400]   - Yeah, that's a little experimental.
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:04.600]   But it's, but it's, basically because it has some,
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:07.000]   there's so much data being gathered
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.640]   that the Watch Watch can monitor continuously.
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:12.840]   Here's another interesting one, I'll give you.
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:16.640]   A judge has ruled that pacemaker data can be used
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:19.920]   in an arson trial because the judge said,
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:24.920]   "Revealing your heart rate is not particularly too invasive."
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:28.840]   - Wow.
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.080]   - Although if I were a lawyer,
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:33.600]   I would argue that my clients' heart rate data
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:36.440]   could not be correlated with, you know,
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.280]   actually setting a fire running around
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:40.560]   because it could have been tied to anything.
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:41.920]   - I couldn't watch an exciting movie.
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:45.280]   - So let me read you the story and you can decide, okay?
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:46.120]   - Okay.
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.240]   - Ross Compton, a man from Ohio, was charged with aggravated
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.880]   assault, arson, and urnsterringe fraud
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.600]   based on his pacemaker data.
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:54.960]   Compton told the police that when he saw his house burning
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:58.160]   last year, he calmly packed his bags,
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:01.320]   tossed them at his bedroom window and carried them to his car.
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:04.200]   Authorities got hold of his pacemaker data.
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.200]   By the way, there was other evidence they found gasoline
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.320]   on his shoes.
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:08.320]   - I would hope so, yeah.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.000]   - Yeah, the authorities got hold of his pacemaker data,
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.960]   had a cardiologist review his heart rate,
[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:14.720]   Pacer demand, and cardiac rhythms from that day.
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.960]   The doctor went on record to say it's highly improbable
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:19.360]   when Mr. Compton would have been able to collect, pack,
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:21.280]   and remove the number of items in the house,
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:24.520]   exit his bedroom window, and carry numerous and large,
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:26.320]   heavy items to the front residents
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:29.040]   during the short period of time he's indicated to,
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:31.160]   indicated due to his medical conditions.
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.560]   In other words, his heart is ticker's not up to it.
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:37.040]   Compton's lawyer said, "We take the strong position,
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:39.840]   medical data regarding the inner functions of one's body
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:42.960]   designed to assist a doctor in keeping a patient alive
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:46.440]   should be safeguarded against government overreach."
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:48.000]   As was our-- - All right, so here's where
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.640]   I think Stacy and I will agree.
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:51.200]   - I agree, I agree that that's overreach.
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.040]   - What do you think Stacy?
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:52.880]   - Here's what the judge-- - Totally, yeah.
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:54.200]   - Let me just tell you what the, yeah, but wait,
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:56.720]   the judge said, Judge Charles Pader,
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.720]   "There's a lot of other information about things
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:01.080]   that may characterize the inside of my body
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:03.320]   that I would much prefer to keep private
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:04.960]   rather than how my heart's beating.
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:08.120]   It's just not that big of a deal."
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:11.160]   - That's bull on a stick. - Oh, crappy.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:12.840]   - You can tell if someone's pregnant
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:16.440]   based on their heartbeat, you can tell if you like,
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:19.840]   age-related illnesses, you can tell all kinds of stuff
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:20.840]   from someone's heartbeat.
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:22.920]   - You can tell, you wanna drug them all with my,
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:24.240]   with my a-drug?
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.240]   Doctor, mom, I'm also pointing out--
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:27.240]   - You can tell someone's sexually attracted to you.
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:29.160]   Sorry. - Oh.
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.000]   - I'm not.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.920]   (laughing)
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:35.400]   - But I am saying-- - I'm just looking.
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.880]   - Doctor, mom says in the chat room,
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.880]   that's why law,
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:41.680]   lie detectors are not allowed in court.
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:43.320]   Which, by the way, they measure,
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:45.440]   along other things, heart rate,
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:49.360]   because it isn't necessarily indicative of mental state.
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:53.800]   - And that's one of these things where I think
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:57.360]   we are getting to a point where we have this data
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:58.760]   and we're drawing conclusions,
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:00.400]   but those are not peer reviewed,
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:03.080]   scientifically valid conclusions.
[01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:05.600]   It's correlation, not causation, right?
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:10.600]   And I think it is a really dangerous legal precedent to say,
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:12.320]   one, it's not private,
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:14.480]   but two, that those could be,
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:16.640]   that you should rely on that when,
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.960]   I don't think you should.
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:21.160]   We don't know, we simply do not know enough
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:24.360]   about the human body and how people react.
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:25.640]   - Yeah, so there's that issue,
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:28.200]   and then there's also the invasion of privacy issue.
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:31.120]   Ah, this judge is an idiot.
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:32.640]   (laughing)
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:35.640]   - EFF weighed in, Stephanie Lecombra,
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:36.960]   who's a lawyer there, said,
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:40.280]   Americans, this is actually probably the real quote,
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:41.800]   Americans shouldn't have to make a choice
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:44.480]   between health and privacy.
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:46.240]   We as a society value our rights
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:49.360]   to maintain privacy over personal and medical information,
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:51.320]   and compelling citizens to turn over
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.120]   their protected health data to law enforcement
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:54.240]   and roads those rights.
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:55.120]   That's the key there,
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.560]   making the choice between health and privacy.
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:59.760]   Like, oh, I better not get a pacemaker
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:02.640]   'cause the cops will wanna know what my heart rate is.
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.160]   - Well, indeed,
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.440]   - I'm not gonna get in trouble here politically,
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:08.000]   but yeah, I forget the thousands of people
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.520]   who deregistered to vote in Colorado
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:13.400]   'cause they didn't want their data handed over to the,
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:15.080]   - Yeah, it's really supporting us.
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:16.640]   - People are doing that.
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:17.480]   - Wow. - Yeah.
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.360]   - Colorado, now all but two states
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:21.200]   have denied the request of the voting commission.
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.040]   - Well, they denied it.
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:24.160]   - I believe for some of the data.
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.400]   - Texas just handed it all over.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:28.000]   - Sure they did.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.480]   - My dear governor in New Jersey said fine, I think.
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:34.720]   By the way, Chris, Chris Christie,
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:36.920]   the most unpopular man in America,
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.480]   he was in a Mets game last night,
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:42.200]   and he caught a foul ball, and they booed him for that.
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.480]   (laughing)
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:44.640]   He gave it to a kid. - Give it back!
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.200]   - They still booed him. - Give it back!
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.920]   - You just booed him when we can.
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:48.880]   (laughing)
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:50.040]   You can't win.
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:51.200]   You can't win that.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.680]   You know, I'm almost starting to feel sorry
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:53.800]   for the poor guy.
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:55.680]   - No, no, no, no, no, no. - Don't do that.
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:56.520]   - Don't do that.
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:57.960]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:01.480]   - So apparently I am a doofus for buying
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:04.760]   and liking the Nest IQ cam and gadget said,
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:08.960]   it just reminds us that facial recognition needs to work.
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.560]   (laughing)
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:13.960]   I do, I mean, I do, it's got a six-core processor in it.
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.800]   It's got a 4K sensor.
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:18.960]   The idea of it is it sees what you look like
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:22.280]   and then allows you to say in a database,
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:24.040]   no, that person's okay, that person's okay,
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:26.520]   but if anybody other than those people are in my house
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:30.160]   let me know and gadget's pointing out.
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:33.320]   It doesn't, it's not very accurate.
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.600]   So-- - Ready Leo?
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:35.400]   - Yeah. - Are you ready?
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:37.200]   - By the way, this is Roberto Baldwin, it looks like.
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:40.280]   Yeah. - Oh, you got it.
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:43.160]   Which one is that? - This is the good camera.
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:44.280]   - Stop rubbing like that.
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:45.120]   What is that?
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:47.200]   (laughing)
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:49.040]   - That's just the NetApp though.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.320]   That's the one I told you you should have bought
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:51.640]   Star of the Nest IQ. - Oh, yeah.
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:53.440]   - So can I get it now?
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:54.600]   - Yeah, you can buy it now.
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:55.960]   I think it's $199.
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:59.440]   - Less than the IQ was.
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:00.280]   - Yes.
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:03.720]   - Well, I've already been told I can't have a camera
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:05.360]   in the house anyway, so it doesn't really matter.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.360]   - Well, this one, this is the one you could get
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.600]   because everything's stored to an SD card
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:11.600]   or you can send it to your own server
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.400]   on the property or you can send it to the drive.
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:14.640]   - It does.
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:17.120]   - So, oh, does it text me?
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:21.080]   - It texts you if you see--
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:22.560]   - This is the-- - This isn't the camera.
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:23.520]   You've got the camera.
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:24.800]   Let me see if I can find the camera on here.
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:27.200]   This is the one that just tests the ear quality.
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.360]   - Oh, yeah, this is-- - Oh, you have the presents.
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:29.360]   - I think you saw the welcome.
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.200]   - The welcome.
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:31.440]   - The presence is the outdoor one.
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:33.440]   - Right. - Yeah, their names are cute.
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:35.160]   - See, I made a mistake 'cause I went with Google.
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:37.680]   I thought, oh, well, Nest's gotta have this.
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:39.640]   - See, that's why I called you a doofus.
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:40.480]   - Yep.
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:41.320]   - On air, no less.
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:42.520]   - Yeah, it's all right.
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:43.760]   I'm still sexually attracted to you.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:45.080]   Oops, did I say that?
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:46.600]   - Oh, God. (laughing)
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:47.880]   No, I did that on purpose.
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.640]   I'm joking.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:50.800]   - The entire chat room.
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.840]   - I'm not interested in you at all.
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:56.700]   The camera that recognized your loved ones.
[01:11:56.700 --> 01:12:01.240]   Okay, it's kind of French, happy French song.
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:02.920]   I'm just gonna turn that down a little bit.
[01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:06.760]   - Oh, wait, last week, I said something wrong, you guys.
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:09.840]   Fubaro, when we made fun of my pick last week,
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:11.280]   it is not an Italian company.
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:12.480]   It's a Polish company.
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:15.280]   - Oh, well, that's easy to be fooled, Fubaro.
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:18.720]   - So, yeah, I just, I felt like I had to say that.
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:19.560]   - Oh, that's good.
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:21.160]   - I feel a little bad that we had such fun
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.320]   with the audience like that.
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:25.000]   - Oh, yeah, no, they like it.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.480]   They, except what I call it, the Italian.
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:28.320]   Fubaro.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:29.160]   - Oh, how dare you?
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.040]   - Every press is good press.
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:33.320]   - Yeah, they didn't seem to mind.
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:34.680]   - No, yeah.
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:36.120]   - My Twitter account was fine.
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:38.000]   - The NetAtmo, so do you have the outdoor one,
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.480]   the presence as well?
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:40.320]   - I don't.
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:44.560]   - But you have been using the welcome for a while
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:45.520]   or you just got it?
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:48.120]   - Yeah, no, no, I've used the welcome for a while.
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:49.040]   I've had this for like--
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:51.320]   - You took it down so you could show us.
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.840]   - Well, I took it down a while back.
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:55.640]   But yeah, I've had a NetAt.
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:59.240]   I've had the, I reviewed it like two years ago.
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:01.160]   - So you can, so it does have local storage,
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:03.000]   but you could put it on Dropbox.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:03.920]   - Yes.
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:05.520]   - Oh, so you really do control it.
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:06.360]   I think you're right.
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:07.840]   I think that's probably a good idea.
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:10.360]   It seems to have the same capabilities.
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:11.180]   - It does.
[01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:15.160]   - But you're not putting them on a Google server somewhere.
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:16.000]   - Right.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:16.840]   - Okay.
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:17.680]   - And it talks to lots of things.
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:19.880]   - I don't think it has an echo integration.
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:23.360]   So, but that's because it doesn't go to the cloud possibly.
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:24.920]   - Right, yeah, yeah, that's right.
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:29.120]   - So, now you, I know you wanna do this Google Analytics story.
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:30.840]   Can you hold for one minute?
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:31.920]   - I can totally hold.
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.200]   - Are you having an earthquake in there?
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:34.600]   Everything seems to be jiggling.
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:35.440]   - Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:36.440]   I'm twitching.
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:37.720]   - Oh, okay.
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:39.480]   Sorry, I'll stop.
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:40.960]   - Are you seeing spots or anything?
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:41.800]   Are you okay?
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:42.640]   Everything's okay.
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:43.480]   - Yeah, I'm totally fine.
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:44.320]   - Okay.
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:45.680]   - Is your vision narrowing?
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:46.520]   Okay, okay.
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:49.240]   - I lose vision in one eye when I have my green.
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:50.640]   So I can always see out of the other way.
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:52.200]   - That's 'cause you're going like this.
[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:53.040]   Ow!
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:53.880]   It hurts.
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:54.720]   Ow!
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:57.760]   All right, we're gonna take a break.
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:58.760]   We'll come back.
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.360]   You're still working on your doorbell,
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:02.120]   a story for a wire cutter, right?
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:03.080]   - I know I'm so sorry.
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:04.160]   Y'all will be the first to know.
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:06.520]   - I wanna put in a plug for the Ring Video Doorbell,
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:08.920]   my personal favorite, the one I use,
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:11.520]   the one I have connected in my house.
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:15.880]   The one that I have hooked up to my arrows,
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:17.760]   the Ring Video Doorbell is awesome.
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.760]   You know I use it 'cause every once in a while,
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:22.280]   you'll hear wind chimes come from one of my phones
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:23.560]   if I forget to mute them.
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.800]   That means somebody is walking by my door
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:27.320]   or you'll hear bing, bing, bing,
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:29.440]   and that means somebody's rung my doorbell.
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:32.920]   The Ring Video Doorbell is a doorbell with a camera,
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:35.880]   a microphone, a speaker, and motion sensors.
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:37.640]   It replaces your wired doorbell.
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:39.520]   They have a version that has a battery,
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:42.520]   so you can also replace or put a doorbell anywhere,
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:45.440]   even if you don't have wires.
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:46.920]   It was easy for me to install,
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:49.000]   and it helped that the kit with the Ring Box
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.200]   came with everything I needed,
[01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:52.400]   the screwdriver, drill bits, if you need that.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:55.800]   I did not, a little level.
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:58.960]   And once it's hooked up and paired to your wifi,
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:00.680]   if anybody goes by your front door
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:01.840]   or anybody rings your doorbell,
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.640]   you will be notified wherever you are,
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:06.600]   anywhere in the world.
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:08.600]   It's really a remarkable thing.
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:12.240]   They've actually extended it to include the floodlight cam,
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:13.760]   which is a motion-activated camera.
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:16.840]   It's basically the doorbell minus the doorbell.
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.520]   It has a floodlight attached to it, too,
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:20.040]   that lights up when people walk by.
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:22.440]   You get HD Video Two-Way Audio.
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:25.080]   You'll know anytime somebody just steps on your property,
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:27.560]   you can even see and speak to visitors,
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:29.440]   or set off an alarm,
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:32.680]   'cause the thing has a very loud alarm on it.
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:33.800]   When things go bump in the night,
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:35.560]   you'll immediately know what's going on.
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:39.200]   The Ring Floodlight Cam, and the Ring Doorbell.
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:41.760]   Wall Street Journal's best of CES 2017,
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:42.880]   and now we've got kits for you.
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:45.200]   They call them the Ring of Security Kits.
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:47.160]   Either you get a Ring Video Doorbell,
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:49.960]   you're choice of either one, two, or three floodlight cams.
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:52.520]   You connect it with your favorite smart locks,
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:57.520]   your hubs, I mean, I can actually say to my Echo Home,
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:00.040]   Echo, show my front door, the Ring,
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.320]   I can see through the Ring.
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:03.480]   With Ring, you're always home.
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:05.800]   Deliveries, I know what's going on.
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:09.280]   They have this great program called Ring Neighborhoods,
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:10.400]   where you can see other people
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:11.720]   with Ring Doorbells in your neighborhood.
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:15.240]   They've been doing this in Wilshire Park in LA suburb.
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:19.240]   They put one in 10 homes, got a Ring Doorbell,
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:22.320]   and that reduced in six months,
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:25.720]   burglaries by 55%.
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:27.720]   One in 10, 55%.
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:29.680]   That gave them the idea to do this all over,
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:32.440]   so I can see who else has a Ring Video Doorbell
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:34.280]   in my neighborhood, and if they participate,
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:37.120]   I can see what's going on outside their door.
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:41.680]   So it's a neighborhood watch program powered by Ring.
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.600]   I just love this.
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:47.080]   Take a look at it, go to Ring.com/twig,
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:50.400]   r-ing.com/twig.
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:53.600]   Take a look at the Ring of Security kits,
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:55.800]   get your Ring Doorbell, get set up.
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:58.320]   They have regular Ring kits and Pro kits as well.
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:00.200]   The Pro is the one without the battery slimmer.
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:02.720]   It's got a 1080p camera in it,
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:04.160]   and these, you know, I have to say,
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:06.480]   these floodlight cams are gorgeous.
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:08.480]   You know, I've had floodlights in my house.
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:10.600]   This is much nicer looking.
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:12.480]   Really, really sweet.
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:15.880]   Save up to 150 bucks now, Ring.com/twig.
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:20.480]   We thank him for making this week in Google possible.
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:24.200]   Leo Laport with Stacey Higginbotham from StaceyOnIOT,
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:26.640]   the podcast, IOTpodcast.com.
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:28.640]   She's @gigastacey on Twitter,
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:30.400]   Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:32.640]   at CUNY, the city university of New York,
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:34.680]   blogger at buzzmachine.com.
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:39.040]   He's at work today, but you're soon going somewhere.
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:44.040]   Washington DC to a panel discussion tomorrow morning
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:47.240]   with European members of Parliament and American people.
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:49.680]   I was invited by a former FCC commissioner
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:51.120]   because they're going to try to, you know,
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:54.920]   basically convince Europeans not to regulate speech.
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:55.760]   Good.
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:57.320]   That must be Julius Jannikowski.
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:58.960]   I was like, "Weeler, Jannikowski?"
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:17:59.780]   No.
[01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:00.620]   Cops.
[01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:01.840]   Nope, Susan Ness.
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:02.680]   Oh, all right.
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:03.960]   Oh, old school.
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:06.960]   Going old school.
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:09.480]   My life because I'm dead, there it is.
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:10.320]   I'm sorry.
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:12.280]   (laughing)
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:13.120]   All right.
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:13.960]   What is happening there?
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:15.560]   Google Analytics, I don't even understand
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:17.000]   this article in search engine land.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.560]   It says it's something called ask a question,
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:21.560]   Stacey, you better explain.
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:22.400]   Oh, okay.
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.880]   I just thought this was cool because it's using,
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:26.760]   if you use Google Analytics, which lots of people do.
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:27.760]   Love it.
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:30.760]   All of that data that's on your dashboard right now,
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:32.880]   what they're doing is letting you just ask normal people
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:35.240]   questions like how many visitors did I get?
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:40.240]   What percentage increase did I, my site see year over year
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:42.920]   in June?
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:44.320]   And it'll just tell you.
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:47.000]   Wow.
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.080]   That would have to look up the data and everything.
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:48.920]   Yeah.
[01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:49.760]   Right.
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.080]   So it's like kind of like search.
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:54.280]   But for business.
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:56.400]   But I mean, it's your own data.
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:57.240]   It's your own data.
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:58.800]   It's normal language, yeah.
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:18:59.920]   Right, natural language.
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:01.120]   Natural language, there you go.
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:04.240]   That's the one, that's the word I was looking for.
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:06.560]   So like it's the four, it's what?
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:08.960]   And how many types of questions?
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:13.200]   So what is my traffic in June of 2016?
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:16.240]   And then how many visitors came to my site
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:18.120]   from Twitter last month?
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:22.160]   So how else do you see this being used?
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:24.800]   I just, I think about, so this is to me,
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:27.520]   what this is indicative of is voice becoming
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:31.320]   such an accepted user interface to cycle through
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:35.200]   the massive amounts of data that we have available to us.
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:39.480]   And honestly, I'm surprised, I'm surprised it took
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:41.640]   Google this long because they have such expertise
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:44.680]   in this area, but I also see something like this.
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:49.680]   If I were Tableau or some sort of popular ERP software,
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:53.920]   I would be tying my data back ends with things like the Echo
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:57.400]   in building these types of natural language voice interfaces.
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:19:58.960]   Yeah.
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:02.560]   'Cause that's, this is this kind of data,
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:05.040]   having it available, like think about anytime
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.240]   you're in a meeting and you're like,
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:09.840]   oh man, what was our revenue from this point?
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:12.960]   And you're trying to figure out like brainstorm stuff,
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:15.880]   having something that you could just ask and give it to you,
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:18.320]   that's great, that is what computers do.
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:20.000]   That would be so awesome.
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.480]   So I was excited by this.
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:24.120]   Echo, how many uniques did we have last week?
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:25.880]   Things like that would be so useful.
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:27.040]   Yeah.
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:30.200]   I'm looking on our site, I don't see where I would do that,
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:31.600]   but maybe something like that.
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:36.600]   It says it's coming to the desktop for the first time,
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:39.320]   on the mobile app users will also be able to use voice
[01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:41.280]   to surface data in Google Analytics
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:44.360]   after clicking on the Analytics Intelligence icon.
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:45.800]   Oh, okay.
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:49.360]   And it will be available on desktops as of Wednesday
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:51.240]   and the asking a question functionality
[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:52.880]   will start rolling out over the next few weeks.
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:55.120]   Well, there you go, that's why I don't see it.
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:58.400]   But I will soon, that's fun, I'm gonna play with that.
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:20:59.240]   I'll give it.
[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:03.320]   I just think, I mean, I'm kind of enterprising, so, you know.
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:06.520]   I'm not, I'm really down market.
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:10.320]   But apparently, according to Amazon,
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:14.640]   I should wear more more bug repellent in pregnant clothing.
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:15.480]   So I'm going.
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:16.680]   Hey, you know, Zika's a thing.
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:18.320]   Do you want me to turn on the lights in this room?
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:19.160]   'Cause--
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:20.000]   No, I take it dark, but it's--
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:20.880]   I can't like it.
[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:21.960]   It's moody.
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:24.160]   It's moving the war.
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:25.560]   Stacey noir.
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:27.840]   Stacey, after dark.
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:29.840]   Like the least noir person out there.
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:31.560]   (laughing)
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:35.080]   Google says it doesn't underpay women,
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:38.480]   and we don't have to tell you, we know this.
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:41.440]   This is a federal judge has actually agreed,
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:43.960]   as limited the information
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:46.600]   the Labor Department can request.
[01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:48.560]   Remember, Google refused to give this information.
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:50.880]   A federal court moved on Friday to spare Google
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:54.520]   from turning over information about
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:57.040]   how well it compensates women.
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:00.120]   Is it not passing it over worse PR than passing it over?
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:02.320]   And I don't get this.
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:06.080]   If you're paying attention, I think lately--
[01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:09.520]   There's so many more egregious things happening
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:10.760]   to women in the tech industry.
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:12.880]   Maybe it's like, eh, that's right.
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:13.720]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:16.520]   This may be a good time just kind of look over there.
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:21.160]   Well, and an important thing that's going to make
[01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:22.000]   a difference here.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.840]   So, Dr. Chai tweeted this out today,
[01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:28.400]   is the AP Computer Science Test Story.
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:29.560]   Isn't that great?
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:30.880]   I am so-- It's so good.
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:33.320]   Excited. I hope it's meaningful.
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:35.560]   I tweeted it as well.
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:39.280]   Turns out that, and they think it's the Hour of Code
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:41.600]   and Code Academy and all of this,
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:47.600]   push to get more young people involved in coding.
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:49.280]   Let me see if I can find the--
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:50.720]   It's on the rundown.
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:51.760]   Yeah, I also-- Here it is.
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:52.600]   AP.
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:57.400]   Female, Black, and Latino student participation
[01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:02.200]   in the AP Computer Science Exams
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:06.160]   has more than doubled in the past year.
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:09.200]   More than 29,700 women or girls really took
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:11.560]   an AP Computer Science Exam in 2017.
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:14.320]   That's a 135% increase.
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:20.440]   And 10 years ago, so 29,700, this year,
[01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:23.680]   10 years ago, 2,600.
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:25.360]   Amazing. Great.
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:26.240]   Still not enough.
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:28.960]   Yeah. But Black and Latino participation,
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:34.200]   170% increase, more than 22,000.
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:35.560]   That doubled. That's taking.
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:37.480]   So, how many past?
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:39.320]   Well, that-- No, don't take it.
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:41.320]   No, it's not.
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:42.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:43.560]   Stay easy.
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:46.240]   No, there's a lot of effort to get kids
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:49.400]   who are not necessarily prepared to take it.
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:52.400]   This is really-- So, ladies, they took the-- really?
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:53.920]   OK, I went to a few questions.
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:54.920]   That's a good question.
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:56.320]   Super competitive. Yeah.
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:59.120]   And I'm not trying to be a total jerk,
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:02.640]   but there was tremendous AP tests
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:04.080]   for a frigate badge of honor.
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:05.840]   So, what you could be seeing is merely
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:08.200]   the push from the schools to get these kids to take them,
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:11.280]   as opposed to a genuine interest.
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:12.960]   And there's certain-- and it could also
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:15.680]   be a rise in the number of AP Computer Science
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:17.960]   classes out there, which would make a lot more sense.
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:19.480]   Because it is.
[01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:21.640]   I'm not-- again, this is not a negative thing.
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:24.760]   I'm just kind of like, yeah, a lot of kids took a test.
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:29.320]   So, here's my question for both of you.
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:32.400]   Do we ever get to a point where we have a surplus of programmers?
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:34.000]   We've been in this terrible shortage.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000]   Is there a point where we could-- over to your point states
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.560]   that we could overdo sending kids to teach programming,
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:41.400]   and then there's not the jobs for them?
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:43.520]   Is that ever possible?
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:46.760]   I think the type of programming skills,
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:48.400]   like the basic programming skills,
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:51.160]   that'll eventually-- everyone will know
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:52.440]   how to do it for the most part.
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:55.520]   I don't think this is really about making more computer
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:58.040]   scientists as just making more diversity
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:24:59.480]   in computer scientists.
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:00.280]   Oh, I agree with that.
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:01.320]   No, no, no, I'm talking about it.
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:02.880]   I'm just talking in general.
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:04.880]   Could we make a mistake pushing-- because basically, we
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:07.360]   say that every young person out there on the world
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:09.480]   was going to say, in plastics, young man, it's programming,
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:10.720]   young woman.
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:12.360]   And everybody should be programming.
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:16.480]   Do we get to a point where, like, lawyers and MBAs?
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:18.080]   Actually, we don't need as many as we thought.
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:18.720]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:20.200]   And I'm not a fan of saying--
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:21.640]   I actually disagree.
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:23.880]   When President Obama said he thought his daughters
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:26.280]   ought to have studied coding, and then everybody--
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:28.120]   he actually said everybody should study coding.
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:30.880]   I don't think that that's actually true anymore than everybody's
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:33.640]   such study woodworking or plumbing.
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:35.360]   Is it a way of-- I'll kind of--
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.960]   We would say--
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:38.440]   Go ahead, Stacy.
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:39.600]   Oh, I was going to double-sabricate.
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:40.440]   I don't know.
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:43.560]   We say that everybody should learn how to read,
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.680]   and everyone should learn basic math.
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:48.400]   And I think coding may become part of that,
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:50.520]   because it's going to become kind of the lingua franca
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:52.240]   of a tech society.
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:55.640]   So I think having a basic understanding of that
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:57.560]   is actually probably really good.
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:00.440]   Do they need to be awesome programmers?
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:01.680]   No.
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:04.000]   But understanding it, yes.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:04.640]   Yeah.
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:08.280]   And actually, this AP test was really a very fundamental computer
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:10.160]   science test that they're talking about.
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:10.520]   Kind of--
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:13.080]   Oh, and I should also note, because someone did point it out,
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:15.160]   and they're right, you can score from a one
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:16.480]   to a five on the AP test.
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:18.800]   And there is technically no pass fail.
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:21.040]   But if you don't get at least a three--
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:22.040]   Well, the idea is that--
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:22.800]   I'm going to call you a failing.
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:26.040]   Actually, by the way, there's a lot of controversy,
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:27.600]   I think, over the AP system.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:28.360]   AP test, yeah.
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:30.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:31.080]   I did not vote.
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:34.800]   I was not a freshman ever, because I got credit
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:37.320]   for all of my classes taking AP tests.
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:38.320]   Wow.
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:40.240]   That was really impossible to get credit for.
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:42.320]   You must be smart.
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:44.640]   Yeah.
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:46.720]   The Atlantic had an article a few years ago.
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:47.520]   Never a freshman.
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:49.680]   That's your biography title.
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:50.680]   Never a freshman.
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:51.280]   Yeah.
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:52.560]   AP classes are a scam.
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:55.080]   The college board earns over half of all its revenue
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:56.440]   from the courses.
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:57.560]   Yes.
[01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:59.000]   And this is 2012.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.160]   But this has been going on for some time.
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:02.600]   And there's definitely some thought
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:04.360]   that this whole AP thing.
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:06.760]   And the kind of pressure that you were put under in school
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:11.280]   to do it, Stacey, is really a profit center for the college
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:12.920]   board more than anything else.
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:14.680]   I was like, I'm a typical girl.
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:17.200]   We're we're overachievers.
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:18.200]   That's what we do.
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:20.120]   That's what we do, man.
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:23.000]   I don't know if coding--
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.080]   I mean, look, I love coding.
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:27.480]   And I encourage people who are interested in it, absolutely,
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:28.080]   to pursue it.
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:30.400]   And I especially encourage parents
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:33.280]   with daughters who are interested in math and coding
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:36.840]   and science and technology to strongly encourage them.
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:39.480]   I think it was a wonderful call on Sunday
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:43.160]   on the radio show from an aunt whose eight-year-old niece
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:44.640]   had gone to code camp.
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:47.040]   And she said, what do I do next?
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:49.760]   How do I-- she talks about it all the time.
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:51.280]   That's great.
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:53.280]   But I don't know.
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:56.080]   I think that there's a lot of kids who--
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:58.680]   pushing them into coding classes just going to--
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:00.280]   But I think learning the fun--
[01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:02.560]   I'm not saying they have to do it for the rest of their lives.
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:05.160]   But I didn't love trig.
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:07.520]   But you have to know how to do it.
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:08.000]   Do you?
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:08.520]   So--
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:09.240]   Do you really?
[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:10.240]   I'm not really-- no.
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:12.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:12.920]   No, I don't.
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:13.560]   I love it, too.
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:14.640]   And I love algebra.
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:16.600]   But I don't think I've ever--
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:17.640]   OK, algebra is different.
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:18.920]   That's like algebra thinking.
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:21.120]   That's a whole way of solving problems in the world.
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:24.160]   But trig is used in coding.
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:26.720]   You actually computer scientists use trig a lot.
[01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:28.240]   Oh.
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:30.120]   Because, well, if you're moving stuff around,
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:32.960]   you've got to understand--
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:33.480]   vectors.
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:35.200]   --x, y, and vectors and all that stuff.
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:38.720]   But for computer graphics, trigonometry is a necessity.
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:41.920]   But I can't think of any other--
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:42.920]   Carpenters?
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:44.200]   What are you saying, John?
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:45.680]   Who uses--
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:48.240]   He's saying it just makes paths in your brain,
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:51.080]   like one of those woodborer ants.
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:51.560]   Got it.
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:52.760]   Yeah.
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:56.640]   No, that is the argument, by the way, for teaching math.
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:59.120]   When a kid says, like you said, I'm not going to ever use
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:28:59.480]   algebra.
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:01.320]   No, but you're learning a method.
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:02.600]   You're learning a method of learning.
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:04.440]   You're learning a method of rigorousness.
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:06.200]   That is the argument for it.
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:07.680]   Math is really useful.
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:09.120]   Like, basic math is--
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:12.920]   Like, I got my first job as a journalist.
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:13.880]   I kid you not.
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:16.480]   The question they asked me that clinched the deal,
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:19.120]   they were like, do you know the formula for percent change?
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:19.560]   Oh.
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:22.160]   And I looked at them like, are you kidding me?
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:23.400]   And then I was like, of course I do.
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:25.040]   And they're like, you're hired.
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:26.680]   I agree with that.
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:29.240]   And I'm sure Jeff does too more and more.
[01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:31.680]   If you don't know statistics and probability,
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:35.080]   you should not be a journalist.
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:38.480]   Because those kinds of fallacies can really bite you.
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:38.960]   Yes.
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:40.560]   Yes, our numeracy is very bad.
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:41.120]   We numeracy.
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:42.760]   That's the word.
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:44.480]   Numeracy.
[01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:46.280]   All right, what else?
[01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:48.640]   Google is using-- oh.
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:50.080]   We didn't do it last week.
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:52.320]   Do you want to do the Amazon AI that's
[01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:53.600]   designing phone cases?
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:56.040]   I forgot to do it last week.
[01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:56.760]   Have you seen that?
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:59.760]   Is this the ugly phone case guy?
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:05.920]   So Amazon has been doing an experiment
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:12.920]   to design phone cases using artificial intelligence.
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:16.640]   And it's actually-- you can buy these cases on--
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:17.440]   what is the name of it?
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:20.000]   My phone case, something like that.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.440]   My handy design, that's it.
[01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:24.400]   My handy design.
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:27.080]   Handy is the German word for mobile phone.
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:28.240]   Oh, my handy-- I get it.
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:29.160]   My handy design.
[01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:33.160]   All right, so here are some of the designs
[01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:37.880]   that are on Amazon designed by a computer,
[01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:40.640]   adult diaper worn by an old man with a crutch cell phone
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:42.800]   cover case.
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:44.400]   I'll get you not.
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:47.680]   The toilet paper tube collection cell phone cover case.
[01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:51.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:52.960]   Oh, no, let's move on.
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:55.840]   Oh, no, let's move on.
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:59.160]   Some of these old woman with asthma inhaler cell phone
[01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:03.960]   cover case worried teenage girl in bedroom with pregnancy
[01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:06.560]   testing cell phone cover case.
[01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:08.040]   So wait, how did they--
[01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:09.120]   This is my favorite.
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:09.640]   Whoa.
[01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:10.440]   This is my favorite.
[01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:11.400]   This is for you.
[01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:14.000]   Cheese wheel on-- it says baddie,
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.120]   but I think they mean body instead of table.
[01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:19.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:22.040]   Did it just take any phone throw there was out there?
[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:23.040]   Or how did they--
[01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:23.680]   I don't know who's standing.
[01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:24.680]   I'm not the right--
[01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:25.680]   I don't know.
[01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:26.680]   I don't know.
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:27.520]   I don't get it.
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:28.160]   I don't know.
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:30.560]   But it makes for good--
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:31.640]   But I think maybe--
[01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:32.160]   It's a pop-up question.
[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:33.160]   This is a good case.
[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:40.640]   Cheese wheel on body instead of table.
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:43.520]   Oh, oh, I definitely want the galvanized steel wheelbarrow
[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:46.680]   card isolated on white cell phone case.
[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:47.880]   No, I don't know.
[01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:53.660]   I guess what happened is they let loose something
[01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:57.520]   that would just take any image and offer them for sale,
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:31:59.960]   whether anybody would want them.
[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:02.840]   And then maybe they didn't sell any.
[01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:03.200]   Or maybe--
[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:04.520]   I imagine they did not.
[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:04.520]   Or maybe.
[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:05.680]   So a lot of--
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:06.180]   They did.
[01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:07.480]   Some of them.
[01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:08.680]   Maybe.
[01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:11.240]   The cheese wheel, I could totally see my friends sporting them.
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:13.120]   Yeah, I think that's pretty funny, actually.
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:20.240]   Oh, I had the best sandwich, the street food in New York.
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:20.740]   Oh, yeah?
[01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:21.740]   Tell us about it.
[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:24.560]   A place called Baked Cheese House,
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:27.000]   house H.A.U.S. German spelling.
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.760]   And they're on this-- in New York now,
[01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:31.760]   on 34th Street for a few weeks, you'll have these sheds.
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:34.520]   And it was raclette cheese.
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:39.720]   And then slice of pursuit on the beautiful bread.
[01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:42.040]   And then another little just dom of cheese on the top.
[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:43.200]   I took a picture of it that someone--
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:45.200]   Why are you bringing this up?
[01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:46.360]   I have no idea.
[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:47.360]   Cheese wheel.
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:48.200]   Cough naked man with cheese.
[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:50.040]   Cheese wheel.
[01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:50.600]   Cheese wheel.
[01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:52.140]   For a chance to bring it.
[01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:53.340]   Yeah, I see it as half cheese wheel,
[01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:55.580]   be melting onto my sandwich.
[01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:57.060]   And I want one right now.
[01:32:57.060 --> 01:32:59.540]   I've often called this the most intellectual show on Twitch.
[01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:03.020]   But now I'm going to call it the most discursive show on Twitch.
[01:33:03.020 --> 01:33:04.620]   It's just better than Taco Bell.
[01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:06.100]   I will grant that.
[01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:08.060]   It's like Mr. Toad's wild ride.
[01:33:08.060 --> 01:33:09.940]   We're just--
[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:11.260]   There's the summer.
[01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:13.860]   There's not a whole lot of exciting news.
[01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:14.580]   Well, wait.
[01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:15.820]   How about this?
[01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:19.420]   Facebook executive and former journalist Campbell Brown
[01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:23.620]   says, we're launching a new subscription product.
[01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:26.280]   This is almost exactly the same time
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:27.720]   as we talked about this last week,
[01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:31.060]   as the big publishers went to Congress looking
[01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:34.300]   for an antitrust exemption so they could collude
[01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:38.000]   and negotiate with Facebook and Google.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:38.500]   So--
[01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:39.460]   Yeah, the announcement's going to be cool.
[01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:42.340]   But they have-- I wasn't allowed to say--
[01:33:42.340 --> 01:33:43.980]   Oh, you've known about this.
[01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:45.420]   Not because of the relationship I have with Facebook,
[01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:47.440]   because I went to a Facebook event, which
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:49.800]   was off the record with publishers.
[01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:52.680]   But the publishers have been asking for this for a long time.
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:54.360]   Finally away from the monetize.
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:56.600]   Because people basically-- people
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:58.360]   like the Wall Street Journal have been just basically
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:01.400]   giving Facebook content without any way to monetize it.
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:02.800]   Is that what they--
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:04.900]   Well, it's really more about the funnel.
[01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:06.280]   It's really more about saying--
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:08.240]   it's not that you're monetizing the content on Facebook
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:09.720]   and saying that if somebody comes along
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:11.520]   and they happen to like a lot of your stuff,
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:13.880]   then you ought to be able to pitch them a sub at that point.
[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:16.200]   You also ought to be able to cut them off if you say, OK,
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:17.920]   we don't allow you to read that many stories.
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:19.280]   So the rules that exist.
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:21.640]   And what it will do is if you want to buy the Wall Street
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:24.680]   Journal, it will send you to the Journal site.
[01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:26.200]   The Journal will close the transaction.
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:28.760]   The Journal owns all the consumer information about this.
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:30.920]   So it's really a way to get down the funnel.
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:32.960]   And publishers have been begging for this a long time.
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:36.520]   I talked to a major, major publisher yesterday who said
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:40.800]   that Facebook did a good job of listening to what
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:43.000]   the publishers wanted and fed it back.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.720]   Now, the only fear other publishers have
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:47.480]   is those that aren't dependent on pay walls say,
[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:48.400]   that doesn't help us.
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:49.960]   We still want advertising.
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:51.440]   Don't go too overboard in thinking
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:53.240]   that solves all the problems of media.
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:56.000]   That's just those big guys who can afford to have pay walls.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.080]   Nevertheless, it shows they're trying to listen.
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:34:59.960]   They're trying to do things.
[01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:01.960]   I think it's a fine and dandy thing.
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:04.680]   And I think AMP has included a pay wall consideration of that
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:05.080]   as well.
[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:06.880]   So they're finally a parody on this.
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:13.160]   Let's do some more Amazon stuff.
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:15.360]   How about real quickly Amazon has also
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:18.280]   been rumored to be launching a messaging app, which I think
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:22.720]   is really smart, capitalizing on Google's complete inability
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:26.040]   to figure out what the heck it's doing in messaging app.
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:28.960]   Their messaging is as bad as their ability
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:32.120]   to connect people on the stupid echo for their communications
[01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:32.640]   effort.
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:32.920]   Maybe.
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:34.080]   It's going to fail.
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:34.840]   Yeah.
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:35.800]   I don't have--
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:37.200]   Amazon has done a social place to be.
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:39.560]   I don't connect to people on Amazon.
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:40.640]   Well, but what if--
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:42.440]   OK, so what if you just said somebody out?
[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:44.880]   But the app-- yeah, you're right, I guess.
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:48.600]   The thing is you'll be able to shop with it, of course.
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:52.600]   I think-- here's what I think.
[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:55.880]   We've talked about line, which is huge in Japan.
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:57.240]   WeChat, which is huge in China.
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:36:01.000]   And they are used to do everything in these countries.
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:01.680]   And no one is--
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:02.760]   There you've got a point.
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:06.880]   Nobody is really trying to create that kind of app
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:07.640]   in the United States.
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:09.440]   I don't know why.
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:12.680]   It says there's a lack of competition there.
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:13.560]   Maybe, yeah.
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:15.200]   Because, yeah, it's true.
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:18.640]   Part of the problem with messaging apps is there's just
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:19.560]   so many of them.
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:21.200]   The market's so fragmented.
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:23.600]   If you could own the market, though, as WeChat and line
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:25.560]   do in their respective countries,
[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:28.480]   you can buy train tickets on WeChat.
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:30.840]   You also have the advantage in China
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:32.240]   that a lot of people don't have computers at all,
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:34.160]   but they have smartphones.
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:36.640]   Well, there's also maybe a cultural thing.
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:38.440]   We have this kind of weird cultural thing
[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:40.240]   about selling out.
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:41.920]   There are some people who-- not everybody.
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:46.360]   But you don't advertise things to your friends.
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:48.680]   I mean, I even feel weird passing on affiliate links,
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:49.440]   to be honest.
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:50.440]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:51.680]   What's that called?
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:56.880]   So it may just be like, we talk about different things.
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:57.440]   I don't know.
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:05.760]   OK, so this came from a site called AFTVNews.
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:09.920]   And they have a graphic.
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:12.480]   Apparently, Amazon's begun surveying customers
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:14.200]   to gauge what features or interests.
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:17.080]   They have a graphic from the survey
[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:20.440]   one of the customers passed along.
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:23.160]   Everything you've always wanted in a messaging app.
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:24.160]   So here's what it says.
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:25.040]   Everyone's on it.
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:27.560]   Reach all your friends just using their name.
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:29.080]   No numbers needed.
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:31.200]   That does sound like the broken system
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:33.520]   that the echo uses.
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:34.800]   Keep private and secure.
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:36.520]   It's got encryption built in.
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:39.560]   All chats are automatically encrypted.
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:44.040]   Works everywhere-- desktop, mobile, iPhone, or Android.
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:45.840]   Great for groups with app mentions,
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:47.880]   fast photo sharing and video chat,
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:49.280]   group messaging is easy and fun.
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:51.720]   High quality voice in video calls.
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:54.520]   Amazon obviously is working on something like that,
[01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:55.880]   with the echo.
[01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:57.920]   Call a friend one-on-one or get on a group call.
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:59.680]   It's always free.
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:03.400]   And of course, the obvious stickers, emojis, animated gifts,
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:06.480]   filters, they've got games, challenge,
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:09.960]   friend gen groups to games, customize chats
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:12.160]   with color coding or add nicknames.
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:15.800]   Share your location, listen to music, order food together,
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:18.160]   split a bill, and a lot more.
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:19.880]   And I think this is really for Amazon.
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:21.920]   This very last one is the most important thing.
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:23.080]   Chat with businesses.
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:24.880]   Get super service on your terms.
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:25.880]   Make reservations.
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:28.640]   Check on your orders and even shop.
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:31.120]   So you're right, though.
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:34.360]   I mean, you've got to get critical.
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:36.200]   Don't you have to get critical mass for this to work?
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:38.320]   Your friends have to use it.
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:39.360]   Right.
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:42.440]   That's always the challenge for messaging.
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:44.640]   Well, Apple has this advantage because everybody who
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:47.680]   uses an Apple device uses Apple's messages, right?
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:49.800]   It's just not cross-platform.
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:53.480]   But Apple, I think Apple could do a lot of this stuff.
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:54.320]   They've talked about--
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:56.320]   Yeah, but Apple likes privacy, remember?
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:58.040]   Yeah, and that's the problem for them.
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:01.840]   And then on an Android device, you can pick a third party
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:03.200]   app as your SMS app.
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:04.880]   So you'd have to somehow convince everybody
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:08.080]   to download it and make it their SMS app.
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:09.440]   Then it could be almost universal.
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:12.680]   All right, maybe this is going to be a challenge.
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:16.920]   Yeah, I mean, they may do it, but I'm not--
[01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:18.320]   Oh, sure, they will do it.
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:20.680]   But whether it'll succeed or not.
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:22.120]   How much money will it take?
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:23.600]   Right.
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:25.720]   And there are things they failed.
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:26.440]   Oh, many.
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:29.440]   Look at-- you know what the classic example of the fire phone?
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:30.800]   Right.
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:32.240]   Big flop.
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:34.240]   I am-- I tried to get this, but I couldn't.
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:36.600]   Now, I should mention our sponsor is Blue Apron,
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:37.720]   is one of our sponsors.
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:40.920]   Amazon is doing something very similar.
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:42.520]   They call them Amazon meal kits,
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:44.440]   but you have to be in a certain area.
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:46.720]   When the word of this came out, Blue Apron
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:50.760]   stocked tumbled because everybody's afraid of Amazon
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:52.360]   getting into their market.
[01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:57.640]   So this looks so much like a Blue Apron card.
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:39:58.480]   Oh, wow, it does.
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:01.280]   They could have stolen this from Blue Apron, right?
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:02.320]   And it's the same idea.
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:06.400]   You get all the ingredients.
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:09.240]   I wonder if they'll be using the whole foods.
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:10.680]   Oh, no.
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:11.720]   Well, so--
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:14.480]   The prices are more expensive, I have to say.
[01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:17.200]   17 different meals, not nearly the range.
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:21.840]   And they offer-- the prices start at $15 up to $19 per meal.
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:25.600]   So-- but of course, Amazon can control that price.
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:27.800]   That's pricey, I think.
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:29.200]   That is pricey.
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:31.800]   Although with Blue Apron, because they're, quote,
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:33.440]   unquote, "negotiating with growers,"
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:35.240]   doesn't that help reduce the--
[01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:37.240]   I mean, there's a whole foods markup
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:40.040]   you've got to take it beyond just the foods.
[01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:40.720]   Right.
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:43.920]   Now, I feel like Blue Apron has the logistics down.
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:47.120]   They've put a lot of energy into those.
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:48.480]   And again, I know they're a sponsor,
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:51.480]   so I don't want to sound like I'm big at it on this.
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:52.760]   There's other companies doing this.
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:53.440]   Hello, fresh.
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:55.600]   There's quite a few.
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:58.080]   I've tried a bunch of meal plan kits,
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:00.760]   but they all have the same problem, which is you have to actually
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:02.200]   make the meal.
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:03.640]   Tarston, yeah, right.
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:04.240]   But you know what?
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:05.640]   I've also tried the ones that was prepared,
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:07.680]   and it's not nearly as good.
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:09.800]   You know there's that new oven out.
[01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:10.440]   Did you see it?
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:11.760]   The Tavala?
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:13.160]   I'm not buying another oven.
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:15.440]   I just bought the June oven.
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:17.440]   Because of you, Tavala.
[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:18.600]   That's a good oven.
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:19.280]   That's a good oven.
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:20.400]   I like the June oven.
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:21.760]   I'm not complaining.
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:23.640]   The Tavala is the $14--
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:27.880]   $14, $400 oven that has a subscription meal plan
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:28.680]   affiliated with it.
[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:29.040]   Oh, no.
[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:30.320]   And it's a steam oven.
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:31.200]   Yes.
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:34.480]   So oh, so oh, that's hysterical.
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:35.320]   Yes.
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:37.160]   So when you buy the oven, you subscribe--
[01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:39.360]   you have to subscribe to their meal plan?
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:40.040]   Yes.
[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:41.680]   And then what happens is--
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:42.280]   you found it.
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:42.920]   It steams.
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:46.160]   You scan it, and it does the steaming.
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:46.960]   So--
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:48.280]   Ta-da-da.
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:51.280]   So this is going to taste like dorm food.
[01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:53.960]   I-- well, the Wall Street Journal review
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:55.240]   said it tasted pretty good.
[01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:56.880]   I haven't tried it.
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:57.360]   So--
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:58.400]   You don't have to cook it.
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:41:59.320]   There is an advantage.
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:01.480]   They do the prep.
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:05.080]   And the meals are like, I think, between $12 and $15.
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:07.160]   But that's kind of--
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:08.800]   I think that a little premium if you're
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:11.760]   going to have it cooked for you.
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:14.960]   I wish I didn't have to buy an oven for it.
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:17.160]   Well, and I have many thoughts on this.
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:18.160]   So--
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:18.680]   Yeah.
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:19.840]   I don't have any more room.
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:21.680]   I already have a June oven.
[01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:23.240]   You're like, Stacy, I already bought another.
[01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:25.240]   Don't tell me about any more of your smart cookery.
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:28.000]   Oh, cookery.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:29.040]   Jeffrey, you're still there.
[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:29.720]   I think we lost--
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:30.240]   You're still here.
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:31.080]   I came back.
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:32.480]   You see me?
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:36.040]   Yep.
[01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:37.800]   So Bixby.
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:38.600]   Oh, right.
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:40.240]   I got it.
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:40.760]   So--
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:41.120]   You got it?
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:41.880]   I got it.
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:42.520]   I got it.
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:44.440]   I have my Samsung Galaxy S8.
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:47.640]   This was the phone made with a dedicated button
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:49.480]   just for the voice assistant.
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:51.880]   For the whole time I've had this phone,
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:55.560]   all it really did was launch some Fakotka Google Now style
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:56.280]   cards.
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:59.480]   Suddenly, the Bixby assistant arrived today.
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:01.000]   She's here.
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.920]   Would you like to hear her?
[01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:03.520]   I would.
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:04.000]   All right.
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.640]   I'm going to play her voice.
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:09.640]   Don't forget to include a specific app or generic service
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:11.960]   name for what you want me to do.
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:15.040]   For example, Google Play Music or Google Maps
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:20.640]   or a general category like music or maps like this.
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:22.840]   So she's given me some choices.
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:23.480]   So what--
[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:25.960]   Just remember to use the app name or service
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:28.240]   and tell me what to do.
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:31.200]   She's more designed around--
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:31.840]   Opening apps.
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:33.400]   Opening apps and giving them a command.
[01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:36.200]   So for instance, open Google Play Music
[01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:39.760]   and play the top charts, open contacts, and find David.
[01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:42.240]   Open messages, show me the latest message.
[01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:45.120]   Open settings, make the display brighter.
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:46.280]   Open Sesame.
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:49.240]   Open Sesame and make my dinner.
[01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:50.600]   Open camera, take a selfie.
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:52.240]   Here, let's try that one.
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:52.560]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:54.000]   I'm still getting tutorials.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.880]   I can work with all these apps.
[01:43:55.880 --> 01:43:58.680]   So let's make sure they're all updated.
[01:43:58.680 --> 01:43:59.800]   OK, update.
[01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:01.880]   I think they are all updated.
[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:03.120]   How many apps do you think you were--
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:04.240]   That's all Samsung apps.
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:06.880]   So it's Samsung email, video player, voice
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:08.800]   reporter Samsung notes.
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:09.920]   It's apps nobody uses.
[01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:10.760]   Although, wait a minute.
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:11.360]   I take it back.
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:15.280]   Facebook, YouTube, Instagram.
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:17.040]   It says, these are in the labs.
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:19.480]   They don't work perfectly yet, but Bixby will learn as you
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:19.920]   use them.
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:21.200]   Try them out now.
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:21.720]   What's app?
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:25.800]   Twitter, Tumblr, Gmail, Google Play Store.
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:27.760]   Oh, so they are-- OK.
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:29.000]   So they are adding some--
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.760]   There are lots of things.
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:31.600]   Take a look.
[01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:35.080]   There are nearly 3,000 different things I can help you with.
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:38.640]   To find out what I'm best at, check out my Bixby and Bixby
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:39.720]   home.
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:43.280]   Show detailed information about my robot vacuum.
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:46.080]   It's one of the commands.
[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:48.760]   Turn off iris recognition in Samsung Pass.
[01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:49.720]   Turn on airplane mode.
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:51.640]   Change the view mode for the SD card.
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:53.480]   It seems very focused on the phone.
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:57.560]   As we interact more, you can gain more experience points.
[01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:01.320]   Move up to higher levels by gaining experience points.
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:04.040]   You can also check my newer looks and participate
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:05.440]   in special promotions.
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:07.800]   What do you think of the voice?
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:09.240]   Mm.
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:10.240]   She says--
[01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:11.800]   Not as friendly, a little more--
[01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:12.040]   A little more.
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:13.040]   --a little more.
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:13.960]   Ready to go.
[01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:15.200]   Oh, there she sounded friendly.
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:15.680]   Yeah.
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:16.160]   Mm.
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:17.720]   That was a smile.
[01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:20.640]   Enjoy free offer from Google Play Music for Bixby users.
[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:24.360]   Get 14 days on us.
[01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:26.760]   Or get your first three months on us.
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:27.880]   Payment info required.
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:28.360]   No thanks.
[01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:29.400]   I already have it.
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:30.160]   OK.
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:32.560]   Press and hold the Bixby key, then tell her what you want to do.
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:33.200]   Let's see.
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:36.320]   Let's see what the robot voice sounds like.
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:37.360]   What time is it now?
[01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:40.760]   All right.
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:42.440]   It's 3.41 p.m.
[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:44.040]   That's the same voice.
[01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:47.120]   That's pretty good for a robotic voice.
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:49.520]   Is there a male voice?
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:50.000]   Yes.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.680]   I'm told-- somebody said yes.
[01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:54.840]   I'm at Bixby levels 0.
[01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:57.320]   So they're trying to gamify it, which is dopey.
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:45:59.360]   Yeah, language is speaking style.
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:00.920]   You want to try the male?
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:01.440]   Sure.
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:02.440]   Yeah.
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:03.800]   Here's the male voice.
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:05.480]   Bixby male.
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:06.000]   OK.
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:12.480]   What time is it now?
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:13.000]   OK.
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:16.240]   It's 3.41 p.m.
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:18.120]   That's fine.
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:23.160]   Level up in Bixby, and you can earn Samsung reward points.
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:25.520]   Just what I need.
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:26.640]   OK.
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:29.320]   So the nice thing is it doesn't directly
[01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:33.080]   compete with Google because it's really more
[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:35.680]   about using the phone, I think.
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:40.680]   Anyway, Bixby is here.
[01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:41.960]   Are we excited?
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:44.880]   At least this button does something.
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:48.240]   Oh, she's listening to me.
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:51.600]   Oh, you know why?
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:59.280]   I-- you can give him a command, which for me is Tilly Hat.
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:03.280]   Tilly Hat.
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:05.280]   It doesn't work.
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:09.280]   You can have a 2 to 4 syllable password.
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:13.280]   Open the gallery app and show me my latest photo.
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:19.280]   I did it, but doesn't say anything.
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:23.280]   Oh, good.
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:26.280]   So that worked.
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:28.280]   Oh, my God.
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:32.280]   Amazon just recommended the best item in the world to me.
[01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:33.280]   You're so--
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:34.280]   She's so bored.
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:36.280]   She's looking at her Amazon recommendations.
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:38.280]   I'm like, I'm playing with the Amazon app still.
[01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:39.280]   I think this is a better app.
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:40.280]   Yeah.
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:41.280]   What?
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:42.280]   Elf earbuds.
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:43.280]   Oh.
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:44.280]   And look at elves ear design.
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:47.280]   So they're earbuds that have elf ears on top of them.
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:48.280]   I like that.
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:50.280]   I am sold, man.
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:53.280]   Oh, they're in stock on July 25th.
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:54.280]   OK.
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:55.280]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:57.280]   Are urban, urban elf earbuds?
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:47:58.280]   Yes.
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:47:59.280]   Yes.
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:00.280]   Wow, they are.
[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:01.280]   They're flesh colored.
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:02.280]   I know.
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:04.280]   Well, some people's flesh colored.
[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:06.280]   Oh, no, that's a good point.
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:08.280]   Oh, that's creepy.
[01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:09.280]   I think it's ugly.
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:10.280]   Yeah.
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:11.280]   Do they have--
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:14.280]   OK, but look at the picture of the person wearing them.
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:15.280]   Yes.
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:16.280]   Oh.
[01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:17.280]   Oh.
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:19.280]   Look at the double taste you would get.
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:20.280]   Oh.
[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:21.280]   OK, I'm buying these.
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:22.280]   See?
[01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:23.280]   It's awesome.
[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:24.280]   OK, I'm buying them.
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:25.280]   All right.
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:26.280]   See?
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:28.280]   Are there Mr. Spock earbuds?
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:29.280]   Yeah.
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:30.280]   Oh, that's a good question.
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:31.280]   A real seller.
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:32.280]   No.
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:38.280]   You know, imagine those with those LED lash things that you bought and then boom.
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:39.280]   You're ready for it.
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:40.280]   Have you ever left yet?
[01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:43.280]   Oh, I ordered them, but I don't have to have them come yet.
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:45.280]   You can freak people out.
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:46.280]   OK.
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:52.280]   OK, when I come on the show with my elf ears and my LED eye brows or eyelashes or whatever.
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:56.280]   I'm going to be very excited.
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:57.280]   I am too.
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:48:58.280]   All right.
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:48:59.280]   Look.
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:02.280]   I think we can say safely that we have covered everything that matters.
[01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:04.280]   We have done everything of notes.
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:05.280]   Everything of the world.
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:06.280]   Google and the cloud.
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:07.280]   Yes.
[01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:13.280]   Net neutrality day of action organizers say 10 million people saw the protest, 2 million
[01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:15.280]   comments of the FCC.
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:16.280]   The FCC has said we're not--
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:17.280]   None of it's going to matter.
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:18.280]   Yeah.
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:20.280]   And the FCC says we're not going to show you any of those comments.
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:21.280]   Sorry.
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:22.280]   No.
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:23.280]   Nope.
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:24.280]   Don't care.
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:27.360]   Hey, but if you send us other comments like about the voting commission, we'll totally
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:28.360]   mail that out to everybody.
[01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:29.360]   Yeah.
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:30.360]   Yeah.
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:31.360]   We'll let you know about those.
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:32.360]   Yeah.
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:35.280]   So, hey, let's have some pics.
[01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:36.280]   Let's cheer up.
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:37.280]   Let's just pick.
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:38.280]   Give me a--
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:39.280]   It's going to be eager for her pics.
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:40.280]   You already-- yes, Stacy's got a pic.
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:41.280]   She's been excited about it all day.
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:42.280]   Go ahead, Stacy.
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:43.280]   OK.
[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:45.280]   Guys, you're going to love it.
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:48.280]   It looks like a breast pump, but it's not.
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:50.280]   Well, that's good to hear.
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:52.280]   There's a lot happening here.
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:53.280]   It's a box.
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:54.280]   There's wires.
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:55.280]   There's wires.
[01:49:55.280 --> 01:49:56.280]   There's things.
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:59.280]   I should probably have plugged it in.
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:00.280]   Oh.
[01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:01.280]   OK.
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:02.280]   Sorry, you guys.
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:03.280]   You go ahead.
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:04.280]   You plug that in.
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:08.280]   You know, I think Stacy, you should wear those urban elf earbuds on the show.
[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:10.280]   I think she's doing it right now.
[01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:11.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:13.280]   It would be certainly interesting.
[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:14.280]   Yeah.
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:15.280]   It would be different.
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:16.280]   Yeah.
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:17.280]   It has a microphone, I think.
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:19.280]   Well, I have a microphone.
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:20.280]   Oh, my God.
[01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:23.280]   Now, Bixby's talking to me.
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:27.280]   This is going to be another thing that's going to listen.
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:31.280]   Help fix thin brows for mature women pro makeup artists.
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:34.280]   Cryptocrosswards for Dummy's cheat sheet.
[01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:35.280]   All right.
[01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:41.280]   So what I have here for us today is Smart Nora.
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:42.280]   What?
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:44.280]   Oh, did I break?
[01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:46.280]   You left Nora at home?
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:49.280]   I left part of Nora in my bedroom.
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:51.280]   Go ahead, get it.
[01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:52.280]   OK.
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:56.280]   While you're getting Smart Nora, Jeff will give us his number of the week.
[01:50:56.280 --> 01:50:59.280]   So we could do the fact that text docs finally beat their record from 2000.
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:01.280]   I think that's boring.
[01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:02.280]   Wow.
[01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:03.280]   Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:06.280]   It took that long to get back up after the crash.
[01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:07.280]   Yeah.
[01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:08.280]   That's amazing.
[01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:09.280]   How about, but I?
[01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:10.280]   OK.
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:11.280]   Go ahead.
[01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:12.280]   I was going to give you a number.
[01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:13.280]   You do another number.
[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:19.280]   Kevin Russe did a really good piece of the New York Times, which he joined scores.
[01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:22.280]   I thought it was about 100 private groups on Facebook.
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:23.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:24.280]   Yeah.
[01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:30.280]   And it was a really well done, intelligent, open and curious piece saying that in this world
[01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:35.280]   where Zuckerberg is trying to go to communities, maybe the answer to the ability is private
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:38.280]   communities where you're not showing off to the world and you're talking to people who share your interests,
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:42.280]   even if they are flat earthers.
[01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:45.280]   So we asked permission to get into all these groups and he got into all these groups.
[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:47.280]   Did he tell him he was a New York Times reporter when he?
[01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:49.280]   Yeah, I think he did.
[01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:50.280]   Yeah.
[01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:51.280]   Yeah.
[01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:54.280]   One told him to go blow off, but the rest of the rest let him in.
[01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:59.280]   And it's really, really interesting piece that again was open to the humanity that's there.
[01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:01.280]   So hats off to you, Kevin.
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:03.280]   I have a number for you.
[01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:04.280]   OK.
[01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:06.280]   22,000.
[01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:10.280]   That's how many people agreed to clean toilets to use free Wi-Fi.
[01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:16.280]   Because they didn't read the terms, purple, which is a company in England that does Wi-Fi
[01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:22.280]   hotspots, decided to just kind of have some fun and add for two weeks a community service
[01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:25.280]   clause into its terms of service agreement.
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:34.280]   22,000 people sign up to perform 1,000 hours of menial labor for the Wi-Fi access, including,
[01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:39.280]   and by the way, purple says purple gets to choose which of these you could do, cleansing local
[01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:47.280]   parks of animal waste, providing hugs to stray cats and dogs, manually relieving sewer blockages,
[01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:52.280]   cleaning portable labs at local festivals and events, painting snail shells to brighten
[01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:56.880]   up their existence and scraping chewing gum off the street.
[01:52:56.880 --> 01:53:00.840]   Just to make sure people were reading this, they did offer a prize for anyone who contacted
[01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:05.760]   the company and pointed out the clause, one person.
[01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:07.760]   One person did it.
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:13.760]   In other words, one person in 22,000 reads the terms of services.
[01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:15.760]   Good gimmick, yeah.
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:17.760]   It was fun, yeah.
[01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:18.760]   Did you get her?
[01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:19.760]   All right.
[01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:20.760]   Stacey.
[01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:21.760]   I did.
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:22.760]   Okay.
[01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:23.760]   You're on.
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:24.760]   Now I've got all my pieces.
[01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:25.760]   There's a lot.
[01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:27.760]   So there's this piece, this piece.
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:29.760]   Still doesn't look like a breast pump to me.
[01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:32.560]   And this is the part that looks like the breast pump.
[01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:33.560]   It comes with its own little--
[01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:35.760]   Oh, it's a nice little felt piece.
[01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:36.760]   Yeah.
[01:53:36.760 --> 01:53:37.760]   Okay.
[01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:38.760]   Wow, wait a minute.
[01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:41.760]   Should we do a game where we guess what that should possibly be?
[01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:43.120]   Let's do it.
[01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:44.120]   What could that be?
[01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:45.120]   I'll make it work.
[01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:46.120]   Let's see all the parts.
[01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:47.120]   She had to go get something.
[01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:48.280]   She had to plug in something.
[01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:49.280]   It comes with a case.
[01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:51.080]   It has a little strip.
[01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:54.760]   She said a name.
[01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:56.080]   It goes on your arm.
[01:53:56.080 --> 01:53:57.080]   It's going to punch Leo.
[01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:59.080]   It doesn't go on my arm.
[01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:04.040]   It doesn't go on your arm, but you could put it on your arm if you wanted to.
[01:54:04.040 --> 01:54:05.440]   Does anybody in the chat room?
[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:09.200]   Any idea what this--
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:10.760]   This is a fist going to come out of it?
[01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:11.760]   Is it a--
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:14.240]   No, so I don't know if you can see it rising and falling.
[01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:15.240]   Is it a bone?
[01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:16.240]   But it fills up with--
[01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:19.080]   It fills up with air or it rises and falls.
[01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:20.080]   Oh, it's rising.
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:21.080]   It's getting bigger.
[01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:22.080]   Does that help anybody?
[01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:25.880]   Is it a figma mama mama or is it a blood pressure measure?
[01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:28.480]   It's see what people are saying in the chat room.
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:30.320]   Is it a heat and pad?
[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:31.320]   Aircast.
[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:32.320]   Is it an aircast?
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:33.320]   It is not.
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:34.320]   It's not a heat and pad.
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:35.320]   It's a hot box.
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:38.280]   It's another oven, grown.
[01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:42.900]   All right, do you guys give up?
[01:54:42.900 --> 01:54:43.900]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:54:43.900 --> 01:54:44.900]   Yes, we could like--
[01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:46.400]   You're like, clearly, we have given up.
[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:48.840]   It is an anti-snoring device.
[01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:49.840]   What?
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:51.200]   No one would have guessed that.
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:52.200]   What?
[01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:53.200]   No one would have guessed that.
[01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:55.840]   Oh, this is the thing that goes under the mattress that lifts you up?
[01:54:55.840 --> 01:54:57.120]   It goes under your pillow.
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:54:58.560]   It goes inside your pillow.
[01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:01.040]   That sleeve that I showed you fits inside your pillow.
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:02.040]   Yeah.
[01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:04.280]   And if you start to snore, it raises your head.
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:05.280]   It does.
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:07.200]   It raises it up to this level.
[01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:08.200]   This is the high level.
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:09.200]   Wait a minute.
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:10.200]   Hold on.
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:11.200]   We're looking at the video right now.
[01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:12.600]   Look at some woman hit a man.
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:14.680]   Yeah, because he's a snorer.
[01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:17.680]   I find women snore just as much as men.
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:19.040]   So I got it because I snore.
[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:20.040]   Yeah.
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:21.040]   Let's see.
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:22.040]   Go ahead.
[01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:23.040]   Show Stacy so we can see what she's doing here.
[01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:24.040]   Okay.
[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:25.040]   Show us.
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:26.040]   Okay.
[01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:29.560]   So this part right here is the speaker and it goes next to your bed.
[01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:30.560]   So that looked like a mouse.
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:31.560]   I thought that was a mouse.
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:32.560]   It does.
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:33.560]   It looks like a microphone.
[01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:34.560]   Oh, sorry.
[01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:35.560]   Microphone.
[01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:36.560]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:37.560]   Okay.
[01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:39.800]   He obviously understands how this works.
[01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:40.800]   Yes.
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:43.400]   So it's a microphone and it detects.
[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:45.120]   It says it detects snoring.
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:49.600]   What it really does, it detects a lot of noise and you can adjust the sensitivity on
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:50.600]   it.
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:52.360]   You can see that.
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:55.560]   And then what else to know about it?
[01:55:55.560 --> 01:56:00.760]   I mean, it's smart only in the sense that it has Bluetooth to talk to the pump, which
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:03.000]   is located in this case.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.000]   Is there an audible?
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:13.640]   So it's audible if you're like laying on your side and I'm going to turn it off because
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:16.040]   it's like how strong is it?
[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:17.040]   Is it strong enough?
[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:18.040]   It's really strong.
[01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:21.480]   So like this is it's deflating right now, but like.
[01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:25.280]   And it lifts you up enough that that's that's enough to stop snoring.
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:26.280]   Yeah.
[01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:30.760]   So the idea the and this I don't know because I am not a doctor and this is something they
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:31.760]   sent me to review.
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:32.760]   I purchased it.
[01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:34.360]   I will be sending it back.
[01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:36.000]   Don't worry.
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:42.360]   But the thinking is that it moves your head enough that it engages your throat muscles
[01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:44.960]   that have relaxed or something.
[01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:45.960]   Right.
[01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:47.400]   Again, not a doctor.
[01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:52.240]   So I have been trying it for a week.
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:54.800]   And sadly, I don't snore every night.
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:58.920]   So we can't figure out if it's changed anything or not.
[01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:01.160]   So I'm not recommending this.
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:05.600]   Clearly you you haven't audibly snored though because you because otherwise you would say
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:06.600]   it's not.
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:08.840]   Well, see this this is this is my issue.
[01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:14.200]   I have audibly snored because I have woken myself up snoring because I am freaked out
[01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:15.800]   when I snore because my husband.
[01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:20.760]   I should say this and I'll say this not just for you, but everybody sleep apnea is a huge
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:25.760]   problem and be undiagnosed sleep apnea, especially in women because doctors often don't believe
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:30.160]   women have this problem is actually can kill you.
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:31.160]   Yes.
[01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:33.560]   So take it seriously.
[01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:40.720]   If you snore or and ask your partner if you wake up suddenly, sometimes or you stop breathing
[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:46.040]   at times, that's a serious condition and a lot of people have it.
[01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:48.960]   I'm just allergic to everything in my bedroom.
[01:57:48.960 --> 01:57:53.360]   So the snoring is like because you can't you're it's because I can't breathe.
[01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:54.360]   All right.
[01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:55.360]   I live in Austin.
[01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:58.240]   It's like the allergy capital of the world.
[01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:01.680]   Anyway, so this is the device.
[01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:05.400]   I can say that I've slept on it and I don't notice it.
[01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:09.520]   It has my husband hasn't woken me up yet and said that I've been snoring.
[01:58:09.520 --> 01:58:12.480]   I have not recorded my my whatever.
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:16.040]   And it doesn't tell you whether whether it inflated during the night or not.
[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:17.680]   There's no record.
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:19.640]   There's no record because there's no app.
[01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:22.000]   Well, maybe there's an app actually.
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:27.280]   So Dr. Mom has said this does not win her seal of approval.
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:30.920]   And send me a link to the Mayo clinics.
[01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:33.040]   These diseases and conditions.
[01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:39.760]   What causes snoring page and it could be your mouth anatomy, alcohol, consumption, nasal
[01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:44.040]   problems, sleep deprivation, sleep position.
[01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:49.640]   So it's typically most frequent last was sleeping on the back as gravity's effect on the throat
[01:58:49.640 --> 01:58:50.800]   narrows the airway.
[01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:58.040]   So that might Dr. Mom confirm this idea that at least for this particular snorer, it could
[01:58:58.040 --> 01:59:00.200]   fix it.
[01:59:00.200 --> 01:59:05.040]   Now the one to worry about is obstructive sleep apnea, which is a serious condition and you've
[01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:07.160]   got to pay attention to.
[01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:08.800]   So any very cool.
[01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:09.800]   Stay safe.
[01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:10.800]   Very cool.
[01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:12.160]   Tell us how it works for you.
[01:59:12.160 --> 01:59:13.160]   I'm thinking.
[01:59:13.160 --> 01:59:15.160]   Yeah, I will.
[01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:16.920]   I guess I've got to record myself.
[01:59:16.920 --> 01:59:21.160]   This is actually one of my challenges is I'm not sure how to really test it because it
[01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:22.160]   feels pretty.
[01:59:22.160 --> 01:59:27.920]   I'm in raw and our chat room says he finds a nice cold glass of water in the face is
[01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:29.920]   very effective for care.
[01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:36.520]   Yes, my husband who is the nicest man, as we all know, he pats me gently on the side.
[01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:39.840]   And so then I'm like, yeah, that's not going to be effective.
[01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:41.880]   I use the elbow and the ribs method.
[01:59:41.880 --> 01:59:43.640]   That's much more effective.
[01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:44.640]   That would be more effective.
[01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:46.880]   He's just like, he pats me and I'm like, yes, do you need something?
[01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:47.880]   I think he's like, you're snoring.
[01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:50.200]   I'm like, oh, yeah, that's very nice of him.
[01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:52.000]   So he wakes you up and stops you.
[01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:53.000]   I think that's good.
[01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:56.880]   Lisa, you just gives me an elbow on the ribs.
[01:59:56.880 --> 01:59:59.960]   You know, I tried for a while is those breathe right strips.
[01:59:59.960 --> 02:00:01.440]   They never worked for me.
[02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:03.160]   It seemed like it did much either for me.
[02:00:03.160 --> 02:00:04.440]   No, it didn't work much for me.
[02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:06.400]   It makes me look like the problem too.
[02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:11.960]   So then I put some dark circles under my eyes and I look like I'm going to the football
[02:00:11.960 --> 02:00:12.960]   game.
[02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:16.040]   You say one more down, two more down.
[02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:21.760]   Well, ladies and gentlemen, I don't really, I was going to save Bixby for my thing in
[02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:24.200]   the week, but it was so dopey.
[02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:27.200]   I didn't really care to do it that way.
[02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:29.200]   I don't want to plug it.
[02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:31.040]   So I think we can just wrap this up.
[02:00:31.040 --> 02:00:32.040]   Is this good?
[02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:33.040]   Yeah, this is good.
[02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:36.000]   So next week, I will hope to see you from Australia at 630 in the morning there.
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.120]   Oh, this is the one where you're going to do it from the Sydney Harbor and we'll see
[02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:41.800]   the bridge and the sunrise in the background.
[02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:43.040]   And I just froze.
[02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:48.560]   And amazingly, Skype will work better down under it.
[02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:50.160]   It's the Coriolis effect.
[02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:51.160]   Yes.
[02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:54.280]   You will find Jeff Jarvis at buzzmachine.com has blogged.
[02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:58.040]   Don't forget all those great books that he writes, including what would Google do, public
[02:00:58.040 --> 02:01:02.880]   parts, geek sparing gifts, Gutenberg, the geek.
