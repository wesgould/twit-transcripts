[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   Coming up on this week in Google, I'm in here in place for Leo Laport, who's off
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.280]   gallivanting through San Diego. We've got Aaron Nukem and Jeff Jarvis joining me.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.400]   We have a lot of fun just chatting about, "Well, we get the earnings out of the way up at the top."
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.160]   Then we talk about AMP, some changes to kind of search that'll make you see a
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.240]   little bit more of what's going on with accelerated mobile pages. Also, the
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.600]   Samsung Galaxy Note 7 announcement was yesterday and we'll talk a little bit
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.960]   about that, about some of the new Nexus rumors. Android Nougat is right around
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.000]   the corner. Comcast is messing with your data on the ISP level, wants to sell it
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.520]   to advertisers, all sorts of stuff that we're going to discuss next on This Week in Google.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.560]   Netcast You Love
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.360]   From People You Trust
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.400]   This is Twit.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.400]   bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by cashfly, C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:13.000]   This is Twig, this week in Google, episode 364 for Wednesday, August 3, 2016.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.640]   Abs of Chipotle. It's time for Twig, this week in Google, Leo Laport out today.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.840]   Actually, it just took off. I think they're going to San Diego for something down there.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.400]   A little bit of sunshine, a little bit of Mexican food. I'm not really entirely sure,
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.560]   but I'm Jason Howell, filling in for Leo, at least doing my best to fill in for Leo.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.240]   And joined by awesome people. As always with this show, I always enjoy coming
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.200]   on to This Week in Google because we get to talk with none other than Jeff Jarvis.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.200]   How's it going, Jeff? Good. I'm glad I'm delighted you're back and I'm going to see
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.600]   what we're going to mess up in your life this time on Twig.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.000]   I was back in the back office with Megan, we share an office and she was like,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.560]   "Just don't break your device with two-factor authentication."
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.480]   For those of you who missed it, yes. Jason, I took one for the Gipper last show,
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.360]   so we're going to see if he could match it this time.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.160]   Hey, all I can say from that is everything's good now and I learned a lot.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.240]   And you have a shrine to Matt Cutts up in your home.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.360]   Yes, exactly. Matt was instrumental to at least pushing it along, so that was really nice of him to do that.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.600]   Also joining us is Aaron Nukem from The Maker Space.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.280]   Where's The Maker Space? Where are you at right now?
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.000]   So I am in lovely, I wouldn't say downtown, Manisha. I'm not actually in downtown Manisha.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.360]   I'm in the industrial park.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.440]   Yes, here at The Maker Space, Manisha Maker Space.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.600]   So I thought it would be nice to have the show from here for once and see how it goes.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.160]   Yeah, right on. And behind you, you've got some sort of laser-y thing that totally
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.640]   attracts my eyes to it. Yeah, so that's actually the sign from our laser maze.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.800]   So we set up this big 8-foot by 16-foot laser maze and you can crawl through it, kind of a
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.840]   mission-impossible style to try to get the jewels at the end or whatever you're trying to do.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.280]   Oh, no. And that's the sign. Maybe if I turn this a little bit, you will see it better.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.480]   That's the sign that goes up on the front of the laser maze as people are queuing up to go through this thing.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.440]   That's what it looks like. So a little Arduino programming and some strip of LEDs goes a long way.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.640]   Would you say that-- What happens when you cross a laser? What happens to you?
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.800]   So it makes a sound. It goes ahh. And it also adds-- This whole thing is timed. So it adds five seconds
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.760]   to your time every time you cross through a laser beam. So you're really trying to avoid them
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.760]   and come out with the best time possible. Would you say the majority of the stuff that you're
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.400]   working on in Maker Space has to do with Raspberry Pi Arduino? I mean, is it pretty much all built
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.760]   around that for the most part? Well, see, a lot of the stuff I do is built around Raspberry Pi
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:47.880]   Arduino. But no, not at all. So we do welding here. We're just doing our first machining
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.120]   training. So there's a lot of equipment we have here that you wouldn't have in your garage
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:59.320]   presses and breaks for bending material and shears for cutting metal and lots of woodworking
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.760]   equipment. So really, it's kind of whatever you want to make it. If you want to do woodworking,
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.280]   you can come in and do woodworking. If you want to do electronics, you can come in and do electronics.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.520]   The 3D printers are right behind me. You can do that too. So it's a mixture of all kinds of stuff.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.760]   Super cool. My only real experience with any of this stuff was actually working with you to get
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.160]   the Raspberry Pi up and running on my arcade cabinet, which gets used very frequently at home.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.560]   So thanks again for helping out with that. I finally got the kids, I finally got the kids
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.320]   like understanding that these aren't the kinds of games that you touch the screen on.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.720]   That it's like a different type, a different category of game, took them a while to actually
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.000]   warm up to it. But now they've got Pac-Man Fever, so it's good.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.960]   So if you ever find yourself in Pasadena, go buy Bill Gross's idea lab.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.440]   Oh yeah, definitely. I've heard of it. He has his fab space there to do the things that he
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.760]   actually works on. He's built cars out of there and all kinds of neat stuff and it's really cool to
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.400]   see it in the process of a company. Yeah, definitely. Absolutely. Sounds great.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:03.560]   Fan. Bill's one of the nicest guys in technology. Excellent. That's Pasadena, California.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.640]   Now that Wikipedia doesn't really show me a whole lot. But anyways, well, cool. It's
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.080]   awesome to be doing a show with both of you guys. We've got a lot to talk about. Actually,
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.040]   this was a big, I know it's kind of boring to start with earnings stuff, but I think it's
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.800]   important in the sense that technology companies, like the really big technology companies,
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.880]   this was a really impressive earnings quarter starting off with Alphabet.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.760]   For the second quarter of 2016, the revenue is up 21% year over year. Half of their searches
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:43.800]   come from mobile. Obviously, that's a testament to the strength that Android, also the paid deals
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:51.320]   with iOS, all that kind of stuff. With more than half of all those searches coming from mobile,
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:58.120]   basically the overall ad spend on mobile is increased 63% year over year. So there's a lot of money
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.960]   to be made there. So obviously, really good news for Google. Lots to go around.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.680]   But the numbers right before that from Facebook, it's killer and it's scary in the hell out of
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.880]   media people because they more and more and more and more own the advertising world.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:19.560]   Yeah. So I mean, they're the big guys. Obviously, Google is tremendous in online advertising.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:26.600]   Facebook is moving upwards, but still not necessarily a total threat to Google at this point.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.880]   Would you say, Jeff? No, not at all. But I wouldn't sell my Google stock,
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.120]   but I wish I had some Facebook stock because I think they're both going to do very, very well.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.640]   I guess the challenge here for Google in this regard is that
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:47.640]   mobile ads actually cost less than desktop ads. So if their strength is in mobile,
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:55.320]   they actually have to do a lot more work to make up the difference. But I guess this is just the
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:00.840]   landscape that that they do. But the volume is very high. And as we see coming up with,
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:06.120]   we'll have a discussion a little later on AMP, between AMP and that speeds up the experience
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.720]   immensely and you end up getting more inventory out of it, more engagement out of it and better
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.960]   performance of the ads out of it. So they're going to be tweaking the mobile experience
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:21.160]   constantly and data. Mobile generates more data to be able to be more targeted and thus more
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:28.600]   effective and efficient. Yeah, very, very true. So Google's doing awesome. I always do that.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.960]   I always accidentally say Google, but it's alphabet actually. Although Google's behind all the
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:39.160]   searchy stuff that's happening that's making a heck of a lot of money for alphabet. And
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:46.040]   yeah, I don't know. And Facebook, Amazon had a really impressive earnings quarter. They
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:54.440]   quarter after quarter are basically breaking their records of revenue generated each and every time.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.280]   So you've got these like, Bahaemas just doing not so. And then there you go,
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.920]   posted a record profit, third straight quarter, double the amount of employees that they have
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:10.280]   for the company in one single year, which if I remember correctly, I read somewhere that the
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:17.160]   number of employees that they added in a single year, which is 268,900 employees is the new high.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.000]   The number that they added is more than alphabet has as a company, which
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   kind of gave me pause right there. But I guess Amazon has the last vast majority of them are
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.400]   not doing high tech jobs. Right. Exactly. It's all about fulfillment. It's all about, you know,
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.120]   a lot of the work around taking all those products that people order online and
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.520]   they'd a lot less and pushing it out. Yeah. Something that isn't factored into there, I guess,
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:45.960]   or the seasonal employees. So that would even make the number higher. So, yes, getting the earnings
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.280]   out of the way. But I don't know, any thoughts about kind of like where we are in technology
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.040]   in general as relates to these three companies. And then you have like Twitter,
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.440]   which is just like limping along. It can't quite keep up. Or what do you mean?
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:03.960]   Yeah. I mean, I would say, you know, that, I mean, you mentioned Apple having a little bit of an
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:09.000]   issue, right? Diversifying. But I would say that Google, as much as trying to diversify,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.200]   it's also having some issues, right? Because almost all of their revenue or the vast majority of the
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:22.680]   revenue that comes in is ad revenue, right? And I think they have, you know, a lot of work to do
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:28.600]   in terms of diversifying and making other parts of the business profitable. And this is exactly why
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:33.720]   they did alphabet in the first place, right? Is that, you know, they have all these other things
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:39.480]   that they're trying to do so that if the ad market ever crashes, they're not going to feel the pain
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.880]   as much. And this is something that they're trying to do with their moonshot programs and
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:49.000]   other things. And I think Amazon is out there doing the exact same thing. They realize that
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.520]   online retail is one thing. But if online retail, you know, could go to some other company at some
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:59.400]   point, and so they have to diversify. And so that's, it's interesting. I think that they may actually have
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:07.640]   the, the, I wouldn't say the most diversified portfolio, but at least with things like AWS and
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.760]   cloud business and pushing more towards a, you know, on the one side pushing towards retail,
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.200]   and then on the other side pushing towards business customers. I mean, I think they may
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:21.160]   actually be in the best position because if one of those flip flops on the teeter totter,
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:26.440]   they can depend on the other one. Whereas Google and Apple are really in trouble if they lose
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:32.600]   their primary sources of revenue. Yeah, it's a really good point. Amazon with, you know, like
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:38.520]   Alexa and the Echo, that's a, that's a whole angle of its business that I don't know how much of that
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:43.640]   is actually driving the success of the company necessarily. But it's an initiative that was
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:48.360]   very experimental, it seemed like, and it has really kind of caught fire and now has become
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:55.480]   very close to Amazon's heart as far as like, kind of dialing into the fabric of Amazon's efforts
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.480]   going forward, really trying to kind of have those integrations and everything, at least from
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.480]   the sales side. And then you mentioned their web services division. That's their cloud and
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:10.280]   storage and all that technology behind the scenes, $2.8 billion a revenue for the quarter, which is
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:15.800]   up 58% year over year. So that's just going nuts though, because everybody relies on what Amazon
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:23.320]   does in the cloud, which is scary. But it's good for them. At least they have something to fall
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:30.360]   back on, whereas Google has a few things up their sleeve, but nothing like Amazon. So I think Amazon's
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:36.360]   actually in really good shape. And like you said, Twitter, eh, I know Twitter, that's the
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:41.080]   cat. What did I see here? I read the read this article by the Wall Street Journal that was basically
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:47.880]   kind of looking into kind of the channel, the big challenge for Twitter, which is essentially the
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:52.760]   fact that so much of its usage comes from non users, which is kind of the way the service has
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.560]   been built, right? It's built so that you can get on, you can follow, you can share all that kind of
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:03.640]   stuff, but you can also watch as a as a voyeur from the outside or, you know, see these tweets
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:08.120]   embedded into pages and all this kind of stuff. So visibility is high. Everybody knows about
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:14.040]   Twitter. You know, they're talking about it on TV. They're mentioning throwing hashtags into
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:19.000]   into advertisements and everything. So it's not like Twitter isn't a known product. It's just the
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.560]   fact that it only has 313 monthly active users compared to possibly, I think they were estimating
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:32.520]   so we're around 800 million, sorry, 800 million addressable users as far as like an audience,
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:37.880]   but not a daily user that's logging in, just kind of seeing them tangentially. And that's kind of a
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:42.280]   huge issue for Twitter, trying to figure out how they, you know, how they convert that into some
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.960]   sort of way that they can make any money whatsoever because they're just not really doing it.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:53.080]   I don't know. So yes, obviously Twitter has the big challenges there, but
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:59.560]   any other thoughts on these earnings before we get out of the earnings pool and jump into fun stuff?
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.320]   It's jumping to fun stuff. I don't know why I started off with earnings, probably because it
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:07.800]   was right in front of me. I could have started off with Samsung because that's fun. Did you guys
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:13.160]   check out the announcement yesterday with their new device, the Galaxy Note 7? I thought I was
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:18.040]   going to go, but it passed by me and I didn't know I didn't get an invitation or anything.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.920]   It didn't happen, but it looks like a nice device. Yeah, it's really nice. Actually, I was pretty
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:28.440]   impressed. Leo, Ron Richards and myself were on hand yesterday morning to kind of cover the
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.960]   announcement and everything. And it wasn't like we were talking about a device that we hadn't
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:39.000]   already heard so much about in the internet sphere. So many things had leaked about this
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.360]   already. So there weren't a whole lot of surprises, but to catch people up, 5.7 inch super AMOLED
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:50.680]   display, quad HD with curved screens. So they've added a curved screen to both sides of the Galaxy
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:58.600]   Note 7 to kind of bring it in line with the edge, which by the way, the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:03.240]   sold more than the S7 in the past five months. It's been incredibly popular. So it makes a whole
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.920]   lot of sense that they would kind of design like that. Jason, have you spent much time using an
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:13.240]   edge phone? I mean, I've reviewed the edge device, actually both of them. The first one that was
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:18.760]   just like the single edge on one side, which was weird. And then the latest one. What do you really,
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:24.040]   does it add any value? It does to some. It didn't really to me. I mean,
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:28.440]   from an aesthetics perspective, I really like the look of the device. And it's kind of
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:34.360]   nice. But the screen then is to be as weird. Yeah, you mean how the image kind of falls off to
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:38.680]   the sides a little bit? Yeah, that's not the way it's meant to be seen. The other thing I wonder is
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:43.960]   if when you know, when I go into the airport, I go, I travel a lot, I go to the airport and time
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:51.000]   to put my phone down at security or at the gate or the club, trying to hold the phone on the edges.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.400]   So it doesn't hit any buttons or anything. So you can put the barcode down. Is this whole little
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.760]   dance you have? Is that worse on the edge phones? Are you in danger of hitting stuff?
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:04.680]   I feel like I got a little bit of that in my playing around with it. I'm pretty sure I'm guessing
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:09.400]   and I'm going to check out the the note seven. So I'll be able to test it with this as well. But
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.240]   I'm guessing it's the kind of thing that the longer you live with it, the better you get it at that
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:17.480]   sort of thing. You kind of adjust your usage pattern on it a little bit so that you don't
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.720]   do those things. But I definitely had phantom touches on just a little device when I was using
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:26.360]   it. And that would annoy me at least short term. But I'm sure people kind of get used to how you're
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:31.080]   supposed to hold it eventually, at least I would hope so. I still think it's a gimmick personally.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:36.120]   Maybe it's just me. I mean, maybe the sales are proving me wrong. But I said this before,
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.400]   either on this show or all about Android, I think it's a gimmick. I think it's an interesting
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:44.920]   gimmick. It certainly has enticed people to buy this particular device. But at the end of the day,
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:49.320]   what usefulness do you actually get out of it? And maybe there's some folks in the chatroom
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.760]   that have one that can tell us, Oh, yeah, use this every day. And here's the feature that really
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:57.320]   works for me. But everybody I've talked to says, Oh, isn't it cool? And it's like, well, okay,
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:02.600]   what do you do with it that you couldn't do otherwise? Or that really makes it better than
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.840]   having a flat display? And nobody can seem to answer that question.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:11.960]   So I think it's cool because it looks cool. That's my opinion. You know what I mean? And I don't
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:18.760]   know if that's necessarily enough. But sales are pointing to the fact that it probably is. You
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:22.920]   know, Samsung in their earnings, I don't want to go back to earnings. But just to kind of tap
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:28.760]   on this point here, said that the S seven edge was the breakout. I mean, like I said, it beat the S
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:35.640]   seven. So it's selling more. Their earnings were they increased revenue 5% year over year after having
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.640]   really had some challenges over the past couple of years. They've really turned things around
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:45.240]   with this latest kind of family, the S seven family of devices. And within that successful
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:49.960]   family, the edge is the breakout hit. So you will whether people find it useful or not,
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.560]   they're willing to drop extra money because it does cost extra to get the edge version.
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:59.000]   And you can get a seven version without the edge. Yes, you can get you can get a traditional
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.200]   S seven and seven also. No, you cannot with the note seven. So the note seven is only with that.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.840]   It's only with the edges on the side. And I want to see it because some of the early reports that
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:14.920]   I had seen had mentioned that it might be like a less steep of an edge like curved corners,
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:19.720]   but not necessarily as curved as the S seven edge. I'm not really quite sure I haven't seen
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.880]   it in person yet to judge that. But give credit to Samsung because the world laughed when they
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:30.760]   sat down and produced a fab blood and took over and the world looked dubiously at them when they
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.240]   put on the edge phones and the market is proving them right. So credit to them.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:39.000]   Absolutely. I mean, almost to the point to where these large factor phones, you know,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.440]   we don't even really call them phablets anymore. They're just phones. It's just we've got so
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:47.320]   used to seeing these large factor phones. And yeah, I mean, in the early days of all about
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:53.560]   Android when the note the first note released, it was enough of a kind of quizzical thing that
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:57.800]   we actually had a segment that which was Android in the wild, which was can anyone actually spot
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:02.520]   one of these things out in the wild? Like you're on the subway and you see someone randomly using it.
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:06.920]   And it was really hard to do, but they paged away. I was in Korea and I tried to buy one
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.800]   there because it was an odd beast and you saw them just all over.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:17.720]   Mm hmm. Yeah. So, you know, taking Samsung's been listening to their users a lot and you know,
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:22.440]   they've had they've almost been forced to they've had to correct things because the last couple of
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:27.560]   years they have not done as well as they were used to doing, at least as pertains to mobile,
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:32.280]   but just in general. So they've, you know, made some changes to the Note 7 along those lines.
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:38.440]   There's the curved edges on the screen. They've made it waterproof. So now the note series is
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:43.880]   waterproof all the way or at least the Note 7 is waterproof all the way down to where the S Pen
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:48.760]   slides into the device that is waterproofed in there. So, you know, it's no water is going to get
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:53.960]   through, which is really interesting. I'm very curious to, you know, know how they pulled that
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:19:00.040]   off. They've increased the battery life to 30 3500 milliamp hour battery. So, you know,
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:05.480]   based on versus the last version, which I think was like 3000 milliamp hour battery and
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:09.480]   battery is important to everyone, I think probably one of the most important features.
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.880]   Micro SD card slot, they worked that back in. So you've got removable storage.
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:18.200]   That makes Aaron Nukem happy. What are you going to use that for if you had this device?
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.000]   What would you use for?
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Anything and everything. I mean, just just simply having a device. You know, we've talked about
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.640]   this before, just simply having some extra storage and a lot of these programs, you can say, you
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:34.680]   know, don't keep my photos, which are usually the biggest drag on your internal storage. Don't put
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:40.920]   those on my on my internal storage. Put those on external storage and just doing that alone will
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.760]   save you so much space on your device. Let alone, you know, the fact that you can put a bunch of
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:48.840]   movies on there, take it with you on the plane, change it out. If you want to watch something
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.600]   different, all that kind of stuff. I mean, it just makes it so much more usable, in my opinion.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.280]   But, you know, I think if you didn't already mention, I'll say it again, the fact that there's
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:00.920]   four gig on this device, four gig of internal memory, as well as I believe 64 gig of
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:06.120]   normal storage. Yeah, a baseline. That's the beginning of the storage.
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.920]   I mean, I think that is a good trend in the right direction, just because there are some people
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.120]   that don't care about the external storage. They just want to have everything on there.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:18.600]   And at least that gives you a little bit more room to play with. I mean, on my Nexus 6, which
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.920]   I'm still using, about ready for a new phone, I think. But on my Nexus 6, I mean, I'm constantly
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:29.000]   kind of bumping up into that 32 gig that I have. And so it's nice just to have the extra internal
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.560]   storage as well. I think you're getting close. I think you're getting close to needing a new device,
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:39.640]   Aaron, and possibly the new Nexus is the next side right around the corner. It sounds like,
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:45.000]   yeah, that's probably what I'm guessing you're waiting for. You got it. But yeah, so Samsung
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.120]   did a great job here. They also have Iris scanning built into the phone, which I really want to
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:54.600]   play around with. This was one of those things that we heard about in advance of the announcement.
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:59.640]   And I kind of did a little eye roll just like, all right, Samsung's doing the thing again.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.880]   That's sounds really great on paper. Same time. We'll get all messed up.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:08.840]   Exactly. Totally. It's not going to let me into the phone. But yet, everybody that's played
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:14.280]   around with it, at least in the preview stage, says that it's in some ways faster than a fingerprint
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:19.000]   scanner. And almost to the point I read in one article where it was like, I'd take a picture of
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.960]   the process, but I can't because it's too fast. Like anytime I try, it just lets me in right then.
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:31.320]   And I can't actually snap a picture of it. So I don't know, could be kind of a gimmick, but it
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:38.600]   actually sounds pretty legit to protect certain parts of the phone. And not to mention fingerprint
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:42.360]   scanners aren't the most secure thing in the world anyways.
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:49.080]   As we learned more this week. Yeah, right. Okay. So there, researchers were able to,
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:55.880]   I think they initially 3D printed, someone who was murdered, they wanted to get into the phone.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:01.160]   It was a Galaxy S6, I believe. They wanted to get into the phone. Yeah, it was an S6.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:07.720]   To see if there were any clues to who the murderer might have been. And they took, I guess,
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:12.680]   a picture, an image of the fingerprint of the man who, you know, who's phone it belonged to.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:19.240]   And they tried to 3D print a thumbprint or a thumb to access it. But of course that doesn't
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:26.760]   carry a charge the way our hands do. And so that will keep that from working. So they ended up 2D
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:32.520]   printing it with conductive ink. And that got them right in. Oh, something to try.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:41.000]   Like our next next workshop. I mean, it's probably easier to do that than it is to replicate the
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:48.680]   iris of someone's eye in order to get into a device. But, ah, but that's just that's fascinating to me.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:56.600]   So, yeah, cool things. They also announced something called Samsung Pass. This is kind of tied into
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:01.240]   the security of the device and that, you know, it's got nox security underneath, which is very
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:06.920]   well known for, you know, very good protection for these devices. Samsung Pass is actually
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:13.080]   going to be working with banks like B of A, Citibank, US Bank, and a bunch of others to essentially,
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:19.560]   you know, store a lot of that, that card information and stuff and work in tandem with iris scanning
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:26.040]   as well as other authentication methods. So I think overall what Samsung is doing here is
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:31.880]   they're filling out their like they've got a really good schedule going right now throughout
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:36.760]   the year and this year being a great example of that. They started with the S7 and the S7 edge,
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:42.040]   really aimed it towards the general consumer had a knockout last five months. I mean,
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:46.520]   their fan of the last five months of sales has just been enormous for Samsung. As things start
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:52.520]   to settle down, they unleash the Note 7, which has a very ardent, you know, particular audience,
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:57.240]   but is also really good and tailored for like enterprise users and stuff like that.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:04.040]   So Dr. Android, it wasn't that long ago, a year ago, we thought when Samsung was, oh, well,
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:09.080]   that's the whole, we don't talk about Uncle Samsung. Yeah, not doing so, what kind of plastic we
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.920]   can get enough of, and it really seems to have come back to a quality reputation, no?
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:20.040]   It really does. And like I said, this goes, A, their profits are showing that they're, you know,
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.880]   they're actually selling phones in a time when it's really difficult to sell phones.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:28.680]   Historically, this is about as bad as it's been since this whole smartphone revolution
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:33.880]   of the past, you know, seven years since the iPhone kind of released and everybody hopped on
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:38.520]   the bandwagon. You know, this last year or two has been really, everything's slowing down.
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:43.800]   Even Apple says it's slowing down yet Samsung's able to push through it with really great hardware.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.480]   So number one, the sales are showing that. And number two, like I said, they're listening to
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:51.800]   their fans. They're doing things. They're making changes to their devices, at least in the mobile
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:57.080]   side of things that actually means something, in my opinion. I got so used to seeing Samsung
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:03.400]   devices and seeing the tricky software that they throw in. And, you know, again, I rolls because
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:08.680]   they look great on paper. They look great on a stage when they're showing it off, but then in
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:17.320]   reality, like you never use it, you know. What's another Dr. Android question? What's the latest
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:21.360]   guessing on timing for the Nexus? Nexus, Nexus.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:29.560]   Okay. From what I understand, okay, so this might tie in with the fact that Android Nougat,
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:36.040]   which is, you know, historically, the next version of Android has launched with a device,
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:40.040]   that with the Nexus device of some sort. That's what we're used to. That's what we're used to
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:44.680]   seeing for years and years now. Well, it turns out that we might be seeing Android Nougat
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:51.400]   in the next couple of days, potentially. Evan Leaks, sorry, Evan Blass on Twitter. He's a
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:57.400]   notorious leaker of information. Or, you know, he's given a lot of information from people who
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.720]   want to leak information. And it's usually very accurate. So he posts it when he feels confident
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:08.360]   in it, says it's probably going to happen tied to the security patch in a couple of days on August
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:13.880]   5th. Google's already announced that there will be a security patch on the 5th. They haven't announced
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:19.080]   that Nougat would be, you know, associated with that in any way. So that remains to be seen.
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:23.560]   But that, if that happens, it's a very different scenario than what we've seen in the past.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:30.120]   Normally, these new versions of Android have a device to launch with. And this time, you know,
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:36.600]   we're hearing about two HTC Nexus devices. We haven't heard about them in any sort of official
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:41.000]   way from Google yet. So they don't even exist as far as we're concerned. And it sounds like
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:47.240]   Nougat's probably going to release before those and that another device in LG V20, I believe,
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:53.560]   is actually going to beat the Nexus devices to market as the first hardware shipping with Nougat.
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:59.880]   So we don't know. We know that the V20 is launching in September from what LG says. And if they're
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:04.680]   touting that it's going to be the first hardware to ship with Nougat, it tells us that the HTC
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:10.120]   Nexus is, if they actually do exist, probably not coming until September at the earliest and don't
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:16.520]   know when beyond there. So I don't know if that's a good or a bad answer for you, Jeff. Are you?
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:21.240]   Very well, it's best to have. I was thinking about this. Somebody asked us, I think, in
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:28.120]   Twitter the other day, what do we think of the Nexus 6? Leo, he was SLEO, too. Leo is long gone
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:35.160]   into 45 with their phones. I still like mine a great deal. And we are at the point of wondering
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:39.640]   what feature could they come up with? It's going to make me, I'll switch because I'm a lemon.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:45.640]   And Google says, oh, here, here, you put the carrot in front of my nose and I'll go buy the carrot.
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:51.480]   But it's hard for me to imagine what they're going to come up with. It makes me say, oh, I got
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:58.520]   to drop this. What about you? Yeah, I mean, I've felt that way for a little while now. I mean,
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:04.120]   we've got improved cameras. So the cameras are finally pretty close to on par with what I'm looking
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:10.680]   for. I don't know. I don't know what the feature is anymore. It's like sometimes it feels like
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:15.640]   we're a peak phone as far as that's concerned. All the phones have blended into each other.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:21.400]   And I don't know what a new device brings that makes it a must have other than that it's a new device.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:27.320]   Well, I think this actually elevates the Android operating system part of the device, right? I mean,
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:31.080]   when we're talking about NuGet, because there really isn't a whole lot of new features from a
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:36.440]   hardware side that are coming out, except more and faster. So we're at that point where desktop
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:44.120]   PCs were maybe, I don't know, eight, nine years ago, something like that, where they kind of peaked
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:50.040]   and people stopped talking about this AMD versus Intel and this processor versus Intel.
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:54.520]   And all of a sudden, it was the new software you could run on the desktop or your laptop or
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:29:00.360]   then phones became really popular. So I think we've just hit that point where we have plateaued in
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:05.960]   terms of where the hardware is, not where it can go, but it's just the differences are so slight or
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:11.240]   so insignificant that they're just not interesting as much as they used to be. So now it really is
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:18.280]   about the software. And I think now Google at least has and its partners have an opportunity to shine
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:23.880]   with Android and what the software can do, how it can make use of those resources as opposed to
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:30.600]   just the hardware itself. And I'm actually really hopeful for the HTC devices. I know a lot of people
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:36.920]   are kind of like, I don't know, HTC hasn't been doing much lately, but I always enjoyed my HTC
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:43.240]   devices when I had one. And so I'm really hoping that HTC can make a comeback. If it is true that
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:48.920]   they're going to be the new Nexus, manufacturers are the new Nexus devices. So we'll see.
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:55.080]   Really seems like all signs are pointing to yes, as far as that's concerned, there's two devices
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:30:01.000]   that are expected. Sailfish is the kind of codename for the smaller five inch display with a 1080p
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:07.240]   screen. And there's the Marlin, which is the codename for the larger 5.5 inch QHD
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:13.480]   AMOLED display. And outside of that, those changes, and I think a larger battery on the larger one,
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:22.040]   they're pretty much the same between the two of spec for spec. So it really seems like this is
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:26.600]   probably what we're going to expect as far as the new Nexus devices are concerned. I've always
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:31.960]   really liked HTC as well, Aaron. I've always thought that their hardware, their build quality,
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:39.720]   I really like their style and aesthetic when it comes to their design. The HTC 10, I reviewed
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:46.760]   that. I really enjoyed playing around with that device. But this is a crazy year because you've got
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:55.160]   flagship devices from Samsung, from HTC, these high quality devices, LG, Motorola, all the Motorola
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:31:01.480]   got rid of the headphone jack. So you can dock them a few points for that. But you've got these
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:09.080]   higher cost devices compared to this whole middle of the road, $400 priced, but still incredibly
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:15.640]   impressive hardware options like the OnePlus 3, which is excellent. And Leo, I think, did Leo
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:22.920]   show off the ZTE Axon 7 last week? Sounds like he did. Which is also just excellent design for
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:28.840]   like $400. So this is just such a weird time for smartphones. It's kind of, I don't know, it almost
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:36.040]   feels like it's confused because at some point you have to ask yourself where it's worth going
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:42.360]   from the $400 phone that has pretty much everything you really want up to the $850 Note 7 that adds a
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:51.000]   stylus and a couple of other features. Is it worth it? So, oh, I don't know. But I don't know,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.360]   I'm looking forward to the new Nexus whenever that happens. And it'll be interesting if NuGet
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:01.880]   does release in a couple of days here to see how that rollout goes. You're both on sixes, you said,
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:09.240]   right? Yeah, I am. Six P, six P. Okay, so you got regular six. Okay, well, you both would get
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:14.280]   NuGet. I think the regular six is also lying to get NuGet as well. And that's the main reason to
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:20.120]   to get Nexus phones. Yeah. It's the assurance that you'll get, you know, every time I look at a
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:23.240]   Samsung device and I think they're getting better and I'm like, ah, but then I don't really want
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:27.800]   to wait. I have to deal with Samsung. The other thing I'm doing is that is because I travel,
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:34.920]   I have Google Fi on the six and my real phone is the six P. So when I'm traveling, I'm using
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:40.680]   Fi on this internationally, which just makes a huge difference. So I'm carrying two phones. And then
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:46.360]   because I have AT&T grandfather on my main phone, I can't tether from there so I can tether from
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:51.160]   this thing. So it's really, it's, I'm dragging around two phones in my briefcase, but it's kind
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:55.960]   of worth it. So you have the two phones so that you don't have to give up a grandfather, or the
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:00.200]   grandfather unlimited. That's specifically like you're not going to let go of that no matter what.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:04.280]   I don't know that. Just in case it's just never have to worry. I don't, you think I use that much
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:08.120]   data? Yeah. But it's like an insurance policy. I don't have to worry. You don't have to worry.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:12.280]   The phone will automatically say data, worry, and I think, ah, that's not for me. That doesn't apply.
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:17.880]   Oh, yeah. Now I had the, I had the grandfather and unlimited data with Verizon for quite a while.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:22.200]   And then I just really like, I started actually looking at my data usage and I was like, man,
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:26.600]   I'm just not using it anymore. And then for based on what we do, and in the world of Android, I feel
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:32.680]   like, you know, when you're on Verizon, just as, as an example network, you're so limited compared
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:38.120]   to the possibility and the open world that is out there outside of Verizon as far as options
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:42.680]   and everything like that. So I ended up going, being okay with the fact that I was just going to
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:47.480]   let go of my limited data. Verizon was really working hard to make it really inconvenient too.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.440]   So, you know, they really don't want you to have your unlimited data.
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:54.520]   They don't have it. They make it challenging just for that very reason.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.880]   Every month you have to chew gum, turn around, spend five times to keep your plan.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:03.240]   Exactly. Call us. We'll talk about it. We'll talk about it. If you are considering getting the
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:11.160]   Note 7, then you will probably want to pre-order it because if you do pre-order it, you get a free,
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:16.280]   your choice of either a free gear fit to wearable, like fitness wearable device.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.440]   That's based on Tizen, by the way. Or you get a 256 gig micro SD card.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:27.640]   I'm assuming that Aaron Nukem would opt for that if he were to get a Note 7.
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:32.920]   Just think about how many Raspberry Pi images I could put on 256 gig.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:38.840]   You get a hot swap, your Raspberry Pi images on the fly, all from your phone.
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.320]   Sure. Yeah. That makes sense to me.
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:51.160]   So there you go. They also announced a gear VR, an updated gear VR, because the Note 7 is now
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:58.440]   based on USB-C. So what is my gear VR going to be still going to work?
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:01.800]   Okay. So what phone are you using with your gear VR?
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.760]   I guess this is the Galaxy 6s.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.480]   The S6. So the S6 will still obviously...
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.280]   That's right.
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:12.120]   It's easy. They all name their things almost the same thing anyways.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:17.240]   The old gear VR obviously is going to continue working with your device.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.080]   Your device would work with the new one.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:22.440]   What they've done is they've changed the...
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:26.680]   There's like a little removable plug.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:32.920]   So you can choose whether that removable plug has their standard USB or the USB-C connector on it.
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:36.680]   And it'll actually work with the S6. There you go. Those are the plugs right there.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.600]   So if you want to upgrade, go for it. Jeff is just $100.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.200]   Wider field of view, or it could just not be that important.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.520]   I'm sure the one you have right now is just quite all right.
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:50.600]   How much time do each of you spend in VR in a month?
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.200]   Not much at all.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:52.920]   I mean...
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:53.400]   Zero.
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.080]   Zero.
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.320]   Unless I'm testing, because I don't have one.
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.000]   So unless I'm testing something out...
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.600]   We go to friends.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:01.400]   Or something or...
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:02.600]   Or something or whatever.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:07.720]   It's interesting, but it's not interesting enough to me to the point where I want to go buy it.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:11.800]   I'd like to play with it, but it's not like when the week came out,
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.120]   I was like, "Oh, I've got to go get that."
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:17.080]   I mean, the kids are going to go nuts or whatever.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.000]   But this isn't quite there yet.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.920]   Like the killer app for VR to me hasn't quite hit yet.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.280]   I'm sure it will at some point.
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.080]   The Pokemon Go of VR has not hit for you.
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:27.560]   That's right.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:28.120]   That's right.
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:36.280]   I mean, I actually this week, today's episode of Android Operaina is a cardboard VR episode.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:41.720]   So I spent some time this week in VR, but if I'm not doing it for those reasons,
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:42.760]   I mean, it's just hard.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.440]   For me, it's more of a time issue.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.920]   I just don't have a whole lot of time to A. play games and B.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:52.760]   Take, you know, stop whatever I am doing and pull out a goggle or a helmet and put it on
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.240]   and take 20 minutes doing this thing.
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.360]   I think it's neat though.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:00.360]   I think it's interesting remains to be seen if it's really the next big thing.
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.560]   We thought wearables, you know, like watches and stuff were the next big thing.
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:04.840]   Or at least someone did.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.800]   In the higher house because we saw those everywhere.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.120]   And I feel like even that's kind of petered out at this point.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:10.840]   Right.
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:17.480]   I will say what I did do, since you asked Jeff, as I did go look at the Conan 360 coverage he did
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:22.360]   at Comic Con where he did his shows, or at least some of his shows, some parts of his shows,
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.200]   in using the 360 cam.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:31.320]   And that kind of blew me away in terms of watching live video and being able to move
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:35.000]   with my finger, or if you had cardboard on, obviously with your head,
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.920]   move around and see what people were doing, including the audience, how they were reacting
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:39.560]   to the jokes.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.680]   That was pretty neat.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:50.440]   And so there may be a play there for sporting events, live concerts, things like that.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:51.560]   Hold on there.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:55.480]   So I just, I had a meeting day with somebody who was really good at VR doing an investment in the
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:57.880]   art of the art of the day at my school because we're worrying about this too.
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:01.400]   And I'm not sure concert, concert doesn't make sense.
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:05.720]   But concert is a 180, most is a more like a 150 degree thing.
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:06.360]   Right?
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:09.160]   How often do you want to turn around and see the crowd?
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:13.320]   Well, you might not want to see the crowd, but like if you look, go look at the Conan 360,
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:18.440]   what they did is you could actually pick to view the concert from a different angle.
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:22.120]   So sometimes, you know, when you're sitting in the cheap seats or you're way off to the side,
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:25.240]   because you didn't know that that was a bad seat or it was the only seat you could get,
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:29.800]   you're like, man, I wish I could see what it looked like from over there, because that,
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:33.480]   you know, I just wish I could see what, you know, or I want to focus on the drummer or the
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:39.000]   guitar player, but I can't see him from here. Those kinds of things are possible with the 360 view.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.920]   And so I think it does make interesting, especially, I mean, you got to remember too,
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:48.200]   like sporting events and concerts and stuff. Those are true fans in the true sense of the word
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:52.920]   fanatics, right? These are fans that really want to get into this. And so I think they might even
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:56.920]   pay more to see a football game or a concert and be able to look at it.
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:02.600]   But our guest said it in, our guest is expert in VR and he did all kinds of work in it and he's
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:07.080]   pushing for it and investing money and so on and so forth. His view about a football game, he said,
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:14.600]   you know, look at a 4K TV straight on curated by expert people with commentary and the right
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:19.640]   scene selection that beats a 360 camera on the field. I don't know what the heck I'm looking at.
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.680]   Well, there goes the ball. You know, and I think he has a point. I think we, I think it's a
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:27.880]   year point. Aaron, earlier, we haven't found we're struggling to find the killer app or we just
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:33.240]   haven't found it yet. Yeah, I feel like there's something to be said though for experience.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:39.800]   Like, yeah, they're completely different experiences, right? Watching a football game. I think football
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:44.760]   is actually a great example they bring up because even when I go to like a live football game,
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:48.840]   I don't necessarily feel while I'm there that it's the best way to watch a football game because
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:52.760]   I miss out on all the other stuff, right? And there's a lot of waiting and, you know,
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:57.720]   things, the field's very far away compared to where I happen to be seated and sometimes I just
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:02.440]   feel like the TV experience for me is better. But there are other experiences where I would love
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:07.240]   the ability, even though I can't make it in person, to be immersed by it. You know, I might not look
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:12.920]   behind me at a concert when I'm actually at a concert. But if I can transport myself into
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:19.880]   tricking my brain almost that I'm there, then I have the ability to do it if on a whim I decide to.
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:23.800]   I mean, like, yeah, look around. It makes you feel like you're there in a different way,
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:27.000]   not that you're necessarily going to be watching that person that's standing behind you the whole
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:33.640]   show. But that makes you feel like you're in a real experience more than just watching a video
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:38.760]   on a TV screen. And it certainly did me watching Conan 360. I felt like, wow, I kind of feel like
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:44.520]   I'm sitting in the audience. Yeah, right. Yeah. There was a there's a video. I was actually just
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:50.440]   setting up. I got one of those Gear VR goggles when I bought the S7 a little while back and then
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:55.160]   promptly dropped it and broke the screen. Finally got the screen replaced. And so I was like,
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:58.680]   okay, so I'm going to, you know, go through the setup with the Gear VR and everything.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:02.920]   And one of the things that they pre-installed on Gear VR, can't remember the name of it, but,
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:09.480]   you know, as a musician, I love this as a demo. It's this, it's this video, a 360 video of a guy
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:15.320]   sitting at a piano with his dog sleeping on the carpet. And he's just sitting at the piano, like,
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:20.920]   like playing and writing the song or whatever. And, you know, I have no reason to look around and
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:26.040]   look at the couch that's behind me or anything like that. But just the fact that I'm transported
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:32.760]   in the middle of this room in this like highly kind of personal scenario, like that kind of
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:38.520]   extra information brings me there more than if it was just a fixed view, you know. And that I think,
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:43.480]   I think there's a lot of potential there once we get VR to the point where it's crystal, you know,
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:47.400]   it's super clear when you look at it. I think that's another barrier right now is when I look
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:52.440]   through VR and I can't help it. Just notice that it's blurrier than I want. It's not as sharp as I
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:58.120]   want. I want it to be super sharp because then that will help increase the kind of perception
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:05.960]   of reality. And so it has a ways to go. But I'm excited for it. And actually, you bring up VR,
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:12.920]   VR is a, you know, a part of the new version of Android, Nougat, which hopefully is rolling out
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:17.400]   in the next couple of days. Neither have you either of you guys played around with like the
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:25.640]   dev preview, anything with Nougat? Yep. Yeah, I've got it on the, on the, my six. I like the
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:29.640]   notifications a lot. Yeah, notification improvements are way better.
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:33.480]   Act on notifications and not having to go to the application. I think we're going to see more and
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:41.160]   more of that. You know, let me ask, do you, I'm still the odd man on not finding a heck of a lot
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:47.880]   of value in Google now? Yeah, okay. I just, it's just not that targeted on me. Maybe the two accounts
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:57.400]   problem. But, but I get to, I get a sense with notifications, how Google now, it pulls things
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:01.240]   out to the front of the view, you can act on things when you see them where you don't have to open up
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:06.760]   the app. It's like Android instant apps. In a sense, you'll get the chunk, the actionable chunk
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:12.120]   of what you want to work on, wherever you are, whether that's through Google now, whether that's
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:18.760]   through notification, whether that's in on a web page, that's very appealing. I think that's
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:25.720]   to me to break through for Nougat. Yeah, well, I mean, you know, we heard at Google I/O about kind
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:31.480]   of this, this furthering of what Google now, you know, began as and, you know, going into the world
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:37.640]   of assistant, whatever that ends up being. And it sounds like that's probably going to be integrated
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:43.400]   into Android N or Nougat at, you know, to some degree, we haven't seen any of that in the developer
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:48.360]   previews. So there's still some surprises to be unveiled once we actually see Nougat, there's,
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:52.600]   you know, assistant integration, does that replace Google now to a certain degree?
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:57.640]   Right. Or is that an evolution of Google now? We actually, actually, just the other day,
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:03.800]   there was a leak, Android police had a leak of the Nexus launcher, and, you know, the file is out
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:08.600]   there now. So you can actually install this if you want to. It's not fully operational, but you
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:13.320]   can install it and play around with it. But what it hints at aside from the fact that the app drawer
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:17.160]   is going away, or at least the button for the app drawer is going away, instead you swipe up to
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:22.120]   reveal your apps. Really? So yeah, you're looking at it right now, there's a little upwards arrow
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:27.800]   down at the bottom that you swipe up into your apps. So more changes are afoot.
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:33.560]   It's hard for clumsy people. I, you know, I think it's probably just like reprogramming your brain,
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:38.040]   right? Or if someone's never seen it before, the first time they did, did they know that that little
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:44.200]   dot with the, you know, that little circle with the dots inside actually represented apps or not
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:50.600]   until they touched it. So it is probably a minor change ultimately. But what this hints at is
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:56.520]   that the Google search bar up at the top is also going away. And instead, you're going to have a
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:03.320]   little Google button that supposedly could be tapped. And that would bring out the search,
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:09.720]   but possibly also have kind of assistant integration worked into there in some way, shape or form.
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:14.760]   So so we don't know, maybe Google now will get much, much, much better for you once assistance
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:20.920]   kind of worked in. Yeah, I hope so. That's what also interesting to me is Google now as spoken.
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:26.920]   How do you mean assistant? A lot of what I you do with the Google now,
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:33.960]   come voice in voice out. Yeah. Yeah. Are you are you very used to kind of doing the voice commands
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:38.840]   at this point? Or is I do it more for dictation of things. Okay, I don't do voice commands. What
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:45.560]   about you guys? Control the device, not necessarily a whole lot. I might I might use a voice command
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:52.760]   to like, you know, play a song or play an artist or something like that. But yeah, nothing really
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:59.160]   that major, nothing that technical. And I mean, there are tons of Google now commands and and
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:02.600]   all that kind of stuff. I just I don't think of them. I just don't think of them on the fly.
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:08.440]   Well, I'm using it more and more these days. I mean, I'm using it, especially the read me my
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:13.640]   itinerary command. Wake up in the morning. It's a really good one. I just read you what's on your
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:19.480]   calendar. That's a really and I've been using, you know, read me my voice messages or my text
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:24.840]   messages, but that doesn't always work. You know, mostly I use it for search, but I am starting to
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:29.240]   use it more and more and prefer it more and more. And certainly for dictation, what I've
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:33.320]   thought about when I was thinking about what Jeff was saying about now is what I've noticed is that
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:37.320]   there is good stuff in there. I just don't always see it because I don't always swipe over to that
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:43.080]   tab to see what's in there. And the notification part though is getting more useful to me
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:49.960]   over time. I'm starting to get more notifications that are either just in time or your package was
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:56.440]   delivered or, you know, things that might be interesting to me are starting to creep in there
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:47:00.760]   more and more. And so I hope that with Assistant, they'll take that and really incorporate it in a
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:05.560]   way that's useful for people because I'm starting to see Google with all with all the Google apps
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:11.880]   certainly. And I think other app developers are starting to get into this with NuGet is starting
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:17.320]   to build those little nuggets in there that can really be useful and help someone, right, to really
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:23.960]   make it as Google's calling it an Assistant as opposed to just something interesting to look at
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:31.480]   once in a while. Yeah, for sure. I have noticed that my usage at Google now has slowed down
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:36.040]   lately and I'm not entirely sure why. What were you using it for mainly?
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:42.760]   Well, I don't know. Like, my main value was just checking in on it to see to see what it was
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:47.560]   giving me, you know, like weather, weather prime example. I probably use Google now for
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:53.080]   weather more than like the actual page of Google now for weather more than anything else. I don't
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:57.240]   use it for parking directions. I don't really, I don't even really use it for itinerary because
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:01.560]   my itinerary is always kind of the same. Like I could have been working. I do shows that I go home.
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:07.720]   It would be very helpful if I was doing a lot of traveling, I'm sure, and I would probably rely
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:12.280]   on it to a certain degree. But, you know, there are ways that it ends up working, you know, where
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:17.560]   I'm outside of my normal use case. Like when I do travel and suddenly it pops up that card that
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:22.600]   says you're flying tomorrow, here's your itinerary, you know, things like that. That's what I think,
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:27.960]   that's where it excels. And I wish, I wish there was more opportunity for it to do things like that
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:33.000]   that were really helpful in my day to day life. But I think my life is just so, you know, so normal,
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.200]   you know, to my own days, my days aren't really that varied that there's not a whole lot of
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:42.280]   opportunity there for Google now to improve it as far as that's concerned anyways.
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:49.000]   But I was trying to, I was digging through my pocket list because I had found a really great
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:56.440]   voice command kind of interface for Google now to know all of these extra things that it can do
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:00.680]   for you. And I just cannot find it. I mean, there's thousands of them. There are so many.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:07.400]   So, yeah, we talked about that last time I was on the show. I think Leo brought it up as his
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:15.080]   tip of the week or something. Some guy compiled. Yeah. Yeah. And he made like, yes, there you go.
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:19.400]   Okay. So you guys already had it. All right. Old news, but still very, very cool.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:25.080]   There it is. Okay, dash Google dot IO. I kept putting Google dot IO because I thought that was
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:31.000]   it, but it's okay dash Google dot IO. If you want to check that out again, apparently Leo beat me
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:40.120]   to the punch on this one. That's a good way to take a look at it. Let's see here. We can touch
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:44.120]   on a few more quick Android things before we get out of this. And then we'll get to,
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:49.000]   then we'll get to AMP after this stuff. Well, let's let's finish up on this because I know
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.960]   you've got things to say about the AMP news real quick though. Google is not here to argue about
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:50:02.120]   it. Exactly. So you'll have the floor. Yeah. But real quick here, there's actually a new
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:06.840]   security notification that's coming to Android, which I think is actually amazed that it took this
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:11.960]   long to happen because it makes perfect sense. But essentially when you when when your account
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:17.240]   is logged into on a new device, you know, I'm very used to getting an email that basically says,
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:23.160]   you know, your your account was accessed on a new Chrome install on this computer or whatever.
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:27.880]   And you know, it's me. So I know that that's okay. And I just dismiss it. I archive it, whatever.
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:32.120]   Well, now you're going to get a notification in Android that asks you or that tells you front
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:38.120]   and center on all of your devices. Did you just sign in? Is this you that way? You know, immediately,
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:42.040]   you don't have to know that you don't find out the next time you log into your email five hours
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:47.560]   later or whatever, you know, right now somebody accessed it and you have controls right from there
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:51.880]   to actually do something. That's the precursor to any written passwords. Oh, you think? Yeah,
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:55.880]   yeah, yeah, there's been speculation about that. The what will happen is that your phone becomes
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:51:01.800]   that device where it'll ask you, is that you? And you say, yes, and that's what will get you in.
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:09.880]   Oh, fascinating. I have to have to think about that. Is that is that a good good alternative?
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:14.360]   What do you guys hope so I can't wait to get rid of passwords. You know, I can't stand stupid
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:19.320]   little things, things that don't matter in life at all that are what the most complicated
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:24.600]   password you could imagine. Yeah. They want to they want to salute liquid and haiku form.
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:32.840]   Yeah, the worst of the worst is when when you've got all of these rules for a password that it
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:37.960]   actually takes you time to figure out like if you're playing the game, right? Basically, it takes
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:42.440]   you five minutes just to select a single password. I understand why. But not only the passwords,
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:45.240]   but the security questions. I don't know if you guys have noticed it's trying to secure any
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:50.600]   questions. Oh, yes. There's five questions and they're like, you know, what was your third best
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:58.280]   friend's middle name in second grade? And you're like, I don't know how could I possibly even I'm
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:03.960]   never going to remember this. And so, you know, if we could just get rid of those by having the
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:10.920]   phone be that security question thing, that would make me happy or I was scanning or I was scanning.
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:15.160]   Or I was getting yeah, that would be Sam's with the event. So I just looked at my Google now.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:20.680]   And the first thing in stories to read is a thing I wrote on Huffington Post today.
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:22.680]   And it says, you've shown an interest in Jeff Jarvis.
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:28.840]   Yes, I am. Google, you're supposed to know this at least. You're supposed to know at least this.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:35.240]   That's me. Yeah, you know, you know, one other thing that I have been using Google now for lately,
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:39.960]   and it used to really suck at this is what you're talking about stories to read. It used to be
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:46.200]   horrible at giving me articles that I might actually be interested in somewhere along the
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:50.040]   line somewhere in the last like four or five months they figured it out. They got rid of the
[00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:56.120]   junk. I felt like I was getting so many just junkie spammy, almost articles before. And now I'm
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:59.960]   actually getting things that I'm like, Oh, add that to the list. I'm going to remember this one for,
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:05.000]   you know, for all about Android or for tech news today or whatever, like it's super applicable.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:09.080]   So they made improvements there and that gets me looking at it regularly.
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:13.000]   But I don't know. Do you guys use the news and weather app, the Google news and weather app?
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.800]   Not the app. No, I use Google play newsstand.
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:23.960]   Every constantly. Oh, okay. I don't use that either. I try it really because,
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:30.040]   Mr. Dr. Android, because what I it's basically, you know, what it does, it replaces to an extent,
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:35.960]   my old RSS habits, because there's a technology bar in it, right? Just fine. But then I can go in
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:39.160]   and put all kinds of categories in like, believe it or not, I have Chromebook,
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:41.800]   Android auto, just to see if it ever comes to the car I want.
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:49.960]   A Google, Bitcoin, and other things. And so there's the latest of the news that I want
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:52.360]   from across multiple players. It's really very good.
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:58.280]   Very interesting. I recommend trying it. I could use those as a tip of the week.
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:03.720]   I'm going to try it as well. Because I use, I use the news and weather app. And what I've noticed
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:08.280]   is a while ago, maybe seven or eight months ago, they started putting in, is this something you're
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:12.280]   interested in? And they started giving you suggestions. And then over time, you're kind of
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:18.120]   curating your own interest list. And eventually it starts, well, almost right away, it starts
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:22.440]   putting things, hey, you know, based on your, you said you were interested in Jimmy Fallon.
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:24.440]   Did you catch what happened last night on Jimmy Fallon?
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:30.680]   And it's like, all of a sudden it became much more useful. And I'm not sure, since you don't
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:34.920]   use news and weather, my assumption was, is that Google now was getting better because I use
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:39.160]   Google news and weather. And it was incorporating my suggestions into Google now. But you don't
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:43.640]   use it and you say your suggestions and your story suggestions in Google now is getting better.
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:47.400]   So maybe that's not the case. But I know mine have gotten immensely better over the past six
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:52.040]   months or so because I started actually interacting with it and saying, yes, this is interesting,
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:57.400]   or no, this isn't interesting. So. Yeah, I've definitely seen that in Google now. And I've used
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:02.840]   it from time to time when it when it pops that up. No, I'm not interested in Justin Bieber.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:06.440]   Just right for the record. You don't need to give me any more news stories about Justin Bieber,
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:10.280]   because that one time I searched his name. So that was nice to get that control. And then you
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:14.120]   can, of course, you can go into the settings behind the scenes and now that knows you like
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:18.520]   the girl, we've been in that it's going to give you really boring stories. If it's been tracking
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:23.800]   everything that I say without me prompting the search query, that might just be the future.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:30.440]   The show we had to suffer through Twit Musak before the show. It was awful. I'm telling you,
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:35.560]   it was painful and terrible. And then Jason started doing percussion and humming along with it.
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:39.720]   Yeah, I couldn't help it, man. It was just it was too catchy in a novel.
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:44.920]   I said, go back into his head and do it again. Yeah, thanks a lot. I had driven it out completely.
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:49.720]   And I feel it like struggling to get back in there, but I'm not going to let it. I'm not going
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:58.840]   to let it. Instead, let's talk a little bit about AMP. No, don't. Oh, man, it either.
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:02.600]   Man, did that actually happen or was that just in my brain? I don't know.
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:09.400]   Accelerated mobile pages. That's AMP is about to see an expansion that goes far beyond the familiar
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:14.920]   carousel of supported links, links that we now see, or at least I've seen a lot of those,
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:21.240]   and into all mobile search results. So this means that results from AMP publishers
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:25.880]   are going to automatically serve up the AMP version direct from Google when clicked.
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:31.080]   So here's the deal. And they're calling it a developer preview. And I come on and say,
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:34.280]   well, why is it a developer preview? A developer doesn't have to do a thing.
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:38.360]   The developer's not developing anything. It's just you're linking to more. So that's just what
[00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:43.160]   they got. That's the reflex of Google. All it means is that for now, the only way you can get to
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:50.840]   blue links to AMP is by going to G dot CO slash amp demo. Again, that's G dot CO slash amp demo.
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:57.880]   And there you will see that if an AMP link exists for a given story, then it will go to that AMP
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:03.000]   link. Now, a couple of things about this. I talked to Richard Jingress at Google before the
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:11.400]   announcement. And he said that there will be no impact on ranking. Right. That's important.
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:16.520]   Well, yes, but I said, but Google keeps telling us that fast pages will rank better.
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:23.160]   And one way to make them fast is AMP. And then their answer is, well, we have 200 signals
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:27.640]   for ranking and speed is one of them. Now, what the weight is to that and how you get there,
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:32.840]   I don't know. But I take the point that it's not going to be going to prejudice in favor of AMP.
[00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:41.480]   They have 150 million AMP documents now, a four million new AMP documents each week,
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:50.040]   179 countries, 79 language, 650,000 domains. So it's spread rapidly. Now, two weeks ago,
[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:54.920]   they announced AMP for ads because what's happening on AMP page is it holds the geography of the
[00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:59.320]   page, the, I mean, the architecture of the page, and ad is supposed to go in, but the blank box
[00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:04.040]   stays there because the damn ads are too slow. So now they have efforts to speed up the ads,
[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:07.960]   which is what the real push here is, is to make the experience better. And so that's going to
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:13.560]   improve matters. But even with the slow ads, so-called viewability for ads has been better with AMP
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:19.560]   because people see the whole page and they don't give up and go away. The timing here is one second
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:27.000]   for an AMP page up to 16, 17 seconds for a regular page has huge impact on 90% of the publishers
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:35.880]   have used AMP have said they get greater engagement. What else? I think that was the,
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:39.960]   there's were the highlights of what I heard from there. So I think it's a good thing.
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:44.120]   There's still confusion out in the marketplace. I was talking to a newspaper publisher
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:48.040]   a week ago. They still think that this is like instant articles and you're going into a Google
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:53.160]   walled world. And no, yes, Google has an influence over the standard, but it's an open standard.
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:59.640]   You don't have to use Google CDN. It's just a web page. And like other web pages, it's served
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:05.240]   through a CDN, but it's still your web page. It's just a faster, better web page on, and again,
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:10.840]   let's also emphasize if you use the G.CO/AMP demo, that will only be the case in mobile.
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:17.240]   They do not go to AMP pages on big screen browsers. That's why it wasn't working for me.
[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:22.200]   I was trying to get there. It was reading your mind. And so I heard confusion.
[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:28.280]   You got there. Yeah. I mean, that was my, that was, you kind of addressed one of my
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:32.120]   questions, which was it feels like we're becoming three types of web now. We've got standard,
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:36.120]   we've got AMP, and we've got instant articles and publishers kind of have to do this song and
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:40.200]   dance to make sure that they support, at least to some degree, I mean, if they're interested in
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:44.440]   speeding things up, supporting all three is that I mean, that's got to be a pain for publishers,
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:48.120]   though, right? But it's no different. Well, you know, so this is a really interesting thing.
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:52.440]   It's not just that. It's not just taking the content you already have and serving in new ways,
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:57.800]   right? That's a, that's a lot to do. You're right. Instant articles is basically an RSS feed.
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:02.840]   If you do an AMP page, you can turn that AMP page into your RSS feed, instant
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:07.160]   instant articles, as I understand it, and it does 90% of what you want. So that's not that bad.
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:13.880]   But there's something much bigger going on in the media world, which is platform native publishing.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:19.320]   So Washington, I think we mentioned this last week, Washington Post just put on a job for two
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:25.560]   full-time Facebook live producers. I see media companies advertising for full-time Snapchat producers.
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:31.240]   And because you can't just take the articles you already wrote for print and just try to shove them
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:39.640]   in like, you know, something down a potay and a goose's neck, I'll set that up, into all these
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:46.040]   platforms. You've got to do what's appropriate to the use case of the platform. I think tomorrow,
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:51.880]   a publisher post, I talked to these guys who founded Occupy Democrats, which is an amazing
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:58.600]   thing to me that makes just memes for Facebook and obviously, politically oriented towards the left.
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:03.880]   But rather than trying to get people to read articles through these mechanisms and still see
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:09.160]   ourselves as a destination, you make content that is appropriate to the platform so that people
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:14.600]   can use it as part of their conversations. That's the bigger challenge than just publishing stuff in AMP.
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:21.400]   Aaron, have you had much kind of much interaction with the AMP pages? What do you think about them?
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:25.000]   Well, interestingly enough, and we were just talking about news and weather and on news and
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:31.240]   weather, if you look down at your suggested articles, it'll say AMP on there. And they come up in that
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:35.640]   browser that you get on the phone. And I've had trouble in the past. I don't know if this is AMP's
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:42.920]   fault or if it's the browser part that comes up on your phone because it's not Chrome, it's a separate
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:49.480]   thing. And I've had trouble getting some things to work, especially multimedia things that are linked
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:54.040]   to in the article or whatever, they don't work. And then eventually, at least on my phone, it'll say,
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:58.040]   oh, do you want to open this up in Chrome? And I say yes, and then everything works.
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:02.840]   But that's been my experience is that, and again, I don't know whether it's the AMP part of it.
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:08.600]   That's that part that's not working. Or if it's the actual browser, like, and the same thing happens,
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:13.080]   you know, when you do Google search from your home screen, right, it comes up in the, you're
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:18.280]   still in the search app and it's showing you a webpage there as opposed to just opening up Chrome
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:23.800]   as it used to. And I think maybe it's just that thin down browser part that's not working. I don't
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:28.680]   know. But that's been my experience in the past. Otherwise, I love how quick the article's load.
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:34.760]   It's fantastic. You don't have to sit there and wait because, I mean, we all do this. If you have
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:38.600]   to wait more than five seconds for just about anything, whether it's on your phone or your desktop,
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:41.320]   you're out of there. You're not staying. You're going to be like, ah, this is broken. I'm going
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:47.640]   someplace else. So it's fantastic to keep the eyeballs on the content. But again, and maybe Jeff,
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:51.960]   maybe you know, but I've had some issues, technical issues, content that I want to interact with.
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:55.960]   No, that's really interesting. Okay.
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:05.800]   Yeah. I mean, just just from a use standpoint, anytime I encounter those, I, you know, or that carousel,
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.720]   I can't help myself, but just tap it just to see just be like, how fast you can load, whatever.
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:12.920]   And yeah, it just goes so quickly. And that's awesome. I love it.
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:18.680]   By the way, one oddity of am is that if you go through that carousel and one, two, three, four,
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:24.360]   five, six, you just went through six page views, even though you weren't looking at the story.
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:29.720]   Because because the definition of page view was the page loads and because the page loads
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:34.760]   so quickly, they're still sticking in the industry with that as a definition. And clearly,
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:39.320]   that's not going to work a long term. That's, that's, that's, nobody's trying to deceive anybody,
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:45.720]   but they have to update these issues, the amount of time spent looking at a particular link,
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:49.320]   essentially. Yeah. The other issue that Google said was that even before, because let's not
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:56.600]   forget, this ampez was started in a great measure. I was, I was at the Google Newsgeist where this
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:02.440]   kind of got birthed and part of discussion I was part of a year and a half ago. And
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:07.800]   it was an effort to give something to the news industry, to help the news industry out. But the
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:14.200]   truth is AMP has never, ever been about news. It's about a faster, better web. And so Jigra said
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:18.440]   that part of the interesting thing is that even before they moved off the links,
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:25.720]   went to blue links, even even though AMP links were only coming from the carousel and Google News,
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:33.080]   still commerce companies have been implementing AMP. Because if you have a slow, miserable experience
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:37.480]   on commerce, you lose customers. You know just how many you lose. So AMP is proving to be a
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:42.520]   better experience for commerce. And, and I thought, oh, the other thing was, I asked them,
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:49.480]   what about others linking to AMP? And they said that Pinterest and Feedly are already there
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:53.720]   linking. A nozzle is already there, like a nozzle was the first one they just jumped right in,
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:05:04.680]   if you're a nozzle fan like I am. But, but Twitter, medium, LinkedIn are working on and near,
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:09.000]   also linking to AMP content, if it's available. So you're going to see it from Google and you're
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   just going to start seeing it from elsewhere as well. And once the blue links come in,
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.920]   if your publisher is not doing AMP, you're a fool.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:16.760]   Sippa.
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:23.080]   Is this, is this, does this have implications on Facebook as well? I mean, I know Facebook does
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:27.880]   some of this stuff already, I'm sure in their technology. But, you know, I actually wouldn't mind,
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:32.440]   I've started using Facebook a little bit more just because, you know, that's, that's where people
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:38.440]   are. I really still love Google Plus, but the people aren't there except for my technology peeps, hey,
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:38.680]   guys.
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:41.720]   But it's the sound of the tumbleweeds.
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:46.520]   Yeah, exactly. I still use Google Plus though on, on almost a daily basis, and it's where I
[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:51.880]   publish first. But anyway, my point was, is that on Facebook, I mean, I really wouldn't mind having
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:57.800]   a Tinder-like experience, if you'll pardon the analogy, in that you can, you're just looking at
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.920]   stuff and you're just swiping through like, nope, not interested, not interested, not interested.
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:05.080]   Oh, that's interesting. And if I could have that type, because half of the stuff as I scroll down
[01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:09.720]   through there, it's like, sorry, I just don't, I don't, I'm not interested in that. I don't really
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:12.680]   care about that particular update. But if I could just go, ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:16.760]   Oh, that's the one I really want to drill down on. That would be actually, it would get me more
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:18.120]   engaged in Facebook, that's for sure.
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:25.240]   Well, and I mean, is that part of Facebook's instant articles? I mean, isn't that a chunk of
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:28.680]   what they're doing? They're certainly offering these things up fast, but you're talking about
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:31.800]   just like the action of swiping through them piece by piece by piece.
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:37.640]   Yeah, the action and the quickness of it. I mean, I know a lot of stuff is preloaded already in
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:43.880]   Facebook, so it's already there. But yeah, the interface itself as well as just having it load,
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:49.240]   you know, instantaneously at a nice, you know, and maybe some of the acceleration that the
[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:53.000]   caching that Google is doing, it seems like it would, it would help there as well.
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:07:01.080]   Yeah, let's see here. I'm not sure how much more I have on amp other than I like it.
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:05.080]   Oh, that's plenty. That's good. We've got it. You're just you're just used to having a full
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:11.480]   hour. I know of fit from Leo. I've inserted here. Exactly. Exactly. So we've trimmed it out down a
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:17.400]   little bit so we can make room for drones, delivery drones. I think this is pretty cool. So last week,
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:23.080]   we heard that Amazon was going to be taking its drone party to the UK where they were going or
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:29.640]   overseas, where they were going to allow Amazon to test their delivery drones. And the White House
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:36.120]   is basically now working with alphabet on its project wing drone delivery project. It's testing
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:44.600]   it here in the US. It's part of a $35 million National Science Foundation grant. Google, you know,
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:50.440]   has plans, at least last year had said that it had plans for drone deliveries by 2017. So by next
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:57.160]   year, Amazon's also targeting 2017. And I don't know, this is kind of laying the groundwork, at least
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:03.640]   bringing some of that testing onto US soil so that the US isn't, I guess, left behind in this
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:08.600]   pursuit of delivery drones. What do you guys think? Is this something you're looking forward to?
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:15.880]   What are the implications here? Dr. Gadget? Oh, yeah. Okay. I was waiting by. I was hoping I could go
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:19.800]   first. I think it's great. I think it's interesting that the government's getting involved. I think
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:26.200]   there was a lot of negative feeling from companies and individuals when they came out with the fact
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:31.000]   that you have to register now to fly a drone. And they've, I think a lot of people felt like the
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.320]   government's cracking down on drones, not only for personal use, but for business as well.
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:40.520]   And isn't it awful? And since then, they've kind of shifted a little bit, realizing that this is a
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:45.320]   technology that's going to happen. And it has tremendous implications. And yes, there needs to
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:50.520]   be some protections for things like airports and military and what. But the implications of the
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:57.400]   technology are far outweigh any sort of, hey, let's prevent people from using it because
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:02.600]   there's going to be not just delivery, but all sorts of commercial uses that are already going on
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:07.080]   today. So I think it's really interesting. The most interesting thing here was that I thought
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:11.400]   was that it was a government. It's the National Science Foundation. I guess it's still part of
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:16.280]   the government. But they're actually doing some testing and on man flight research.
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:22.760]   So we can prove the point here a little bit to say whether it's actually going to work or how
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:26.840]   safe it is or what issues there are to overcome when we start talking about this. Because I think
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:31.000]   it is going to happen. It's just a matter of time. What about you guys? You guys looking forward to
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.160]   the day like I am when that you hear the drone come to your front door? Yeah.
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:42.360]   Here's that thing you ordered on Amazon. Thank you. See that way. I think certainly for the first,
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:47.480]   I think we need some killer cases to break the ice and the fear and the techno panic on this.
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:54.040]   Right. And so what I see is deliveries to emergencies, medical supplies, blood, that kind of stuff.
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:59.000]   That's God's work. And it's not going to get in conflict with jets flying above. It's going to
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.240]   be low enough altitude. Things are going to happen. I think that's going to be critically important.
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:08.920]   So to me, I would push those kinds of humanitarian efforts to get people used to the idea of it.
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:14.360]   And then commercial efforts follow. And I have to believe that if we do this right
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:19.960]   and regulate it properly, and indeed's regulation, no question about it, it's aviation space,
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:28.440]   at the right drone level and knock that off. And yes, now I'm a former member of a future privacy
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:35.080]   group, former just because I lost interest after a read my book. But I still get their newsletters.
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:39.480]   And there was just recently a huge seminar about drones and privacy because you can panic about
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:44.120]   privacy about everything. So of course, yes, the drone is going to go over your backyard and see
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:51.480]   that you have weeds. Fine. Fine. But when we get past that kind of techno panic stuff,
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:56.520]   clearly there's tremendous use, clearly there's tremendous benefit. Now, what's interesting to
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:01.240]   me is that if this really does start taking off, especially in the suburbs, city, it's going to
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:08.200]   be really difficult. Yeah. But in the suburbs, Amazon is going to start killing off more stores.
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:18.040]   Yeah. Well, I mean, and certainly the amount of people that's required to, like, doubling their
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:24.120]   workforce for things like fulfillment and everything and delivering and all that kind of stuff.
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:30.920]   Well, I guess delivery is more in the hands of UPS, FedEx, and whatever. But I'm imagining that
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:37.320]   a drone workforce is going to cut down on their need for labor and stuff, at least to some degree.
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:45.320]   Like, right. Sorry. Go. I was just going to say it certainly could impact UPS and the mail service,
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:50.920]   which has benefited greatly from Amazon's delivery. And so they've got to be worried about this.
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:57.640]   But probably not entirely. I mean, you can't lift everything with the drone. They're not going to
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:05.000]   make drones big enough to lift a 60 inch TV screen and deliver it at your door. So there's going to
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:10.040]   have to be delivery drivers anyway. But you would almost think, you know, all the tiny little packages
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:14.920]   that you get, either in the bubble wrap packaging and all that kind of stuff, whatever it is. I mean,
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:20.840]   there's so, they must just be monotonous at this point. But, you know, I wonder if it'll lead to
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:26.280]   cheaper, cheaper delivery, or at least cheaper cost for Amazon to be able to deliver that way as
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:35.080]   well. Yeah. Right now, the FAA requires line of sight for drones. And it also prohibits flying
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:39.720]   over people. So these are things that are going to have to be overcome in order for this framework
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:45.400]   to be figured out. They're targeting 2017 as the time, the year that this is going to be figured
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:50.520]   out. So next year, but I guess that remains to be seen. I'm open to it. I'm certainly not
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:55.240]   concerned. You know, I'm open to it as long as I'm expecting it. You know what I mean? Like,
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:59.960]   I'm cool with the drone landing in my backyard. If I if I said, Hey, drone, delivering me this
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:05.960]   thing, that sounds great. I don't see why not. I think breed breed, O drones, breed,
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:11.800]   drones, is going to do it. That's the killer wrap. Yes, exactly. All of the burrito places are
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:16.920]   going to employ their own drones for delivery. And I think Chipotle is finally going to overcome their
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:24.040]   PR. We have a story in the rundown. I think I put it under under numbers. That's fine. The guy
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:30.760]   ate burrito every day. He ate Chipotle every single day. And boy, is he come? This isn't like
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:35.160]   Jason. Yes, some way guy. We know where that last story. Do you do?
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:44.600]   So this guy is eating Chipotle every single day. So how long has he been eating Chipotle?
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:51.160]   I I think even go for it. But I was just going to say you eat any you eat any okay. So for every
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:57.800]   day for a year, man, that's got to get old. I mean, Chipotle, sure, I'm sure it's good. I've
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:01.880]   had Chipotle a couple of times. I know you guys have a thing on this show for Chipotle. I've had
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:07.720]   a couple of times. It's all right. It's good. I'm not rushing out to Chipotle any time soon again,
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:12.040]   but it was okay. But anytime you eat the same thing every single day for an entire year, man,
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:18.200]   that's got to get old. But is this just to prove that you can and still be totally cut?
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:25.880]   I guess he's doing it as a diet discipline. Okay. There's no different from the ill-fated,
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:32.440]   well, or infamous Jason with Chipotle. It limited your panoply of food.
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:37.480]   Got it. Maybe being bored with your food is not a bad thing. That's true.
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:43.960]   That's not to mention. I mean, he didn't get to look like that just by eating Chipotle.
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:50.520]   There's more to it, Chipotle. You don't go from A to Z just by going to Chipotle. You've got a
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:58.440]   lot of workout to get to look like that. With enough exercise, you can probably eat just about
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:04.120]   anything you want. In fact, people that do the body building stuff, they actually have to bulk up
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:12.040]   in order to get the muscle on. I think the exercise probably goes a little bit further than your
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:15.960]   choice of which fast food place to eat at. What do I know?
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:22.920]   Yeah. If you scroll down on that article, you get an Instagram post, which is basically the
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:29.560]   before and the after. Keep going down a little bit further and you'll see the other you go.
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:35.000]   Now you've got the before and the after. So you too could go from this to this by just eating
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:41.880]   Chipotle and nothing else whatsoever. Don't do anything else. That's all you got to do.
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:45.720]   I'm not over promising, right? All you have to do is eat Chipotle burritos for a year and
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:50.440]   you too will look like that guy. By the way, I just want to put up with it. They don't have
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:55.000]   them here. I don't think in California, but just put a plug in for Mose Southwestern Grill
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.320]   for those of you that have them. I like them a lot better. But that's just me.
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:06.840]   The end of it. I lived in Ohio. I think so when I walk in, they always scream welcome to Mose.
[01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:11.640]   Yeah, that's right. They're like, quick yelling at me. I like their phone.
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:17.160]   They would let me mix it up more than Chipotle would. Oh, the bones. The most
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:23.640]   stuff doesn't feel quite as fresh and oomphie, but I do like that they have queso long. Yes.
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:26.360]   Exactly. That makes me happy. Yep.
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:31.320]   It makes everybody happy. Jason is stuck in a burrito sandwich.
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:35.880]   Pretty much. I'm trying to think of technology and I can't because I'm just thinking of like
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:40.440]   guacamole right now. This is what you get. What is going on? It's actually for those of us that
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:44.440]   haven't had lunch yet. I mean, I don't know. Exactly. I ate lunch. I actually ate Mexican
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:50.200]   for lunch. So it was some Mexican food, some tacos. So I had lunch. So this is great conversation
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:57.560]   for me. Like I what? Android what? Can you eat it? I don't know. Well, you can eat a new get. By the
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:02.600]   way, have you guys eaten new? Good. I mean, have you have you like actually gone out and got like
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:08.680]   a box in your get and tried it anytime recently? I feel like new gets like. No, and I was appalled
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:15.160]   that that poor Mike Elgin when he was on the show two weeks ago from France, he for the joke,
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:22.680]   he had those slice off a piece of nougat and it was $40. What? Whoa. Yeah. No way. Who knew that
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:27.720]   nougat was that expensive? I know. Was it good? Like did he say it was? He said it was good. Yeah.
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:36.200]   Okay. Yeah. Nougat. It's just it seems like a nougat in Milky Way. I thought nougat's in Snickers.
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:41.160]   Snickers. That's right. Yeah. It's in Snickers. It's the really kind of chewy stuff layered in
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:45.560]   Snickers. Yeah. Nougat seems like like good in things. But by itself, I don't know, we got a box
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:50.840]   of nougat for all of that Android when when we knew the name and I don't know. It's very
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:56.200]   underwhelming of all the desserts that that we've had as an as Android or treats that we've had as
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:00.920]   Android names. Probably my least favorite. But oh yeah, it is in Milky Way. Milky Way is a barn made
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:06.440]   of chocolate malt chocolate malt nougat topped with caramel and covered with milk chocolate.
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:10.760]   I'll see. But I like Milky Way. I think it's a corporate redefinition of nougat. I suspect the
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:18.600]   French would say that's the call. Yeah. Yeah. Not quite the same. Yeah. Toblerone is also a nougaty
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:26.040]   treat. Oh, that's interesting. Supposedly. Yeah, supposedly. Yeah. Anyways,
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:33.480]   should be would should be should we? There we go. Should we be worried that Comcast wants to
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:40.040]   is asking the FCC to loosen restrictions that would allow them to sell user browsing data
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:45.560]   to advertisers? What do you guys think? AT&T apparently already does this.
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:51.240]   Is it at an individually identifiable user basis? That I did not see. I did not see whether it was
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:56.440]   specific to a user. I mean, it would have to be well, actually, no, it would have to be at least
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:02.760]   if you take AT&T's example, they did this last year. And what that allows for you can actually pay
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:07.960]   extra to not be tracked in this way. So it's like a feature that you have to pay extra for to not
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:12.280]   be tracked. But what they end up doing is they sell that to advertisers who will then like mail you
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:20.840]   based on your browsing history, you know, mail, email, just general web browsing. So yeah, I would
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:24.920]   have to imagine that at least to some degree, this is this would be tied to you if it's similar to
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:30.120]   AT&T's gigapower service. But I mean, it's different, right? Like we talk all the time about
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:36.360]   allowing companies like Google and Facebook kind of into the world because we get a product from them
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:41.880]   that may or may, you know, if we're okay with doing that, then hopefully we're doing that because we
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:47.640]   get something in return that's of equal value to us. They're free services, let's say. But when you
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:53.400]   talk about ISP, I mean, tech, tech companies is one thing. They have certain access. ISPs have
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:58.040]   the whole enchilada, the whole enchilada, so to speak, the whole burrito. Yes, the whole chipotle.
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:01.080]   Yeah, that does make one nervous. Yes.
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:06.760]   I don't think it should be I don't think you should be I mean, they should be paying you,
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:11.080]   right? Or something you shouldn't have to pay to get out of it though. I mean,
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:15.400]   there should be free to opt out, right? Absolutely.
[01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:19.240]   Like that I can do it to people. I can go to Google and say, don't track me.
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:23.560]   Right. The real way to do it is an option that would that would I think end up being popular is
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:29.320]   will pay you if you go to this data, will give you a privilege if you give us this data. And then
[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:34.120]   that's a that it's a choice and you benefit from it too. And it's fully in your hands. Then people
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:39.080]   aren't going to complain and scream privacy because it's clearly their choice and they're rewarded.
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:41.240]   And are they rewarded sufficiently? Well, that's a marketplace.
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:47.400]   There's a lot of efforts over the years to come up with marketplaces for your data. It's complex
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:52.360]   because you don't really want to remember the early days of Facebook privacy stuff. You have to set
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:57.320]   a whole bunch of rules in the beginning and then you get a headache. But in this case, yeah, I think
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:03.720]   they could say here's something. So Leo and I both use the Google surveys thing. Yep,
[01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:09.400]   which is kind of ridiculous. But the fascinating thing is that it'll often say to me, you know,
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:14.120]   what the survey it does most often is we have a question for you based on your shopping history.
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:19.080]   And of course, it knows exactly where I was. And it asked me, when were you there to clearly prove
[01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:23.640]   that I'm credible? And then it wants me to just rate them. Okay, so three stars, four stars.
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:26.600]   What difference does that make for them? I'm not sure why they're getting a lot of value out of
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:36.200]   this unless what they're really doing is paying me 10 cents to verify their GPS activity. And if
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:41.160]   they know that I went to Walmart on Saturday, you know, June 1, then they know when everybody
[01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:45.000]   went to Walmart on Saturday, June 1. And I'm okay with it. They're paying me 10 cents for that
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:51.160]   information. Would everybody be freaked by that? No. Yeah, but at least you know, at least they're
[01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:55.400]   asking you, do you want to take part in the survey? And they're paying you that information.
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:59.480]   So I mean, there's two points right there, which are really important. I mean, I just got
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:06.680]   that survey this morning that said, we noticed you went to your bank. Well, I didn't go to my bank.
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:11.560]   I went to a grocery store that had a bank inside of it. And that's the kind of information that
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:16.920]   Google can't necessarily get just just by tracking your GPS because there's a bank there. There's a
[01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:21.480]   grocery store there and one's inside the other one. They don't know which one you went to. But
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:25.640]   with the survey and me agreeing to it and then paying me for that information, then I can say,
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:29.000]   yes, I did. I actually didn't go to the bank. I went to the grocery store. I mean, that wasn't
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.800]   what the survey was about. But just as a for instance, there is just some data that you can't
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:37.640]   tell even by browsing, right? I mean, there's a lot you can tell by people's browsing history.
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:41.560]   There's a lot you can tell by people's network traffic that goes across their
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:47.160]   ISP and the routers and all that. Another perhaps a good reason to use a VPN, by the way.
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:51.400]   But you can't tell everything. You're going to get a lot of false positives from that data.
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:56.200]   And so by taking it one step further, and when you do that, you do it in a more public way that
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:59.880]   says with someone's permission, that says, we want to collect this data and we may pay you for it,
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:05.000]   I think that's a great way to go. So it's been really interesting experiment. So to, after
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.800]   Jeff, you and Leo turned me on to the Google surveys thing to see what comes up and what
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:12.520]   they're pulling from my history and stuff, it's actually very insightful.
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:17.800]   It's fascinating. Yeah. I have not checked out the Google surveys thing.
[01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:21.640]   Oh, you should definitely do it. How do you sign up for it? I forget.
[01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:28.360]   Is it the consumer surveys? Is it the consumer surveys site?
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.280]   No, it's probably not. You just download the idea. There's an app for it.
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:36.920]   What is the name of the app? Or I actually can't remember. It just comes up for me occasionally.
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:39.080]   Yeah, I can't remember it. I'm looking it up right now.
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:41.320]   Oh, I'm in the awards. There you go.
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:43.320]   Awards got it. Okay. No, I'm for. Yeah.
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:48.360]   Well, so here's the deal. I end up earning, you know, like 250 every five days or something,
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:53.960]   but I buy a TV show with it. You feel like it's, hey, Google has a currency, which is entertainment.
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:57.880]   I get some free entertainment. Sure. I answer some questions. That's that.
[01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:01.640]   Whereas United Airlines gave me a thing where you can earn miles by doing this.
[01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:04.840]   So if I know, all right, I'm a big United guy. I'll do that.
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:08.840]   But it was JD power and other kinds of things that we got extremely personal,
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:12.600]   asking whether I had prostate cancer. And even though I've told the world that I have,
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:18.280]   did I really want to tell them that? And in the end, I only earned 50 miles.
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:23.720]   So I said, no, now I did a dollar amount, maybe equal to the two dollar show that I get.
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:27.880]   But somehow the two dollar show felt like it was worth more than this intangible mile.
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:34.520]   Yeah, 50 miles is not very much. I don't know. But, you know, that's going to be harder to find
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:43.400]   value in than something that you can watch right now, for sure. We're getting a little bit empty
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:48.520]   here, but definitely one thing I'm really excited about. I'm curious what you guys think about.
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:54.920]   It is Magic Leap. So we talked a little bit about VR today. Magic Leap, a new, you know,
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:25:01.240]   it's this ultra secretive, you know, company that basically Google and many others have invested in.
[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:08.680]   It's kind of an augmented reality product that has yet to be anything tangible, but yet they've
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:13.000]   had millions upon millions of dollars invested into it. I can't remember the exact amount,
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.160]   but it's something like 700 and some odd million dollars without any sort of product.
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:21.320]   And every once in a while, they release these little videos that kind of showcase what you'll be
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:29.960]   able to do in this augmented reality world. They just released a video from a conference in China
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:35.560]   that basically shows a user measuring the space in their room and shopping for lamps
[01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:38.600]   in order to fill it with. Kind of sounds a little bit like Project Tango, right?
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:43.240]   Right. We saw that at Google I/O and actually when we were at Google I/O,
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:46.440]   they were showing off Project Tango on the stage and some of the things that they were doing.
[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:50.280]   And it really felt like based on what I had seen and what we'd seen from Magic Leap
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:53.960]   over the last year or so, the little bits and pieces that we have anyways,
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:58.360]   because we haven't seen very much, they really reminded me of similar products.
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:03.320]   Although what I understand about Magic Leap and from what they've kind of said in little
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:08.520]   talks and stuff, we're starting to hear more and more is that they expect it to be some sort of a
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:14.920]   low profile, all glasses type form factor that you would potentially wear all day.
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:22.680]   So I don't know how soon Magic Leap is coming around for everyone to check out finally.
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:25.720]   I don't know more or finally going to get any more information about this,
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:29.400]   but it sounds really fascinating. Have you guys been following along with kind of the
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:34.040]   Magic Leap thing? Are you interested in it? What do you think? No.
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:40.840]   I'm interested, but I haven't been following. So I guess there's two parts. There's two different
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:44.760]   answers to it, the two questions. But I am definitely interested in it. I mean, you know,
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:51.240]   there's also been talk about leaving Google leaving a microphone on all the time to listen to
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:57.320]   conversations and things like that. So I think it is really interesting. And I think it goes to
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:03.320]   what we were just talking about, right? You get more and more relevant things when you have more
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:08.280]   information. And that's what this is really all about. But of course, again, there, I'm sure
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:13.720]   there will be plenty of concerns about privacy and all that too. So I think this kind of,
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:17.320]   and with Google Glass and things like that, I think it just comes with a little caveat that
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:24.440]   says, hey, just be aware, you may need to have some sort of a little LED light that comes on when
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:28.920]   this thing's on or some notification that this thing is listening to you or watching what you do
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:33.480]   or whatever. There has to be some because obviously you can't, I don't think anyway,
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:40.360]   you could take that thing out and leave it somewhere and walk away and have that be
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:46.280]   in somebody's home, let's say, and have that be legal, right? You could put it in a public place,
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:49.640]   but not in a private setting. So there's going to have to be something.
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:55.400]   Yeah, it's going to be interesting. I guess there's a lot of Hollywood kind of action around
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:59.880]   this too. Peter Jackson, who did The Lord of the Rings trilogy and all that.
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:07.000]   He's seen the technology and he's like way on board with it, apparently. Star Wars or Lucas
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:14.440]   in San Francisco, Lucas is actually has a part of its campus dedicated to
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:19.000]   Magic Leap kind of test area where they're playing around with it and allowing people to kind of
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.640]   come in and mess around with the technology. And also you were just showing Carson kind of a
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:29.800]   little bit of video shot with Magic Leap that would superimpose the characters into your space
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:35.080]   and actually use a table that you happen to have in your space to project imagery onto.
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:38.200]   They're talking this up to the point to where they're saying that when they put
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:43.880]   fake, when they put artificial people in the room with you while you're wearing the glasses,
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:49.800]   they actually have to change the brightness of those people slightly so that when you're looking
[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:55.640]   through the goggles, you take that as a clue that that is in fact not a real person. They say that
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:29:02.440]   it's that believable, that the experience is way better than what we've seen so far. And I don't
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:08.760]   know how much of that is hyperbole or not, but that's the kind of stuff that gets me very interested in it.
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:16.520]   Kind of that elevated reality experience. Yeah, it goes back. I think that the expense of this
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:22.200]   is huge. Trying to build this stuff is mightily important. The expert I was talking today in my
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:25.720]   office said that you really need to have is he put up the picks and shovels, you need to have
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:30.280]   the software, you need to have the ability to build your own stitchers and other things to really
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:37.480]   push this. That means that a lot of this remains in San Francisco and LA. In my world, in New York
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:41.320]   and media, I think we've got to deal with the reality of what exists today. What exists today
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:47.080]   is 360 photography and 360 video. Yeah, that's pretty much it in terms of what is possible. And
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:52.840]   Facebook can show both 360 photo and video without goggles. That's going to get you some critical
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:57.560]   mass and value. There's applications like real estate that start to be of value. So that's what
[01:29:57.560 --> 01:30:03.160]   I'm paying attention to now. I think the far out stuff will be out there. And people with a lot of
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:08.280]   money, like movie producers and advertisers and brands will be playing with it. There will be a
[01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:12.520]   critical mass. There will be a richer on investment. But God bless them, play an experiment in a way
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:17.160]   and we'll see what falls back on us then. Right. Kind of trickles down to everyone else eventually
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:23.720]   in lower cost hardware. So I don't know if there's anything before we get to kind of the picks and
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:27.320]   everything. Is there anything in here that we didn't talk about that either of you guys really
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:31.240]   want to make sure it gets in there? So as we got to that guy who eats Chipotle every day,
[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:35.240]   and that was the big one. All right. All right. Just wanted to make sure we definitely talked
[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:39.480]   about the guy who eats Chipotle every day. And I agree that is very important because those
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:43.800]   abs are really impressive after one year. I guess we should mention for the record,
[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:49.640]   Uber giving up on China and merging with or handing over to GEDI. China is just an impossible
[01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:53.480]   market. And every single American company in European company that tries to go to China,
[01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:59.720]   you just can't do it. Man, Uber had design. I mean, they had big plans for
[01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:04.200]   dominating China. And just man, after two years just did not work out for them. So well,
[01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:08.280]   yeah, go up, go up. So you guys, you guys don't want to talk about the Pokemon go update?
[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:11.800]   Well, tell us what about the Pokemon go update?
[01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:15.160]   I don't know what it has to do with Google. I guess it sort of does.
[01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:18.760]   Yeah, we've talked about a lot of things that nothing to do with Google Cloud computing and all
[01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:23.160]   that, right? I mean, so there was an update that came out where they fixed a few things,
[01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:28.120]   it was the first major update they've done since the app was released. It took away footprints.
[01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:31.800]   That was the big deal, right? So you can't see how close the stuff is to you anymore.
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:38.680]   But they did do some things to ease people's concerns or address the issue that some people
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:42.840]   had about telling you, look, don't drive. If you have the app open and you're driving,
[01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:47.720]   it'll say, you know, we don't drive and use the app at the same time. Certain things like that,
[01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:52.920]   they added some security things. And so that was good. It'll be interesting to me at least,
[01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:56.200]   one thing we want to do is we want to add the maker space as a PokeStop.
[01:31:56.200 --> 01:32:03.160]   You still can't do that. So if they get that capability, I know we'll be interested because
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:08.200]   we're thinking about doing all sorts of things with 3D printed Pokemon, maybe leaving those out
[01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:14.280]   where the Poke stops are so that people can find a real life 3D printed Pokemon to take back with
[01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:19.640]   them just for fun. Yeah, yeah. So we'll see if that ever happens. But anyway, the app was updated,
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:24.520]   a few new features, a few features they took away, which probably helps them in terms of
[01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:29.800]   traffic and congestion since they don't have to calculate all those footprints now.
[01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:35.320]   I guess people were theorizing that that actually was kind of a concern to have to
[01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:42.280]   calculate the distances where these creatures may actually be in relation to your given location,
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:45.160]   could have been dragging down the servers. And so that might have been why they got rid of those.
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:50.840]   Oh, I see. Right. Actually, that's a lot of sense. Yeah, but people were kind of upset about that.
[01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:54.360]   I doesn't bother me at all because I never found it a useful feature to begin with.
[01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:59.080]   I couldn't figure that part of it out. So I'm sure you guys both might find Pokemon Go, a useful
[01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:06.120]   feature. I open it every once in a while and throw a Pokeball from time to time. That's about all I do.
[01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:10.040]   I don't go out and explore with it. I probably should maybe a little bit. It's funny because
[01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:13.560]   sometimes, you know, we don't often, but occasionally we'll go like to downtown San Francisco with the
[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:17.000]   kids. And the kids kind of don't like it because you always get stuck in traffic and they,
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:21.880]   it's going to take forever and blah, blah, blah. And now they're like, can we go to San Francisco?
[01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:29.160]   There's like a million Poke stock. So it actually is. It is working in the positive sense that they
[01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:32.120]   actually want to get out and take a look at things and they're looking at things a little bit
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:37.320]   differently. Maybe it's not the way that we would, you know, we would hopefully hope that they would
[01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:41.960]   engage in the culture and the in the diversity and all that. They're not really there yet,
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:46.600]   but at least it's getting them out and about and looking at things that perhaps they haven't really
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:53.400]   looked at before. Yeah, better than not, I suppose. Better than not. Yeah. I still kind of, my brain
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:57.240]   is programmed. So where if I'm outside and I see someone looking at their phone, I still kind of
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:00.760]   automatically assume they're playing Pokemon Go. They're probably just reading a text message,
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:04.280]   but at this point, it's like it's it's permanently altered in my brain. Yeah.
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:12.840]   All right. Hey, let's do some pics and we'll start with Aaron. I'm sure you've got a project of some
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:18.040]   sort. That's kind of what you do with the makerspace, which I do. I do, but you're it's actually an
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:22.280]   app today. Okay. I will show you some makeery things. Do you have it installed already? Yep,
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:28.840]   I installed it. Oh, let's see where it ended up on my screen here. You're fast. So let me set this
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:33.720]   up for you. So one of the things that we do here at the makerspace is we do, or we call it the
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:37.960]   Raspberry Pi or Dween O night where you can come learn about these little computer platforms and
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:43.000]   learn how they work and things. And one of the questions people ask most often is, okay, so I've
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:48.680]   got my Raspberry Pi onto the network and it pulled an IP address, but I have no way of knowing what
[01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:54.440]   that IP address is or how to actually log into it because I disconnected it from the monitor I was
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:58.760]   using in the keyboard. And I know it's on my network somewhere, but I can't find it and log into it.
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:04.040]   And so a lot of listeners probably already know about these utilities, but there are utilities out,
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:09.000]   especially for your mobile devices that can help you find IP addresses on your network.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:14.040]   One of that is, is I don't know if it's pronounced Fing or Fing. I think we've talked about it before.
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:21.240]   I prefer. I like Fing better. Should I okay, first of all, before you continue on,
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:25.080]   should I be worried about showing the screen because it's showing a bunch of IP addresses,
[01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:30.120]   we think, not this screen. Well, no, no, no, but the screen. Yeah, the app.
[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:35.640]   That's a good question. You know, we could just do with the stick with that. I don't want to make a
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:40.760]   horrible state. Yeah, we don't want to do that. So anyway, but it will show you the IP addresses on
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:44.520]   your on the network that you're connected to and it'll even show you some things like, hey,
[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:51.560]   this device has multiple IP addresses associated with it. So in some cases, your Raspberry Pi,
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:56.680]   for example, might be hidden behind, might have a couple IP addresses. One of them, you can actually
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:36:00.760]   communicate with the other one you can't. So you can click there and see what the other IP addresses
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:06.040]   and communicate with it that way. And when it pops up on your network, it usually says the host name
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:11.320]   of the computer, which in this case would be Raspberry Pi. So for people that are getting into
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:15.880]   Raspberry Pi, they're just starting out and they need a way to find the Raspberry Pi on their network.
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:20.280]   This is a great way to do it. Not only that, but this is just a really cool app to have any way
[01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:25.240]   to be able to take a look and see if there are other computers or devices on your network that
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:31.000]   you may not be aware of. Maybe you don't have the wherewithal to be able to log into your local router
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:36.040]   or gateway at home and find that information. This is a great little way just to open that up and see.
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:41.720]   There are other apps as well on the marketplace. The one I use is I think called Wi-Fi Analyzer
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:46.440]   that will do this and more. It'll also show you Wi-Fi signal strength. So you know whether you
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:54.360]   should move your Wi-Fi to a different channel to be able to maybe have more room away from your
[01:36:54.360 --> 01:37:00.040]   neighbor's Wi-Fi, for example, because it's all basically broadcasting on a similar frequency.
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:05.000]   And by moving the channel around, you can actually get a little bit better reception on your Wi-Fi
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:10.040]   at home. So it's a little bonus there for you if you want to take a look at that. But for finding
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:14.840]   devices on your home network that are difficult to track down, highly recommend either Wi-Fi
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:21.480]   Analyzer or F-ing as I like to call it at home. And by the way, one other thing since we're on
[01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:25.960]   my pick, the pick that I had last time I was on this week in Google, I got a lot of tweets about
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:29.960]   people saying, "How do you build it? Can I build it?" It was a little box, had a little keypad that you
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:35.720]   could play a sound with. So I actually did a full-on instructional with a video. So for those of you
[01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:39.480]   that were asking me where they can find more information on how to build it, where to order the parts,
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:43.320]   all of that stuff, please go check out the instructional. It has all the answers there that
[01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:46.760]   you'll ever want in terms of how to build that simple little box. Or if you're just looking to
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:51.000]   get into Arduino and you're looking for a project to start with, this is a really good one because it
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.880]   teaches you about how to interface with devices, how to play a sound or two. It's nothing that's going
[01:37:55.880 --> 01:38:03.640]   to be too difficult for a novice user. So go check it out. Nice, only costs $12 for all the parts to
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:07.480]   put it on together too. That's a $12 secret code box. I think I called it.
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:18.040]   Very cool. Find that on instructables.com. Jeff, you have a lot of numbers in here. What's the number
[01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:25.400]   you want to go with? Well, it could be how Google asks for what you make in your previous job,
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:31.480]   but they don't really use it in determining your pay because they only use it for data. So to find
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:35.400]   out what a rail is paying, but they pay based on the job, not the person. So I found that interesting.
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:39.400]   I found an interesting. The Nielsen is going to measure the TV chatter on Facebook,
[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:44.040]   which is another way to look at the real ratings. But I think I'll go with this one
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:49.160]   because I found it moderately interesting. Who was it who did this?
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:57.400]   Center for Responsive Politics looked up the campaign contributions for employees of Facebook
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:03.560]   and Twitter. And two Facebook employees and one Twitter employee gave the Trump campaign
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:11.480]   as opposed to 349, I think the number was, who gave to Clinton, the two companies together.
[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:20.120]   Wow. So I found that illuminating. I'll just leave it there. Wow. That's a that there's a wide
[01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:27.160]   gulf. I don't know how much more I'm willing to say. Meanwhile, Trump's campaign while we were on
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:32.520]   the air insists that they basically close the fundraising gap with Clinton this month
[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:36.600]   based on small contributions. So those small contributions are not coming, it would appear
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:42.200]   from Twitter and Facebook employees. One thing that I will say is I saw an update on Twitter last
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:48.120]   night that made me laugh out loud. And it said something to the tune of the 2016 political race
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:52.600]   is as if Michael Bay is directing it. And it really it really does feel that way.
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:59.080]   It's a crazy political race. Two great New York Times tweets. One said that that
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:04.120]   with all the things going on with Trump just one day, it's a journalism school test as to what's the
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:10.600]   lead. Yeah, right. Because the way the other word was after Trump says said this week that the New
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:16.680]   York Times doesn't write good. New York Times scribe tweeted me write good soon.
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:26.600]   Okay, I'll leave it there so I don't get you in trouble. Yeah, well, I'm guessing any time we
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:30.840]   we we talk about politics, we probably get at least an email or two. So I'm expecting that.
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:38.600]   That's okay. That's just part of the job. Excellent. So there is that I have an app that actually Google
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:44.840]   just released this morning that I thought was kind of cool. It's kind of an educational
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:50.920]   style app that uses Google Maps and the 3D imagery associated with Google Maps that they've
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:57.000]   you know, curated over the years. It's called Vern the Himalayas. And basically what this is,
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:04.520]   they've taken their map data about the Himalayas and they've you know, laid it out in a three-dimensional
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:09.960]   sort of way. I actually have it on my device right here. I don't know if you have, I'm sure there's
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:15.160]   some sound effects. I didn't check it out if there's sound effects this morning. But basically,
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:18.920]   what is it? Oh, it's it must be nighttime in the Himalayas. That's why it's so dark. But you've got
[01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:23.960]   a little kind of like heat map up here of different points of interest that surround you. And you can
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:31.720]   you're this guy. I think he in scale, your name is Vern and in scale, you're about 500 feet tall
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:36.760]   compared to everything that surrounds you. And you know, you're basically maneuvering through the
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:44.280]   Himalayas and every once in a while you'll come across different things. I've found a glider,
[01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:49.560]   like a glider so I can fly around through the mountains. I'm trying to see if I can find any
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:55.400]   sort of informational point. As you go along, let's see here, you can kind of scroll around.
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:59.240]   You see these little informational points that when you walk up to them, you can you know,
[01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:06.200]   do you hear the audio? I don't know if there's any audio coming through there. I just turned it
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:12.760]   off. That was my accident. There we go. I do not hear the audio, but maybe that's just me.
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:18.120]   Huh, okay. Well, I don't know why it's not playing, but basically there's like an instructor guy
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:22.040]   that kind of comes on and tells you about some of the places that you're seeing. I mean, a hard
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:26.760]   time finding any of these points so that I can show you kind of the interactive elements. But
[01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:31.720]   you start to kind of come across different things that aren't just mountains, but different points,
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:37.640]   you know, places that exploration has taken place. There's a jetpack that you can find through somewhere,
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:43.080]   which I'm having a hard time finding. Oh, here's something. Okay, I got a little jolt. So now I've
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:49.400]   got oh, now I can nice. I can sled through. That's cool. So you find these little things and you
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:55.000]   just kind of get to explore the Himalayas as this little robot guy and learn something new about it.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:59.880]   It's targeted for kids, of course. It was an idea that I guess some kids had and Google just decided
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:04.760]   to kind of create an app about it and take their maps and really kind of bring it to life a little
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:09.320]   bit so that you can explore a world that maybe you've never been to. Probably most of us have never
[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:14.840]   traveled through the Himalayas and definitely not as a 500 foot tall robot. And you can kind of
[01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:19.240]   explore the landscape, learn something about kind of the other explorations that have happened,
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:26.040]   different key points about the region and everything. I don't know. I've wondered, you know,
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:33.000]   because Google has all these 3D maps of the world about taking these maps and making them playable,
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:38.040]   you know, because we're always, you know, we're used to game designers spending so much time
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:42.120]   working on levels and, you know, level design and everything. It's like, we've got the world
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:45.800]   as our level design when you're talking about these types of apps. And this is kind of an example
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:52.040]   about that. But it's pretty cool. What is that? Sorry, that's me. There's there's makers in here.
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:56.040]   Okay, it confused me because I was like, do you hear that? And then that started going. I was
[01:43:56.040 --> 01:44:01.000]   like, wow, that does. That's part of the app. That's really confusing. I was on mute for a while.
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:07.480]   So that but that reminds me. I wonder if they're feeling I wonder if this is a response or maybe
[01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:12.760]   they're feeling a little bit guilty about letting Niantic Labs go now that, you know, they've done
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:17.320]   the Pokemon go think we got to do something. What are we going to do? What do we have? Oh,
[01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:23.640]   we've got Vern. Okay. Yeah, let's do Vern then. Yeah, not quite Pokemon, but that's cool though.
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:28.520]   I like that. Yeah, it's a neat little way to kind of explore and, you know, obviously a little hard
[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:33.480]   for me to find points right away. The Himalayas, it's a pretty big space. So, you know, it takes a
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:37.400]   while to explore in order to find the things, but you find these flags and everything and you can
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:41.240]   read all about it and they'll tell you kind of the story of these different areas. So very cool.
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:46.520]   It's called Vern, the Himalayas for Android. You can go and install it. It's free and check it
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:51.000]   out for yourself. I want to get the jet pack because that's when it looks like you can have a lot of
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:56.920]   fun. You guys, thanks so much for tuning in for this week in Google. And thanks to both of you for
[01:44:56.920 --> 01:45:01.400]   taking it easy on me. I always enjoy coming out of the this week in Google and especially with
[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:07.080]   you guys because you guys are a lot of fun to do a show with. Aaron Nukem, tell us a little bit
[01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:10.760]   about, you know, what you want people to know about the work you're doing and where they can
[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:14.840]   follow you. Sure. Well, you can always follow me online. Like I said, I'm still on Google+
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:19.480]   but Facebook works and Twitter works on Mira and Nukem on both of those, of course.
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:25.880]   I will be on the news screen. There is this Saturday. So you can definitely check me out there live.
[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:32.040]   What is it? 3PM on Saturday or? Yeah, 3PM Pacific. 3PM Pacific. Thank you very much.
[01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:37.160]   And I'm going to have a little surprise. I'm bringing a project. I posted a picture of it up
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:43.160]   on Google+. So if you want to get a teaser about what my project could be that I'm bringing to talk
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:48.120]   about, you can take a look at Google+ and figure out if you can guess what it is. Oh, there it is.
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:55.480]   There. Yeah. What is it? What could it be? You'll find out. Couldn't be Flight Simulator.
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:46:01.160]   That's not what that says. It does say Flight Simulator but that's not what's inside.
[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:07.880]   What's inside the box? What's in the box? Very cool stuff. I always a pleasure Aaron. Thank you.
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:13.480]   Yeah. Thanks for having me. And Jeff, of course, you are here each and every week and it's always
[01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:18.360]   an honor to do a show with you. You will be too for the next six months or so I hear.
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:24.760]   Well, in a few months, yeah, Leo and Lisa are taking a nice vacation. So I think there's a
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:29.000]   string of like three episodes back to back that I'll be along with you guys. So that's great.
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:34.200]   I'm looking forward to that. We will find ways to ruin your life. Excellent. Yes. We didn't quite
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:38.680]   ruin my digital life today. I'm sure we can figure it out. You haven't made a sacrifice for the show.
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:44.840]   I feel like that's kind of required at this point. Jeff, tell people what you want them to know about
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:51.800]   everything you're doing. Well, so I had an interesting conversation today on .nyc, which is the show
[01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:54.520]   we're still trying to figure out. That's where we're kind of not doing it on the Twitter network
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:47:00.280]   yet until we get it. Twitter-ready and Twitter-worthy but very shortly on YouTube, if you look for
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:06.040]   .nyc show and soon on Facebook, I did an hour-long discussion today with Jim Rutenberg, who is the
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:11.800]   new media columnist, David Carr's replacement of the New York Times, and my friend, very smart
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:18.520]   journalism thinker, Jay Rosen, and it ended up being a full hour on Trump because it's such a
[01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:23.240]   fascinating phenomenon right now with news coverage and political coverage. And so I had a lot of
[01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:27.240]   fun this morning. This is my second podcast today, which is nothing compared to you, sir.
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:34.760]   For me, it's a big deal. So .nyc show and it will be up very shortly in both places.
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:39.800]   Excellent. Definitely check that out. I find it on YouTube to kind of get the inside scoop
[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:48.360]   on .nyc. Thanks again, Jeff. Thank you. And yeah, you can find me at about.me/jasonhow. I do
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:52.840]   tech news today here every single day with Megan Moroney. I also do all about Android and Android
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:57.880]   App Arena for the Android-y type stuff. It's probably why we're a little Android-heavy at the beginning
[01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:01.960]   of today's show. Apologies on that for people who watch all of the shows. But there you go.
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:08.520]   But thanks for always making it fun and easy for me to come on Twig. It's always an enjoyable
[01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:16.120]   time for me. Twig is every Wednesday, 1.30 pm Pacific, 4.30 pm Eastern. Is it 20? 30? UTC? I
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:20.600]   think I could be wrong on that. But listen to Leo next week and he'll probably correct me.
