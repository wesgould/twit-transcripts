[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.360]   But we don't host that many shows together every once in a while in new screensavers. So it's nice to have you here
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.600]   Thank you. Yeah, you should hope there's no show you shouldn't be on your your your
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.440]   Knowledge is so wide ranging. There's no show you couldn't be on
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.120]   I think the word for that is poly geek. I'm a poly geek. Yeah
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:26.120]   Paul I want a geek and all the way from Tbilisi Georgia Mike Elkins with us from gastronomat net
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:35.080]   Yep here in the deep in the heart of the south no, not actually we're close to Turkey Russia, etc
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.800]   You cannot participate in what we're about to do no
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.040]   This is this leftover from all about Android last night
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.680]   Yeah, it is and it looked awful on that show. So this is the mystery Oreo flavor
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.320]   I see it all have our Twitter. Have you tried these yet? I don't eat Oreos. Oh, you're just a cop. Oh wait wait
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.960]   No, that's a cop out. That's a cop out. Oh man. No, they're so nasty. Well, some of them are some of the flavors have been absolutely
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.040]   phenomenal
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.040]   this one's really
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.960]   This is so the idea is they don't tell you what the flavor is and oh, I see the no the idea
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.380]   Is they had a bunch of cream left over in the bat and so guess the flavor for a chance to win
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:22.080]   $50,000 so you haven't tried these yet. I have not nor have I now we're told I've been told you need to smell before you eat it
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.560]   I will try one whoa, really? I will not I mean just sniff it. You can at least smell it
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.400]   I know exactly what that it's a double stuff. No, this smells like children cereal like oh
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:39.720]   Oh, I don't know if I want that. Oh, it's just like fruit. Yeah, I don't want to eat it sounds alright
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.320]   So I'm sorry Mike you're left out of this. I am gonna know I'm gonna eliminate this because I know this is chocolate
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.320]   Right. I don't want to eat the wafer just the creamy
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.240]   Dilling they don't still make this at a shortening. Do they is it lime?
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.680]   Do is there an answer on the back that's definitely fruit loops? Oh
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:05.240]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.720]   Father Robert
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.240]   That's horribly bad. We'll get you some water
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:21.280]   So the grand prize where there are two ways to enter text mystery to five is no winner with that thing two six and follow the link
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.640]   to submit your guests or go to aria mystery comments to make your guests and
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.720]   To I don't know how you would do this to enter without making a purchase
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.480]   Or guessing the correct flavors the official rules so you don't even have to get it right to enter
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.500]   So we don't know what the flavor is unless we text them. No, this will be a big unveiling
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.840]   Jammer be can you know I can get the flavor out of my mouth. I kind of like it
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.760]   Can I get some a flame thrower and some coffee? I know that's good. You like it?
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.920]   I like fruit lobster. Okay, I like it
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.160]   Not between a chocolate wafer. That's not pretty bad
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:03.480]   So the only thing the only way is this ties into the show in the any ways that the newest and right is aria
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:11.640]   That's completely a flimsy. Just a bit. It's been a great bit though because he's got enough Oreos for every week of the year
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.440]   And some of those flavors sounded nasty and they turned out to be quite good actually
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.840]   52 Oreos of you know he bought a bunch and all his guests who come in they bring Oreos from around the world
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.800]   I didn't know this there's Oreos flavors that you can only buy in other countries. Wow, it's true go figure
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:33.560]   This is definitely fruit loops. I would really like a Tim Tam for like tea and I would like that to come on to Tim
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.840]   Oh, we have Tim. It's an Australian cookie. Can you get her?
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.560]   Tim's leftover
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.560]   Australian spring is Tim Tams all time
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:49.440]   Is a biscuit with a chocolate coating and they come in. Oh, okay. Yeah, all right who owns fruit loops
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.960]   That's what would confirm the house. Is that an abyss go brand?
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.760]   Aren't they all
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.680]   Actually, we've got someone from the US patent and trade office
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:05.200]   You could probably tell it's an infirmacy with the same thing. This is a pharmaceutical. Is it not?
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.400]   I'll be regulated like one
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.240]   They're definitely changing my feelings and a little dry mouth happening right now
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:20.480]   Oh Mike, can you get us any specific Oreo flavors from Russia and Turkey? No
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:32.040]   Exactly, no, they actually have all kinds of really awesome cookies here that do not take tastes like fruit loops
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.560]   I'll bring some of those. How about that? I'll bring some non-Australian non
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:43.000]   Flintplams or whatever they're called and you'll love them. I heard in Moscow. You can buy caviar Oreos
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.080]   I'm thinking those are probably pretty good. So that sounds delicious
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:54.400]   Kellogg's is a direct competitor. It is to Nabisco. So it's not fruitlet-floured. Okay, so maybe this is a patent and trade office thing
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.400]   I think someone just stole a recipe
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.320]   - yeah, this is Mondalees Leo is actually
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.640]   Is that how you pronounce it? Why do they put the Z is silent?
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.560]   They put a bar over the E like E. It's supposed to be Mona Lee's
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.880]   Mona Lee would be the French pronunciation
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.800]   Mondalee wait, Mandalay?
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.000]   - Mondalee - it's Mondalee. So it's Mondalee? Should I write fruit loops?
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   I would go with lime actually. I think they're lime or lemon. I don't know that really smelled like fruit loops
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.520]   Well, yeah, that was early childhood fruit loops. Yeah, all right. Well, you could enter twice by the way fruit loops is spelled F R O O T
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.520]   - is it? - is it?
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:42.240]   It would be lie. It would deceptive trade practice. That's right. You're one smart cookie
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.960]   Thanks for submitting your daily guess or you can guess as many times as you want
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.480]   That kind of takes the challenge out of it upload a receipt while we can't help you eat the evidence
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:57.680]   We sure could help you earn a bonus entry just upload a proceed a receipt showing your purchase or submit a photo
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:05.840]   You know what okay, I actually want to complain about something okay, and it's team mobile
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.480]   Oh, did you watch do watch baseball? You didn't watch the World Series last night
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:14.480]   Did you and I know Mike you probably couldn't get it? I normally watch baseball, but I did so not watching this series
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.360]   So Fox which is broadcasting the World Series at game one was last night has apparently sold
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.860]   Two second or three second ads in the game
[00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:28.680]   So they'll be this is during the play by play which is I'm telling you I don't want to watch anymore
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:33.280]   I'm so upset and team mobile bought a lot of these and so every like every
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.840]   batter it seems like
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.240]   texts something to
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.000]   Mobile hate those to send two dollars in Hurricane relief to Puerto Rico, which I don't which I support
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.040]   But instead I'm gonna send them a hundred dollars instead of tweeting
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:50.520]   So it's brilliant though because you get for two dollars you get lots of tweets talking about team mobile
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:56.920]   You get these ads in the middle of interrupting the biggest baseball game of the year I
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.000]   Was I was flapper-guested, but the best one is the did you see the YouTube ad? Yes?
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.580]   That okay, that is brilliant. That is the best bit of trolling I have ever seen by a corporation
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:10.120]   So YouTube bought you know they have those interchangeable
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:14.520]   banners behind the batter right and
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.600]   YouTube bought that thing behind the banner
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:26.040]   Where does that play button show up? Where does the play button show up on the TV? You're watching TV
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:31.680]   You're watching the world series where does the play button right in the middle of the screen where you're like you're trying to tap it
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:39.200]   OCD meters around the world went off the scale because they're going with no play play this should be banned. Oh
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:46.560]   Really I thought it was very clever or I think it's I didn't but you know you have to watch this for two and a half hours
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:54.200]   So who's the demographic here because don't only old people watch baseball do young people watch baseball on television?
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:59.960]   I'm that is a real question. I'm not trying okay. Wait a jerk Mike. Do you watch baseball?
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:05.920]   No, but it has nothing to do with my age. I never watched sports ball of any kind so I
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.920]   Don't have to have a punching machine to hurt me
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:17.840]   I don't just do young people not watch baseball anymore. Is it over for baseball? Maybe it is do you got that sad?
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.680]   Well, I mean the thing about this is YouTube doesn't need to advertise
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.600]   They've got brand recognition, but I see what you're saying state like what demographic is yeah
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.240]   who is this in fact?
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:32.040]   When old people like me watch this how would we even know that that's a YouTube button?
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.800]   It kind of makes sense though because essentially lots of people are watching lots of things on YouTube
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:43.240]   Especially nowadays with the new YouTube features. There's a lot of sports and who is who's who are they trying to get?
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:49.080]   They don't need to get young people young people know about YouTube, but the young people only don't have a watch TV
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:54.360]   And remember this is not an ad for YouTube in general. This is YouTube TV, which is there a cable cutters
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:00.080]   My dad actually subscribes to this see so he can watch golf another old person sport
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:05.680]   Wait, well, go away. Wait. I know a lot of young people who play golf. Don't make that an age just thing scooter X
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:11.320]   That's what YouTube bought the tickets if you bought a ticket for the World Series there YouTube was on the ticket
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:16.880]   They spent a lot of money on that big box. Well, maybe it's the only sport they can get okay
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.600]   Aside from the fact that I think it's a brilliant trolling. I just love that
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:25.240]   They didn't really need to do this right look at the size everything everything they must have
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.920]   Yeah, I mean that is exact that looks like a play button
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:36.680]   It feels like an algorithm and it wouldn't if the angle was just slightly off or the elevation perfect like they really they tested this sucker
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:40.560]   I mean, you say it's a lot of money, but is it a lot of money in Google dollars?
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.040]   I mean, it's probably just one one monthly payment to the EU, you know as part of a I mean
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.800]   This is nothing lunch money for them. Look at the tweets
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:54.920]   The location that YouTube logo is maybe has me wanting to touch my TV to start the video keep trying to plus play on my screen
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.880]   Hey, somebody tell Fox to get rid of the YouTube logo on plates driving nuts
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.520]   No, you're confusing Fox's strike zone box with YouTube
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:08.520]   But like like Padre said this is this is excellent trolling everybody's talking about it
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.640]   Yes, that's really all you need well done to do congratulations well done
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:20.440]   Now if they had YouTube TV and it was showing the World Series without that they take it out, okay?
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:25.880]   I see that actually I should check on my YouTube TV if I can get the world series for the world series
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.200]   Well, it's on it's on
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:32.460]   Fox I think it might be on my let me go to my YouTube TV
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.720]   Hold on a second. I was gonna say my husband watches baseball. So and he's my age
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:42.560]   So I don't know if he's older enough. I won F1 racing. Oh, that was just this last week in Austin. Yeah
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.340]   How was it? Oh, I can't do it Microsoft's edge
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:57.800]   Some other product to watch YouTube TV. Would you like me to look and see if I can get the world series on YouTube?
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:04.120]   Do you subscribe to YouTube TV? Oh, no, I don't yes, this is for YouTube TV. Oh, so
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.400]   Oh
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.800]   Was it there in my home you actually oh well came to and
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.840]   And if I press this plus button now, it's gonna TV art
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:21.000]   That's gonna. Yeah, I didn't know they did that and that's good because I could skip through the two-second
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.720]   commercial team up
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.680]   Do you like YouTube TV does it give you something that no other service?
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:31.280]   But it's an advantage for people in certain metros like the San Francisco Metro where we are because we get live TV
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:39.640]   Live local TV. So you see I'm getting channel 2 channel 5 channel 7. Oh, so it's geo located. Yeah, this will give you
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.160]   These are my local stations and not every market has locals
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.160]   But don't you think this is the greatest interface?
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:52.040]   It actually plays plays it live so you could see what's on I mean if nothing else Tivo and the others should learn
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:59.680]   From the UI the uis I think spectacular can you pick your location? So like for example, you're gonna get what you
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.880]   Well, you could you VPN to it?
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:07.080]   Or are they gonna I know I figure Google's probably smart enough to let you do that
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:14.200]   This is and you have I know you have a younger daughter who probably watches some of these young the kids stuff like Disney and
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.400]   She has not she grew up on Netflix and that interesting
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:25.120]   She can watch for any software without any network. Are you like DVR and then take it offline? No record
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:32.560]   Oh, I think you can't someone someone actually was telling me they subscribe to this so they could bring how to videos and programming
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:39.520]   Videos on the plane with them. Well, I have let's see. I have Fargo here because I a DVR that let's see if the menu
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.080]   Let's meet to remove Fargo go to Fargo
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.560]   I don't maybe not well if you take your take your related on YouTube
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:52.080]   I have to go have to stream it which you would expect right well some shows probably you can't do that all of them that way yeah
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:58.920]   Hailed DRM making life difficult, but for instance you can have with one subscription
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:03.960]   You can multi-mobile family members each with their own DVR each with their own channel tunings and so forth
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:07.680]   I think this is it's 25 bucks a month. I think for 25 bucks a month
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:12.800]   This is if you're in a market where you can get the locals a pretty good choice see but for me that's it
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:13.960]   25 bucks a month
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:20.600]   That's all I'm gonna pay every month for entertainment so I could I make YouTube TV the only entertainment I buy a month
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:27.000]   No, you know, that's the problem and I think that's the real problem with court cutting is then you have to add Netflix
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.080]   Mm-hoo Lou probably now you wouldn't need hula if you have this as much you don't have to
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.360]   I'm just gonna point out
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:40.280]   Right the only service I pay for right now is Amazon video because it comes 35
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.400]   I'm it 35. I don't do Netflix. I don't know who I don't do YouTube TV
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.600]   But if you but so this 35 plus 10 bucks for Netflix, which is a pro you know
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.800]   That's a good deal. Okay, and maybe another 15 if you want an HBO
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:57.040]   Then you then you're talking but then but then you rolled in the cost of your connection to right and then your connection
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:03.640]   It's the same as cables and that's yeah, frankly one of the reasons cable companies have slowly ratcheted up the internet prices
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.400]   Because they want it so that well, we'll get you either way
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:12.240]   They knew that 160 buck our who or the trip we just hooked up the community
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.160]   I live in in San Francisco to Comcast and so we had to do business class
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.160]   That's the only way they would come out to our side of the street
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.060]   If we got it if we got just the internet it would have been
[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:27.640]   285 dollars a month getting this exact same internet connection plus a hundred channels is
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:32.160]   95 dollars a month, but you're gonna have to contact them every year, right? This is true
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.400]   This is true, but actually I went into the Comcast store and that's the representative said
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.080]   I'm gonna save I could save you money now, but you have to keep in touch with us every year
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.040]   Otherwise, this will go back to the normal pricing and you'll be sorry
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:51.840]   And they charged us the higher rate and then I called up and I threatened the cancel and they refunded the three months that they had already
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.800]   charged us so it's they don't care they just care they
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:59.920]   You on the cable plant because they actually sell that advertising right that's that's their
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:07.760]   Yeah, but I think you nailed it though Leo the killer thing about this is families because imagine a family where you got a kid in
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.960]   middle school kid in high school kid in college and
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.840]   This is not about
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:18.560]   Another way to get local programming or different types of programming on a TV
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.120]   It's about getting TV on a mobile phone
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.600]   And so kids are gonna want to see their shows on on their mobile phone
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:30.400]   They're gonna want to have their own DVR and the parents are gonna want to have the kids have their own DVR
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:35.840]   Right so because you don't want to wade through all your middle school kids DVR shows
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.440]   To get to your shows and so I think I think really if you think about a
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:48.560]   A family where you have kids going up through the schools or whatever. It's really it's basically so inexpensive to just take care of everybody
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:54.880]   So it's for convenience. That is like the first worldiest problem. I think I have ever heard
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.440]   I hate scrolling through my kid shows
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:03.520]   But there's another reason and that's the stick it to the man and people hate cable companies so much that they will actually pay more
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.680]   Just to stick it to the cable company right tom mare did that
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.240]   Yeah, because it's don't like them and he had to stay on the phone for an hour and a half. Oh, they hate you
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.000]   To pay more that's so our case. So this is a perfect example
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:24.400]   We're we stock home syndrome. So my cable and my internet have been kind of dropping very quickly briefly
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.360]   But i'm watching a show and go and then it come back
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:32.800]   And I know that's the cable because it's on two different, you know, I have a business class and a home class and I know that it's them
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:35.600]   And I know I have to call Comcast
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:40.240]   And I just it's like we can put up with this. Can we we can live with this for a while
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:47.040]   It is actually less painful to have the tv stop every 10 seconds than to call comcast to get it fixed
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:52.560]   That's horrible. No, you just tweet about it and then they call you that's actually yeah, okay faster way to do it
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:57.280]   So I did this many years ago. I when I you know still believed in the twitter
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:04.000]   I I tweeted it back was back when comcast cares and all that. Mm-hmm. I got a call from the executive office. You know what they said?
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:10.400]   Can you stop tweeting? They didn't say we'll fix this then you say will you fix my cable? Yeah
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:16.080]   They really their real impetus was not to fix something. They didn't say i'm sorry you're having these problems
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.680]   We'd like to fix it. They said we'd like what can we do to get you stop tweeting?
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:23.360]   I did I said that's really simple. Just come out here and fix those
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.520]   Make my brand work
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:30.560]   Take away the reason for my tweeting that's it just tells you that it wasn't about customer service wasn't
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:36.720]   All right, i'm gonna get the bad flavor of the oreo is out of your mouth and i'm gonna put it back in when we talk about the pixel two
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:42.240]   Stacy's using her pixel two the pixel two excel display and all that you want me to show
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:48.640]   Tell me when it's time for me to show that almost time. Okay. I'm ready. But first we are going to cleanse your palette
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.360]   With some luscious blue bottle coffee
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.960]   We love blue bottle coffee now you can get it by subscription
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:02.480]   And it is the most amazing when you have a company like blue bottle that has an insane dedication to coffee like i do
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.960]   To be honest
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.720]   You're you're getting by the way, I don't know if they sent it to georgia
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.400]   And i'm sure you have good coffee there, but boy you might want to not that good
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:18.480]   This you know blue bottle. It's awesome. Oh, yeah, and i was just trying to somebody who says oh i only do the single
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.040]   What do you single farm single source?
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.680]   So this is a costarica
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.880]   uh from chirapo regolo de rivas
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.960]   Oh, man just wait a minute to smell that collect them all share
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.760]   Is this smell good? Oh my god, that may leave with me. I know you can take it
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:40.400]   This coffee is the definition of homemade grown processed even dried milled
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:46.000]   On the urenia family farm along the mango trees of rivas costarica doesn't that sound wonderful
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.400]   Years of tinkering have brought its sweetness into focus with the tart complexity that should please its farmer the ambitious
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:58.560]   regolo harrardo urenia as much as it astonishes anyone with a good fortune to taste it
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:03.840]   It's got reineer cherry dried fig and creme brulee notes
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:09.200]   You know we're gonna make some how about if we make a little bit we could taste it the beans by the way
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:14.320]   One of the things is really critical. It's wonderful to get a coffee from a farmer directly
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:19.920]   So that you know they're getting the proceeds directly and you're tasting the unique flavors that they are bringing you
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.800]   That's why blue bottle works directly with farmers all over the world
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:28.000]   85% of the coffee they buy is certified organic most of their blends are certified organic
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.800]   But the key is they bring the beans home. They don't roast them until you order
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.720]   They're all the beans you're going to get are roasted within 48 hours of your order
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.360]   They even have a date and time on it
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:46.400]   So that you know and shipped to you so you're getting and this is critical you're getting the beans have just been roasted
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:52.240]   And they have something for every palette from the lighter fruit flavored profiles, which we just described to the deeper
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.880]   Chocolatey espressos. I'm a big fan of the blend
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:23:03.520]   My mouth is watering the giant steps uh blend. It's it's a really good. You gone in and sumatran
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.280]   They they describe it the notes as viscous
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.200]   fudgy
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:09.760]   and
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.520]   substantial
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.560]   Doesn't that sound like something you want? It's wait with cream in it
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.760]   I like it with cream. Yeah, do you not like cream?
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:22.080]   You got to taste the coffee you could taste the coffee. I like cream
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:25.440]   All right, we can get another one without it. This is the Kenya embo
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.400]   jikirima
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.320]   Roasted
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:35.520]   How could that even possible october 24th? What day is this into the future? It's a 25th
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:39.520]   Wow
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.080]   Come on. You should just try it's not a lot of cream. I already I put my order in. Oh, okay
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.120]   That is really good. That's why he took it away from me
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.560]   Blue bottle is I promise you and if you don't agree
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.800]   No cost to you
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:58.160]   It is the freshest coffee the most delicious coffee you've ever had

[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:36.240]   So this is really oh man. I go to there's a blue bottle I go to in la and I just I love that place
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.680]   The coffee is always just beyond fantastic
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:45.760]   Yeah, I don't know what it is about blue bottle. I don't I really don't but it is is qualitatively different
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.960]   Than any other coffee place. It's yeah, it's not doesn't do it justice. Say it's it's better
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.080]   It just tastes different and I like the different it's cleaner
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.560]   Yeah, maybe like
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.360]   Yes, it tastes like what it's you think something. Yes, right?
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:03.040]   Even if you have the temerity to be cream in it. I know the yeah
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:07.360]   Anything in your coffee you drink it black. I sometimes put sugar in my coffee
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.360]   I would submit the cream isn't as bad as sugar or connie
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.720]   Cream I don't normally put sugar in my coffee
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.600]   But when I go to blue bottles sometimes I order there's a couple of drinks they have that are kind of like these caramelly
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.640]   Forgot what they're called. Then it's like they're here having candy
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:27.120]   Yeah, well, they don't over sweeten it. It's it's just enough so you can smell it
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:33.120]   Just just the aroma. Yeah. Well, it did it. This is they open that box. It was you'll like you like opening that every other week
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:38.160]   Hey, this is just an answer your question. I'm sorry Leo, but coffee in that Georgia. Yeah. Yeah, it's
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:41.440]   It's not great. What they do have in Georgia is is something like
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:47.280]   Also has notes of mango and whatever this is where wine was invented. That's right. That's right
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:52.000]   Yep, absolutely. This is this is um, I think it was travel
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.560]   Oh, it's they met big travel
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.920]   The big travel guide company. What's it called the website?
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:58.720]   or
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:04.240]   Oh trip trip planner trip advise trip advisor. That's it trip advice. Just just named
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.480]   Tbilisi the number one city in the world for wine. They just did this uh
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.720]   Last week
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.720]   And it's absolutely true
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:19.200]   Absolutely true. This whole country is insane obsessed with wine. Well, everybody makes it at home
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.760]   We have some neighbors to the north who might disagree with that
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.240]   Canada. All right. Well, it's on man
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.720]   Canada
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.720]   I don't think they're really
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:32.000]   They're more better for you know, tim's tim Hortons
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:38.720]   Uh, this this just in uh, so we all know about dx. Oh, they're the ones who give the grades for the cameras on the phones
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:44.080]   And on lenses and so forth and they're the ones that google very happily said we have the higher score ever
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:48.080]   Uh, what google didn't point out is the honor the new honor make 10
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.880]   Actually has a higher still photo score of 100
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.200]   What is it? What is the scale on this thing?
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:57.680]   We're at a hundred. Okay. Although now that something's got a hundred. I think they're gonna expand it
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:01.600]   You what if something's better than the the like a lens is in the made it anyway
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:06.880]   They have decided and I'm so happy to hear this to take over the nick collection from google
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:12.960]   So these this was uh, something google bought and used mostly what they wanted snap seed
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.680]   Which google distributes is a free app which is a great app
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:22.480]   But nick was very famous for making uh photo editing tools that everybody all the pros I know loved especially
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:26.480]   Silver effects, which was their black and white their monochrome, uh filter
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.400]   And it has been neglected by google google started giving it away
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:34.240]   So it wasn't like they were charging for it, but they haven't neglected it
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:37.280]   And so i'm very thrilled to hear that somebody's going to take over nick
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.880]   And uh keep that alive, especially silver effects because that is
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.680]   A plugin that is hard to live without
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:48.320]   These are plugins for photoshop and for lightroom, right? Which one do you use? Are you a photoshopped?
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.280]   I'm a lightroom guy and we can talk about lightroom too. That's a big change
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.600]   Uh, this last week
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.600]   uh, at adobe max adobe
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:00.960]   And now that they were going to eliminate the buy it once keep it forever model from lightroom
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.440]   Which is a very popular pro photography
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:10.000]   Tool and require a subscription. I've been subscribing for a while because the creative cloud subscription lightroom included photoshop
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.840]   Lightroom $10 a month. That was a good jeep enough. Yeah cheap enough
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:18.160]   Well considering light rooms 200 bucks by the photoshops like $800. So that was a good deal
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:23.200]   I'm one of these guys who i'm on an old version of this suite
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:29.280]   I'm 5.5 because I don't want a subscription. I want to own my software and forever be able to use it
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:34.960]   Yeah, you're well, you're that's not uh adobe's modeling more. It's not my self-smotting more. I think it's the you know
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.960]   It's not a business model. I understand. Yeah, I understand why they want their model
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:42.080]   They're gonna make far more money. But at the same time, it's like well
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:47.360]   But I want to pay for it. I take my money and let me own it and then i'll buy the next version
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.320]   But yeah, because that's what their model was if we would update it every year
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.440]   They you know and then you'd pay it for a little extra for the updates. So anyway
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:29:00.480]   It's a completely new interface on Lightroom. So we'll see what they they're keeping the old right room as creative
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:05.440]   Lightroom CC classic CC and then the new Lightroom is just like Lightroom CC
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:11.600]   Um anyway, so actually that opens up in the it's maybe one of the reasons dx omark is acquiring nick
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:16.080]   It opens up. I think an opportunity in the marketplace for companies to make lightroom
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.840]   Replacements because I think a lot of photographers are looking for something better
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:24.000]   And I know a number of at least two companies seraph which makes that great affinity photo
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:30.400]   uh and um mac fun which makes a really fabulous kind of lightroom like program called lumenar
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.920]   Are both working towards making their products be a challenger
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.200]   in the
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:40.960]   I remember when google got the collection and I was hoping that it would just become part of google photos
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.360]   I was too. I think this was just odd never happened
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.040]   That's what I really thought would happen and that would have been amazing. That would have been incredible
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:50.560]   You can I wish they'd integrate snap seed into google photos. That would be fantastic
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:56.560]   Snapseed is so good and for most people. I think snap seeds all you really need you get great results with snap seed
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:03.600]   I think what lightroom what's happening lightroom is really adobe acknowledging that really most photography is now done on a camera phone
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.720]   And processed in the camera phone
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:13.440]   For posting on social media. That's mostly what people are doing now and and that's kind of where they're tuning their
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.120]   software
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:19.920]   Uh, all right. You got a pixel 2 and by the way your case looks great on your pixel 2
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:27.200]   What's that theme Leo? It's uh people reading people reading in space women reading in space
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:31.920]   It's it's not women reading in space. It is women astronaut. It celebrates
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.640]   women astronauts
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:38.560]   I've unfortunately confused Stacy by asserting it doesn't look like that at all but
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:45.440]   So that is a woman astronaut. Yes, and that's the planet earth and she's in the module of whatever it is
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:49.360]   Obviously she's not wearing a suit and the book is floating because she's no gravity
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:58.720]   I think it's just a nice case. It's a nice picture. Well, and I activated the live case of screensaver. So my screensaver is also
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:03.920]   A woman in space. Um, I think it always at the same picture. No, it's not the same picture
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:09.040]   It is. Hold on. It's the other side of the portal. Do we have an over the shoulder? So for you
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:11.840]   Yes, I think we do.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.320]   Carson's trying to figure out where it is. There it is
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:21.840]   Okay, so in let's see. I think I can just change all your colors to kind of match to like
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.280]   So this is a
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:25.040]   And let's see
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:31.280]   Go to settings. It's a little lot of focus. Oh, sorry. It's a little bright is mostly with the problems
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.920]   That's because that's because Padre asked me to make a
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:38.480]   That's right. I wanted to see how bright it could get turn it down even more. I would see I'll break that white is yeah
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.360]   Guys, I can't do eight things at once
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.080]   I'm a bad multi-task. There we go. That's perfect
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:48.800]   So this there's a 10-minute documentary where they interviewed three women who were in space
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:54.720]   Um, and it was actually kind of cool because I showed it to my daughter because I'm like go ladies and stem
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:32:00.880]   And there's a there's a moment where one of the astronauts who was a mom talked about saying goodbye to her son
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.360]   Before they did the liftoff. Oh wow
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.760]   And my my daughter looked at me and she's like
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:14.960]   Moms can go into space and I was like, yeah, they can't oh so it was pretty cool. Anyway, did she then say when are you going in space?
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.600]   You know, she didn't she's not a teenager yet
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:24.080]   She's like space. She's sad that I got a good old. The funny thing is that is no longer a rhetorical question
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:29.440]   It used to be a generation ago. Now it could be well actually that's possible. Yeah, there's more are they ticket?
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:35.200]   Uh, there there a woman just came back for the international space. Don't think there's a woman currently in orbit
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:41.760]   There is not one in orbit. Oh, what's she a mom? I don't remember. Yeah, doesn't not that that matters. Are there dads in space?
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:46.640]   I hope so. Yes, they're definitely dads in space because when she get packed from space
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.280]   She may not be a dad because of all the radiation right?
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.280]   Well, have your children first
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.480]   They just had that astronaut come down after a was a year plus
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:33:00.320]   And he his blog is filled with all the readjustments and his bones. It's not easy. Yeah
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:06.400]   Yeah, after all of the exercise that he did to simulate gravity. It's just no the human body doesn't like zero g
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:12.640]   It likes it when it's up there right? It loves it when it's out there. You come back down though into a grab which is uh, the
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:18.080]   Expanse has that they built that into the storyline how people who grew up in a zero g as a great show a great book series
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:23.760]   When they come down into a large gravity. Well, they just can't cope Robert just interviewed the author
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:28.560]   On a trangulation. That's awesome. Scott scott kelly now has his
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.680]   Book out about his year in space called endurance
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:36.720]   Oh, he was interesting because he had a twin and so they were doing all of these medical experiments
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:39.440]   I didn't know that on him, but they were kind of on him
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:45.280]   Because they were they could compare his bone mass and so forth with his brothers to see they were going to compare their DNA to see
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:51.600]   I did they do that? I don't know that would be amazing to see if it like his DNA has mutated because of his exposure to radiation
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:56.000]   And now he has superpowers that doesn't happen. No, unfortunately
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.880]   It's not what i've heard
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:04.960]   Let us uh talk about the pixel 2 xl's display first of all the pixel 2 are you happy with it?
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:11.440]   I am happy and I like the intentional squeeze. I think it's I tried it. You let me squeeze your phone. Thank you
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.360]   and uh
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:17.520]   I I didn't squeeze it that hard, but you can hold it firmly and it doesn't trigger
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:20.960]   That's true. You really have to kind of intentionally squeeze it, but it's not that hard
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.600]   I thought it was just right actually and you can actually so
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:29.440]   There was an option when I set it up to actually kind of customize it. It asked me to squeeze the phone how I wanted to squeeze it
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:33.440]   And so I was like, I think you said it uh nicely, but the point is
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:39.840]   Uh, there is a clear distinction and it buzzes gives you haptic feedback when you squeeze it and it launches the it does
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.840]   And I turn a lot of my haptic feedback off
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.840]   Yeah, did you leave that one on? I get irritated
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:48.320]   And it's nice actually when i'm reaching in my bag with intention to like oh, I need to find this out
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:52.720]   When you're reaching you can just squeeze it as you're reaching into your bag and then it's like
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.440]   I've heard people say that that that's kind of like a natural thing reaching your pocket squeeze as you're pulling it out
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.760]   And then speak immediately
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:04.160]   Uh, the screen looks good. You like it. It's an lcd screen. So it doesn't have any of the burn-in issues
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:08.720]   I was like it's i'm so glad everyone was like, oh the screen on the smaller one is not any good
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.760]   We hate it. It's fine. I'm like oh here's my heads in the way
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.960]   I tell you there are um, there are people with very
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.280]   picky eyes
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.680]   and those are the people the picky people who
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.120]   tweet and review tech educe and write on reddit
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:27.680]   And I looked at the pixel 2 excel at a Verizon store when it was available
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:31.920]   And I did I saw that what they're talking about the modeling with the dimmer screen
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:36.480]   That did not bother me in the least. However, I'm very concerned about this burn-in issue
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:41.920]   That is that is a huge issue that feels like quality control and I don't know what google's gonna do
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:44.240]   And then there's also on the pixel 2
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:50.240]   There's complaints now and I just had this happen about ticking during the phone calls
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:56.640]   So you're getting that I did get ticking. I didn't get there's apparently also a high-pitched audio thing that happens from the speakers too
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:02.960]   Uh, it strikes me that ticking has happened before and um, I think it's an NFC radio issue
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.320]   I think that can be
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:08.960]   Wow, the problem the physical heart-wearing is yeah, that's a hard way for that's not something
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.080]   That's not chilling
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:14.960]   Firmware update that they can do they're gonna have to take the dbs down exactly the firmware means
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:19.680]   When they turn on the cellular radio for a talk, they basically kill off all the other RF
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:22.400]   Which you're not supposed to do that's not good design
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.840]   It means that if you're on a call and you go to use say the NFC it just won't work
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:26.880]   Right
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:31.920]   Here's uh, I used to be on Verizon with the 4G and the CDMA right that was that was always exciting
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.360]   Here's uh, Alex uh, dobe's tweet. This is the
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.360]   I can see it first one to talk about it
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:41.680]   And what you see is the back button the home button and the recents button
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.560]   Those are the buttons that are on all the time of course and they're gonna be
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:49.760]   The ones you're gonna have burned in but you even can see a little line from the dock there
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:57.520]   Um, and so and that's after a few after seven days he said so that is really a cause for concern
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.560]   Oleds do have burning issues. It's not unheard of
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:07.600]   Um, somebody was telling me. I think rene richy. Uh yesterday was telling me that on the samson o leds like like the node eight
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:13.440]   They jitter the display they move it a pixel left pixel right every once in a while
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.480]   Just to avoid that specific kind of burning. Oh
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:22.400]   Samsung is the display used in the iphone 10 the o led and of course the node eight and the s seven
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:28.160]   It is the best display i've ever seen. I think I think everybody agrees even in the node eight. Oh led is fantastic
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:32.320]   It's beautiful. Yeah, I mean it's rich. It's bright. It just really looks good
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.240]   Uh
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:40.000]   But that's not the one that google got they got the lg display the same as in the v30 and I think some are worried that it might
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.400]   Not it might be a subpar a third generation o led
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:50.400]   That's so weird because this is a known quantity on oleds. You know it. It's it's not like lcd
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:54.000]   We're shining a backlight through through a filter. You're actually burning
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.960]   The oleds right to make that light. Well, okay
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.760]   We've known that for what six years now
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:04.960]   So for you not to build that into the firmware where you you jitter or at least play with the pixel so that you're not
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:09.120]   Unevenly wearing them. That's that's almost negligent
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:13.520]   Uh, you know, it's as if they just decided not to listen to their engineers anymore or they're engineers
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:18.640]   And there's there's engineers at the company and then there's engineers at the suppliers
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:23.680]   There's engineers at the factories and the manufacturing and all that kind of stuff and this is uh to me
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:29.360]   This is most likely an example of what happens when you're not apple or samsung
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:34.880]   You know the if you're apple and you're building and your component suppliers are building
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.200]   Uh parts for apple
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:42.480]   You don't mess that relationship up because that it's the end of you and and it's you know the the volumes
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:48.560]   That apple and and also samsung produce displays at just put some at the front of the line
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:50.640]   And so somebody like google comes along
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:54.640]   And they're they have a fraction number of units. They don't have the history. They don't have the back story
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:59.360]   They don't have you know any of that stuff. Uh, they're going to get you know, truth is
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:03.040]   They're they're going to be second in line for the top tier uh phone makers
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:11.280]   And that's been true of every manufacturer in the age of apple apple gets they get the lion's share of the trough
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:16.080]   They can get the best parts and they can lock in manufacturers for those parts even if they're not going to use them
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.240]   They're famous for doing this
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:21.040]   It's they may they may need 10 million screens
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:26.320]   But they're going to sign a contract for 20 million just because that's 10 million that another manufacturer can't get
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:32.880]   Which it's kind of funny, but at the same time it means all all the devices i love are going to get the sub par parts
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.440]   Yeah, it
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:39.120]   So it's not just google that's suffering with its new uh flagship phone
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:45.280]   This morning and some suspected that apple had leaked it to bloomburg bloomburg had a story
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:51.040]   That apple had reduced face id accuracy in order to get the iphone 10
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:59.680]   Out the door we've known of course that the components uh for the iphone 10 were behind it pushed the iphone 10 back a month
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:04.240]   It's you'll be able to order it uh day after tomorrow at 12 o'1
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.960]   Am friday at pacific time
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.200]   uh for delivery next friday, but
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:12.640]   I wonder if people are thinking twice about this apple has
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:19.520]   denied it saying blooburgs claim that apple has reduced the accuracy to be sex spec for face id is completely false, but it was
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:25.120]   A strange denial by the way bloomburgs response we stand behind a report it was a strange denial
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:29.600]   Because it didn't exactly deny that they had done that it was more about
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:32.720]   well
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.400]   We haven't
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.280]   The quality and accuracy of face id haven't changed
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:45.360]   But they didn't say since when so apple i've been on the wrong end of the stick reporting on apple and things that have gone wrong and they are
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:48.880]   They fight you they fight you and they are very
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:55.600]   Knit picky in a way that is heart you're like oh if only i'd put that one word in my story
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:58.160]   Yeah, so i catch off mic i'm sorry
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:04.720]   But but also no but also the the other thing is that these aren't black and white issues at all company like apple always has 10
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:09.680]   Possibilities that they're looking at as they're going into a manufacturing cycle
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:15.600]   And at some point they do the cost benefit on each of the different possibilities and maybe that one
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:23.360]   They there are technologies where they're on the fence where either we put the really really good one at a higher risk into the current model
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:28.320]   Or we keep perfecting it and put it in the next model and lots of people are involved in that
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:33.760]   Process and so a lot of these leaks come from component suppliers and others who are
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:38.480]   Who think maybe their part is going to go in and then they're informed by apple
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:42.160]   No, your part's going to go in some later phone or maybe it won't go in on later phone
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:48.240]   And that from their perspective apple has made a decision to step back the quality
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:52.560]   Whereas with apple i don't you know you see what i'm saying? It's a
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:57.200]   No, this is what we always plan to do option we were thinking something better. We decided
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:00.640]   I guess the point is that at the announcement apple said
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:08.000]   There is one in a million chance of a random person unlocking your iphone with face id and they say we stand by that number
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.800]   It is just as accurate in that respect
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:16.800]   So, uh, yeah, that's part of the accuracy, but there's other things having to do with accuracy does it recognize?
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:20.480]   You twice in a road. Does it recognize you if you were wearing glasses?
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:26.160]   There may be other areas that apple that the spec has changed and they could change something like the algorithm
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:32.480]   And that governs this sort of act they could change the model they could do all that and as long as it fits what they said
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:38.560]   Right all their clays exactly right all their claiming is we it continues to be a one in a million
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:43.760]   So that that's what they're saying hasn't changed. Oh, there are many other parameters that might have changed
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:47.120]   So i'm not sure i think they in other words they could both be right as you point out
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:51.920]   Uh, mike, it's just uh, it's some it's a little bit of a semantic parsing
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:54.960]   Um, you know apple's very good at that
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.920]   As you have pointed out so i think really the
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:02.400]   For the consumer the real issue is going to be how fast it is how convenient it is
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:08.400]   Not whether there's one in a million chance somebody could duplicate my face because we're very happy with touch id
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.800]   Which apple itself says is one in ten thousand right?
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:16.000]   That's not nobody said oh i'm not going to use touch id somebody might spoof it
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.600]   What we look for is reliability so it works every time it works fast
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:25.200]   Uh, it works even if my fingers not right or my face isn't right
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:32.240]   Those are the things that consumers really care about and so i'm but those aren't the things that apple cares about what apple apple cares about is
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:35.440]   This this animoji thing is part of the face recognition
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:42.240]   Process animoji is where it looks at your face and then it animates the facial expressions of a in an avatar
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.720]   Uh as you're chatting and that sort of thing
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:49.600]   We're right on the brink and this isn't just an apple thing. This is going to be in all the android phones
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:54.400]   We're right on the brink of emotion detection and monitoring all the time
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:59.680]   So everything you do with your phone the phone will be watching your face and gauging are you happy?
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:05.680]   Are you sad? Are you thrilled? Are you bored? Are you what's going on with your and this is going to be the new privacy thing
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.760]   So right now
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:13.920]   So that's really what apple's caring about is so how much data can i get out of your facial?
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.120]   Yes
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:22.320]   I I talked to a free scale engineer and you could tell how long ago it was because they were still free scale and not an xp and now not possibly qualcom
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:26.720]   But they were already doing this kind of emotion detection using
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.080]   um
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:31.520]   Face recognition there and so they weren't doing it on a handset yet
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:37.440]   The goal was to put it on handsets and that was always the goal and so imagine if mark zucker bird
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:42.320]   Had the data as you're looking at the facebook timeline. Oh, she looks bored quick
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:45.600]   Feed in some
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:53.360]   Imagine I mean, but that's the data facebook would kill to get right oh and and facebook has the best face recognition technology
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:59.280]   It's better than the fbi's and so that's a it's a short road from that to to emotion detection
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:04.400]   Well, so best they have the best for recognizing a person
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:08.160]   Um, it all like all around them. So yes, not just their face
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:11.040]   Not just but but it's also context related
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:15.440]   So it's in the context of other photos and that sort of thing the the best context
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:21.760]   Aware solution that I've seen actually belongs to a company that was seeded by the cia
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:29.360]   They're one of the cia startups and they've made a software solution that can do not just facial recognition, but body language recognition
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   And they they built that for obvious reasons
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:38.240]   Uh, but it was google has gait recognition. That's another way to authenticate use. Well, you walk like you
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.880]   Uh, what was the video i'm trying to remember?
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:45.920]   Uh, maybe it was you who's talking about it stacy they it was at a self-driving car event
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:48.400]   They had people in the self-driving car
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:56.480]   Mockup and they were looking at their moods and their feelings as they were driving to try to figure out what to play
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:00.960]   In the self-driving car because you're going to be kind of bored
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:07.360]   You're sitting in this box for five hours. You don't have anything to do on a long road trip and they were actually doing a motion
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:10.400]   and uh, feelings
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:13.280]   Testing to see what
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:16.960]   So we clearly we can we can already do this. That's not there's no question about you
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:22.560]   You gotta remember when you when you do the uh, the the setup for the face id on the iphone 10
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:27.760]   You do this so you get all the different angles. It's not just straight on left right
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:34.800]   They they take all angles so they should be able to recognize you even if your phone's not dead on right and I
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.360]   I've heard
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:43.280]   That it's it's actually quite accurate. Uh, it but that also depends on lighting. Uh, so if you've got decent lighting
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:46.080]   It's almost 100 percent
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:48.960]   Mood sensing yes. Yeah
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:54.960]   so uh, but really more to the quotidian concerns of our
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:57.920]   audience
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:03.440]   Should you worry about an iphone 10 or a pixel two xl should you hold off on ordering? It sounds like maybe
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:05.840]   It would be prudent
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:11.040]   To stick with what you got you're happy with the pixel two so until the ticking which i'm hopeful
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:18.080]   They'll fix it so I love this phone. Yeah, I really like it. It's very fast. It's got great pictures. It's
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:19.520]   Oh
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:24.800]   I like always on don't you like always on I do that's I'm like I'm sneaking glances at it all the time
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:28.160]   Uh, and you see the olives have always been able to do that
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:30.400]   So I think mo to rel x was the first to do it
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:34.080]   Robert how they do it on an lcd though like this. I mean, isn't that
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:37.680]   Are they turning the whole screen black with white text? How are they?
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:43.040]   So that's a lot more power hungry than it would be on an OLED where they just turn on those individual pixels
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:47.280]   Well, also the the screen on the pixel two. I believe they can do segmented backlighting
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:51.440]   Okay, that makes sense. Yeah, I can see how much power it's consuming
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.280]   Yeah
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:58.400]   Well, that's another issue by the way and lisa's really noticed this the iphone 8 a lot of people are complaining
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:03.040]   Especially with iOS 11 has terrible battery life. I haven't had that problem at all my plus
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:08.160]   But so maybe specific iphones, but a number of people are saying there's battery issues of the iphone
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:14.880]   So the overall story may be here that at this point in late stage smartphone technology
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:20.640]   Companies are now pushing so hard to get a differentiator to get an improvement to somehow make this new phone
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:27.120]   Better than last year's slab of glass that there may be pushing too hard didn't sam sung do that last year with a note seven
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:29.120]   They did and it exploded in flight
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:34.720]   I mean before before the explodey things the note seven was an amazing phone
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:36.880]   I remember seeing it at epha before they released it
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:41.280]   I love seven and I have to say I love the note just as much. This is a great phone
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:44.160]   My parents charged theirs in pyrex baking dishes
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:50.480]   Because they did not want to do it. They were like it took it took verizon like threatening to turn the phones off
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:57.280]   They got my mom off the the note seven but here's the thing the note seven the note eight the iphone 10 of the the pixel two
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.920]   There's thousand dollar phones
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:04.240]   And this is not a thousand well right right but I mean 650. Yes. Yeah
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:11.360]   I'm more of the range of a three to five hundred dollar phone guy and my my five hundred dollar phone is fantastic
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:16.240]   What are you use right now? I'm on a one plus five. I just I just moved from a one plus one to a one plus
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:19.520]   You're like an essential phone. I was gonna say do you want an essential because the price cut
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:25.680]   Makes it kind of attract. I'll give him mine. I love it. Okay, it's yours. Oh, it's in my mind
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:28.960]   I just got an essential phone and I got the 360 camera on this
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:33.200]   This I feel I you know what this actually kind of makes me sad
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:40.880]   Uh, Andy Rubin who found created Android sold it to google left google after working on robotics for a while and as well as android
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:44.160]   To start his company. It's gonna be a home. We've talked about this before you're gonna
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:47.280]   I'm sure be reporting on their whatever home automation solution
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:52.080]   Kevin just bought an essential phone and I was the first thing I asked him was look for any secrets to the home stuff
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:54.560]   I don't think there is any it's just a kind of stock android phone
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:57.280]   And actually I really like it ceramic and titanium
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:02.880]   The when I got I did not do a pre-pro model and a lot of people who did got bit by bad cameras
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:06.560]   But I don't know if you remember when I opened up my phone and I started taking pictures of crashed in me
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:12.000]   Crash crashed in yeah, it's hard. Not even when you were taking a picture when you opened the app it crashed. Yeah, yeah
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:18.240]   It crashed the phone the phone reset so but since then there've been two or three maybe four
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:23.280]   Updates to the camera at least three that I noticed updates to the camera and it's fine though
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:28.080]   But we had such high hopes for the essential it looked good. You don't get a second chance though
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:33.600]   That's the point is in this market. It's so competitive if you come out and you look at so they're dropping it what by 200 bucks
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:37.760]   But if you spend $800 on anything you
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:40.640]   House I mean
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:44.160]   House's break cars break well an $800 car expected to break
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:49.120]   An $800 device by golly that better be a really good device
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:53.200]   When you get a new car often there's defects you don't you expect them to fix them
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:57.600]   I don't buy the first model here of any and if it was the $300 essential phone
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:02.160]   I would be willing to put up with bugs at an $800 price point it better be a finished product
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:06.320]   You're gonna enjoy this free essential phone. I really see isn't amazing
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:14.560]   No, I like it. It's a little smaller right. It's a big screen because it's edge to edge. It's beautiful
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:16.800]   It's a gorgeous phone
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.760]   You know, there's the problem is nobody's gonna make a case for it
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.920]   Um, you know because there's no ecosystem
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:25.520]   They sold 5,000 that's spread and but I think it's a very very nice phone
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:28.400]   And I have had zero problems once those camera updates came out
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:32.720]   And it has a nice black and white monochrome mode in the camera that I think is quite good
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.440]   I think it's I mean, it's that it'll be the
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:37.440]   Pretentious mode. Yeah, the pretentious mode
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:40.080]   It'll be the best
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:46.640]   What is it if it's $200 less? What'll be 600 bucks? I think it's I can't remember the exact 500
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:51.200]   It'll be I would say it'll be it's the best $500. It's right up there with a flagship phone
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:57.280]   So people should not hesitate to buy it for 500. I think but but meanwhile there's another thread of
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.440]   Interest that's starting to emerge
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:02.640]   And just to throw a wet blanket on this whole conversation
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:10.160]   When smartphones were new they were solving problems left and right they the app stores enables to carry all these things
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.960]   We don't have to buy different devices. We don't have to buy a radio
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.680]   We don't have to buy this don't have to buy that because they were all apps
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:18.480]   There's an app for that they had all the stuff they were solving our problems
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:24.400]   Now we're spending more and more money on smartphones and what problems are they solving? What problems for example
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:27.840]   Does the new pixels solve that the old pixel
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:33.280]   Gave you as a as a person well my old picture broke
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:36.960]   This works that's good. That's good
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:42.240]   Meanwhile the smartphones themselves are causing problems. What are our real problems?
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:47.200]   Our real problems is work-life balance our real problems are we're too distracted from our smartphones
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:51.360]   We're addicted to social media people are getting dumb irk students or
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:57.520]   The grades are plummeting because they're using their smartphones and they can't help themselves from using their smartphones in class during lectures
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:00.320]   There's a new study that came out today that said
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:07.360]   20% of babies under the age of one in Tokyo are using smartphones what?
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:14.880]   Under the age of one where they do it with them their mothers are showing them videos to keep them quiet and stuff like anyway
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:21.440]   So we there's a there's a growing problem around smartphones and I would like to see google an apple
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:24.880]   and other companies start to solve the problem
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:31.040]   Two things because jeff isn't here. I'm gonna say techno panic and then i'm also going to say
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:33.280]   Andy Ruben
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:39.200]   With the essential phone is actually trying to solve that he wants you to keep the phone in your pocket and to have contextual
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:43.680]   Computing that is aware and gives you what you need when you need it. He doesn't have a watch. What does he use for that?
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:47.360]   That's the home side of it. That's what he's trying to do there and I think
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:52.160]   I might want my essential phone back. Okay. I think there are things that are happening
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:56.560]   It's just it's gonna take a while because we're gonna have to build an entire new user interface
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:54:02.240]   The big ecosystems are like I want to get in this ecosystem and they're trying to like lock everybody out
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:05.120]   Which makes it hard for users to use the services they want
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:06.720]   uh
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:08.720]   But we're we're getting there
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:15.280]   And I don't I think there's so much that phones do that is really good for kids and people
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:20.240]   That I I don't want you to be like oh smart phones are terrible
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:24.320]   I think asking tech companies to respond to the cultural
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:27.200]   Dislocations their technologies are
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:32.400]   Creating is like asking a butcher shop to put a sign up promoting veganism. Well, it's they will it's no
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:37.040]   But they will at some point they will have to at some point because essentially there's this arms race
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:38.000]   uh
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   Between the social media companies between the app creators between youtube and all these other companies and the smartphone users themselves
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:47.360]   makers themselves to get more and more
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:54.400]   Addictive and distracting for example, uh one of the great greatest features of of stacey's phone is the always on though
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:58.960]   Family is always sort of like you and she said I want to look at it even more than I did before
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:04.560]   Look, she's made it face down so she doesn't yeah, that's what but this is the we are no match for this
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:06.560]   Is that their job?
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:09.520]   Look, we have we have a archive
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:14.320]   And there are articles that I just pulled up what like a month ago
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:20.240]   From people who were complaining about this new technology and what it was doing to the society in san francisco
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:22.400]   The new technology was the cable car
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:26.720]   And they were saying people are no longer walking. They're not talking to their neighbors. They're on this cable
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:30.880]   So, I mean you can go down the line of human advancement. They always is true
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:34.560]   That's true. And of course we have abandoned the cable car, haven't we?
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:37.280]   But but I mean look at look at megan's
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:41.600]   Digital cleanses and lots of people are doing digital have to respond to it
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:42.960]   Yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:47.520]   And so there's going to be more and more of that where people are there there are actually some startups that are creating
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:54.560]   There's the light phone for example. There are other things that are just silly. Well, yes they are but the the the
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:56:02.480]   This tiny little this tiny little movements of obscure people on the fringe that grow into mainstream movements eventually
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:07.680]   And I think that I think that's inevitably gonna happen at some point because at some point people are walking into traffic and
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.680]   stuff
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:11.680]   Could you go back to a feature phone?
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:15.920]   I've considered it seriously in fact in fact
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:21.360]   The funny thing is a feature phone wouldn't do anything for me because I never use the phone right me neither
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:23.360]   All I want is the other features
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:31.280]   At the end of the show near the end of the show mike's tool at the end of the show okay
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:34.800]   I'm going to tell you about the perfect phone. Okay
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:41.840]   It's an Android phone and it's the greatest phone. It's the phone that everybody should get and it solves all these problems stay tuned boys and girls
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:48.480]   So I don't think this is a problem because I think if you have like I look at my phone and always on and I'm excited because I can see
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:50.480]   the what time it is which
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:54.400]   I really love that's the main tool right you can't really see the notifications
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:57:01.520]   If you cultivate and maybe it's just my contrary and introverted personality, but I mean I don't
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:08.000]   I don't let it rule my life and I I try to be very conscious about things like if I'm like
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:14.480]   Oh, am I really enjoying reading the entire internet after dinner? Okay, but but oh say part of part of the problem here is that we're all
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:19.360]   We all do this for a living we get distracted by our smartphones for a living all of us
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:23.200]   Carefully cultivated my life for so that that would be the case
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:31.200]   There are all kinds of studies that for example one of the most dramatic studies found that if your phone is just sitting on the table
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:33.680]   For Sherry turkel we you know we interviewed
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:41.760]   And she talked about his her conversation reclaiming conversation or her book reclaiming conversation. She talked about how
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:47.360]   Conversations are more superficial if there are smartphones on the table
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:49.600]   And there's a similar thing in terms of IQ tests
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:54.080]   If you put a tape if you put a phone on the desk and take get an IQ test
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:58.160]   You like five IQ points dumber than if the phone is taken out of the room
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:00.160]   I
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:11.360]   Am dumber if like I'm trying to do something and there's anything that's exciting
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:13.920]   That's a very good point. A chocolate muffin would do it
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:14.800]   There's something more though
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:19.120]   And I'm going to take mike's side on this because at the school I live at I
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:24.640]   Say masses for the student body and so we'll have 1500 students in in the chapel or in the auditorium
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:29.760]   And it's funny because they have to leave all of their electronic devices in their bags in the classrooms
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:32.160]   Because you know they'd be doing otherwise and you see them do this
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:37.440]   Yeah, it's it's it's not just they're reaching for the device. That's not there
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:39.760]   And that's if I can agree with stacey
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:41.760]   It's exactly like a chocolate muffin
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:47.840]   The difference is that the food industry has recognized that we have a massive health crisis and that one third of the populations
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:51.120]   Now obese because of chocolate muffins and they're now producing
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:56.400]   Solutions all kinds of diet things and only to preserve their business
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:00.480]   The smartphones
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:06.480]   Do exactly the same thing for exactly the same reason the product is addictive and it's getting more so there's a difference
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:13.600]   There's a difference the food industry can say that because they realized all of the that luxury food is a luxury
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:19.600]   I will pay so much for zoodles tech industry can make a good case for saying everything we sell can increase your productivity
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:25.200]   Pretend your Pablo Escobar. Okay Pablo. You're cocaine. It's far too enjoyable. It's far too addicting
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:29.360]   You're gonna have some problems up here in the United States. Can we just ask you to make it a little weaker?
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:35.920]   Showing that the productivity is declining in terms of personal productivity
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:40.960]   That not the amount of time people spent that people now only work less than like two hours and 20 minutes a day
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:46.960]   And that the amount of time they spend on social media and their computers is actually more now than the time they work
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:55.200]   Productivity is like you need to come back from Georgia. You're turning into something weird. Yeah, you're all like talking to people
[00:59:55.200 --> 01:00:00.480]   I bet you smile it strangers. I'm just the nearly indicator. We're all going to be talking about this within over the next
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:04.480]   Year or two or three years because it's it's it's becoming a growing problem
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:10.800]   So I think about this and I I train my daughter like a she's 11 and she actually doesn't have her own smartphone
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.520]   and yay, she talks to
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:18.880]   The echo I want madam a or google in our house to do a lot of things
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:26.400]   So she's not even encountering the phone in ways and the rest of the time she's actually on her laptop chatting with her friends and google hangouts
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.960]   and so
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.440]   I obviously can't keep this up forever, but
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:38.560]   We're also spending a lot of time talking to her about what it means to not be able to get off social media and she like told me the other day
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:41.360]   She's like, I think i'm watching too much youtube. I was like, well
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:47.520]   She's aware of it the fact that she's aware of that is amazing and so I was like, can we watch a can we watch a video a quick?
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:51.280]   When I put it in the rundown near the bottom. It's a psa from funny or die
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:57.360]   Okay, uh karston if you have that I could pull it up to understand. Yeah, this is a perfect
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:05.280]   Along the lines of what stacey's talking about. I was going back and forth with my daughter about there was something when she was a kid called neo pets
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.800]   And uh, there was a great article about neo pets
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:16.320]   In which it talked about how a young woman who is now a professional computer programmer learned to code
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:18.320]   in neo pets
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.320]   Uh, because it was like my space a little bit
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:25.760]   And you had it you could create a store and she she you know, they talked about her dad
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:30.560]   She said, um, hey dad. I when she was 11. I need to buy a domain name
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:35.360]   And he said can I use your credit card and he said yeah, I bet she doesn't know how to do it
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:40.880]   In fact, she did she bought a domain name for a neo pets store. I sent it to abby abby said oh, yeah
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.680]   I learned css and html when I was 12
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:50.000]   Playing this game which as parents we might have said oh you're spending way too much time with this artificial
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:56.160]   Animal, um, I I think the every generation is going to have some issues as you said
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:02.880]   There's a long rich history of uh, us old folks saying oh, it's gonna ruin your eyes. You're watching the tv
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:05.360]   You're gonna read books. You're never going outside
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:12.000]   But there's a rich history of us correcting it as well. I mean we we got to the point where we my generation watch way too much tv
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.480]   It's too much of it's or your flavored fruit loops
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:20.880]   But absolutely, but but there's that but people are trying you know, there's there's a whole industry of trying to get people off tv
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:26.320]   And anyway, so where did you write? I said, where did you put this? It was near the bottom. It's a it's a psa
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:30.640]   All right. I think carston's founded. Yeah, there you go. All right. Here's a public service announcement from
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.600]   Funny or die funny or die. I should tell you something about that
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:39.520]   No, he doesn't have it. He doesn't have it. He has it. He doesn't have it. The person really doesn't want to play this
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:44.000]   I have it. He really doesn't like it. I still be sitting down together. You can tell me something they did today
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.800]   I drew a horsey good for you, son
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:52.480]   He's looking at his phone. Obviously. I started smoking. I love you too sweetheart
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:59.760]   I'm selling longs out of our minivan. I got a tramp stamp. I'm getting implants. I'm dating your brother. Uh-huh
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:02.560]   I'm looking math in the basement
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:06.080]   Great idea kiddo. That's why you're so popular at school
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:14.720]   Device free dinner hashtag common sense.org. That's awesome. Will ferrell on his phone looks like by the way that was a note aid
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.320]   I'm just saying and
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:20.080]   I don't blame him because that's a gorgeous display. I don't know if you noticed that but I will say
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:24.960]   In my house. I live with 12 older priests or 12 other Jesuits
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:29.360]   I am the one who never has his device at dinner
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:34.320]   And some of the oldest priests are the ones who do so it's not a generational thing
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:37.600]   We don't we actually have done device free dinners because
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:44.960]   We're weird that way, but so i'm like but we talked to the amazon echo so we won't we
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:47.760]   So it's device ish free so like
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:54.320]   Madamay has a seat at the table essentially at our house because we're like we'll sit there and we'll be arguing about something and then suddenly
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:57.440]   You really use your echo. It's really so your echo is the referee
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:00.400]   Basically like yeah, or when did this happen?
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:02.960]   Or my daughter will come home and she'll be like
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:08.480]   Oh, I just learned this and i'm like no way there are not nine continents and she's like
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:15.200]   Asking me so then we know madamay in a very brilliant move google actually announced something like 50
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:23.200]   New google home or google assistant plugins. Uh, I don't know what google calls them for for kids for children
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:26.960]   I'm excited about those. Yeah, my daughter and i we play okay
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:33.840]   Again, if you have a tween would you rather on the echo? We play that like non-stop my daughter loves it
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:35.840]   It's like would you rather you know
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:41.280]   Do i'm trying be gwyneth paltrow or robert deniro. This is a terrible example
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:45.120]   And you pick one
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:49.840]   Or after uh, what's his name? Harvey Weinstein
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.760]   We know he hit on robert deniro too. You just don't know
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:58.720]   But so we we play these games all the time and she she like loves it
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:02.960]   so I think it's smart for google to get in on all of this because
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:07.760]   This is not a device. It's it's less addictive. It's a little bit more fun
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:14.080]   Yeah, and I think that's not a strategy. This is not oh my gosh all this technology is destroying us
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:18.400]   It's we swing one win the pendulum and then we swing back and people realize no I need to balance
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:21.600]   Because if I don't balance my life a little bit, I'm not going to make it to 50
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:25.120]   And and that's that's generally if you look at the history of technology
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:28.560]   It's not that we get rid of the technology that caused the imbalance in the first place
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:32.080]   It's we figure out how to actually adapt it in our life and make it a healthy theme
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:38.240]   I think that's where we are right now. Yeah, and I think I think voice interfaces are way healthier way healthier because it's so screens
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:42.080]   That's the digital crack that and if you and it's also bad for your eyes
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:43.680]   So look at screens for 18 hours a day
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:47.520]   So if you're talking to a computer it's like another person in the room and it's much more natural
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:52.000]   And your brain doesn't have to like completely focus all of its attention on the device
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.400]   Or if you have to look at screens for 18 hours a day, you could get some Felix gray glasses
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:59.680]   How do you think I look? There you go. Hey, what up? What a segue
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:05.840]   Hey, why don't you try some Felix gray's on just see if you can see the difference
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:09.680]   It's gonna let's stay see tries. I mean, would you like to try some Felix gray's as well?
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.760]   Of course, sorry. Here you go. Felix gray
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:16.080]   No matter what you do for work if you're staring at your phone or your computer or screen a lot
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:21.680]   As Mike has look you look good. Oh, these are these are a little big for my faith
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:24.400]   Oh, you want trade because he's a little small for my face. I think that
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:28.320]   Too small for your face
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:31.360]   That's like good on you Robert. You look like an intellectual priest
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:36.720]   I feel like that's a trade trade. Those are for Stacy. These are the small ones here
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:40.240]   Oh, okay. They give me the wide ones because I have a giant massive head
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:44.800]   All right, that's good on you. Okay, what do you think those are perfect for you leo?
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:48.320]   Those those those this this is my size and let's see Robert
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:51.920]   Yeah, no Robert. Yeah. No, come on. Come on, Robert
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:54.880]   You could tell he's a teacher. Oh, yeah
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:07:00.400]   So these are more than just good looking glasses. Although they are Italian made they're very nice
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:07.120]   Frames Italian acetate same stuff for satche uses and all that these are you know a nice nice horn rim
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:09.600]   but style but
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:13.600]   They're much more than just what they look like because if you're looking at screen all the time
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:19.120]   You know that dries your eyes out you get headaches you get migraines you get blurry vision
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:22.400]   This is the what you need to wear. These are
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:26.640]   Especially designed for people looking at screens they filter blue light
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:31.040]   And by the way, it's not some coating on the glasses the filters a lot. You'll see that sometimes
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:35.440]   That that makes them look strange to other people out there. It looks like you're wearing yellow glasses
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:42.240]   These look completely clear. That's built into the optics of the lens itself. They eliminate glare
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:47.200]   Uh, there's no there's no telltale yellow tint or color distortion
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:52.800]   They look great on you. They fit great. There's all sorts of cut this one. Uh, you might want to try this one
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:55.120]   What model is this? I really like it. This is um
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:58.080]   The jemmison
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:01.280]   Oh, that's named after an astronaut the jemmison
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:03.840]   May jemmison c5
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:06.640]   So isn't that cool mine's named after an astronaut
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.400]   um
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:13.600]   They're available both in space non prescription and reading lenses. In fact, I would suggest I do this
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:18.160]   I wear reading and they have they have readers from point from 1.0 to 2.5
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:21.360]   But I would suggest even if you don't use readers even if you're young
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:26.960]   To add a little a tiny bit like a quarter a diopter magnification 0.25 plus
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:31.280]   And that helps it makes the screen easier to read
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:34.320]   I find it really reduces eye strain
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:39.120]   All orders include free shipping and free returns. You've got nothing to lose except that annoying eye strain
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:46.640]   Give your glasses. I mean your eyes the break they deserve go to phillics gray glasses.com

[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:08.720]   But you know, I might start doing this because it really makes a very very big difference and they're anti-glare
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:14.240]   Yeah, yeah, I don't see any reflection Leo. Yeah, I can probably wear these huh. Yeah, maybe I'll look at mine
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:17.520]   I have a terrible reflection with that's why I stopped wearing glasses on tv
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.600]   Yeah, because you can't because you get that blue from the
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:22.720]   Screen so you don't see any reflection on my let me
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:26.320]   No, look at that. No, if I look at the there's a little yeah
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:30.640]   I look the lights up there but not from the computer which is because I'm never gonna really look up here
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:31.840]   I'm gonna look straight ahead
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:36.720]   If you if you master the angry librarian look I should master the angry librarian look
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:44.720]   Excuse me. Are you children reading in here? Go outside and look at your screens
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:47.440]   Uh

[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:56.800]   We are thrilled to have in studio stacey higginbotham all the way from austin texas now stacey
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.760]   because you were here we we arranged for uh uh
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:07.760]   Chipotle to bring in a ton of queso. Oh and jeff isn't here, but I did I tested and
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:10.720]   Like queso he did not like it. He said it was grainy and flowery
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:16.320]   So it was not gritty which is what everyone told me. Yes. I thought it was good. It was not
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:22.160]   You have austin. I was like it was not my favorite queso. I would not order this queso
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:26.080]   But it was not gritty. Is that don't worry. They're not a sponsor. You could say anything you want. No, I'm well
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:30.880]   I was where I was like, I'm like, is that really if it's not gritty good news. It's not gritty
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:34.640]   And gritty kids my phone doesn't explode. No, that's a ringing endorsement
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:39.600]   Yeah, exactly. I thought it was good because we you know, you really can't get good queso up here if I were in austin
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:44.880]   I've it's just melted velveeta you guys like 90. I mean, I know that's not
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:50.720]   That's that's the best queso in california is in san abarborough at a place called la super rica
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:56.320]   Uh, no, I I will debate that there's a really good place in san ose that does queso all right you're on
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:00.800]   That's where i am tonight. Where's that? Where's the both down off of one-on-one in storry
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:04.160]   There's there's like three or four shops there that do really really good queso
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:08.080]   Are they mexican food shops? Yes, they are. Okay. Oh, we have fabulous mexican
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:12.480]   It's different from the text mex that you get cali mex, which basically means we're gonna add an avocado
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:17.520]   This is not cali mex. This is not fusion. This is mexican food. Oh, there you go interior mexican food
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:24.240]   This this actually this story came out yesterday chipotle executives don't care that the chains queso is being slammed as dumpster juice
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.920]   Wow
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.520]   Wow
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:29.520]   That wasn't that bad
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:30.560]   No
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:32.560]   It's not it's not dumpster juice
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:36.960]   Uh, I don't think it's anything to do with their stock going down 8 on tuesday
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:43.280]   I love chipotle food poisoning all of that is I wasn't sure if you would and I said she's from austin
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:46.000]   I don't know if we should have chipotle today. Oh, no, I liked it
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.960]   Well, okay. So I came after eating it. Oh, please and I had two pieces of coffee cake that was
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:53.520]   Because my face
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:58.880]   I am I'm I'm not hungry so far on the show, which is unusual for me. I know well
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:03.120]   We we still have an hour and a half to go come for the food stay for the gastric explosion
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:10.000]   Uh chipotle reported queso actually added 6% to its sales when the menu item launched nationally in september that's all the counts
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.560]   So somebody's eating it
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:16.160]   Many people's problems with chipotle queso is the texture
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:20.400]   That's the gritty you go. Yeah, so it wasn't gritty like I was told it was
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:26.000]   Uh, I'm kind of pretty I didn't I didn't taste the grid
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.600]   Analysts warn is from cnbc
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:33.600]   queso might be not be enough to stabilize chipotle's margins
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:37.040]   Analysts warn
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:40.720]   That is a headline you don't really expect in on cnbc
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:47.120]   But but there it is case so is not enough to stabilize anything until it gets to that gooey cold stage
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:55.520]   It will be amazing apple quesos could be the best case of ever. Oh sure others have dor done queso
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:58.080]   They're gonna grow their own cows
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:03.360]   What do you think all that empty space in the middle of the spaceship is for it's a case of farm
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:07.360]   It will also, you know cut the grass for eco-friendly keep it on the green piece list
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:14.400]   Uh, so I'm just looking at queso recipes. Uh, I also don't think chipotle has the best chips
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:18.480]   But no in your chip experiences crucial to your queso experience
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:24.560]   I don't particularly like anything at chipotle, but oh my gosh. My daughter is listening to twit live
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:26.000]   Hi
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.680]   starter and uh
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:31.840]   Thank you for for knowing that you watch youtube too much. I bet she asked madame to play it
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:36.560]   She said madame listened to my mommy on twit
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:40.720]   I wonder if that would work. I bet it was skill. No no
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:45.840]   Madame is not that smart google might you watch google knows who your mommy is that's
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:48.880]   Google's like oh, yes, I know who your mother is
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:53.200]   If I google like oh kevin and I were doing this I fight google
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:57.920]   Stacy's dog stacey higga motham's dog pictures of my dog come up really
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:00.720]   Um, that's you know you've gone too far
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:03.360]   Wow
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:08.240]   But if you google kevin tofels dog it doesn't come up because norm is named so you have to google
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:14.560]   Kevin toful norm hey john could you bring me the invoke because we did get a new could you bring me the invoke?
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:16.800]   It's on my desk. This is the new harm and cardan
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:22.000]   competitor, but it's not uh, it's it's not madame nor is it syri
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.200]   it's cortana
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:30.240]   Didn't know microsoft works with madame a there will be some madame features
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:36.400]   Yeah, but I don't know how much actually cortana ain't bad. It's just why I don't understand why you would spend 200
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:42.960]   Dollars on a Cortana dedicated Cortana device if you could get an echo for 40 dollars if you could get a google for
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:45.360]   For 50 dollars
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:47.600]   And apple's gonna have its home pot at some point
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:51.120]   Um, you know I'll need is some power because it's got a short cord
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:58.320]   It's cut so you want to look at the industrial design first. I guess it's very masculine and kind of it's
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:02.480]   Metal dark it yeah, that's very much a harmon car
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:10.320]   Work yeah star wars. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they do make a silver one. That's that's the only designer colors. They have
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:16.480]   Okay, would you do me the honor and they had they had a floor standing version of this at efa two years ago
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:21.440]   That was like $3,000 floor standing. You mean like a tall one? Huh? Wow
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:26.800]   Uh, it's a pretty good field. It would be awesome. I'm curious what you you all will think of it compared to
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:33.520]   Say the echo show which I think has the best single unit speakers for amazon
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:39.120]   Now this is now an hp brand correct. No, it's owned by sam sam sam sam okay
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:42.000]   Samsa although for all I know samsa
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.280]   It could be I don't know
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:50.720]   No, no, no, no, and you see it has the little inside it has a little light that's
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:54.320]   rotating the thinking now i've never spoken to kartana
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:16:00.480]   Would you like speaking to the other voice assistants? Accepts is more lonely. Hey kartana. Let's listen to some music
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:06.240]   Or not don't you have to like set it up got a boot up
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:10.080]   It's still booting. That's like microsoft. Yeah
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:17.440]   Well, they want to bring the windows experience to the digital assistant. It may be joining the Wi-Fi
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:22.160]   It's true. It may have it made that sound though like it it did right it thinks it's ready
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:24.240]   I
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:27.200]   Think you have to hit it harder
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:37.280]   Hey kartana listen to some music
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:44.560]   Okay, here's the latest episode from the podcast windows weekly on tune in

[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:22.880]   Hey kartana
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:24.960]   Hey kartana
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:27.280]   Stop
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:32.160]   Let me get some music. Hey kart. Go ahead. You do it. Hey kartana play Beyonce
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:35.280]   All right
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:37.280]   She says all right. I can't play
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:44.000]   Right now. Oh, it's only tune in. Oh you choose tune in spotify or iHeart radio as a weird limited
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.840]   Thing only those things as far as I could tell you could choose one only of those
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:52.880]   Take kartana listen to kllc radio
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:59.440]   All right tuning into radio disney kllc hd3
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:12.480]   Well, what do you think it sounds okay? Hey look kartana may get things wrong a lot, but her fails are super hypodelic
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:16.480]   authorized my mommy
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:19.920]   That's good base
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:24.400]   No, that's actually that's quite good. It sounds it. It's a little muddy. Yes. It's a tubby. Yeah
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:31.600]   Like i'm not an audiophile, but they emphasize the base. That's what um high-end sound good too. It sounds better than than the echo
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:34.320]   Yeah, that that's true. Hey kartana stop
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:40.560]   Anyway, that's 200 dollars. Uh, that's a direct competitor price wise actually no cuz
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:44.480]   It's a direct competitor the sonos one sonos one which I have at home. I don't have here
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:50.720]   That is a little it's not a full amazon echo there. It won't do everything a standalone echo will do
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:55.920]   But of course it integrates into your sonos. It sounds better than this. I think even though it's a it's like a play one sonos
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:58.640]   It sounds better than this. It sounds really pretty good
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:01.680]   So we shouldn't buy this is what i'm hearing
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:06.720]   I don't see why anyone would buy it because unless you're like so all in on the windows ecosystem that you want
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:09.360]   kartana for instance you can have it
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:15.360]   You can have it uh she lit up when I said that you can have it add um
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:18.560]   Uh to your calendar your outlook calendar things like that
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:26.480]   So it integrates with office 365 build my keynote presentation. Yeah except it's powerpoint, but other than that oh, oh powerpoint presentation
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:32.320]   I'm sorry. I'm I'm sorry stacey. I can't do that. Hey kartana
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:35.360]   Play never gonna give you up by rick astley
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:43.760]   All right, I like it. All right. Oh, all right now if 15 minutes from now she starts playing it
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:47.040]   That would be an amazing that would be rick rolling here. That's great
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:51.120]   Uh, you brought another toy too. Do you want to save that for your picker? Do you want to show it now?
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:57.200]   Oh, we could show it now. Okay, so you actually took a look at this on tech guy a few weeks back
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:59.280]   Yeah, this is anchor's new nebula
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:06.080]   So anchor we all know chinese company and they've and we actually really like them for aftermarket accessories like batteries
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:10.640]   Uh, but this is the first time they've done like a real product
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:15.200]   Right. So this is a collaboration with another company that they wanted to take their battery tech
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:21.280]   So this is entirely portable. They're touting this as a theater quality portable battery powered projector
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:23.920]   Um, and it's actually really good. It's android powered
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:30.000]   Oh, and it will you can stream directly from the unit. Uh, you know, it's opening up the little lens is gonna start it up
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.760]   So this yeah, I'll just pass this over to you now. There's a couple of things I really like about this
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:37.200]   The first is the fan is on it's on. Yeah. Oh, yeah, it's warming up
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:40.880]   Um one of the things oh yeah, you may might want to look directly into the lens
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:44.880]   Um, that's gonna be kind of bright. Oh, let's go to warn those glasses
[01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:51.680]   This this will do it's auto skew and auto tilt one of the hardest things to do with a projector is get it to match right
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:56.320]   It actually detects its angle and it will automatically fix the picture. Oh
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:59.680]   I need that on tables at restaurants
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:05.920]   Okay, this is getting kind of creepy is apple face recognition phase two
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:09.680]   Do you need a this thing?
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:14.080]   Yeah, give me a thing you can you can you can you can check it out of this thing?
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:19.600]   Now I just got this yesterday, but I want to do things like, you know, take it out in the middle of a field because
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:25.360]   It's actually very very bright way bright. This is not definitely not a pico projector
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:29.840]   This is more like a home theater projector. It's a little expensive. It's $600
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:34.080]   Actually adjusting the focus. I probably shouldn't be doing what I'm doing. Oh, no, that's that's the thing
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:36.160]   Yeah, it'll auto focus it will auto skew
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:40.240]   Yeah, maybe we need it back on the yes. See there we go. How long's the battery life on that?
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:41.280]   Uh, that's a good question
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:45.200]   So that's gonna depend on the brightness and how you use the features for it
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:50.400]   It has built-in Wi-Fi so you could just do use this as a standalone and play say Netflix
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:57.840]   Or corgi videos a lot of corgi videos. How did you know he loves corgi videos? Oh, I love corgi videos. Oh, you got the twitters. Oh
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000]   Oh
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.520]   Wow, you guys
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:09.520]   It's even though it's a decent size unit. I can't see this lasting for more than three hours on the battery if you're using heavy
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:12.560]   So there's a big battery, you know, let's play at 15 000 milliamp
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:16.640]   So it won't get you through all of the lord of the rings trilogy, but it would get you through one
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:18.800]   Precisely more than enough
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:24.160]   Um, but I I got to say just in like the two or three hours that i've been playing with this thing
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:29.440]   I'm impressed the android integration is really well done. It's not just android slapped onto a projector
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:31.360]   It actually it works
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:35.360]   Uh, the the controls are intuitive the quality is really really good
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:38.560]   Even if you're you're projecting on a non projection service a surface
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:41.200]   And uh, one of the other cool things about this is
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:45.200]   the fact that um, you know, they want this to be a portable unit
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:51.200]   And it's actually really durable one of the things i'm always concerned about when i'm carrying a projector is one good bump
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:54.880]   And you've destroyed the optics this thing. I really dropped it off a table
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:59.920]   I wouldn't do it again. Oh, but it's still working. Sorry anchor. Uh, you're reviewing. It's gonna have a thing. Yeah, yeah
[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:02.560]   So yeah, 600 bucks not bad
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:08.080]   I totally need that. Uh, we we don't uh have a tv because we're always traveling
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:14.960]   We watch all over tv movies on a laptop. That'll go good. Yeah, uh seriously the other night. I did um, what was it a?
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:19.200]   25 foot wall at in our gym and it literally looked great
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:24.560]   Really? Wow hd mind. Do you know what the native specks are for the uh video?
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:26.800]   Uh, it does 1080 so the luful hd
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:30.240]   I think it'll actually take 4k, but I think the sensors only 1080
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:37.040]   Um, yeah, unlike see this is this is how I know a company isn't used to having a lot of complicated products
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:42.400]   Anchor didn't send out like the reviewer sheet the spec sheet. They just assumed that you'd go get it
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:47.520]   Which is I kind of find that refreshing they didn't have a pr person they they literally sent me the unit and they said
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:51.200]   Wifi you like to know what you think about it wants to join our wife. Yeah, I know right wow
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:57.920]   Oh, I think that is android. So in effect you can use its own user interface. Yeah, you don't need to connect this is it ever remote control
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:01.040]   It does so you could stream Netflix on this directly from it. Correct Wow
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:07.680]   That's kind of neat. That's really kind of neat. It's very well made. I saw the photo type of this at CES
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:11.120]   Roland is saying in our chairman 1280 by 800. So it's a 720
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:15.920]   DLP and that's it 3000 lumens. That's a lot for some this
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:23.040]   Someone came up to you. Yeah, yeah, that's kind of does look like the town crier light typing. Yeah, oh as well
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:25.680]   10 o'clock
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:28.320]   Time to go with the hotbed with your sheep
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:35.600]   It's not bad, huh? Oh, no, that's like that's party time at the uh, it's like five pounds. Yeah
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:38.160]   All right, how much?
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:41.680]   $5.99 600 and is it out now it is out now you could buy them on amazon
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:46.880]   And actually anchor I think sent two of them to us because Anthony got one for the studio
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:52.240]   And they sent this one to me so we were gonna review it for the new screensavers. So we got
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:56.080]   Oh, it's going it's definitely going into our our holiday gift list. This is nice
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:01.520]   It's also going into my pocket after the show. I just bought one. Oh
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:07.040]   Lio no, I thought would be nice to have it home. I think
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:14.080]   Actually, that's it. That's a nice thing to have like for a backyard. Yeah, summer exactly want to watch a movie outside
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:17.760]   Yeah, well, I'm going someplace that has a huge huge wall
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:20.560]   The Vatican yes China
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:22.880]   That's no, that's my new
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:24.880]   Put it on the sistine ceiling
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:28.560]   Michael angel never imagined well the the roof of my house
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:33.440]   I can see the sistine chapel and st peter so I could just project over the distance
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:36.960]   So if you ever go to the vatican and then I can come back to it
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:44.640]   He's got the keys to roam. Oh, yeah, by the way, if you ever do stop by roam like you're welcome to stay our house at the vatican
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:49.280]   Yes, it is literally a three-minute walk to to st. Peter's but you
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:55.520]   Yes, the house is designed for like 800 people
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:59.280]   Don't know but the the society of jesus is actually a frat
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:04.560]   That's why he's like you're welcome to stay at our house. I'm like what's happening here
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:08.880]   It's very quiet for an intellectual somber
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:15.600]   We actually keep there on our property. There's a building that is apartments for any of our lay visitors
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:19.200]   So jesus don't stay there. It's actually a separate building on the compound
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:22.160]   And it's a three-minute walk to st. Peter's nice, huh?
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:26.400]   But he won't be there till september. Don't get your hopes all up and also might just remember
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:34.800]   Um, the building was created in the 1700s. So there's no toilets. Wi-fi is terrible. I was gonna say bad Wi-fi and
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:37.680]   Just FYI
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:39.680]   All right, uh, let's see
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:43.840]   Google is apparently having a trouble getting the
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:46.800]   white pixel twos out
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:52.080]   They are pushing out their their offering they're pushing back some of the orders
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:55.440]   And offering a free live case is a compensate. Hey
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:00.400]   How about that? So you're lucky you got yours. That's nice. I thought I didn't even ask
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:05.520]   That's beautiful. That's that's but you didn't get the panda one. So you don't have the orange
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:10.960]   That's only in the it was only on the excel and i'm very sad because I love orange like nobody
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:14.080]   That's what I ordered, but it won't be for weeks that I get it. So
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:18.480]   There's that's something pretty I kind of like what and by the way, this is a metal back
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:22.240]   But they've done a soft-touch paint on it, which I think is quite nice. It was very fancy
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:25.520]   You like that color? I think you're happy with it. Oh, yeah, I don't ever see it
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:29.760]   I don't ever see I don't care like I actually wanted the blue one. I've never felt the squeeze thing
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:33.360]   That's actually I like it works. That's very cool. It's really nice
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:36.800]   So there are little of some delays on the one you got but you got it
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:40.560]   Several people who bought the pixel 2 with an october ship date only have to
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:43.360]   Only to have that date slipped to november
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:47.600]   Are being offered a case as compensation
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:51.520]   Dang and I paid 40 bucks for my case of the missing
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:54.720]   Google phone did you get the
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:58.560]   Google
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:01.040]   I told you about the ticking
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:04.640]   I did get the Google bugs the boot Google pods bro pods
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:09.920]   No, what are they they're pixel pixel pods pixel buds pixel buds pixel buds the P-buds
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:15.440]   bros, I keep thinking of marijuana, so I'm like, oh, um, but you are in california pixel buds
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:16.720]   but
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:22.000]   I I need to actually a decent pair of bluetooth heads headphones that are not like crazy pair with it
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.480]   well, also just because I don't have any and
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:30.000]   I keep I've only had this for like three days and I keep misplacing my dongle everywhere. I'm just like
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:35.120]   Dongle is not a good solution. It looks so stupid your phone has this tail
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:39.760]   Yeah, by the way, I'm sure that the the handful of casemakers that
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:47.360]   Decided to make cases for this phone are thrilled the google's handing them out. Oh, yeah pick one up today for free
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:51.520]   um, we have a couple of bluetooth
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:56.320]   For sorry, I'm just logging into my
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:58.960]   last pass
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:01.200]   Yes, so I can get into amazon
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:07.200]   The most secure broadcaster on the internet
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:08.480]   I am
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:15.920]   Did you turn on the app advanced protection for your google? I I turned it on for a account not from my account because I found it incredibly annoying
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:19.840]   It's it's pretty intrusive the the showstopper for me was it doesn't work
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:21.600]   with
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:25.760]   Linux and I a lot of my machines are linux. Let me show you the bluetooth
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:30.640]   Um that we like and I think you would like this is from jlab
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:35.040]   The audio epic too and it's not too expensive. It's not cheap
[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:39.760]   Okay, because I lose my headphones like I'm a i'm a $50 headset headphone kind of person
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:44.560]   There's bluetooth. There's good bluetooth. Let me see if I can find another most of my headsets come from the plane
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:47.040]   The ones that they hand out you keep those I keep
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:53.280]   I'm kind of cheap, but it advanced protection by the way this this is the little fob that google's got a dongle
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:55.840]   Yeah, so this combined with a yubiko key
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:00.560]   That's what you need so that you can be on your laptop your desktop your mobile device. That's tough
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:05.680]   Yeah, this is this is a little you don't need them both at any given time either use one for the use the
[01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:07.440]   Yubiki or
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:11.440]   Yeah, I need two final utf devices one that's a usb and one that's bluetooth
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:15.520]   Um, and so I I have it too and I turned it on and then I turned it off because
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:22.320]   Uh, you also have to use chrome. Yep, doesn't work with linux. Although I suspect they'll fix that one other issue
[01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:28.400]   Um, I don't normally associate turning on bluetooth with adding security to a device. Oh, yeah
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:33.840]   Well, all it's I think this is alright. I'd sending it's sending a one-time only code
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:38.880]   From that little did you pass? All right? Well, I'm not worried about them intercepting this communications
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:42.320]   I mean if you turn on the bluetooth. Yeah, you can fly off again. Yeah
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:46.000]   That's not great. It's like what can I help you? I lost my yubiki
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:51.680]   Okay in there. Oh, I have it with me. I carried around it all the time. I picked this pocket now
[01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:57.280]   I'm long. Hold on. I'm logging into leo's account right now. I am leo l'aport. I usually have it
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:59.120]   handcuffed
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:05.040]   Fly at his chain. It's not a purse. It's european. It's a european carriole. It's a man bag
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:08.880]   Um, well and if you lose it, which I may have done
[01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:14.240]   Getting into your account. There is a manual process as there always has been but it's in more
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:20.080]   It's more astringent than it was before you have to spit into a tube so it can check your dna
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:25.840]   33 you turn on the super secret authentication on your google account. Oh god. No. Yeah
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:30.960]   Well, also I should point out if you turn off turn on two factor on your google account
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:33.120]   You get many of the same benefits
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:36.800]   uh, the the the most secure thing it does is the most
[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:41.920]   Inconvencing thing which is it doesn't allow third-party apps to use your google account
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:43.600]   So all of your
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:48.880]   You're using an android device, but if you use an iPhone none of apple mail won't work apple calendar won't work
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:52.880]   apple contacts won't work on your iPhone you have to use all google stuff, right?
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:58.080]   And uh, for some people that would be a showstopper as well, but that's what one that's probably the main reason
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:04.720]   It's more secure. Is it no no malicious third-party app or chrome extension can hook into your google account
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:08.480]   You know, they have to they have to you know get past this as well
[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:13.040]   So it's in that respect if you know who it's for john padez to the democratic
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:17.680]   That's what they said. That's why they created that if you if you never leave your house you're much safer
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000]   which is kind of
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:27.120]   Yeah, we talked about this with steve gibson and the whole idea is if if you enable great protection and great security and yet
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:31.520]   It's incredibly convenient. It's not really great security. It's the Rapunzel problem. It's yeah, exactly
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:35.680]   It's security theater. I'm not looking in his pocket. This is inconvenient enough
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:42.160]   Where it actually does add security and in order to add security. I'm sorry folks, but you're gonna have to add inconvenience
[01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:44.160]   That's just how that works
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:48.800]   Why they don't let me in the studio
[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:52.320]   The was ago did you pass but just similar what you have is a blue?
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:56.240]   But you need the bluetooth because iPhones don't have uh, any usb connector
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:58.720]   So you need that
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:03.360]   For a bluetooth devices it works with phones and stuff too. You have surprisingly few fobs on your key
[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:08.080]   Like i've got a fob for my car. I've got it for getting into my daughter's school. I've got fobs for like the gym
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:14.640]   I have more fobs. I'm like I have on the other end of that chain. I have a lot more fobs. Yeah, I have a ton of fobs
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:17.680]   This is like the must-have stuff. Anyway
[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:21.680]   You like a universal fob you could just switch somebody
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:25.360]   I have a blue one. That's not secure. Yeah, my tesla key. Yeah, somebody sent me this
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:32.240]   Silicone case for the tesla key must have sent you one too. No, we bought ours because my husband the leather case was just too big
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:37.760]   He's like too much. Yeah, so it's transformed and the tesla key assumes that you know what it does because it looks like the car
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:40.000]   So they don't have any legend on it. This has a
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.200]   Legend on it. This was a listener who says thanks to you
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:46.240]   I can now make tesla silicone tesla fobs
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:48.400]   covers
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:50.400]   And I do have a tracker on that by the way
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:56.080]   Just letting you know it's also in the car. I got a tracker pixel. Oh, that's right. You can't steal a tesla
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:58.720]   Yeah, you can for a couple minutes
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:06.000]   Well, no, there actually was a big thieving ring in europe where they would actually disable the gps and then pop them on trucks and then
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.560]   Sell them for parts basically rip out the gps
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:12.160]   I don't know if it was ripping out or if they use it. We're using a um, don't tell me about this
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:18.160]   What are those things called the movie theaters jammers? Oh, yeah, actually you could do that
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:20.640]   You could just wrap the gps unit mylar
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:23.520]   Yep, that's true
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:29.840]   I used to live in a fair day cage and it was awesome you guys leave you I it was my house. It was not
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:32.000]   Intentionally
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.880]   You had one of those houses that had like a mesh
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:42.000]   Why are basically in the walls and yes, it was great for Wi-Fi by the way, it was it was a fun. Do you guys remember Orson bean?
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:47.840]   Did he write a bunch of science? You don't remember him. No, that's Orson's got car. Okay, sorry
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:53.360]   He was a regular on uh to tell the truth. It's a different Orson bean. What is to tell the truth? Nope
[01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:56.080]   No, not that Orson bean
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:58.720]   You don't want me to show orgone orgon boxes
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:05.840]   He was really into the into this kind of crank concept developed by willhelm Reich in the 30s called the orgon
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:10.080]   Energy accumulator it was basically a box with metal walls
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:16.880]   And I think they may be coming back. Oh, you can actually buy these so telco companies. There's a lot of these
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:19.840]   Well, it doesn't do the same thing
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:26.240]   That the orgon box was it was seen as a massless orgon was a massless omnipresent substance like luminiferous
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:31.680]   For your whole body. Yes. So they so they're octo. I think is it octo cages?
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:35.760]   So if you go into like any so any telco tes lab, right?
[01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:44.000]   They have to yeah, it's an anechoic chamber for RF now they make them small though, which is super fun
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.080]   So you could actually buy when they're still like
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:52.960]   $30,000 but I'm surprised no one has offered one of these as a super super wealthy luxury item
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:36:00.080]   I mean they make hyperbier chambers, right? So you do that so you the emf people yeah, you could you sleep emf free completely
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:03.360]   E mf, well ironically the fda banned the orgon box
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:08.480]   Well, yeah, because it's you're living in a box. Well, no, it's harmless. You just spent an hour a day in that
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:12.960]   It's not wait. That was that was like a therapeutic thing. Yeah, that's why they have been telling you
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:18.240]   This is this is basically a Faraday cage, right? I mean, it's a little more than you need, but it does the job
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:22.560]   Yeah, I mean you could do it with just mesh you can actually see through yeah, Faraday cage is just copper mesh. Yeah
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:24.720]   Yeah
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:30.800]   When we the reason I know about this is when we when I was a kid we we moved from Rhode Island to Santa Cruz
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:35.120]   The hippie capital world we bought a house that used to be an organic farm in Santa Cruz
[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:40.640]   And he had they had an orgon chamber in the master bedroom and we didn't we thought well, that's interesting
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:47.920]   Uh, we got rid of it. I wish we'd saved it. We built a Faraday cage for interop one. Did you really we did and it's actually expensive
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:51.920]   Copper copper is very pricey. Yeah, the copper mesh that you steal it from
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:54.400]   Established electrical wine. That's what I
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:58.800]   You know that that was a problem in Hawaii. They kept stealing the copper
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:01.120]   So what they did was they actually irradiated it
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:08.560]   Not not to be dangerous, but if they someone brings the copper to a recycling center. Oh, they'll detect that it's radioactive and they won't buy it

[01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:03.280]   It's uh, you know why because he's been playing that friday the thirteenth game
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:07.440]   Oh, that's the hockey mask. Jason. That's a scary game
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:10.160]   You I shouldn't let a 14 year old play that game
[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:13.440]   You shouldn't let him walk around hearing an axe
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:17.760]   It's next we see it has a red edge on it so the police know that it's not a real axe
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:20.000]   Don't all that
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.760]   Access have that's what he told me. I don't know if that works
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:29.840]   At night in the dark you put the orange edge on it so the police won't shoot you. I think that's what they do
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:33.200]   The kids today. No my wrong
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:35.200]   Oh

[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:52.080]   I'm like, I'm on the show. I'm just not physically here. I'm aware of what's happening. Yeah, but you're not it's different when you're here here
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:54.560]   This is why she asked for the button. Remember? Yeah
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:57.920]   It's I'm like oh, I do I should have a this is enough button
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:00.640]   But that doesn't need to punch anyone in the face
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:04.080]   Maybe just like a move on you could have a move on button
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:07.040]   Yeah
[01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:11.120]   Or for a remote guess like mike when he wants to come in he can tap it and there you go
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:13.200]   That's right and mute all of you
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:15.440]   That'd be awesome. Um, why are you going?
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:21.120]   One quick thing before we uh, we move off the subject of halloweenie type stuff
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:29.120]   Uh, the nexus of scary things and silicon valley. They're actually making a movie about the winchester mystery house. Oh, that's a good idea
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:33.680]   Starring hell in mirin and it's actually they're playing it up as like a scary movie
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:39.920]   So for those of you who are unfamiliar with this place. It's a it's a place in san jose near los gados
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:45.840]   Uh, where the woman who inherited all the money from the winchester rifle company
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:48.800]   Lived and basically went crazy and she
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:54.320]   Was you couldn't stop build. She couldn't stop building. She was she was racked with guilt over people killed
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:59.760]   Place winchester rifles. Yes a real place. You can go and visit it you pay five bucks and you can take a tour
[01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:04.720]   Uh, and so she kept building weird things to confuse the ghosts who are coming after her
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:10.720]   You have you have doors that you open and then it just drops off of a second stairs go right into the ceiling like all this weird stuff
[01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:16.640]   It's I you know I've spent a lot of time there and uh, it's fun. It's really great as a halloween place. It is awesome
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:22.800]   It inspired one of the american horror story. Oh from that. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, so there you go
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:29.040]   I was like, oh, I have read about this in the context. Oh and maryon. This actually doesn't sound scary. It just sounds really interesting
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:32.320]   Yeah, um, I don't are they gonna make it scary?
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:37.520]   They are just keep watching there's a there's there's ghouls and ghosties. No
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:41.520]   See there's all the winchester rifles that she inherited the fortune from
[01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:48.640]   There's charlton heston in uh, oh no, that's a different one this thing was right next to the uh theater complex that I would always go to as a

[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:05.840]   rooms
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:07.120]   spirits

[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:33.200]   238 cities applying it's getting shameless and some of the methods not a little strange. This is calgary

[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:15.200]   You know my my favorite story about the whole amazon headquarters search is what sanose did they did a study and they said look
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:18.560]   It's not going to pay off don't do it don't come here
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:20.640]   They decided we're not going to do this because
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:27.840]   50 000 jobs sounds very tempting until you look at the cost of the 50 000 but there were some there were some reverse psychology
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:34.480]   Uh, what was the town karston that did the amazon reverse psychology like amazon? We decided don't come here

[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:12.640]   Okay, he's explaining all the reasons why prime is a bad idea for some people
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:16.640]   1000 products purchased and reviewed every review
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:19.840]   A reason for amazon to move to kansas city
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:25.840]   Tell amazon so I guess the idea is telling the citizens citizens sly james the mayor of
[01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:31.120]   Kansas city missouri i mean that's nice, but come on amazon's gonna no he wrote a thousand reviews
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:33.920]   He wrote a thousand reviews
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:40.240]   In each review had a line promoting kansas city like i live in beautiful kansas city where the average home price is just
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:43.440]   $22,000 and now he's banned for life
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:48.880]   You could buy a thousand reviews for about a dollar 25 each just fyi
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:57.200]   But the mayor really cares he really does hey in kc got google fibers so well unless it's kansas city if it's kansas city missouri
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:50:00.880]   Not kansas city kansas kansas kansas city kansas
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:05.360]   It's actually really fast. We have a house there that that got google fiber
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:08.880]   They weren't gonna get it until I kept telling them do it just pay the fee
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:13.040]   So that is a Jesuit party house that is a joseph party because you got crazy super fast
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:18.240]   Super super I put a server there just so I get to hit it when I need to here. This is frisco, texas
[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:24.320]   Do you know that's nearby right no no isn't that uh, it's like just outside of dallas this you can call frisco
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:28.560]   Oh, I don't know. Just don't call san francisco frisco. Well, I thought that's what's when I first saw I don't know why it's
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:32.320]   So well their internet speed is not super fast. Yes
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:38.800]   That's exactly why you should be there. Yeah, no kidding. Um, austin is in the running and
[01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:44.080]   Except for our transportation woes would be a good place. I actually I really hope that's you're sorry
[01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:46.880]   Smaller town you said no to lift in uber now
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:54.800]   We got them back because our state legislature decided that little right over turned over rules over rules
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:58.160]   Keep it weird austin
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:01.600]   There is a very nasty
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:05.920]   Uh, oh we're talking about reaper. I was going to use the amazon segue to talk about the amazon key
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:10.480]   Go ahead amazon key and then we'll talk about reaper. Okay. Why you really you can read my mind. That's good
[01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:12.320]   amazon key
[01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:14.320]   so amazon key is
[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:16.880]   this smart security camera plus
[01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:23.520]   A connected lock which I I love connected locks for me their quick seteriel and this idea so much
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:28.240]   amazon basically you can let people amazon delivery people or
[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:33.280]   Amazon service providers that contract through amazon into your house even if you're not there
[01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:37.680]   They can get in there's a special like lock that they have a key to it's actually not a special
[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:41.440]   I mean it's not super special. It's a yayler quick set. Oh, it's one of them bluetooth
[01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:44.160]   It's I think it's actually going to be a zigby lock
[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:48.720]   That looks like a nest cam, but it's not isn't no all all cameras kind of have that look
[01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:49.680]   Yeah
[01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:52.960]   So that way you can monitor them what they're doing when they come in your house
[01:51:52.960 --> 01:51:57.760]   It's to give you that piece of mind like oh there's amazon person coming in and dropping off a package. Yeah
[01:51:57.760 --> 01:51:59.360]   um
[01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:04.240]   You know the the mail us mail has a similar system a two key system where uh
[01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:10.240]   They do yeah, but not into your house. They into the big mailbox the box at the end of the block
[01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:13.760]   Ours gets broken into all the time. Yeah. Well this one
[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:18.080]   Uh, so if you've got a package there's a larger box at the bottom of the mailbox at pallet
[01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:21.920]   They put the key in your box. You put it and yeah with your package. Yeah
[01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:25.360]   Now this actually would you let people do this? I would
[01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:28.240]   um, I a have that lock so
[01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:34.240]   Like it doesn't unfortunately fit on my front door, but it fits on my garage door. So I would do it in heartbeat
[01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:38.480]   Um, but I usually it's a ups or FedEx driver, right?
[01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:43.760]   Sometimes us postal service and sometimes it's an amazon driver not anymore. I have amazon drivers show a
[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:48.880]   You have actual labeled amazon drivers. Uh, they're they're trucks usually aren't labeled, but they are amazon
[01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:51.520]   They started up a new project the first in india
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:54.960]   But it's now on the west coast of the united states called project seller flex
[01:52:55.440 --> 01:53:01.600]   And this was a way to make the third party seller experience on amazon more like the amazon prime experience
[01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:07.600]   What they're going to do is they're actually they're taking ups and fedex out of that part of the transit equation
[01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:12.320]   Now people are speculating that this means that eventually they want to remove fedex and ups entirely
[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:17.120]   Which means they're going to have their own drivers. So that is one of the caveats on this new amazon delivery service
[01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:19.520]   You can only use amazon's own delivery team
[01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:24.320]   So it may not be appropriate for me because I have never seen an amazon delivery team
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:30.880]   $50 you get the if you want the bundle that includes the smart lock the connected camera the installation even
[01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:33.840]   I don't think it includes insulate says and free installation
[01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:34.560]   Holy moly
[01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:40.720]   Once you have the system in place in home delivery will now be an option every time you order something on amazon with no additional charge
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:45.680]   But uh, it's only available in 37 cities where amazon logistics handles a drop off
[01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:51.200]   So that's why you know problem is theft off of porches. I mean is that it's a big problem here
[01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:58.000]   It's a big problem for retailers. I I want to say they lose like four billion for things not actually arriving
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.800]   But I could be making that number completely up. So
[01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:06.960]   We have uh, we have drop cameras a sponsor of oh, sorry ring the ring video doorbell is a sponsor of the twit tv network
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:09.280]   And the one that I installed at my parents house caught two
[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:15.920]   Two trucks. Yeah stealing packages from the house across the way. Yeah. So were you able to where were they caught?
[01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:18.000]   Did you use the video? Yeah?
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:23.520]   So they the officers went down and they asked any of the residents if they had security cameras and we had ours
[01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:25.920]   We gave it to them and they used it in the in the prosecution
[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:33.120]   There you go. So they so that's that's what you need. You don't need people opening your door. You need uh, I guess
[01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:36.960]   Amazon official amazon employees. I have a camera actually this all makes sense
[01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:39.840]   But you have to live in one of those three seven cities you do obviously
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:44.880]   I think I might um now my question is do I actually need the amazon camera
[01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:49.040]   Because I don't really need the camera because i'm fine with them just walking in with the door
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:54.160]   I think you do just because they need they want to control every part of the system
[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:59.360]   That's true. They want to be sure that it it was verified if they have control of your door lock
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:05.920]   They they need to be able to make sure someone's not spoofing a system through third party heart true if you went to
[01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:09.120]   kfc's twitter account
[01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:13.280]   And you noticed it's following only 11 people it's got 1.24 million
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:16.720]   followers, but it's only following 11 people would you be
[01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:22.640]   smart enough to click the link and say hmm. I wonder who kfc's following. Oh, it's this is brilliant
[01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:30.080]   Wait a minute. It's one two. That's the she's a spice girl. She's a spice girl. Yeah, they were that's a spice girl. That's a spice girl. There's five
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:33.280]   spice girls and
[01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:38.400]   The restaurant named herb it's six guys named herb. It's 11 herbs and spices
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:46.560]   This I don't know how long that's been going on for uh, they joined twitter in july 2008
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:52.640]   And it took us this long to figure that I would love to think that they did this from the beginning and it's taken us all these years
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:55.120]   That's like the best Easter egg ever, right?
[01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:58.240]   There's been some guy in their market department going come on
[01:55:58.240 --> 01:56:00.800]   Just like
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:06.960]   And then I just love that that is brilliant marketing and they're gonna get a lot of press versus result
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:11.840]   Almost as much as youtube putting the play button on the back of it. Yeah, yeah
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:18.080]   Hey good news. Uh, well, maybe bad news for some uh, no more revenge porn on twitter. Uh, it's official
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:22.960]   Uh, twitter has a doubt there's no good. There's no there's no bad news here
[01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:27.680]   This is all good news except for twitter's promised these kinds of things before and not deliver
[01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:33.680]   Except that is the bad and that it's just very weird to see that they have a timeline
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:40.160]   For this like starting well, let me let me get the timeline up for you. I don't know why my
[01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:44.960]   Yeah, the announcement is that they will stop watching in it. Not that they can actually stop it
[01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:48.080]   Yeah, we'll no longer tolerate it. There it is
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:50.960]   october 27th
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:57.760]   Why that's soon tomorrow saturday no more non-consensual nudity. It's out. It's got to stop no more
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:04.560]   Uh, that means up skirt photos. That means hidden webcams. Nope. They'll be banned. What they not weren't banned before
[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:10.400]   This is this has been I mean this was an issue with I think it was the massachusetts of legislature with up skirt photos
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:12.880]   That was technically legal
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:17.840]   Um, please I must have been on the nicer side of twitter because i've seen some hateful things
[01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:23.920]   But i've never seen revenge porn in my feed until I until it was a ted cruise. I didn't realize there was porn on twitter
[01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:30.960]   I did so I had I thought that was on a med filter teddy educated us all. I was like, I mean they they're saying that they're they're gonna ban
[01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:35.680]   uh, yeah people who condone or threaten violence and
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:39.440]   That's such a fine line. That's hard. Threatening. Yeah, or
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:45.680]   But I would say nonconsensual pictures of t- that's pretty good that is yeah, that's compromising
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:50.880]   Nonconsent. I mean organizing so starting november 3rd, which is a week from tomorrow
[01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:57.840]   Uh, no more advocating violence. Oh, but you have to be oh see that's the weasel words organizations or groups so individuals
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:05.520]   You you're okay. Hey in the same time hated images hate symbols those are gonna be barred including an avatar's profile headers again
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:10.800]   Amazing what another week this is yeah, you got one more week to to believe that nancy swastika in there
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:13.280]   unwanted sexual advances
[01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:18.960]   No more after next friday hateful display names. Oh, you got a few more weeks. That's november 22nd
[01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:22.800]   And uh, it won't be till december 14th just in time for christmas
[01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:28.000]   That uh content that glorifies or condones act of violence that result in death or serious physical harm
[01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:31.600]   Because then uh every movie studio is gonna lose their twitter account
[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:36.000]   Well, they're not literally advocating
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:41.680]   Violence and harm it's just a movie wait that glorifies glorifies
[01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:43.600]   Oh
[01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:47.360]   I mean come on every action. Oh, it does kind of glorify it doesn't it
[01:58:47.360 --> 01:58:54.480]   Well there again. This is the problem with everything twitter does it's always up to twitter to decide what is what
[01:58:54.560 --> 01:59:01.600]   Yeah, so you have to go to them and appeal to them and if you're not verified then you don't have a prayer laws are that's why we have courts and I mean like
[01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:09.120]   my definition of things that are violent or offensive or different, I mean right community standards
[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:09.920]   This is yeah
[01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:17.040]   I mean look everyone at this table has had and and over skype has had some hurtful hurtful stuff aimed at them on twitter
[01:59:17.040 --> 01:59:18.080]   Yeah
[01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:21.920]   But somebody once said he thought my hair was a way. I mean nobody please don't
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:27.440]   Something's weird. I've only had people be nice to me on twitter. Really? I'm not I'm not kidding. I can't say that
[01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:31.040]   I can't say that because it's just no no. I mean, I'm telling you that's a bad
[01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:33.200]   I know and please please shina hora
[01:59:33.200 --> 01:59:41.440]   But I mean but the problem with with this I applaud this they need to move towards something like this
[01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:44.960]   But I could see the spiraling out of control really really knows in july
[01:59:44.960 --> 01:59:50.800]   On july of 2013 twitter prepared to extend reporting abuse to all users couldn't do it before 2013
[01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:55.280]   December 2014 twitter takes small steps to finally deal with this harassment problem
[01:59:55.280 --> 01:59:56.560]   That's worked well
[01:59:56.560 --> 02:00:03.040]   2015 in february of that year twitter ceo said we suck at dealing with abuse. Yes, that was dick costala
[02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:07.760]   Uh, no, maybe that was a jack coming in coming. No, I think we're still there. No, that was dick
[02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:13.600]   March 2017 twitter is finally rolling out. This is a march a smart fix for its abuse problem
[02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:18.720]   Uh and finally october meaningful safety updates, uh next month
[02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:22.720]   This is axios pointing out that it ain't the first time right
[02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:29.680]   In okay, so I think you nailed it. It's it it's hard to define what these things are
[02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:30.800]   Well, okay
[02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:35.040]   Some of them are not hard to define like some of the things that people are sent is really just
[02:00:35.040 --> 02:00:40.160]   Reprehensible so I feel in twitter has historically not taken care of those even
[02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:45.040]   Unless you're famous now are okay in this group. Are there any bright line examples?
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:50.240]   Someone puts a swastika as their profile pic is that is that 100%
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:56.080]   Isn't it a Buddhist or a Hindu symbol? Exactly. Well, no, no, it's it's the swastika
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:59.360]   So it's not the reverse. It's it's the actual Nazi swastika
[02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:04.560]   And let's say they put a couple of iris the problem and armband and this is the legal system requires proof of intent
[02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:08.640]   Right and that's how that's the hardest thing to define intent
[02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:14.960]   Um, is this intended to be hateful? I don't know. Well, see that's why it can't just be an automatic system
[02:01:14.960 --> 02:01:18.880]   They need to have people who actually look through the account. Yeah now if it's a profile pic plus
[02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:24.320]   15 pages of this person saying horrible horrible things. All right. Yeah, that's done
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:27.120]   But this is the real problem. So you ban that guy
[02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:29.600]   Right, so I have another account
[02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:33.520]   The only way to make twitter more civil is if there's skin in the game
[02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:39.600]   If I can make another account in 10 seconds and be right back at how you're gonna stop it unless yeah
[02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:45.120]   I mean this is like okay. We start tying twitter accounts to something that can be tied to actual people
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:48.320]   That's that is such a massive change
[02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:53.360]   It's super and and twitter's gonna say no and what they point to is the Arab spring
[02:01:53.360 --> 02:02:01.440]   We talked about this on sunday and other times when twitter has been very effectively used by dissidents by activists to change
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:02.800]   uh
[02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:05.680]   repressive governments to look at turkey and the
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:06.640]   um
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:09.200]   The protest and tireier square. These are all
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:12.240]   twitter claims twitter powered. I'm not sure that's true
[02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:14.560]   But that but they certainly twitter was part of it
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:18.880]   And they're gonna say we can't force people to use their real identities because that will suppress
[02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:22.080]   But those people are probably not on twitter anymore
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:26.000]   Well, I'm my guess is that twitter wasn't really ever that you need pseudonymity
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:29.920]   So all you need to do is that you need to verify who you are to twitter
[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:35.520]   And then once they know that you are you and then erida one just says okay twitter
[02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:38.000]   Put any public name you want who is this guy?
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:43.520]   With the to the public you're your anonymous you use a fake name to the government
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:47.120]   Consiputant when twitter decides they want to be big in turkey or big in russia
[02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:51.040]   They'll say oh is this guy bothering you here. Let me give you his account information
[02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:57.600]   What what you need is an organization there there are also gray areas like uh the palestine liberation front
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:02:59.120]   Yeah, is that a hate group?
[02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:02.080]   Well to some it is to others. It's a freedom fighters
[02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:08.160]   And who's going to decide that so many gray areas there's the example of threats of violence
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:13.440]   Uh typical example you can you know in the old days somebody could say i'm going to kill you
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:17.200]   And then that was banned so they said somebody should kill you right um
[02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:23.840]   You know would have somebody kills you like you there there's a whole spectrum of ways to threaten somebody and everybody gets a message
[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:26.960]   It's the same communication using words that are
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:32.160]   Increasingly difficult the ban there's really no hard and fast black and white rule that you can
[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:37.360]   Establish i don't condone violence, but i i wouldn't weep for you if someone were to kill you at this rally
[02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:44.720]   Expressing in opinion well and what's really uh significant is that this is happening in the white house
[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:47.600]   This is happening that's yeah, and so uh
[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:54.000]   Well, the first lady said she was going to attack take this on and i'm sure that's no more bullying
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:57.200]   Happening now. She just be kind. Okay. Just be kind
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:04.000]   Here's the only way that something like this works and you can extend this to facebook as well as if you had an organization that enough people trusted
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.240]   To keep them anonymous
[02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:10.080]   Could do they're verifying say yes this this is a verified account
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:18.480]   But then you've got they've got to have awesome security which is they're gonna have precise company backing and they can't turn down our own subpoenas
[02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:24.000]   So suddenly uh you could if it was say a nation state like at the vatican where to start doing this
[02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:26.720]   I
[02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:31.440]   Should we do we have anything to fear father robert now that they have how many catholic
[02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:38.560]   I'm doing special project superior technological skills that there be hested command just saying
[02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:45.120]   So this is something actually that is serious and you should worry about we covered it on security now in great detail. It is
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:53.200]   The iot botnet that is growing really rapidly already two million
[02:04:54.160 --> 02:04:57.360]   Iot devices mostly routers have been compromised
[02:04:57.360 --> 02:05:01.600]   They are the botnet is growing at a rate of 10,000 per day now
[02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:05.920]   A botnet that had one tenth the size the mirror eye botnet
[02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:10.320]   Brought down on christmas day. You may remember the playstation network and xbox network
[02:05:10.320 --> 02:05:15.680]   Uh was used and that took advantage of flaws in routers some of the same routers that we're seeing by the way
[02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:21.600]   And plug those routers in this in this new botnet iot devices like ip wireless cameras
[02:05:22.240 --> 02:05:24.720]   Uh just unpatched devices
[02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:27.440]   Uh this this new one
[02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:29.600]   Uh, which we're calling reaper
[02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:34.080]   Although checkpoint has uh is calling it uh iotroop
[02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:40.320]   Uh, they say a new you're just gonna get the headlines a new iot botnet storm is coming
[02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:48.000]   It's recruiting iot devices at a far greater pace and with more potential damage than the mirror eye botnet of 2016
[02:05:49.040 --> 02:05:54.000]   And if you look at the attacking ip addresses this graph, which is growing
[02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:57.920]   Pretty much almost well, it's almost exponential straight line right now
[02:05:57.920 --> 02:06:01.360]   This is since the 29th of september. This is in three weeks
[02:06:01.360 --> 02:06:09.040]   How much this has grown it is uh growing really rapidly, but what we don't know is who created it
[02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:12.080]   who controls it
[02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:14.800]   And most importantly, what are they planned to do with it?
[02:06:16.640 --> 02:06:18.800]   Uh, there's nothing more to say except
[02:06:18.800 --> 02:06:23.920]   That's the facts jack was discovered by checkpoint security
[02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:28.960]   Uh, and uh, you know the the devices involved
[02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:36.400]   Are cameras dlink routers a number of dlink routers number of tp link routers and net gear routers
[02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:38.960]   avtech micro tick and
[02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:46.240]   Linksys and we've seen many of these before your favorite the uh, sonality this sineology disk station manager
[02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:51.200]   Right. Well, that's that's a naz that someone put on the internet. You're not supposed to do that
[02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:58.480]   Uh, they they create a router the srm right and that you can't put on the internet so many of these my sonologies on the internet
[02:06:58.480 --> 02:07:03.840]   Uh, so your router. Yeah through my router. So you think that that as a result couldn't
[02:07:03.840 --> 02:07:10.960]   No, uh, join about that because there is a function that you can add to a sineology naz to say be a router. Got it
[02:07:10.960 --> 02:07:15.520]   That's a really bad idea. That's a horribly bad idea. Well, people are doing it. Yeah, uh, so
[02:07:16.480 --> 02:07:24.240]   Unfortunately, um, can can we not call this an internet of things botnet because while these are routers or I know
[02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:28.880]   I think it's unfair to call them. These are things on the internet. That's right and I would say
[02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:35.440]   Again, your old routers my god burn them in a fire you guy. Okay recycle them responsibly, but
[02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:37.840]   In a fire
[02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:41.360]   They they really you've got to unplug them. You've got to update
[02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:46.800]   You've got to look for over the air updates. You've got to look for a company that actually does them in cares like for example
[02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:53.040]   I'm gonna call you out links this because with crack there. I asked I was like, hey, what's up with my routers?
[02:07:53.040 --> 02:07:57.680]   What are you guys doing? They're like we are aware of the problem and we are addressing it and I haven't heard boo since
[02:07:57.680 --> 02:07:59.280]   and
[02:07:59.280 --> 02:08:03.360]   I want to see way better way more rapid security from these companies
[02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:10.400]   And that is that is gonna stop this that is all well. I mean then we also have the dlink lawsuit right now
[02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:17.040]   And they've thrown out a lot of that half of that lawsuit has been tossed because you can't really show any damages
[02:08:17.040 --> 02:08:21.440]   You can show that the equipment is vulnerable. Is this the FTC one? This is the FTC. Okay. Yes
[02:08:21.440 --> 02:08:23.680]   Yeah, and that's that that kills me. It's like wait a minute
[02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:29.600]   We need some leverage against these manufacturers that will release a product and then they won't update the firmware for five years
[02:08:29.600 --> 02:08:31.520]   Well in what you need is damage
[02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:35.600]   I mean the become and this is the problem with security up until now as it's all been an
[02:08:35.840 --> 02:08:42.000]   Externality so the people who pay for it. I as a consumer spending my money on my router that it's super cheap instead of super secure
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:48.400]   I'm not paying for when it takes down, you know, dying or my Netflix. So
[02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:52.240]   I I had a know-how
[02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:58.880]   segment planned for what lat late last year where I was going to show people how easy it was to scan a range of
[02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:01.200]   Comcast IP addresses
[02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:06.560]   Figure out which ones were vulnerable and then get in and pivot and it was it was basically a point and click type thing
[02:09:06.560 --> 02:09:09.040]   And I thought better. I'm like this is too dangerous
[02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:17.360]   But the fact that it's too dangerous also means I can't believe that this is still possible these these are actively supported devices by Comcast
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:23.520]   And I can exploit them with a script kitty toolkit. That's that's ridiculous. And that's not unique
[02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:29.040]   That's common just go down the list of all those devices from all the major manufacturers
[02:09:29.520 --> 02:09:34.960]   What might be interesting is unfortunately like traditional like the actual when I think of an IOT device
[02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:37.440]   These don't have the bandwidth or the computer to be interesting
[02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:44.880]   But if these could ruin something like that a giant network they do you pivot you pivot so here's it's an amplification attack
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:48.960]   So you don't you don't care about the power of the device as long as they can reflect something
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:52.640]   You're happy now, but it's even worse than he's worse than that
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:56.720]   That's that's the one thing if I own the device and I can just make it send traffic already
[02:09:56.720 --> 02:09:59.760]   That's valuable to me as as a black cat use it as a DDoS
[02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:03.280]   But a lot of these that do remote allow me remote code execution
[02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:08.240]   They will allow me to pivot so now I can see inside your network now. Maybe I don't care what's in your network
[02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:10.000]   But if I did
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.720]   It's as if you don't have a fire and that's the problem with a crack attack
[02:10:12.720 --> 02:10:19.520]   Which is clients mostly IOT devices that join networks although actually not mostly IOT devices including phones and laptops
[02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:22.960]   Yeah, all kinds of things anything that joins in a network
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:30.640]   Is vulnerable the sad thing is well the interesting thing to me is the mirror eye button that had one
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:33.200]   Flaw that it was taking advantage of
[02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:37.520]   This one is much more sophisticated, which makes me nervous makes me suspect
[02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:42.080]   Maybe a more sophisticated actor is involved here like let's say a nation state
[02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:46.480]   it's uh it is a broad range of
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:48.640]   vulnerabilities
[02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:55.200]   being exploited and as a result that's why it says a much broader range of internet connected devices
[02:10:55.200 --> 02:11:02.480]   And what's also interesting is many of these devices do have patches, but people just whoops people just don't patch them
[02:11:02.480 --> 02:11:06.960]   Yep, people just don't patch them. That's because it's a pain. I mean they'll make it easy
[02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:11.120]   Sometimes the patches aren't available right in a way that is easy for you to do it
[02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:16.880]   I want some of the one of the reasons why I suggest the Synology routers is because they will automatically update
[02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:19.760]   I like that some people hate that I love it because
[02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:24.320]   A consumer like my parents. I can give this to them and say just leave it on
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:26.080]   Right, we'll take care of itself
[02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:31.840]   Now all of these attacks are taking care taking advantage of something that that we've done very poorly and that is make the transition
[02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:38.960]   From the the late 90s mindset to the new millennium. Well, they're right took advantage of the fact that they're had a hardwired login
[02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:43.040]   But no
[02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:49.360]   Any minds ever many decades well, no, but the mindset used to be you protect the core the cores were all the important stuff
[02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:51.280]   Now it's the edge the edge has brains
[02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:55.360]   And it was about six years ago when people started saying right I don't need to own the core
[02:11:55.360 --> 02:11:58.720]   If I can own the edge and use the edge to disrupt the core
[02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:01.040]   I want to correct myself the morai net
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:05.520]   Was not the one two years ago that affected the PlayStation network. That was the one last business
[02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:09.200]   That affected the dine DNS that almost brought the internet
[02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:13.680]   I bring down a big a big DNS provider dine. Yeah
[02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:19.520]   But I don't see this problem being solved through user action. It will never be solved through user action
[02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:20.400]   Right
[02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:24.800]   In terms of their their purchasing what they buy and then what they do after they buy because
[02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:27.440]   most of these attacks don't directly
[02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:29.920]   Affect the user like right now for example
[02:12:29.920 --> 02:12:36.000]   People listening to this some percentage of the people listening to this show or watching this show have that on their router
[02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:41.200]   Okay, what is what bad thing is happening to them right right now right nothing really right?
[02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:49.600]   It's kind of an abstraction and you know think about the number of users who don't take action when they have fishing attacks when they have trojans
[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:53.360]   With the actual malware problems. Yeah, right in front of their faces
[02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:58.560]   You could be you could be part of the morai botnet or this new botnet and and not know it
[02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:02.800]   There'd be a lot there'd be excess traffic coming out of your say your broadband miss low down
[02:13:02.880 --> 02:13:05.920]   Maybe a little bit but it didn't need to slow down much by the way
[02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:10.320]   Not only does it take advantage of at least seven or eight different vulnerabilities. It has an entire
[02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:12.960]   Lua based back end
[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:18.960]   That allows new code modules to be downloaded to infected machines. This is a this is much more sophisticated
[02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:23.120]   It's a malware that can be updated more updated more than the routers
[02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:24.080]   That's good
[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:29.920]   So even if they were even if checkpoint a Chinese company chihu 360 also found this
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:35.120]   Even if they were to analyze and say it does this it could do something different tomorrow. They know at least that it's programmable
[02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:38.480]   Uh, so this is that's really scary
[02:13:38.480 --> 02:13:43.120]   Just so you know what in a couple of weeks will say oh now we know what reaper was designed to do
[02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:46.400]   But right now we don't we just know it's out there
[02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:49.760]   Well, no and it might be designed to do something different later
[02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:55.120]   And it might well yeah just helping a new module. I asked Steve. Well, what can't they figure out with the command and control?
[02:13:55.120 --> 02:13:59.760]   Um, uh networks. Sorry. He said no, they're a variety. I got very smart about that. They're very smart
[02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:02.720]   Um, can you I mean all
[02:14:02.720 --> 02:14:09.040]   All people should do and the problem is it's not that people watch this show because they know enough anyway to keep their stuff up to date
[02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:12.560]   Is look at this database of infected devices and unplug them
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:17.360]   As you said donate them and responsibly recycle responsible recycle with a hammer
[02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:21.200]   Yeah, uh because yeah, you don't want to give it to good will
[02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:24.480]   Right, uh, unless you really don't like that person
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:27.120]   No, it's it affects all of it
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:31.360]   Um, I was joking, but yes, absolutely. Here's here's the fun part
[02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:35.760]   Your neighbor who might be having compromised equipment. It's not just your neighbor's problem
[02:14:35.760 --> 02:14:41.840]   Your neighbor's on your segments less your broadband, but it's even less your neighbor problem than you or than your than the world's problem
[02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:46.720]   That's the funny thing is the burden of this doesn't as you point out lie on the guy who's infected
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:49.120]   And so there's even less reason
[02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:54.320]   Yeah, if you ever want to get depressed just secure google like security and externalities and you will just be like
[02:14:54.800 --> 02:14:57.840]   We will never solve this just like we will never fix the climate
[02:14:57.840 --> 02:15:02.960]   And you know I feel bad about uh snap though because they made a whole bunch of spectacles
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:05.840]   You have some I have my snap spectacles
[02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:09.120]   How cool they were everybody wanted
[02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:12.080]   That was like a
[02:15:12.080 --> 02:15:14.640]   Apparently
[02:15:14.640 --> 02:15:22.160]   According according to the verge snap is stuck with hundreds of thousands of unsulled spectacles and spectacle parts in warehouses
[02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:24.480]   They oh actually this is the information
[02:15:24.480 --> 02:15:26.080]   uh
[02:15:26.080 --> 02:15:34.320]   They snap expects demand to continue after the holland or thought demand will continue after that big rush last year and ordered hundreds of thousands of additional units
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:40.560]   But once it opens sales to a wider audience the demand dried up and there's this is the whole thing
[02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:45.040]   They were cool because they were scarce right and they created a glut and nobody cares
[02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:50.160]   I think it's a silicon valley thing like they were cool because tech people were like it was neeminess
[02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:56.640]   Tech not even tech people tech journalists. Yes. Some tech journalists. I thought they were ugly deck
[02:15:56.640 --> 02:16:00.880]   I never wanted to put this. Yes. I liked him, but I warm once and that's I never
[02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:06.480]   Didn't look fashionable and fetching like google glass did could you get any my spectacles so I could show people how
[02:16:06.480 --> 02:16:09.280]   How could they look at least compared to the phyllis grace?
[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:15.280]   They might be in the drawer on the lower left there. Yeah, well the big issue wasn't even like in the closet up behind
[02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:23.120]   I think I think they're behind the june oven and just to the left of my v gear vr and
[02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:25.840]   Oh lord. I have a lot of the average
[02:16:25.840 --> 02:16:29.760]   That's what they have to be on your countertop. The june is still in use. Okay. I'm sorry
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:35.040]   You are trying to make a point. No, I say that the the average snap spectacles use or use it for what a week
[02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:40.880]   Yeah, something like that. So even the ones who did use it. Yeah, they realized. Yeah, this is not ideal. Don't worry
[02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:42.880]   They have two point eight billion dollars on hand
[02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:46.160]   Although they're burning at the rate of
[02:16:46.160 --> 02:16:48.800]   They were a camera company. I wonder if they still say that six months
[02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:55.120]   They almost bought a drone a chinese drone maker. I fell through so these don't look bad at all. I think
[02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:58.240]   Let me try them. Let's see what happens
[02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:05.440]   Let's go with the with the hip. Oh see look. Okay. Actually on you. They're not bad. They're not
[02:17:05.440 --> 02:17:09.360]   Yeah, do you feel that I'm not hip enough to wear this?
[02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:16.560]   I just feel like you exude a certain gravitas that maybe these spectacles do not accentuate. I save Higginbotham
[02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:19.520]   I say
[02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:24.480]   No, what you're saying is I look I look like a cartoon character wearing them
[02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:26.080]   I do kind of see I
[02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:30.000]   Thought that they should have the the yellow circles both on the same side
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:34.240]   So it looks like you're looked at you looks like you that that emoji looking up
[02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:36.560]   You need little kunderene eyes for these
[02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:39.840]   Oh, you know what if they had an emojis on them. I bet they'd be amazing
[02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:44.240]   An emojis make everything better. We know this. We know this
[02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:50.320]   And they had this nice weird rubber case with proprietary charging that if you lost it you'd never
[02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:53.440]   Joke be yeah, because what I really like is proprietary the things
[02:17:53.440 --> 02:17:58.400]   Yeah, and they're they're still they're recording right now
[02:17:58.400 --> 02:18:01.200]   Wait, are they still linked to the Wi-Fi?
[02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:05.280]   They're linked to my snapchat, which is on your phone, which is not here
[02:18:05.360 --> 02:18:07.360]   Oh, which we could be totally
[02:18:07.360 --> 02:18:09.360]   If you're on three phones ago, right?
[02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:12.480]   Check, please snap a cat
[02:18:12.480 --> 02:18:16.880]   My old phone somebody says it looks like I had cataract surgery and I'm just recovering
[02:18:16.880 --> 02:18:20.720]   Not a good look those look like Marty Blountman's Marty Feldman
[02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:24.320]   They do would you like them because they really do look better
[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:29.840]   They actually really do look I have an amazing pair of sunglasses that have Swarovski crystals on them that I wear
[02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:33.040]   But do they have the yellow circles on those corners?
[02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:37.680]   You actually look really good in this doesn't she look good in this? I think I can do the whole show
[02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:40.320]   How do you make a picture? I forgot
[02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:44.640]   That's the lens. I think that's how you put a fingerprint on the lens
[02:18:44.640 --> 02:18:48.880]   This is just like the speaker you just are recording. I see that I'd do it again
[02:18:48.880 --> 02:18:55.440]   Wait, oh, I see the real light. Oh, I'm recording this on Leo's. I don't know where it's going
[02:18:55.440 --> 02:18:58.640]   Wait, oh, it's still recording. I think it's at his house
[02:18:58.640 --> 02:19:02.720]   Um, I think it's the essential phone, which you're gonna inherit. I don't know. It's not that
[02:19:02.720 --> 02:19:04.720]   It's probably the note five
[02:19:04.720 --> 02:19:09.440]   Now that would be a cool feature. You don't want these it. No, I'm good
[02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:15.920]   Those will be a collector's item. Yeah, you should save them you come with them in the they're going in my museum
[02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:19.600]   I have a museum behind my desk. I'll do an IO T museum. Yeah, you should do that
[02:19:19.600 --> 02:19:24.240]   I thought this was kind of neat the way they fit in the case and everything and I don't know
[02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:26.640]   Yeah, I'll put them in the I'll put them in the museum behind me
[02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:29.840]   They were the choice I would do a moment in time, isn't it?
[02:19:29.840 --> 02:19:34.480]   Do you remember when there was a time that people were paying for four or five times over the asking price?
[02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:39.120]   I think that was just tech journalists who had the right story. No, we had we had an engineer here Cara Cole
[02:19:39.120 --> 02:19:45.280]   Who told me I will pay you up to $600. Could they open source this could they put this like and give this to like
[02:19:45.280 --> 02:19:51.600]   Yeah, it's called a phone. It's well. It's a camera. I mean, I doubt this is anything too
[02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:53.120]   I mean
[02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:55.120]   I'm just thinking like if I could
[02:19:56.240 --> 02:20:00.400]   If I could use that and build apps against okay, yeah, that was cool
[02:20:00.400 --> 02:20:04.640]   It would have been nice. It had been if it had been an open platform. You might have more people buying them
[02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:10.160]   I'm just saying I think a couple hundred thousand. I mean, they what can you do if you could quickly record something
[02:20:10.160 --> 02:20:12.160]   or
[02:20:12.160 --> 02:20:16.720]   I'm trying to they don't show you anything in the glass. So they would have to make them not sunglasses
[02:20:16.720 --> 02:20:19.600]   What are you talking about sunglasses are appropriate everywhere
[02:20:19.600 --> 02:20:25.680]   At night indoors ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna take a little break. I'm recording this right now
[02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:32.720]   We're gonna take a little break and come back with picks of the week numbers anything you guys think is interesting and worth
[02:20:32.720 --> 02:20:35.680]   highlighting to the world at large
[02:20:35.680 --> 02:20:38.880]   First a word from our sponsor
[02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:45.120]   Ah rocket mortgage I knew I had it here somewhere
[02:20:45.120 --> 02:20:51.200]   I love rocket mortgage from quick and lones actually I can't really say I love rocket mortgage
[02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:54.720]   I love the idea of rocket mortgage and I know that the next time I buy a house
[02:20:54.720 --> 02:20:58.960]   I will use rocket mortgage because when we bought our house, Lisa and I four years ago
[02:20:58.960 --> 02:21:01.920]   We didn't use rocket mortgage. They weren't around yet
[02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:06.480]   We used that big bank and everybody knows the number one lender in the country with the whips
[02:21:06.480 --> 02:21:10.800]   And the horses it's like divo has a bank divo has a bank
[02:21:10.800 --> 02:21:16.320]   Don't ever borrow from divo's bank. It's well first of all you have to go you have to go to the bank
[02:21:16.320 --> 02:21:19.840]   You have to go and then there's somebody there and this is like four years ago
[02:21:20.080 --> 02:21:22.080]   But you might as well have been 1895
[02:21:22.080 --> 02:21:26.960]   Uh, no, it might be it's a little later because he didn't have an abacus. He had a calculator
[02:21:26.960 --> 02:21:31.040]   That had that you had an amortization table key on, you know
[02:21:31.040 --> 02:21:38.640]   So he was so yeah, and he had a chief of papers if we give you this loan and we calculate your monthly payment based on the down payment would be
[02:21:39.840 --> 02:21:42.580]   (imitating PA)
[02:21:42.580 --> 02:21:44.280]   400, no that's wrong.
[02:21:44.280 --> 02:21:45.440]   (imitating PA)
[02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:48.220]   It was crazy but that wasn't the worst part.
[02:21:48.220 --> 02:21:51.700]   Then we go home and we say okay fine, we'll take it.
[02:21:51.700 --> 02:21:53.340]   Okay and he says good but we'll be in touch
[02:21:53.340 --> 02:21:54.660]   because there's some things we need.
[02:21:54.660 --> 02:21:57.960]   Well we were in touch for weeks, for two months
[02:21:57.960 --> 02:22:01.660]   sending them stuff every week, another batch of
[02:22:01.660 --> 02:22:06.420]   well now we need pay stubs from your job four jobs ago
[02:22:06.420 --> 02:22:07.260]   and stuff like that.
[02:22:07.260 --> 02:22:08.860]   I mean literally it just went on and on.
[02:22:08.860 --> 02:22:10.940]   We almost lost house, I've told this story before.
[02:22:10.940 --> 02:22:12.340]   I won't belabor the point.
[02:22:12.340 --> 02:22:14.100]   It was not a good experience.
[02:22:14.100 --> 02:22:15.380]   In comes quick and loans.
[02:22:15.380 --> 02:22:17.180]   Best lender in the country.
[02:22:17.180 --> 02:22:19.140]   Fabulous, very forward looking.
[02:22:19.140 --> 02:22:21.260]   Number one in customer satisfaction.
[02:22:21.260 --> 02:22:24.780]   Year after year they realized this is old fashioned.
[02:22:24.780 --> 02:22:26.420]   It's not keeping up with the times.
[02:22:26.420 --> 02:22:29.980]   We need a client focused technological solution
[02:22:29.980 --> 02:22:34.140]   so they created rocket mortgage and they had three goals.
[02:22:34.140 --> 02:22:37.260]   Goal number one, they wanted to make it simple to apply
[02:22:37.260 --> 02:22:38.620]   so they do the entire thing online.
[02:22:38.620 --> 02:22:42.820]   There's no paperwork, literally no paperwork
[02:22:42.820 --> 02:22:44.420]   to apply for the loan.
[02:22:44.420 --> 02:22:46.980]   You have to sign papers at the end when you get the loan
[02:22:46.980 --> 02:22:49.660]   but to apply no paperwork, no going to the attic,
[02:22:49.660 --> 02:22:52.260]   no searching through, it's simple.
[02:22:52.260 --> 02:22:53.980]   There's, it's fully transparent.
[02:22:53.980 --> 02:22:55.780]   They tell you exactly every step of the way
[02:22:55.780 --> 02:22:58.180]   what's going on so you understand fully.
[02:22:58.180 --> 02:23:00.540]   And then based on your income, your assets and credits
[02:23:00.540 --> 02:23:01.940]   they have relationships with all the banks
[02:23:01.940 --> 02:23:03.620]   and everything so they say okay,
[02:23:03.620 --> 02:23:05.620]   you give them some basic information they say
[02:23:05.620 --> 02:23:08.060]   this is this you, is this your bank account?
[02:23:08.060 --> 02:23:09.460]   Do we have permission to access it?
[02:23:09.460 --> 02:23:12.060]   Yes, okay, now we know what we need to know
[02:23:12.060 --> 02:23:15.820]   and within minutes of you sitting down to do this
[02:23:15.820 --> 02:23:18.460]   on your computer, on your laptop, on your tablet,
[02:23:18.460 --> 02:23:21.420]   on your phone, it'll say you're approved
[02:23:21.420 --> 02:23:22.740]   and there's a big button that says print out
[02:23:22.740 --> 02:23:24.740]   your approval letter, you bring that to the open house,
[02:23:24.740 --> 02:23:27.260]   you're done, you've got the loan.
[02:23:27.260 --> 02:23:31.900]   Rocket mortgage, you apply simply, you understand fully
[02:23:31.900 --> 02:23:35.820]   and then you mortgage confidently with quick and loans.
[02:23:35.820 --> 02:23:37.940]   It's rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[02:23:37.940 --> 02:23:42.460]   If you're buying or refying, in my mind there's just no better
[02:23:42.460 --> 02:23:45.380]   way to do this, rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[02:23:45.380 --> 02:23:47.020]   They're in equal housing, lender licensed
[02:23:47.020 --> 02:23:51.460]   in all 50 states, nmlsconsumeraccess.org, number 30, 30.
[02:23:51.460 --> 02:23:56.540]   Don't go back in time to get your next home loan.
[02:23:56.540 --> 02:24:00.060]   Go to quick and loans, rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[02:24:00.060 --> 02:24:04.300]   I did this entire advertisement wearing spectacles,
[02:24:04.300 --> 02:24:06.340]   snapchat spectacles.
[02:24:06.340 --> 02:24:07.180]   Someone's got to.
[02:24:07.180 --> 02:24:09.300]   I think you could hack these on know-how?
[02:24:09.300 --> 02:24:11.980]   Probably, I mean, they're kind of encased in plastic.
[02:24:11.980 --> 02:24:12.820]   They're Bluetooth, right?
[02:24:12.820 --> 02:24:15.140]   I mean, if they're Bluetooth, they can be hackable.
[02:24:15.140 --> 02:24:16.340]   Yeah.
[02:24:16.340 --> 02:24:18.860]   Maybe you could modify them so they don't look dumb.
[02:24:18.860 --> 02:24:19.860]   (laughing)
[02:24:19.860 --> 02:24:21.140]   They don't look that dumb.
[02:24:21.140 --> 02:24:23.620]   They look great and stacy, but I'm guessing
[02:24:23.620 --> 02:24:24.700]   a lot of things do.
[02:24:24.700 --> 02:24:26.900]   You have to have a good face, you guys.
[02:24:26.900 --> 02:24:29.100]   (laughing)
[02:24:29.100 --> 02:24:32.020]   You don't need a fist, you just kind of beat me
[02:24:32.020 --> 02:24:34.020]   with your words, just beat me with your words.
[02:24:34.020 --> 02:24:36.340]   Stacey, do you have a pick or anything you'd like to?
[02:24:36.340 --> 02:24:37.180]   I do.
[02:24:37.180 --> 02:24:38.020]   Yes.
[02:24:38.020 --> 02:24:41.260]   It's not a physical thing because I'm here as a surprise.
[02:24:41.260 --> 02:24:42.100]   Yes.
[02:24:42.100 --> 02:24:42.940]   I didn't even know I was going to be here.
[02:24:42.940 --> 02:24:44.460]   Happy birthday to me.
[02:24:44.460 --> 02:24:46.020]   Oh, it is almost your birthday.
[02:24:46.020 --> 02:24:46.860]   Uh-huh.
[02:24:46.860 --> 02:24:47.700]   Yeah, I'm not going to say.
[02:24:47.700 --> 02:24:48.860]   Oh, wow.
[02:24:48.860 --> 02:24:50.180]   Wow.
[02:24:50.180 --> 02:24:52.980]   How old are you now, Leo?
[02:24:52.980 --> 02:24:53.820]   I'm not going to ask.
[02:24:53.820 --> 02:24:55.540]   No, no, no, no, yeah, I'll take that.
[02:24:55.540 --> 02:24:56.420]   This is kind of iffy.
[02:24:56.420 --> 02:24:57.260]   This is a startup.
[02:24:57.260 --> 02:25:01.140]   It is a startup called Wellio, and you sign up for
[02:25:01.140 --> 02:25:01.980]   a newsletter and one--
[02:25:01.980 --> 02:25:04.980]   Do you mean Wellio, don't you?
[02:25:04.980 --> 02:25:07.220]   (laughing)
[02:25:07.220 --> 02:25:09.620]   Wellio, W-E-L-L-I-O.
[02:25:09.620 --> 02:25:12.540]   I don't, I don't mean that, actually.
[02:25:12.540 --> 02:25:13.620]   (laughing)
[02:25:13.620 --> 02:25:18.620]   So, yeah, W-E-L-L-I-O, and it, in some places,
[02:25:18.620 --> 02:25:19.660]   it's even cooler.
[02:25:19.660 --> 02:25:21.380]   So what it does is it sends you three recipes a week.
[02:25:21.380 --> 02:25:22.220]   Oh, I need this.
[02:25:22.220 --> 02:25:23.060]   I need this.
[02:25:23.060 --> 02:25:26.900]   And then if you're in an area where it's awesome,
[02:25:26.900 --> 02:25:28.580]   you can actually order it on Instagram.
[02:25:28.580 --> 02:25:29.500]   Oh, look, you probably--
[02:25:29.500 --> 02:25:30.940]   Is this it?
[02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:32.540]   No, this is a test of your--
[02:25:32.540 --> 02:25:33.380]   No.
[02:25:33.380 --> 02:25:34.220]   That's some other wellio.
[02:25:34.220 --> 02:25:35.220]   No, I'm gonna tell you where to go.
[02:25:35.220 --> 02:25:36.140]   I went to the wrong Wellio.
[02:25:36.140 --> 02:25:37.180]   Get Wellio.com.
[02:25:37.180 --> 02:25:38.180]   Go get Wellio.
[02:25:38.180 --> 02:25:38.780]   Get Wellio.
[02:25:38.780 --> 02:25:40.020]   I'd like to.
[02:25:40.020 --> 02:25:43.300]   So, my newsletter this week features apples.
[02:25:43.300 --> 02:25:45.780]   And my recipes, my three recipes of the week
[02:25:45.780 --> 02:25:48.980]   are apple goat cheese frittata with walnuts.
[02:25:48.980 --> 02:25:51.660]   It gives me $6 per serving and the opportunity
[02:25:51.660 --> 02:25:52.820]   to order it now.
[02:25:52.820 --> 02:25:54.260]   Oh, they'll actually sell you this stuff.
[02:25:54.260 --> 02:25:58.300]   Here, I can show you on my magical computer.
[02:25:58.300 --> 02:25:59.500]   You just can't see the email.
[02:25:59.500 --> 02:26:04.100]   And then, so if I go to order it now, it'll--
[02:26:04.100 --> 02:26:09.100]   And these are designed for weight loss or heart health,
[02:26:09.100 --> 02:26:10.180]   or is it your general?
[02:26:10.180 --> 02:26:11.380]   It's just good clean eating.
[02:26:11.380 --> 02:26:12.460]   Good clean eating.
[02:26:12.460 --> 02:26:13.300]   Good clean eating.
[02:26:13.300 --> 02:26:14.300]   OK.
[02:26:14.300 --> 02:26:15.900]   And you can either--
[02:26:15.900 --> 02:26:16.740]   Even if you don't have a liver--
[02:26:16.740 --> 02:26:19.220]   So this is kind of like a blue apron, but not?
[02:26:19.220 --> 02:26:20.060]   I mean, I don't understand.
[02:26:20.060 --> 02:26:20.900]   No, no, no, no, no.
[02:26:20.900 --> 02:26:25.060]   So, well, OK, if it will order all of the items
[02:26:25.060 --> 02:26:26.740]   from the grocery store for you--
[02:26:26.740 --> 02:26:27.740]   Oh.
[02:26:27.740 --> 02:26:28.940]   So you get a list and it says you can add--
[02:26:28.940 --> 02:26:32.020]   It's like a personal shopper for food.
[02:26:32.020 --> 02:26:35.180]   It's the recipe plus you can order the food.
[02:26:35.180 --> 02:26:36.020]   Yeah.
[02:26:36.020 --> 02:26:37.900]   I can't order the food because I don't live in an area
[02:26:37.900 --> 02:26:38.740]   where they have a--
[02:26:38.740 --> 02:26:40.060]   They're in San Francisco.
[02:26:40.060 --> 02:26:42.420]   But yes, in the Bay Area you can.
[02:26:42.420 --> 02:26:43.420]   OK.
[02:26:43.420 --> 02:26:45.700]   If you do this, I would recommend looking at the ingredients
[02:26:45.700 --> 02:26:47.540]   before you just click order because sometimes they
[02:26:47.540 --> 02:26:48.580]   double up on some of the rest of this.
[02:26:48.580 --> 02:26:51.060]   Well, and you may not want an apple goat cheese for time.
[02:26:51.060 --> 02:26:52.220]   OK, well, yes.
[02:26:52.220 --> 02:26:54.220]   Then you don't click on that recipe and say order--
[02:26:54.220 --> 02:26:56.220]   Oh, oh, OK, OK.
[02:26:56.220 --> 02:26:57.700]   Good, because I really don't.
[02:26:57.700 --> 02:27:00.980]   So, some others for this week are sausage and apples
[02:27:00.980 --> 02:27:02.580]   and then chicken plus apple salad.
[02:27:02.580 --> 02:27:05.180]   And you go through-- you can browse through recipes.
[02:27:05.180 --> 02:27:07.740]   I'm not sure I get the value proposition.
[02:27:07.740 --> 02:27:10.540]   So the value is, like, I sit there every week
[02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:12.620]   and I'm like, oh, what do I cook this week?
[02:27:12.620 --> 02:27:14.980]   So I can look at this and then I can just easily,
[02:27:14.980 --> 02:27:16.500]   instead of looking at my recipe book
[02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:20.060]   and then writing down the things on my grocery list,
[02:27:20.060 --> 02:27:21.860]   I just-- it's creative.
[02:27:21.860 --> 02:27:24.220]   It's meal planning a little bit with them.
[02:27:24.220 --> 02:27:26.700]   It's-- yeah, it's meal planning made slightly easier.
[02:27:26.700 --> 02:27:27.460]   Yeah.
[02:27:27.460 --> 02:27:29.700]   Is that going to set the world on fire?
[02:27:29.700 --> 02:27:30.500]   No.
[02:27:30.500 --> 02:27:31.380]   But it's free right now.
[02:27:31.380 --> 02:27:34.660]   Well, what's interesting, because this blue apron,
[02:27:34.660 --> 02:27:37.740]   hello fresh meals in a box model,
[02:27:37.740 --> 02:27:40.380]   is super hot on Wall Street right now, right?
[02:27:40.380 --> 02:27:46.020]   And of course, with Amazon getting into it,
[02:27:46.020 --> 02:27:48.140]   people think Amazon's going to eat this one up once
[02:27:48.140 --> 02:27:49.500]   there, because now they own Whole Foods.
[02:27:49.500 --> 02:27:50.780]   But it's a very hot category.
[02:27:50.780 --> 02:27:52.580]   And this is an interesting way to kind of
[02:27:52.580 --> 02:27:54.180]   sittle into it, I think.
[02:27:54.180 --> 02:27:57.460]   And they're doing machine learning on what you have
[02:27:57.460 --> 02:27:58.180]   and that sort of thing.
[02:27:58.180 --> 02:27:59.380]   That's going to--
[02:27:59.380 --> 02:28:00.380]   This is free right now.
[02:28:00.380 --> 02:28:02.420]   It's just a little fun.
[02:28:02.420 --> 02:28:05.460]   Are they selling this information to anybody?
[02:28:05.460 --> 02:28:09.300]   So if you order it and you buy it, they get a cut.
[02:28:09.300 --> 02:28:12.340]   It's like an affiliate feed for the groceries
[02:28:12.340 --> 02:28:13.020]   that they're working with.
[02:28:13.020 --> 02:28:15.180]   The grocers that they're working with.
[02:28:15.180 --> 02:28:17.060]   I just think it's nice, because I
[02:28:17.060 --> 02:28:19.100]   like to cook different things all the time.
[02:28:19.100 --> 02:28:21.700]   But blue apron, a lot of times--
[02:28:21.700 --> 02:28:24.980]   This is more open-ended meal planning, right?
[02:28:24.980 --> 02:28:27.900]   Yeah, because they want me to do a lot more work
[02:28:27.900 --> 02:28:29.100]   than sometimes I want to do.
[02:28:29.100 --> 02:28:30.860]   Yeah, sometimes you just want to eat.
[02:28:30.860 --> 02:28:32.420]   I don't want to cook semiolents.
[02:28:32.420 --> 02:28:34.260]   Well, in just--
[02:28:34.260 --> 02:28:34.620]   Yeah.
[02:28:34.620 --> 02:28:36.380]   I'm not going to get blue apron every day of the week.
[02:28:36.380 --> 02:28:38.100]   So this is kind of a fun way to go.
[02:28:38.100 --> 02:28:38.580]   I don't know.
[02:28:38.580 --> 02:28:39.940]   I like to cook.
[02:28:39.940 --> 02:28:40.940]   Yeah, I like to cook too.
[02:28:40.940 --> 02:28:42.260]   That's why I like blue apron.
[02:28:42.260 --> 02:28:43.540]   But we only get it three times a week.
[02:28:43.540 --> 02:28:45.260]   It's not like we're always doing it.
[02:28:45.260 --> 02:28:46.740]   Well, it was a first intelligent platform
[02:28:46.740 --> 02:28:49.780]   helps you plan, shop, prepare, and enjoy healthy meals at home.
[02:28:49.780 --> 02:28:50.220]   OK.
[02:28:50.220 --> 02:28:52.020]   Anything to help with meal planning.
[02:28:52.020 --> 02:28:54.020]   That is the worst thing for me.
[02:28:54.020 --> 02:28:55.020]   Yeah.
[02:28:55.020 --> 02:28:55.460]   Yeah.
[02:28:55.460 --> 02:28:56.940]   I actually-- I mean, it's not related.
[02:28:56.940 --> 02:29:02.060]   But I'm a follower of the good doctor, Furman.
[02:29:02.060 --> 02:29:04.740]   And he will also do that for you.
[02:29:04.740 --> 02:29:09.460]   But this is very much more specific to dietary health.
[02:29:09.460 --> 02:29:09.980]   He's very--
[02:29:09.980 --> 02:29:11.260]   Nutritarian diet?
[02:29:11.260 --> 02:29:12.180]   Nutritarian.
[02:29:12.180 --> 02:29:12.980]   Nutritarian.
[02:29:12.980 --> 02:29:17.260]   The theory behind it is you eat high nutrient density foods.
[02:29:17.260 --> 02:29:18.180]   Oh, like spinach.
[02:29:18.180 --> 02:29:18.740]   Yeah.
[02:29:18.740 --> 02:29:19.460]   OK.
[02:29:19.460 --> 02:29:21.180]   And you focus on that.
[02:29:21.180 --> 02:29:25.700]   And so I get a recipe, I think, every day from him.
[02:29:25.700 --> 02:29:27.780]   He doesn't order food for you.
[02:29:27.780 --> 02:29:28.300]   They stuff to shop.
[02:29:28.300 --> 02:29:29.620]   But you send you good for your recipes.
[02:29:29.620 --> 02:29:31.180]   You get lots of good free recipes.
[02:29:31.180 --> 02:29:31.380]   Yeah.
[02:29:31.380 --> 02:29:31.900]   OK.
[02:29:31.900 --> 02:29:32.300]   Yeah.
[02:29:32.300 --> 02:29:33.100]   You should try it anyway.
[02:29:33.100 --> 02:29:33.580]   It's fun.
[02:29:33.580 --> 02:29:34.100]   I will.
[02:29:34.100 --> 02:29:34.540]   I like this.
[02:29:34.540 --> 02:29:35.740]   It's pretty dense, right?
[02:29:35.740 --> 02:29:36.580]   It's dense.
[02:29:36.580 --> 02:29:37.740]   I don't know if it's nutritious.
[02:29:37.740 --> 02:29:39.900]   Chocolate torts, or even denser, or more dense.
[02:29:39.900 --> 02:29:40.860]   Oh, super dense.
[02:29:40.860 --> 02:29:40.860]   Mm.
[02:29:40.860 --> 02:29:41.360]   Or fudge.
[02:29:41.360 --> 02:29:42.260]   Fudge is crazy.
[02:29:42.260 --> 02:29:43.260]   It's dense.
[02:29:43.260 --> 02:29:43.780]   Yeah.
[02:29:43.780 --> 02:29:45.140]   Super dense.
[02:29:45.140 --> 02:29:48.500]   I feel dense just thinking about it.
[02:29:48.500 --> 02:29:53.340]   Mr. Michael Elgin in Tbilisi, Georgia, home of wine.
[02:29:53.340 --> 02:29:54.940]   Yes, that's right.
[02:29:54.940 --> 02:29:56.860]   I have a tool of the weekend.
[02:29:56.860 --> 02:29:59.820]   I promise that I would tell everybody about the ultimate
[02:29:59.820 --> 02:30:02.980]   Android phone that did everything you would ever dream
[02:30:02.980 --> 02:30:07.260]   of specifically preventing you from being overly distracted.
[02:30:07.260 --> 02:30:08.820]   Leo, I have a dream.
[02:30:08.820 --> 02:30:10.420]   I have a dream.
[02:30:10.420 --> 02:30:12.060]   My dream is to have--
[02:30:12.060 --> 02:30:16.180]   I love everything about going full on with a watch that
[02:30:16.180 --> 02:30:18.940]   connects to the internet and so on.
[02:30:18.940 --> 02:30:20.980]   And you can make calls with a watch like the new Apple
[02:30:20.980 --> 02:30:23.300]   Watch on the Samsung watches.
[02:30:23.300 --> 02:30:25.100]   But the only problem with that is photography.
[02:30:25.100 --> 02:30:29.580]   Because I-- the only thing that the new expensive $1,900
[02:30:29.580 --> 02:30:34.300]   phones have that I really want is a really, really good camera.
[02:30:34.300 --> 02:30:35.380]   That's a very good point.
[02:30:35.380 --> 02:30:37.700]   This really become about the camera more than anything else.
[02:30:37.700 --> 02:30:38.540]   Right.
[02:30:38.540 --> 02:30:39.740]   You could just create camera.
[02:30:39.740 --> 02:30:40.260]   You could create camera.
[02:30:40.260 --> 02:30:41.220]   You could create camera.
[02:30:41.220 --> 02:30:42.020]   There you go.
[02:30:42.020 --> 02:30:43.980]   And that is what this phone does.
[02:30:43.980 --> 02:30:44.500]   Oh, OK.
[02:30:44.500 --> 02:30:48.140]   The ultimate Android phone is the L16 camera.
[02:30:48.140 --> 02:30:52.020]   It's an Android device that has 16 lenses in it.
[02:30:52.020 --> 02:30:55.140]   16 camera modules in it.
[02:30:55.140 --> 02:30:56.380]   Oh, come on.
[02:30:56.380 --> 02:30:58.060]   That is a joke.
[02:30:58.060 --> 02:31:02.900]   No, it uses at least 10 lenses simultaneously for each shot.
[02:31:02.900 --> 02:31:07.020]   Sometimes 11, 12, whatever.
[02:31:07.020 --> 02:31:10.660]   And then it fuses them together into a massive 50 something
[02:31:10.660 --> 02:31:11.420]   megapixel image.
[02:31:11.420 --> 02:31:12.940]   Oh, my God.
[02:31:12.940 --> 02:31:15.540]   You can focus it later.
[02:31:15.540 --> 02:31:19.580]   And it's not like this phony baloney portrait mode stuff.
[02:31:19.580 --> 02:31:23.340]   This is optical focus that you actually focus later.
[02:31:23.340 --> 02:31:25.820]   It takes breathtakingly beautiful shots.
[02:31:25.820 --> 02:31:29.820]   They claim that it's DSLR quality.
[02:31:29.820 --> 02:31:32.980]   And it's the size of a phone.
[02:31:32.980 --> 02:31:33.980]   It's $2,000.
[02:31:33.980 --> 02:31:36.060]   That's the downside.
[02:31:36.060 --> 02:31:36.900]   Oh, my gosh.
[02:31:36.900 --> 02:31:39.500]   So look at all these sensors.
[02:31:39.500 --> 02:31:42.020]   Wait, is this the one that has a subscription fee?
[02:31:42.020 --> 02:31:44.500]   Because it stores everything in the cloud for you.
[02:31:44.500 --> 02:31:45.100]   Do you have to pay--
[02:31:45.100 --> 02:31:45.660]   I don't like this.
[02:31:45.660 --> 02:31:47.980]   It's a computational camera.
[02:31:47.980 --> 02:31:50.860]   So I don't think it could do it on the device.
[02:31:50.860 --> 02:31:52.620]   I've seen this camera then.
[02:31:52.620 --> 02:31:53.140]   I've seen it.
[02:31:53.140 --> 02:31:54.460]   Well, there were prototypes.
[02:31:54.460 --> 02:31:56.100]   And I've written about this one.
[02:31:56.100 --> 02:31:58.100]   It was kind of a research project or a kick project.
[02:31:58.100 --> 02:31:59.740]   So here's some images.
[02:31:59.740 --> 02:32:00.340]   Wow.
[02:32:00.340 --> 02:32:00.980]   They're beautiful.
[02:32:00.980 --> 02:32:00.980]   Beautiful.
[02:32:00.980 --> 02:32:02.140]   The images--
[02:32:02.140 --> 02:32:03.580]   You zoom in on those photo.
[02:32:03.580 --> 02:32:04.860]   You zoom in on the images.
[02:32:04.860 --> 02:32:08.300]   And they look incredible.
[02:32:08.300 --> 02:32:09.140]   Yeah.
[02:32:09.140 --> 02:32:11.060]   And because it has so many lenses,
[02:32:11.060 --> 02:32:14.700]   it has real zoom up to 150 millimeter optical zoom
[02:32:14.700 --> 02:32:16.900]   from 28 to 150.
[02:32:16.900 --> 02:32:21.660]   It has, as you said, you could pull focus after the fact.
[02:32:21.660 --> 02:32:23.420]   That's really interesting.
[02:32:23.420 --> 02:32:25.860]   It just seems-- and it fits in your pocket.
[02:32:25.860 --> 02:32:29.220]   So I'm always torn between using my camera
[02:32:29.220 --> 02:32:33.020]   where the photo is kind of inferior
[02:32:33.020 --> 02:32:37.700]   or my big Canon camera, where suddenly I'm a photographer,
[02:32:37.700 --> 02:32:40.620]   which I don't want to be sitting in a restaurant with a big camera
[02:32:40.620 --> 02:32:42.180]   or whatever.
[02:32:42.180 --> 02:32:44.500]   And this is like solving all those problems.
[02:32:44.500 --> 02:32:48.700]   So the dream is carry this plus wear a watch that connects you
[02:32:48.700 --> 02:32:50.780]   to the internet and gives you a notification.
[02:32:50.780 --> 02:32:51.140]   Yeah.
[02:32:51.140 --> 02:32:51.780]   Balls.
[02:32:51.780 --> 02:32:53.740]   And I think that's a better scenario
[02:32:53.740 --> 02:32:55.100]   than actually having a smartphone.
[02:32:55.100 --> 02:32:57.380]   Well, how many cameras are front facing?
[02:32:57.380 --> 02:32:58.340]   All of them.
[02:32:58.340 --> 02:32:58.860]   No, I mean--
[02:32:58.860 --> 02:32:59.380]   All of them.
[02:32:59.380 --> 02:33:00.140]   Like towards you.
[02:33:00.140 --> 02:33:00.940]   Nothing.
[02:33:00.940 --> 02:33:01.620]   Oh, no, zero.
[02:33:01.620 --> 02:33:02.900]   Well, because then it can't take selfies.
[02:33:02.900 --> 02:33:04.180]   I mean, how am I going to use this?
[02:33:04.180 --> 02:33:05.180]   Not a selfie cam.
[02:33:05.180 --> 02:33:05.620]   You can turn it.
[02:33:05.620 --> 02:33:07.460]   You can turn it like this.
[02:33:07.460 --> 02:33:10.300]   Not a selfie cam.
[02:33:10.300 --> 02:33:14.100]   Again, I'm going to wait for the model that has 17 cameras,
[02:33:14.100 --> 02:33:15.100]   because I'm a bit of a--
[02:33:15.100 --> 02:33:15.600]   Yes.
[02:33:15.600 --> 02:33:16.060]   --you know, a photo snob.
[02:33:16.060 --> 02:33:17.060]   No, but seriously--
[02:33:17.060 --> 02:33:19.940]   Yeah, it was 16 of them as the selfie camera.
[02:33:19.940 --> 02:33:20.460]   Right.
[02:33:20.460 --> 02:33:23.980]   I remember when they first released or talked about this.
[02:33:23.980 --> 02:33:25.380]   And it's an incredible idea.
[02:33:25.380 --> 02:33:26.860]   But now that I'm looking at it, I'm thinking,
[02:33:26.860 --> 02:33:28.500]   the first thing that's going to happen for me
[02:33:28.500 --> 02:33:30.660]   is I will put my fingerprints all over at least five
[02:33:30.660 --> 02:33:32.420]   of those camera lenses.
[02:33:32.420 --> 02:33:34.020]   I have to clean that off every single time.
[02:33:34.020 --> 02:33:36.220]   But it is an amazing piece of technology.
[02:33:36.220 --> 02:33:36.720]   Yeah.
[02:33:36.720 --> 02:33:40.020]   And the other thing I love about it is, of course,
[02:33:40.020 --> 02:33:42.820]   they'll be able to refine and hone the software over time.
[02:33:42.820 --> 02:33:45.340]   Because this is really a big soft--
[02:33:45.340 --> 02:33:49.220]   the stitching and the modification of the images afterwards
[02:33:49.220 --> 02:33:51.380]   is something that can be improved year after year,
[02:33:51.380 --> 02:33:52.540]   even with the same hardware.
[02:33:52.540 --> 02:33:59.220]   Snapdragon 820, 256-kigs storage, three custom light A6.
[02:33:59.220 --> 02:33:59.740]   OK.
[02:33:59.740 --> 02:34:00.980]   You can't think of this--
[02:34:00.980 --> 02:34:02.180]   And I mentioned the name.
[02:34:02.180 --> 02:34:03.700]   It's called the L16.
[02:34:03.700 --> 02:34:04.220]   The light.
[02:34:04.220 --> 02:34:05.540]   The light.co.
[02:34:05.540 --> 02:34:06.060]   The light.
[02:34:06.060 --> 02:34:07.060]   We've got a lot of more light.
[02:34:07.060 --> 02:34:09.020]   So you can't think of this like a regular camera,
[02:34:09.020 --> 02:34:10.980]   because we think of regular digital cameras
[02:34:10.980 --> 02:34:12.340]   in terms of megapixels.
[02:34:12.340 --> 02:34:14.580]   That doesn't work when you have a computational camera.
[02:34:14.580 --> 02:34:15.580]   Right.
[02:34:15.580 --> 02:34:18.500]   It's-- I mean, there is no megapixel.
[02:34:18.500 --> 02:34:20.340]   It's technically infinite megapixel.
[02:34:20.340 --> 02:34:21.980]   You must think of the algorithm.
[02:34:21.980 --> 02:34:23.300]   Exactly.
[02:34:23.300 --> 02:34:23.780]   Yeah.
[02:34:23.780 --> 02:34:25.300]   But that also makes-- like Mike said,
[02:34:25.300 --> 02:34:27.380]   it means you could take the same picture.
[02:34:27.380 --> 02:34:30.100]   And when they improve the algorithm five years down the line,
[02:34:30.100 --> 02:34:31.580]   it becomes a better picture.
[02:34:31.580 --> 02:34:33.380]   That's the amazing part of it.
[02:34:33.380 --> 02:34:33.900]   This is--
[02:34:33.900 --> 02:34:35.340]   And the scary part, because--
[02:34:35.340 --> 02:34:36.500]   Yes, I know.
[02:34:36.500 --> 02:34:38.140]   What I'd love to see, though--
[02:34:38.140 --> 02:34:40.780]   I mean, really, the chief benefit of this is the size.
[02:34:40.780 --> 02:34:43.020]   But what I'd love to see is this kind of computational
[02:34:43.020 --> 02:34:44.260]   photography.
[02:34:44.260 --> 02:34:49.900]   And I think Sony, in particular, is starting to do this in DSLRs
[02:34:49.900 --> 02:34:51.860]   or actually, usually they're mirrorless.
[02:34:51.860 --> 02:34:54.580]   Yeah, 16 lenses with full-sized Sony camera lenses.
[02:34:54.580 --> 02:34:55.580]   16 of them.
[02:34:55.580 --> 02:34:56.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:34:56.580 --> 02:34:58.100]   OK, that's not going to work.
[02:34:58.100 --> 02:35:00.860]   I don't know if the multiple lens thing is really--
[02:35:00.860 --> 02:35:01.980]   Trillion megapixel motion.
[02:35:01.980 --> 02:35:03.420]   You could probably do the same thing with the zoom.
[02:35:03.420 --> 02:35:06.300]   But anyway, yeah, I think it's very interesting.
[02:35:06.300 --> 02:35:09.140]   And I do think you'll see some stuff.
[02:35:09.140 --> 02:35:11.380]   The problem with Canon and Nikon is they've been really
[02:35:11.380 --> 02:35:13.300]   slow to adopt these kinds of new technologies,
[02:35:13.300 --> 02:35:16.220]   because they have such an investment in existing models.
[02:35:16.220 --> 02:35:17.860]   It's always the innovator's dilemma, right?
[02:35:17.860 --> 02:35:18.340]   Yeah.
[02:35:18.340 --> 02:35:21.180]   Sony's been able to kind of somewhat eat their lunch,
[02:35:21.180 --> 02:35:23.020]   because they don't have such an investment
[02:35:23.020 --> 02:35:25.140]   in their existing platform.
[02:35:25.140 --> 02:35:27.700]   And I wouldn't be surprised to see a company.
[02:35:27.700 --> 02:35:31.220]   Remember the ray tracing camera?
[02:35:31.220 --> 02:35:33.580]   Like the light road they'll want, TRO.
[02:35:33.580 --> 02:35:35.420]   This reminds me a little bit of that.
[02:35:35.420 --> 02:35:36.960]   Everybody was so excited about what the light
[02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:39.660]   TRO was going to be and do, and it never really went anywhere.
[02:35:39.660 --> 02:35:41.620]   But at some point, I agree with you.
[02:35:41.620 --> 02:35:43.020]   My computational photography-- we all
[02:35:43.020 --> 02:35:45.120]   agree-- is the future of photography.
[02:35:45.120 --> 02:35:47.760]   But this is a step on the road.
[02:35:47.760 --> 02:35:50.060]   I'm not sure I'd want to spend $2,000 on that.
[02:35:50.060 --> 02:35:55.060]   You could buy five of these for the cost of that nice lens, Leo.
[02:35:55.060 --> 02:35:56.580]   What nice lens?
[02:35:56.580 --> 02:35:59.340]   The one I'm looking at me like that.
[02:35:59.340 --> 02:36:00.780]   I mean, I'm the nut that bought--
[02:36:00.780 --> 02:36:04.100]   I mean, I buy crazy stuff much more expensive than that.
[02:36:04.100 --> 02:36:05.780]   But your pictures are incredible.
[02:36:05.780 --> 02:36:07.280]   The ones that you took back from the Galapagos?
[02:36:07.280 --> 02:36:08.240]   Yeah, those were pretty good.
[02:36:08.240 --> 02:36:10.120]   But not as good as Lisa's.
[02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:13.080]   But anyway, this is an interesting idea.
[02:36:13.080 --> 02:36:16.360]   When you get one, Mike, I'll be sure to look at it.
[02:36:16.360 --> 02:36:16.840]   Yeah.
[02:36:16.840 --> 02:36:17.840]   Yeah.
[02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:20.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:36:20.160 --> 02:36:22.280]   Are we going to put it in the holiday gift giving guide?
[02:36:22.280 --> 02:36:22.840]   Yeah, sure.
[02:36:22.840 --> 02:36:23.500]   Let's.
[02:36:23.500 --> 02:36:25.760]   We should probably get one to review.
[02:36:25.760 --> 02:36:26.560]   You want to review it?
[02:36:26.560 --> 02:36:26.880]   No.
[02:36:26.880 --> 02:36:27.400]   Yeah.
[02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:27.880]   No.
[02:36:27.880 --> 02:36:28.400]   Yeah.
[02:36:28.400 --> 02:36:30.240]   Actually, I think Lisa should review it.
[02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:31.160]   She would be a great person.
[02:36:31.160 --> 02:36:31.760]   She's got a good eye.
[02:36:31.760 --> 02:36:33.400]   She's a better photographer than anybody.
[02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:33.880]   She's amazing.
[02:36:33.880 --> 02:36:34.840]   Two of them.
[02:36:34.840 --> 02:36:35.320]   Yeah.
[02:36:35.320 --> 02:36:36.640]   You're a two, one for each eye?
[02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:37.140]   Yeah.
[02:36:37.140 --> 02:36:40.380]   Well, the one for the selfie, you just tape them front back.
[02:36:40.380 --> 02:36:40.880]   It's myself.
[02:36:40.880 --> 02:36:41.380]   Done.
[02:36:41.380 --> 02:36:41.640]   Well, no.
[02:36:41.640 --> 02:36:42.680]   Then you could have 360.
[02:36:42.680 --> 02:36:43.920]   [GASP]
[02:36:43.920 --> 02:36:45.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:36:45.400 --> 02:36:47.520]   How many lenses would you need for 360?
[02:36:47.520 --> 02:36:48.160]   That's more than a--
[02:36:48.160 --> 02:36:49.000]   Like all the lenses.
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:49.600]   All the lenses.
[02:36:49.600 --> 02:36:51.120]   Well, can you do a 180?
[02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:52.640]   Then you just need two, and then you've got--
[02:36:52.640 --> 02:36:54.920]   they'll stitch it together, right?
[02:36:54.920 --> 02:36:56.800]   Master Father Robert.
[02:36:56.800 --> 02:36:59.160]   Right Reverend Father Robert.
[02:36:59.160 --> 02:37:00.920]   Well, I already showed you my projectors.
[02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:02.640]   I wanted to show something a little lower--
[02:37:02.640 --> 02:37:04.040]   I just kind of steal your pick right now.
[02:37:04.040 --> 02:37:04.380]   No, no.
[02:37:04.380 --> 02:37:05.300]   That's all good.
[02:37:05.300 --> 02:37:08.720]   Jason, a while back, he kind of challenged me.
[02:37:08.720 --> 02:37:12.040]   He said, you know you can use a Chromebook instead of Windows.
[02:37:12.040 --> 02:37:13.160]   You fell for that?
[02:37:13.160 --> 02:37:13.660]   I did.
[02:37:13.660 --> 02:37:14.920]   Well, I wanted to see if it would work.
[02:37:14.920 --> 02:37:16.520]   So I picked up one of these.
[02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:17.800]   I actually bought one from my dad, too.
[02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:19.560]   This is an Acer R13.
[02:37:19.560 --> 02:37:22.640]   And this is actually all aluminum body.
[02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:24.080]   It's a good looking laptop.
[02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:25.280]   It's actually really nice.
[02:37:25.280 --> 02:37:26.320]   It's convertible.
[02:37:26.320 --> 02:37:28.760]   It lasts about 12 hours on a charge.
[02:37:28.760 --> 02:37:31.960]   It's a 13.3-inch-screen quad-core arm processor,
[02:37:31.960 --> 02:37:34.720]   32 gigabytes of memory, 4 gigabytes of--
[02:37:34.720 --> 02:37:38.140]   I mean, 32 gigabytes of story, 4 gigabytes of memory.
[02:37:38.140 --> 02:37:39.580]   Oh, only 32 gigabytes.
[02:37:39.580 --> 02:37:40.380]   You can expand it.
[02:37:40.380 --> 02:37:41.500]   Yeah, it's got expandability.
[02:37:41.500 --> 02:37:42.820]   That's less important on a Chromebook,
[02:37:42.820 --> 02:37:43.580]   because you don't really--
[02:37:43.580 --> 02:37:45.220]   Yeah, that's a lot for a Chromebook.
[02:37:45.220 --> 02:37:48.460]   Although Google's now has like ridiculous under 28
[02:37:48.460 --> 02:37:49.820]   and doing 512 gigs--
[02:37:49.820 --> 02:37:51.260]   But I mean, this thing starts at 350.
[02:37:51.260 --> 02:37:51.780]   Yeah.
[02:37:51.780 --> 02:37:53.460]   So they're crazy low costs.
[02:37:53.460 --> 02:37:57.300]   And for $350, normally it's-- well, the keyboard's bad.
[02:37:57.300 --> 02:37:58.460]   Or we'll touch-pass it more.
[02:37:58.460 --> 02:37:59.940]   Is this one have an I5 in it?
[02:37:59.940 --> 02:38:01.820]   No, this is the quad-core arm.
[02:38:01.820 --> 02:38:03.340]   Quad-core arm.
[02:38:03.340 --> 02:38:05.080]   But it does do Android apps.
[02:38:05.080 --> 02:38:09.520]   So this will act as like a super large Android tablet.
[02:38:09.520 --> 02:38:11.840]   And I have to say, I've been using this on know-how.
[02:38:11.840 --> 02:38:13.800]   It's replaced my Windows notebook for know-how.
[02:38:13.800 --> 02:38:17.440]   It's replaced my Windows notebook for some of the other shows
[02:38:17.440 --> 02:38:18.520]   that I do.
[02:38:18.520 --> 02:38:21.160]   And I don't miss Windows, because I just
[02:38:21.160 --> 02:38:23.640]   need something that will access Google Docs that can do
[02:38:23.640 --> 02:38:25.680]   Twitter, can do email, can do Hangouts.
[02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:26.680]   Here's a little bit.
[02:38:26.680 --> 02:38:27.680]   Oh, see?
[02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:28.880]   You get a phone stuck in your head.
[02:38:28.880 --> 02:38:30.360]   Cortana got jealous.
[02:38:30.360 --> 02:38:31.880]   I was shielding her ears.
[02:38:31.880 --> 02:38:33.000]   Instead, I activated her.
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:34.140]   I'm sorry.
[02:38:34.140 --> 02:38:36.140]   Here's a little hint.
[02:38:36.140 --> 02:38:37.080]   Here's a little hint.
[02:38:37.080 --> 02:38:39.680]   Why a Windows notebook?
[02:38:39.680 --> 02:38:41.560]   But this thing, I like it.
[02:38:41.560 --> 02:38:45.280]   This actually, for most of what I do,
[02:38:45.280 --> 02:38:46.120]   would work just fine.
[02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:48.000]   Unfortunately, not for everything,
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:49.800]   because I also do video editing on my notebook.
[02:38:49.800 --> 02:38:52.000]   And that's absolutely not with a Chromebook.
[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:53.400]   Any sort of coding as well.
[02:38:53.400 --> 02:38:53.900]   Yeah.
[02:38:53.900 --> 02:38:54.560]   Out the window.
[02:38:54.560 --> 02:38:57.320]   Yeah, there's a couple of Clueges for getting Arduino
[02:38:57.320 --> 02:38:58.800]   programming to work properly on this.
[02:38:58.800 --> 02:39:01.120]   But they're Clueges.
[02:39:01.120 --> 02:39:04.720]   But I would say for my parents, because I bought one each
[02:39:04.720 --> 02:39:07.600]   for my parents, they're great, because they're virus proof.
[02:39:07.600 --> 02:39:11.200]   And they're incredibly easy for me to manage remotely.
[02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:14.520]   And at $350 a pop, it means that I'm not going to get a call
[02:39:14.520 --> 02:39:16.840]   from my dad saying, I just dropped the $1,000 notebook you
[02:39:16.840 --> 02:39:17.680]   sent me.
[02:39:17.680 --> 02:39:20.720]   Yeah, so I bought the Pixelbook, which was the base unit.
[02:39:20.720 --> 02:39:22.080]   It's $9.99.
[02:39:22.080 --> 02:39:23.360]   That won't come for a couple of weeks.
[02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:25.680]   But I would love to do a head-to-head comparison.
[02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:26.720]   That is definitely nicer.
[02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:28.400]   The Pixel is going to be so beautiful.
[02:39:28.400 --> 02:39:29.920]   And it's just stylish.
[02:39:29.920 --> 02:39:30.440]   So expensive.
[02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:32.600]   But yeah, you could buy three of these things for the cost of
[02:39:32.600 --> 02:39:32.880]   that.
[02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:35.040]   I bought my daughter the Samsung Chromebook Plus.
[02:39:35.040 --> 02:39:36.680]   I've actually bought two of those ones for me and one for
[02:39:36.680 --> 02:39:36.840]   her.
[02:39:36.840 --> 02:39:38.920]   And that's really nice for $500.
[02:39:38.920 --> 02:39:41.160]   So there's great choices out there.
[02:39:41.160 --> 02:39:41.760]   There really are.
[02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:42.560]   And I remember--
[02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:43.040]   And that's a fraud.
[02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:46.000]   A year ago, even Chromebooks, the low price Chromebooks,
[02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:46.600]   were just--
[02:39:46.600 --> 02:39:47.520]   They were bad.
[02:39:47.520 --> 02:39:49.000]   That's all we called for a year ago.
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:52.160]   That's all we were saying is just give us a mid-range Chromebook.
[02:39:52.160 --> 02:39:53.280]   I think that would be a market.
[02:39:53.280 --> 02:39:55.400]   So would that pass the Jeff test?
[02:39:55.400 --> 02:39:56.680]   Well, that's a good question.
[02:39:56.680 --> 02:39:57.200]   Yeah.
[02:39:57.200 --> 02:39:59.400]   He got a Pixelbook, so he'll have his in a couple of weeks, too.
[02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:01.760]   Well, I find that people who have Pixel Chromebooks, they're
[02:40:01.760 --> 02:40:02.760]   kind of snobbish.
[02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:06.080]   Yeah, we don't want to use anything less because--
[02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:06.640]   Yes, money.
[02:40:06.640 --> 02:40:08.320]   You've got the best money.
[02:40:08.320 --> 02:40:09.400]   Bye.
[02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:13.360]   It's like the $2,000 camera phone.
[02:40:13.360 --> 02:40:15.960]   Wow, this was so much fun, especially because you were
[02:40:15.960 --> 02:40:17.080]   in studio, you guys.
[02:40:17.080 --> 02:40:19.120]   And I'm sorry that you couldn't also be here, Mike.
[02:40:19.120 --> 02:40:21.280]   But it's always a pleasure to have Mike
[02:40:21.280 --> 02:40:23.080]   Elgin Gastron, Nomad.net.
[02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:25.720]   He's traveling the world with his wife, Emira, to create
[02:40:25.720 --> 02:40:27.920]   amazing food experiences.
[02:40:27.920 --> 02:40:31.240]   For people, he's done Barcelona.
[02:40:31.240 --> 02:40:33.840]   The next one is--
[02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:36.400]   The next one is going to be Prosecco.
[02:40:36.400 --> 02:40:37.960]   That's going to be next year in Italy.
[02:40:37.960 --> 02:40:40.960]   Yeah, these are pictures of the event in Barcelona.
[02:40:40.960 --> 02:40:41.520]   Oh, wow, fun.
[02:40:41.520 --> 02:40:44.600]   You met the best baker in Spain and got lessons.
[02:40:44.600 --> 02:40:45.800]   And it looks like they're--
[02:40:45.800 --> 02:40:47.280]   Yeah, it was the land there.
[02:40:47.280 --> 02:40:49.520]   It was life-changing for us.
[02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:50.760]   And we were the hosts.
[02:40:50.760 --> 02:40:52.320]   It was just an amazing experience.
[02:40:52.320 --> 02:40:53.760]   But the next one is Prosecco.
[02:40:53.760 --> 02:40:55.080]   And Provence is right after that.
[02:40:55.080 --> 02:40:57.240]   They're both kind of in the spring summer.
[02:40:57.240 --> 02:40:58.080]   Oh, man.
[02:40:58.080 --> 02:40:59.760]   Or Mike, if you'd like, we'll send you
[02:40:59.760 --> 02:41:01.760]   some of the mystery Oreos.
[02:41:01.760 --> 02:41:02.560]   Yeah, please.
[02:41:02.560 --> 02:41:03.560]   Yeah, that one is great.
[02:41:03.560 --> 02:41:05.320]   We're going to add those to your Gastron, Nomad.
[02:41:05.320 --> 02:41:07.440]   Yeah, no, yeah, no.
[02:41:07.440 --> 02:41:09.840]   Mike's also one of the most astute and observant
[02:41:09.840 --> 02:41:12.480]   and thoughtful writers in the tech scene.
[02:41:12.480 --> 02:41:16.280]   And you can catch us writing it to Fast Company and Computer
[02:41:16.280 --> 02:41:17.920]   World.
[02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:20.480]   Yeah, there's still a computer world, right?
[02:41:20.480 --> 02:41:20.960]   There is.
[02:41:20.960 --> 02:41:21.960]   OK.
[02:41:21.960 --> 02:41:25.720]   IDG and across the IDG network.
[02:41:25.720 --> 02:41:26.240]   Thank you.
[02:41:26.240 --> 02:41:26.720]   Thank you.
[02:41:26.720 --> 02:41:27.640]   Always a pleasure.
[02:41:27.640 --> 02:41:28.160]   Is it late?
[02:41:28.160 --> 02:41:28.720]   It's late.
[02:41:28.720 --> 02:41:29.880]   It's like one in the morning.
[02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:30.520]   It is.
[02:41:30.520 --> 02:41:31.760]   It's almost four in the morning.
[02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:32.680]   Oh.
[02:41:32.680 --> 02:41:34.600]   We are far each.
[02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:36.320]   Mike, it's time to get out of bed, Mike.
[02:41:36.320 --> 02:41:38.080]   Mike, I'm so sorry.
[02:41:38.080 --> 02:41:40.160]   I saw you having a glass of wine earlier.
[02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:41.840]   I thought it was like seven.
[02:41:41.840 --> 02:41:42.680]   Go to bed.
[02:41:42.680 --> 02:41:43.840]   Everybody stays up this late.
[02:41:43.840 --> 02:41:45.880]   No, no, nobody goes to bed before the sun comes up.
[02:41:45.880 --> 02:41:46.960]   Oh, my God.
[02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:48.440]   I had no idea it was that late.
[02:41:48.440 --> 02:41:49.240]   Thank you, Mike.
[02:41:49.240 --> 02:41:50.320]   I really appreciate it.
[02:41:50.320 --> 02:41:51.040]   It's my pleasure.
[02:41:51.040 --> 02:41:52.440]   I would have made this a shorter show.
[02:41:52.440 --> 02:41:55.000]   It was kind of a long show because I was having so much fun.
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:56.160]   Father Robert Ballis here.
[02:41:56.160 --> 02:41:57.400]   Again, great to have you on.
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:41:59.560]   First time on Twig, you've hosted it without me,
[02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:00.840]   but I think, right?
[02:42:00.840 --> 02:42:02.080]   No, no.
[02:42:02.080 --> 02:42:04.280]   This was one of the three shows I've never done.
[02:42:04.280 --> 02:42:06.040]   I was excited to be on our show with you.
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:07.040]   No, isn't that great?
[02:42:07.040 --> 02:42:07.600]   Thank you.
[02:42:07.600 --> 02:42:08.600]   I finally got to meet you.
[02:42:08.600 --> 02:42:09.840]   Yeah, I've seen you so many times.
[02:42:09.840 --> 02:42:10.960]   Finally, a host that won't hit on her.
[02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:12.280]   It's great.
[02:42:12.280 --> 02:42:14.440]   Father Robert is--
[02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:19.080]   This is not quite the longest Twig episode.
[02:42:19.080 --> 02:42:20.600]   If we go for another two minutes,
[02:42:20.600 --> 02:42:22.720]   we will now be the longest Twig episode.
[02:42:22.720 --> 02:42:24.280]   Oh, let's not try it for Mike.
[02:42:24.280 --> 02:42:25.360]   That's kind of good and bad.
[02:42:25.360 --> 02:42:26.360]   Let's do it.
[02:42:26.360 --> 02:42:27.360]   No, let's do it.
[02:42:27.360 --> 02:42:28.360]   I want to break the record.
[02:42:28.360 --> 02:42:30.360]   Father Robert Ballis here is the digital Jesuit catch
[02:42:30.360 --> 02:42:33.360]   him on knowhowtuit.tv/kh and on Twiit,
[02:42:33.360 --> 02:42:36.360]   Twit.tv/twit, this weekend in a price tech.
[02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:39.360]   And all around the studio because it's great.
[02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:41.360]   And he's going to be here for a little bit longer.
[02:42:41.360 --> 02:42:43.360]   He's been called back to Rome, but that won't be
[02:42:43.360 --> 02:42:45.360]   till late next year.
[02:42:45.360 --> 02:42:47.360]   And I'm so glad we can have you in the studio.
[02:42:47.360 --> 02:42:48.360]   I appreciate it.
[02:42:48.360 --> 02:42:49.360]   It's been my pleasure.
[02:42:49.360 --> 02:42:51.360]   This is one of those shows that-- actually, I think this was
[02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:53.360]   the third Twig show I ever started watching.
[02:42:53.360 --> 02:42:55.360]   It was, of course, Twit, then security now, then Twig.
[02:42:55.360 --> 02:42:56.360]   Thank you.
[02:42:56.360 --> 02:42:58.360]   I really appreciate it.
[02:42:58.360 --> 02:43:00.360]   And wow, to get Stacey in studio, what a thrill.
[02:43:00.360 --> 02:43:01.360]   What a pleasure.
[02:43:01.360 --> 02:43:04.360]   We adore having you on this weekend, Google.
[02:43:04.360 --> 02:43:06.360]   We want you to keep doing it, but of course Stacey has her
[02:43:06.360 --> 02:43:08.360]   own thing, Stacey on IOT.
[02:43:08.360 --> 02:43:12.360]   Don't forget her podcast, her newsletter, Kevin Tofel.
[02:43:12.360 --> 02:43:14.360]   Now, did you do the show with Kevin this morning?
[02:43:14.360 --> 02:43:15.360]   I did.
[02:43:15.360 --> 02:43:17.360]   The show goes out without fail.
[02:43:17.360 --> 02:43:19.360]   Commitment is important.
[02:43:19.360 --> 02:43:20.360]   It is important.
[02:43:20.360 --> 02:43:22.360]   It's important to be committed to your work.
[02:43:22.360 --> 02:43:23.360]   Well, it's really nice to see you.
[02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:24.360]   I didn't ask you.
[02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:25.360]   How did you like that coffee?
[02:43:25.360 --> 02:43:26.360]   Was it OK?
[02:43:26.360 --> 02:43:27.360]   Oh, it was really good.
[02:43:27.360 --> 02:43:28.360]   Yeah.
[02:43:28.360 --> 02:43:29.360]   I let it get cold because I was not my manager.
[02:43:29.360 --> 02:43:30.360]   Did she have the giant steps?
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:31.360]   What did she have?
[02:43:31.360 --> 02:43:33.360]   She had the same one, the Costa Rica?
[02:43:33.360 --> 02:43:34.360]   Or the Kenyan?
[02:43:34.360 --> 02:43:35.360]   This one.
[02:43:35.360 --> 02:43:37.360]   Oh, I had the Kenyan--
[02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:38.360]   [GASPS]
[02:43:38.360 --> 02:43:40.360]   Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
[02:43:40.360 --> 02:43:43.360]   Oh, can I share a story to get us over the two minutes?
[02:43:43.360 --> 02:43:44.360]   Yes.
[02:43:44.360 --> 02:43:47.360]   OK, well, so I just got dismissed from jury duty after three weeks.
[02:43:47.360 --> 02:43:50.360]   I had almost made it through the Wadiira, and finally I was
[02:43:50.360 --> 02:43:51.360]   excused.
[02:43:51.360 --> 02:43:52.360]   Thank you very much.
[02:43:52.360 --> 02:43:53.360]   Oh, why?
[02:43:53.360 --> 02:43:55.360]   They just-- they used one of their preemptors challenges.
[02:43:55.360 --> 02:43:56.360]   Thank you very much.
[02:43:56.360 --> 02:43:57.360]   Thank you very much.
[02:43:57.360 --> 02:44:03.360]   But one of the other potential jurors that was with me was the wife of a blue bottle executive.
[02:44:03.360 --> 02:44:04.360]   Oh.
[02:44:04.360 --> 02:44:05.360]   And she brought coffee in for everybody.
[02:44:05.360 --> 02:44:06.360]   Oh, isn't that sweet?
[02:44:06.360 --> 02:44:07.360]   That is so nice.
[02:44:07.360 --> 02:44:08.360]   That is sweet.
[02:44:08.360 --> 02:44:09.360]   So you're not going on the jury.
[02:44:09.360 --> 02:44:10.360]   Oh, thank God.
[02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:11.360]   It's the Zorate case.
[02:44:11.360 --> 02:44:12.360]   Garcia Gizorate case.
[02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:13.360]   No kidding.
[02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:15.360]   That's going to last a long, long time.
[02:44:15.360 --> 02:44:18.360]   The fact that you even knew about it probably got you excused, I would bet.
[02:44:18.360 --> 02:44:19.360]   Um, a little bit.
[02:44:19.360 --> 02:44:20.360]   Yeah.
[02:44:20.360 --> 02:44:23.080]   Do priests often get excused from jury duty?
[02:44:23.080 --> 02:44:25.080]   Not as often as you would as often think.
[02:44:25.080 --> 02:44:27.400]   You would think that the-- and I did-- I wore my collar.
[02:44:27.400 --> 02:44:30.360]   I was just-- I mean, journalists, they're like, oh, get you gone.
[02:44:30.360 --> 02:44:34.520]   Well, I tell them, like, I'm a priest, and I work for media.
[02:44:34.520 --> 02:44:36.360]   And the judge said, oh, that's not a problem.
[02:44:36.360 --> 02:44:37.360]   Like, really?
[02:44:37.360 --> 02:44:38.360]   Can't I be?
[02:44:38.360 --> 02:44:39.360]   No, I said I was helping me.
[02:44:39.360 --> 02:44:45.880]   I was-- I was called up on a jury for the-- to catch-- one of the catch-up predator cases.
[02:44:45.880 --> 02:44:47.480]   And they knew I did a radio show.
[02:44:47.480 --> 02:44:50.280]   They said, well, you talk about this case on the radio show.
[02:44:50.280 --> 02:44:51.280]   I said, yes.
[02:44:51.280 --> 02:44:52.280]   They said, great.
[02:44:52.280 --> 02:44:53.280]   You're going to be on the jury.
[02:44:53.280 --> 02:44:54.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:44:54.280 --> 02:45:00.280]   We had a person who told me the first day, he goes, the judge can't seat me because I'm
[02:45:00.280 --> 02:45:01.280]   a sovereign citizen.
[02:45:01.280 --> 02:45:02.280]   No.
[02:45:02.280 --> 02:45:03.280]   And I went, what?
[02:45:03.280 --> 02:45:04.280]   That's not going to work.
[02:45:04.280 --> 02:45:05.280]   He said, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:45:05.280 --> 02:45:06.280]   I live in the United States, but I--
[02:45:06.280 --> 02:45:09.280]   I had to come under myself independent of US--
[02:45:09.280 --> 02:45:13.200]   The last day, he got called for the Wadi-- the Wadiir.
[02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:14.200]   And he told the judge that.
[02:45:14.200 --> 02:45:15.640]   And the judge said, I agree with you.
[02:45:15.640 --> 02:45:16.640]   I can't sit you on this case.
[02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:17.640]   Here's what I want you to do.
[02:45:17.640 --> 02:45:21.160]   I want you to go across the hall to jury services.
[02:45:21.160 --> 02:45:24.280]   And I want you to tell them that you're re-entering the pool.
[02:45:24.280 --> 02:45:26.320]   So you're going to start the whole process over again.
[02:45:26.320 --> 02:45:27.320]   Oh.
[02:45:27.320 --> 02:45:29.680]   And just so you don't get lost, I'm going to send my bailiff with you.
[02:45:29.680 --> 02:45:30.680]   Oh.
[02:45:30.680 --> 02:45:33.920]   So that kind of-- that's like, oh, yeah, don't mess around with the study.
[02:45:33.920 --> 02:45:34.920]   Yeah, you don't want to mess around.
[02:45:34.920 --> 02:45:35.920]   All right.
[02:45:35.920 --> 02:45:36.920]   I'm good.
[02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:37.920]   I'm good.
[02:45:37.920 --> 02:45:38.920]   I'm good.
[02:45:38.920 --> 02:45:39.920]   Okay, we are now officially the longest Twitch show in history.
[02:45:39.920 --> 02:45:40.920]   We did it--
