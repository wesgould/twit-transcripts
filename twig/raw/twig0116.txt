[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.560]   This week in Google, the show that covers Google,
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.560]   the cloud, cloud competitors of Google,
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.680]   and everything else going on the internet,
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.440]   you might realize that I'm not Leo the Port.
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.640]   Well, that's true.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.040]   I'm still not Leo the Port.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.000]   But I'm I as actor.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.560]   I'm on TNT.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.640]   You might see me sometimes daily on this thing.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.720]   But we're joined by, of course, Gina Trapani from smartawear.org.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.440]   Thanks for being here and anchoring the show.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.280]   How are you doing today?
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.320]   I'm doing great.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.160]   Miss and Leo and Jeff are really excited about our lineup today.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.320]   Jeff is off with a book tour.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.000]   He's out there meeting the people.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.880]   So it's kind of like meeting the people's kind of like a Google
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.760]   hangout, but it's in real life.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.360]   It's in 3D.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.920]   It's in really great resolution.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.880]   But we're also joined by Adam Pash of lifehacker.com.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.000]   How's it going?
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.800]   Great.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.920]   How are you guys doing?
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.280]   Good.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.960]   Good.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.800]   And all the way over there is Kevin Purdy, formerly of lifehacker.com.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.440]   Hello.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.480]   You can find him at completeandroidguy.com.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.040]   Or you have a nice lower third there of a bit.ly/gplusmm.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.480]   Did you tell us?
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.160]   Indeed.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.960]   It links to an O'Reilly page for Google Plus the missing manual.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.560]   So how are you guys feeling about this lifehacker reunion?
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.400]   This is fantastic.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.000]   The three of us haven't hung out together in a while, actually.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.880]   I'm excited about it.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.720]   It's a lifehacker gang, gangging up on UIS.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.640]   Well, I had one tip that was posted on lifehacker a long time
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.120]   ago.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.080]   Way back.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.320]   I think in 2001, a long time ago, it was like, I like a CRT
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.840]   monitor.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.560]   I'm telling a tip.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.080]   It was a simple idea.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.200]   I had hated doing the dishes.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.400]   And so I decided, I think I'm going to put Saran wrap on my
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.640]   plates, microwave my leftovers, then remove the Saran wrap,
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.120]   and I have a clean plate.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.320]   Now--
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.520]   I remember this.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.280]   Yeah, you ought to, because I remember the audience was kind
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.880]   of angry about this.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.040]   I forgot that lifehacker is kind of a green kind of thing.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.560]   And yeah.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.640]   Well, what do you remember, Adam?
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.560]   I remember it being controversial.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.320]   OK, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.760]   I apparently wrote this.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.240]   And my lead in says, lazy lifehacker reader and ex-bachelor
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.800]   as writes in.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.160]   Back in my bachelor days, I lived on my own for a while.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.440]   I hated doing dishes.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.120]   However, I enjoyed eating off plates.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.360]   At some point, I realized the plates were really platforms
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.600]   to hold food.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.720]   I got the idea of plates plastered over the plates, or any
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.920]   other hard surface.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.440]   Well, yeah.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.000]   I create a clean plate.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.080]   Hey, I was quite inventive as a bachelor.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.480]   I mean, any hard surface, if it was a particularly large book,
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.320]   I'd use that.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.520]   Saran wrap works on that, too.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.520]   I mean, it didn't matter.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.600]   I mean, look, when you're just starting off,
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.640]   I was just out of college.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.000]   And I was like, you know what?
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.960]   I don't want to buy lots of plates.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.440]   So--
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.760]   I already bought all these books.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.520]   Exactly.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.080]   I mean, what are you going to do with the physics book?
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.640]   Otherwise.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.280]   I mean, it's a paperweight, and it's a plate.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.760]   So, yeah.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.600]   This was June in 2006.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.600]   Yeah, but the tip originally from 2001.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.000]   That's back when I was living on my own.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.640]   Because I remember doing that in my apartment in Boston.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.560]   And there it is.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.120]   There it is.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.640]   There it is.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.600]   The controversial--
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.040]   It's wonderful.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.160]   Are the comments still up there?
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.160]   The--
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.440]   Somebody said when he says, this guy will never get married.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.720]   His mother should be embarrassed for him.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.720]   I love the internet.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.400]   I certainly love the internet.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.560]   All the posts that are the most controversial in Life Hacker
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.080]   are the ones that the editors assume
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.360]   are the least controversial, almost exclusively.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.520]   I thought it was benign.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.720]   It was just something stupid.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.520]   You don't have to do it.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.440]   But anyway.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.480]   So, yeah, there is the true Life Hacker reunion.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.680]   I get my one post.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.440]   And I'm pretty sure that pales in comparison
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.120]   to everybody else's thousands, probably millions
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.160]   of posts at this point.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.360]   You're part of the family now.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.160]   You're part of the family.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.600]   There's my initiation.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.480]   How do you face the wrath of the commenters?
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.800]   You're part of the family.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.520]   Someone called you unrealistic on Life Hacker.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.600]   So welcome to the club.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.920]   Speaking of wrath, there's a lot of people ticked off about iOS 5.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.080]   We got released today around 1 o'clock at Eastern time.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.560]   And apparently nobody can get it.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.240]   Apparently the download times are about, I'd say, four or five
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.760]   hours.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.720]   Are you guys-- is anybody trying to get it right now
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.480]   while we're streaming?
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.640]   Are you using a bandwidth?
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.440]   Five hours.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.040]   Five hours?
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.800]   Gina?
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.160]   Yeah, no, I stopped the download because Skype
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.760]   is a delicate, delicate flower.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.120]   So I decided to resume after the show was done.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.240]   But actually, I think I'm done downloading.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.680]   I had a problem with my iPad, couldn't be restored.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.120]   That was the last error message I got.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.440]   So I haven't quite updated yet.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.040]   I'm hoping that'll finish this afternoon.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.280]   But yeah, I made a snarky tweet earlier
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.760]   about how the update servers being unreachable wasn't
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.800]   exactly the biggest advertisement for iCloud reliability.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.840]   And several Apple fans rushed to their defense
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.360]   and said that it was a huge download.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.160]   And this happens to lots of big companies.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.720]   So of course it does.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.440]   I'm actually really excited for iOS 5.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.840]   I have to say, I'm dying to get Android notifications.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.000]   And I'm really excited about not having to plug my iPad
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.520]   into my Mac again, in ever again.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.560]   That's something that I think Android always just did so well
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.480]   as well as notifications.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.240]   So I'm excited to get that kind of parody.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.320]   Kevin, have you succeeded in getting iOS 5 yet?
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.160]   No, and I didn't follow Life Hacker's tip
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.560]   on getting it early last week.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.680]   And now I totally wish I had.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.080]   Adam, you've got a hold of it somehow.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.280]   Somehow you got iOS 5.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.880]   Well, I haven't downloaded the official update at all.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.280]   Like Gina, last time I was on Twig,
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.480]   I had a miserable connection.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.080]   So I'm not playing with that right now.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:40.640]   But I am getting an iPhone 4S, which is the first iPhone
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.760]   I've had since the 3G.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.840]   So it'll be interesting.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.360]   I saw the tips about getting iOS 5 early.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.120]   I wanted to wait because I really
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.320]   wanted to get the official version.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.600]   I didn't feel like having to back up my system
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.800]   and do everything on my own.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.200]   But for some reason, Apple also just--
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.760]   they sent out lots of different updates.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.640]   They have new applications in the App Store.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.160]   I think there's an airport utility.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.640]   There's a new version of Lying Out 10.7.2 for some reason.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.680]   Are they just trying to crash the internet today?
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.600]   I mean, that seems like a really bad idea
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.720]   to introduce three or four products at the same time
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.440]   over the cloud.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:15.960]   It's true.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.680]   I got notifications for iTunes.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.880]   But I think iTunes has actually been out for a couple of days.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.440]   I just don't launch it very much.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.360]   But those OS 10, the Lying updates, the airport utility,
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.920]   and then iOS 5.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.240]   So it does seem like it was quite a list in my software
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.800]   update window.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.680]   So yeah, I think it's going to be taxing for a few more
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.680]   hours at least.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.040]   As I'm being told chat room, this is not Mac break weekly.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.640]   But Adam, do you have something to say or if Kevin, before we--
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.840]   I always feel like it would be like when we saw Adam and I
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.640]   think Gina and I were all a life hacker way in Windows 7
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.960]   when the betas were coming out.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.400]   And it was just instant internet crash.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.200]   Nobody could get it.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.160]   And I always wondered if it would be really cool
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.240]   if Microsoft or Apple kind of created their own private,
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.640]   bit torrent-ish networks.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.840]   Just not demanding that folks keep a certain ratio,
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.560]   but just check a box and say, I'd like to help other Apple
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.720]   super fans with better wording get iOS 5 as well.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.200]   I always wondered why that's something
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.000]   that no company wants to do is try
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.320]   to share the load with a peer-to-peer a little bit
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.680]   without going totally into the bit torrent recesses.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.920]   It's really intriguing idea.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.520]   The big news we were supposed to be talking about today
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.200]   was the Samsung Galaxy Nexus.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.400]   It was the Nexus Prime rumored, supposed
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.600]   to be unveiled yesterday at an event a CTIA called Unpacked.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.240]   And it didn't happen.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.200]   The official reason, according to the Samsung spokesperson,
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.880]   was that it was in respect about the passing of Steve Jobs.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.320]   They didn't want to introduce anything right now.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.480]   They said, they want to postpone the new product announcement
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.000]   at CTIA fall.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.040]   We agree that it's just not the right time
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.600]   to announce the new product.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.520]   A new date and venue will be shortly announced.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.560]   And I think the rumor is the 19th now, next week,
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.760]   a week from today, it's supposed to be dropped in Hong Kong.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.160]   We're going to see the something big is coming.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.160]   If you haven't seen the teaser video, I'm sure you have.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.200]   It's just a curved glass phone.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.080]   Anyone is still excited about this?
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.960]   Are you guys getting annoyed that this has been delayed?
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.960]   I was surprised that it was delayed.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.640]   I'll be honest.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.040]   And not to come off as a sensitive jerk,
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.520]   but it kind of seemed like extreme deference.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.320]   I mean, we all know that Android wouldn't be in the form
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.880]   that it is if it hadn't been for iOS.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.160]   But I was surprised it was postponed.
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.680]   And actually, Eileen and I were supposed
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.000]   to go to that event yesterday.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.280]   And there was an Android Tech Talk scheduled here in San Diego
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.360]   for last night, which I was going to.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.000]   And the plan was to discuss what had been announced yesterday,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.680]   which was basically a code word for Ice Cream Sandwich.
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.240]   So I went to the tech event anyway,
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.680]   and they wound up just giving the same old honeycomb talk
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.080]   that I had heard at Google I/O in March.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.320]   Although the developers-- it was a couple of developer
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.880]   advocates, and they were saying, they were discussing
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.000]   kind of all the stuff we know about Honeycomb already,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.840]   the action bar and fragments.
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.400]   And they kept saying things like,
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.520]   and future versions of Android will also use this.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.360]   So if you want a future proof of your app,
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.600]   make sure that you use these new components.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.160]   So it was a little bit of a hint of what's
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.960]   to common ice cream sandwich, which is just basically
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.680]   like that it's on the same track that Honeycomb was.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.280]   But I was pretty disappointed, although they
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.400]   need to get this thing out soon if they want to sell it
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.280]   for the holiday season.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.200]   Adam, do you think that Google was
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.440]   going to take a bunch of pot shots over at Apple
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.440]   and say the iOS 5 just dropped, and it's not spectacular?
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.440]   Our phone is amazing.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.960]   The stuff they're doing is catch up.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.840]   Do you think there-- is there a reason why they wouldn't
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.120]   just rewrite what they were going to do?
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.280]   And then just do this deference?
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.800]   Or are they waiting to just really hammer the point
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.560]   that iOS 5 is just a joke compared to ice cream sandwich?
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.360]   I mean, I kind of imagine that there's--
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.080]   I feel like the deference-- it seems unlikely to me.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.800]   I feel like there's another reason.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.080]   Maybe, I don't know.
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.160]   And if they did, the thing is that if they can't talk about--
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.920]   say they can't talk about notifications, for example,
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.800]   unless their notifications have improved
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.800]   from what they are right now.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.120]   Because Apple may have taken notifications,
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.920]   but Apple kind of leapfrogged a little bit with notifications.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.840]   And so I don't know.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.360]   I don't know.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.480]   I mean, obviously, they have been kind of pot shotty
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.080]   in their more recent keynotes and announcements
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.520]   about Android-related things.
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.880]   But yeah, I don't know.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.600]   It seems hard to believe that they postponed because
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.200]   of Steve Jobs.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.600]   But who knows?
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.600]   You can't trust the press release, though.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.400]   Yeah, there's a rumor out there by Eldar
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.360]   Mertazan.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.080]   He's the guy who broke a while ago on Twitter
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.240]   that Nokia was going to be bought by Microsoft.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.600]   And he has this track records a little--
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.600]   he's claiming that the Nexus Prime was delayed
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.320]   because of patent issues, saying Google
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.320]   is removing some features which are subject to a patent more.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.920]   No timeline for this job.
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.120]   Kevin, do you believe this thing?
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.160]   Do you think that Samsung and Google just
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.000]   weren't even aware that there was a patent concern?
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.480]   And they're like, oh, the day before,
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.240]   we're going to cancel this because of a patent.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.640]   They wouldn't know?
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.400]   No, I mean, especially with recent developments,
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.600]   I tend to think that most of the time,
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.000]   if you have a product like that, it
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.960]   costs a lot of money to move an announcement and a conference
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.520]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.280]   Read, do your press, all that kind of thing.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.560]   I tend to think that they would just say, oh, we'll just
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.160]   release and apologize later.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.520]   Easier than getting permission.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.040]   There has to be some other reason.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.240]   It doesn't seem-- I think Adam is right.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.320]   The apology slash difference doesn't seem legit.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.320]   But I also don't know that a last minute patent issue
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.680]   would necessarily delay it either.
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.760]   Must be something else.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.320]   While speculation time, anybody's got any ideas
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.760]   why they would delay this?
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.160]   Just board them just because they wanted more of a--
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.960]   they just don't have the parts ready, anybody?
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:51.320]   Mm-hm.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.040]   Nobody?
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:52.680]   No.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.040]   I leave.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.080]   I'm awesome.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.040]   Anything?
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.400]   I'm the only one that maybe I just feel like--
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.400]   I'm the only one that believes the press release, I guess.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.400]   Or I guess I want to believe the press release.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.000]   You want to believe that there is some sort of sympathy
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:06.600]   out there.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.480]   But I guess I'm the only one.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.840]   Maybe I should be jumping on the conspiracy bandwagon.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.480]   You're like, Mulder, I want to believe.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.000]   Yes.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.720]   OK, that's cool.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.800]   That's fine.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.440]   You can believe that.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.920]   But AT&T, at least they introduce some smartphones.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.920]   They're like, hey, look, our future is Android.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.480]   We don't have iPhone exclusives.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.200]   I can't even say the word exclusively anymore.
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.720]   And Verizon's had it for a while anyway.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.920]   But they are banking on Android with the Atrix II,
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:35.080]   which has got a pretty killer screen at 960 by 540.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.160]   It's got a dual-core 1 gigahertz processor, gig of RAM,
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:38.920]   all that fancy stuff.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.160]   This is their new flagship Android phone.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.880]   Then there's the capacitive glide from Samsung, which is--
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.120]   captivate that, excuse me.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.360]   It's also capacitive.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.720]   It's a slide-out, QWERTY keyboard.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.400]   And there's a nice little video from AT&T showing off
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.320]   all of their nice new phones, including the Pantech Pocket,
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.320]   a very odd, large 4-inch phone.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.120]   It's very unusual.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.280]   It's supposed to be all one-handed design for this.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.760]   Do any of these phones have you guys forgetting about the Nexus
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:08.160]   Prime?
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.840]   I totally doubt that, because it's supposed to be amazing.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.800]   Because wouldn't it be awesome if they came out
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.520]   with that announcement?
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.480]   And they also said, and guess what, folks?
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.520]   We guarantee that in six months, these phones
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.160]   will all be running Android 4.0.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.640]   But nobody ever does that.
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.560]   Nobody ever releases a phone right before an update and says.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:29.040]   And we're committed to making sure this phone gets updated,
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:33.120]   which I always hope to see, or at least hear from some channel
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.600]   or another.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.520]   Well, they created that agreement
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:42.080]   that they were going to push out updates within 18 months,
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.280]   which that's a long time.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:48.720]   I really wonder if regular consumers really
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.920]   sort of internalized the difference between new hardware
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:52.680]   and new software.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.880]   I think-- I don't know.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.280]   My sister-in-law bought a new phone, which has Android on it,
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.280]   and just kind of assumed that it was the newest version of Android,
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.640]   because it's a new phone, which is a bummer.
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.960]   And then she couldn't install something,
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.480]   and it was because it didn't support this older version of Android.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.720]   But I completely agree with you.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.320]   I would love to hear something like that.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.400]   I would love much more of a guarantee, like, hey,
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.720]   we have brand new version of Android coming out,
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.480]   and all the new phones are going to have that version.
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.720]   It's one of the biggest problems, I think,
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.200]   with the Android ecosystem in general.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.600]   Was that 18-month agreement?
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:25.080]   Is that a hard thing, or is that our partners have agreed to?
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.600]   They won't give you the Google Apps with Google
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.200]   until you say 18 months.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.000]   If I remember correctly, yeah, it's
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.160]   part of the with Google agreement that you will update in 18 months.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.320]   And this started-- this agreement,
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.920]   I think, just kind of became part of things
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.600]   like a month or two ago.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.400]   So they're just start to roll us out.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.280]   So yeah, I mean--
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.080]   The announcement was made.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.520]   It all felt like a lot of wind, because there wasn't--
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.040]   it was like, we have some partners.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.480]   We're loosely moving in this direction.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.680]   But it was never-- it wasn't like, this is what's happening.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.200]   These are specifically the phones that you can get.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.960]   And it's still-- it's a huge problem with Android stuff.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.320]   It's one of those other things that
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:07.880]   makes the iPhone so much easier to understand for any consumer,
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.600]   to just be like, I will get this.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:14.320]   And I will be able to access updates when they're available,
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.240]   as soon as they're available.
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.320]   But yeah, I struggled for a really long time
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.840]   with a really crappy Android phone.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.920]   It's miserable, and they need to get
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.840]   that whole situation under control.
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.280]   Actually, I think the Motorola acquisition
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.040]   is going to help with that a lot, because I think Motorola
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.760]   is going to get phones out with the latest version of Android.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.280]   And they're going to be awesome.
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:39.240]   And I think that that's going to really nudge other manufacturers.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:44.800]   Yeah, I mean, that is what's exciting about any Nexus phone,
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:45.800]   too, obviously.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.280]   That's why everyone wants the Nexus,
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.160]   because it's the one that they actually know.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.200]   Well, aside from the fact that they are doing a good job
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:57.240]   with nice hardware when sometimes that's lacking as well.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.840]   So speaking of which, Adam, you had the Nexus 4G
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.280]   for a little bit, and I had it also testing it.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.240]   So it looks like the new phone is curved glass.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.480]   Did you like the curved glass?
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.480]   Do you know-- do any of you guys know anybody who likes that?
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.560]   I didn't like the curved glass.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.040]   I did like it.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:11.960]   You did?
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.460]   OK.
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.320]   Yeah, I was pretty happy with it.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.080]   It wasn't-- I don't know.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.680]   It felt very-- it felt nice in the hand.
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:22.840]   It was a very smooth screen.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:27.560]   It didn't stand out to me as strange.
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.640]   It was just-- I mean, it's not like it's a basketball.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:36.720]   Yeah, the curve of the Nexus Prime.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.720]   The curve of the Nexus Prime does look a little more
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.000]   extreme than the Nexus S. But I have the Nexus S,
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.560]   and yeah, I love it.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.160]   I don't really think about the curve very much.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.320]   I don't know.
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:49.680]   When you look at those pictures, the curve looks really extreme.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.760]   I don't know if that's just an exaggerated thing
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.720]   with the highlight along the top of it.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.480]   But you're right.
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.000]   I mean, looking at that, it looks strange.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.920]   But using the other Nexus, I never had any issue with it.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:03.480]   Do you guys remember the--
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.360]   I'm assuming you did, Kevin?
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.400]   I just-- well, I don't ever trust myself,
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.040]   because I like things in terms of Android that others don't.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.400]   But I liked it, too.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.200]   I just-- I wasn't sure if they thought it would be such a huge
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.360]   hidden, it wasn't.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:22.400]   The Nexus 4G on Sprint, I think, is a free phone right now.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.120]   So I just never know how others perceive things like that.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.520]   Do you guys remember when the G1 came out, the first Android
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.320]   phone, and it had that banana shape?
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.720]   It had that chin that came out.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.120]   And you could actually use it like a real phone.
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.600]   So when you did this, it still looked the same.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.480]   Do you think-- is there some kind of push to make a phone
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.800]   look like a phone with Google for some reason?
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.840]   Do they really want this thing to be curved to your head?
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.400]   I mean, is that really a big deal?
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.680]   Because I know they said, oh, yeah, the curve
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.960]   is good for your fingers when you want to do touchscreen
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:49.240]   and stuff.
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.720]   But maybe they just want ergonomics?
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.640]   They just need a design differentiation.
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.760]   They just need something to say, hey, look, this is new and
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.640]   cool, and it's curved, so it's better.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.360]   So then the other--
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:00.760]   That's in your pocket.
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.800]   Are you happy to see me?
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.080]   That's the problem with this thing.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.800]   This is why they have to be flat.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.880]   Otherwise, it just looks very bizarre in your pants.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:08.680]   That's true.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.600]   That's good fun.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.600]   You've got to think of these things.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.920]   Unless you're going to be carrying it like a bandolear
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.600]   or something, something across your chest.
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.600]   That's the next tablet version, which
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.120]   should be right across over there.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.480]   So Google+, anybody still using Google+,
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.280]   I'm assuming that everyone here is using Google+,
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.680]   what was that horrible reaction?
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.560]   Just, you know, a book I'm working on Chapter 6 right now.
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:33.480]   It's OK.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.720]   No, nobody's using Google+, I guess.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.800]   Yeah, there was a report out from a company called--
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.200]   I think it's called Chitika, which I keep
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.400]   on and call Chiquita, that they're
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:48.320]   saying that Google+ traffic is down 60% after they went to public.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:53.480]   So there's a nice graph, which I'm trying to load very slowly.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.760]   If I was our boss at Life Hacker,
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.680]   I would ask about where they get their stats from.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.080]   There we go.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:58.760]   So there's--
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.280]   Yeah, here's the thing.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.600]   I've spent way too much time in my life
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.880]   obsessing about ups and downs of visits and traffic.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.080]   And every time--
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:15.080]   I don't know, Chitika or whatever, maybe their measurements
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.240]   are 100% right.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:20.040]   But every time I see--
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.000]   like Compete says, this person's gone down this much.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:29.560]   And like, whatever, the various stat trackers,
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:30.920]   they never--
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:34.000]   whenever they're related to things that I actually
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.440]   know about, they're wrong.
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.480]   So I don't know.
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:43.120]   The Google people seem to argue that--
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:46.640]   and in this instance, for those sorts of things,
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.400]   I tend to believe them.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.240]   Plus one.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:52.720]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.160]   I mean, the Google+ team continues to grow the network.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.800]   And they're--
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.720]   I mean, it's hard to say.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.560]   It might experience a totally subjective.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.160]   And it could be that I just have encircled mostly tech
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.160]   nerds and journalists.
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.640]   But it seems like things are still really active in my own
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:08.960]   stream.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.120]   I enjoy using it.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.120]   It's a different feeling than Twitter and Facebook.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.400]   But I don't know.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.760]   I am dubious about these numbers as well.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:21.360]   And Mike Elgin on Google+ basically tore this thing apart,
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.760]   saying the figure represents not the decline in Google+
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.400]   but the decline of newspaper--
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.200]   trustworthyness.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.400]   And he explains what happened.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.640]   He explained that Google+ was invite only on the day they
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.240]   opened the floodgates to the public, immediately spiked by
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.880]   1,200%.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.680]   These new people were mostly enthusiastic new users, but
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.440]   at minority were tire kickers who didn't stick around.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.160]   And it basically tears this whole thing apart, saying, it
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.360]   should have read, traffic increases fivefold as Google+
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:47.280]   opens to the public.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.840]   Because if you look back at the graph again, you'll see that
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.280]   when it opened on the 20th, a lot of people showed up.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:52.840]   That makes sense.
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:57.600]   Why wouldn't people try it out anyway versus sticking around?
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.760]   I mean, this is--
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.200]   I was kind of--
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.400]   I wanted to believe this.
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.400]   And here's why.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.200]   I'm like one of those Google+ hipsters.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.360]   Like, you know I was there before it was cool, you know?
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.240]   And you'd have a public post, or you have a hangout or
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.520]   something, and you'd know the people that would show up.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.040]   But now everyone's there.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.240]   Absolutely everybody's there.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.760]   And they're like, hey, what's going on?
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.520]   And they have all kinds of comments.
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.360]   It's like the internet again.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:21.120]   So I kind of like to be enclosed off.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.680]   The reality is that the growth pattern for a small,
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:27.440]   unknown startup launching a new social network is going to
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.640]   be that steady up, right?
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.640]   But when Google releases something, you're always going to
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.000]   have that initial spike, especially when it's invite only.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.560]   So you get that like Gmail wave rush of people who just
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.920]   dying for invite to try it out.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.640]   And then when it opens to the public, it goes back up again.
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.600]   I just think it's unrealistic to think that this traffic
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.120]   pattern is indicative of failure.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.160]   I think this is just like-- this is what happens when
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.840]   Google releases an invite only product and then opens it
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:51.680]   to the public.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.800]   And Google's just, you know, it's a big target, easy target.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.400]   So I think it's easy to see stories like this saying, hey,
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.120]   you know, it's dead.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.000]   Yeah, the other thing is it's not--
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.440]   I mean, it's not as though Google+ doesn't have its problems.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.080]   I don't think anyone would argue that it's perfect.
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:13.360]   But I just-- it's not-- I don't think that this chart is
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.720]   indicative of anything that you could actually extract a
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.760]   meaningful analysis from.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.080]   Has Google released any--
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.520]   The conclusion they reached.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.040]   Has Google released any information about actual statistics?
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.960]   I mean, I know we've seen stuff from, I think, was Paul
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.920]   Allen from Ancestry.com.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.440]   And we've seen those kinds of speculative kind of numbers.
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.440]   But has Google said anything in particular?
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.400]   Not that I know of.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.640]   No, Google itself.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.000]   Specific.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.360]   They're committed to it, though.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:46.240]   I mean, they're now listing the number of circles and
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.320]   authors in Google search results, which I thought was a
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.840]   really big-- and plus one is integrated across all of
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.840]   their products.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.920]   I mean, this is-- you know, I'm convinced that Google is
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.440]   full steam ahead on Google+ committed to integrating
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.120]   this everywhere.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.800]   And just the power of having it in that black bar across your
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.680]   Google home page is huge.
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.160]   I don't know if we're really-- if many people are going to
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.920]   have the choice but to check it out or use it in some
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.320]   capacity, even if it's sort of this passive sharing kind of
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.320]   Facebook, just through plus ones and kind of saying, hey,
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.080]   what's that red button?
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:23.080]   Well, there was a post that went out publicly by a Google
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.800]   engineer named Steve Yege.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.240]   And he basically tore apart Google+.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.280]   It's funny that you said that they took time doing it because
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:34.120]   he called Google+ a knee jerk reaction, a study in short
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:37.440]   term thinking predicated on the incorrect notion that
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.640]   Facebook is successful because they built a great product.
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.040]   And then it goes on a bit there.
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.520]   I just want to like read some of these quotes and just find
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.360]   out how you guys-- what do you guys think of this?
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:48.440]   Because I was reading this and my jaw was dropped because it
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.880]   seemed a little bit--
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.280]   little harsh.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.560]   But the actual post had been taken down because this was
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.360]   meant to be a private post and has been published
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.040]   everywhere.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:01.680]   So what do you guys think about it being a knee jerk reaction?
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.720]   So Adam really dug into this.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.120]   Yeah, sorry, Adam.
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.440]   No, go ahead, Kevin.
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.800]   I was just going to say that in part, just to kind of
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.880]   explain it, it seems like he's really targeting the Google
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.680]  + platform, more than saying Google+ itself as a knee
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.920]   jerk reaction, unless I write it wrong.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:19.280]   Right.
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:23.920]   So the basic idea from what I understood was he's not
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:28.520]   attacking-- it's not an attack on Google+ primarily, not
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.720]   specifically or primarily.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.120]   In fact, it's more about the Google culture.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.520]   And his issue is with Google as a company culture that makes
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.960]   products that stand alone, basically these silos.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:44.120]   And he's talking up the one thing that he felt--
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.800]   or the one of three things he felt Amazon did very well
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.560]   during his time in Amazon, which was create services and
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.840]   platforms that could talk to each other and that
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.720]   developers, both inside the company and outside, could
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.480]   create things on top of.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.920]   And so his argument with Facebook is that Facebook
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.640]   created one killer app, which is the wall of the sharing,
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.200]   the social things.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.280]   And then the rest of the good things about Facebook are
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.840]   all things that developers have brought to the platform,
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.640]   mostly third party developers.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.040]   And Google launched with something that was very much a
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:17.640]   product.
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.560]   It's very siloed.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:19.640]   It didn't have an API.
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.680]   And now the API that it has is very--
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.280]   I mean, Gina, you can talk about that a little bit more.
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:28.960]   But it's not really robust at this point.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.880]   And yeah, so his argument basically is that Google as a
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:39.040]   company and in particular with Google+ needs to expand
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:43.880]   their thinking towards services over individual products.
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:47.360]   Gina, do you think it's a knee jerk?
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.880]   I doubt it.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.400]   Yeah, I mean, like Adam said, I think that the overall
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.160]   thesis was that Google has to concentrate on platforms
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.280]   over products.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.920]   And so that they're trying to win with Google+ by making a
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:58.640]   great product.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.760]   But they really have to make it a great platform.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.000]   This guy worked at Amazon for several years, now works at
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:04.280]   Google.
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:06.960]   So I certainly don't have the perspective that he does.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.520]   But this didn't seem right to me.
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.600]   I mean, Google launched.
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.880]   And it was too much of a platform and not enough of a
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.040]   product.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.600]   And I've worked with the Google+ API.
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.520]   I mean, the Google+ has been out for a couple of months
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:18.800]   now.
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:19.960]   And the API is limited.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.080]   But if you just log into the Google APIs console, there's
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:27.840]   tons of APIs for many of Google's services, if not all.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.000]   So I don't know.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.400]   I don't see Google as having trouble with making platforms.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.640]   I think that we're so late in the social game at this point,
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.400]   Google has to make a compelling product.
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.120]   They're also going to make the same mistake they made with
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.560]   Wave, which was like, here's a thing.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.080]   And you can do everything on it.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.960]   Developers come build on it.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.600]   And it just flopped.
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.600]   I mean, the way that Facebook and Twitter grew is that they
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.880]   made this great, small, little product, and then they
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.160]   grew it into a platform.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:59.760]   But I don't know if Google is on such an accelerated launch
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.520]   kind of timeline just because they're Google.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.160]   I think they have to make a compelling product first and
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.600]   then extend the platform out.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.800]   So far, the Google+ API is pretty good.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.280]   It has a long way to go.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:14.400]   But it's been only a few weeks so far that it's been out.
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.560]   So I don't know.
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.680]   I kind of disagree.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.600]   I kind of disagreed with his thesis that Google--
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.560]   maybe internally, Google needs to concentrate on platform
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:22.760]   more.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.760]   And this was a post meant for other Google employees.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:26.880]   So it was interesting.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.520]   He described how Bezos at Amazon had issued this edict
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.640]   that every single small team within Amazon had to
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.760]   communicate with one another using services that would
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.080]   eventually be public facing.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.280]   So you had to build an API for everything or else.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.360]   You couldn't use services that other products that other
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.640]   groups were making and how that really shows.
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.280]   Amazon is such an incredible service provider and platform.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.120]   And it is.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:54.400]   And that Google should adopt a similar model so that in
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.800]   order for the groups to communicate with one another,
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.880]   they have to create these services that then developers
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:58.320]   can use.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.240]   And that sounds like a great idea.
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:05.040]   And that does sound like a huge cultural change inside Google.
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:08.280]   I would just love to know what this employee's boss thought
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.320]   about this post.
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.120]   Because it is interesting that it got taken down, but it got
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:12.880]   reshared.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.000]   And the share is public.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:14.360]   The original--
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.320]   I would have loved to have written a letter when I was at
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:20.840]   Life Hacker saying that Life Hacker deals is a prime
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.440]   example of our complete failure to understand platforms from
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.920]   the very highest levels of executive leadership.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.040]   Hi, Adam, Gina, Nick Denton.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.280]   Howdy, Howdy.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.520]   It shows something about Google's culture.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.560]   And then he even mentioned somewhere else in this really
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:37.880]   long post that he wrote a spreadsheet about all the ways
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.840]   that Google loses to Amazon or something.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.600]   And he gave it to HR and they loved it.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.880]   But marketing with a nice distributor, something like that.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.360]   It was all the ways Google's better than Amazon.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.120]   Oh, sorry.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:48.640]   Look around.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:48.680]   So--
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:51.440]   So you're not rooting like it because it would-- yeah, yeah.
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.360]   But still, it's just amazing that this is something you
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.840]   could write internally and expect not to get fired for.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.960]   Yeah, I mean, it's kind of nice that it is.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:02.640]   He does say on his Google+ profile, he has a post up.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:06.120]   And it's basically saying that no one told him to take it
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:06.400]   down.
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.680]   It was a call he made himself and deleted because he hadn't
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:12.400]   intended to make it public in the first place.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.600]   But yeah, for whatever that's worth.
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:17.000]   And when Google+ launched, I was thinking about some things
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:17.760]   that were missing.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.200]   There's a company right now called Topsy.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.800]   And they will allow you to search Google+ for public posts.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.760]   You guys remember when Google+ launched, how there was no
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.080]   search built in?
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:27.920]   Because I remember that.
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.200]   There was some ways around that.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:33.200]   You could do the site search and you could do it via some
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.040]   extra syntax in Google searches.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.880]   But I mean, it looks like people are like Topsy and other
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.280]   companies like that think that there's a future here in
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:40.920]   Google+.
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:44.120]   There's a reason why they want to actually scour through
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:44.920]   these things.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.040]   I just know that this is a welcome thing.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.800]   I know that Google just added it as well.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:52.040]   They had the search in there.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:55.480]   I could see some of the negative stuff that Steve put in
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.040]   this post and why he was kind of lashing out a bit on some
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:02.200]   of this stuff because it seems not fully there.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.960]   Are you guys going to try out Topsy or did you enjoy the
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.000]   fact that search is now--
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.760]   there are more options for search?
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:12.080]   Topsy is kind of a version of Google sparks that they think
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:12.920]   works better.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:16.120]   Like, that's what Google+ sparks are kind of supposed to do
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.600]   is let you search through and kind of keep track of topics
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:19.320]   on Google+.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:23.920]   But Topsy seems for what I've seen of it to kind of feel like
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.040]   what they think is a better implementation of it.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.760]   I think that's scary that you use sparks because I think
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.600]   maybe our audience may be the only one that knows what that
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:31.600]   is.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.600]   Isn't that really--
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.240]   Yeah, even I was a little bit like when I was a little
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.600]   taken off guard when you said sparks.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.600]   Yes.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.600]   Yes.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.400]   Didn't want to try to explain to Google sparks, which I like
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.000]   this idea.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.560]   You'd be able to-- you'd go into Google+ and then you'd
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.480]   pick a topic that you're interested in and then you'd
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.360]   see some curated content.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.720]   Be a great way to start conversations.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.920]   You want to reshare all that stuff because there's no
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.080]   easy way to share stuff on Google+ once you're off a
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.520]   Google properties, not including Google Reader where
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.160]   you can't share things directly.
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.760]   That's a whole other problem, isn't it?
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:05.280]   But yeah, that's what sparks are supposed to be.
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:09.560]   It's a very small curated kind of thing.
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.400]   It saves searches basically, right?
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:12.920]   Kind of.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.920]   Well, you can tell what topic you want.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.160]   It's taking forever to load.
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:20.120]   I picked technology and then I click it and it loads.
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.040]   Let's see what happens.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.520]   Or like a Google News section.
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:25.720]   Let's make sure every sees everything on my--
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.000]   see, that's private.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:27.920]   That's private.
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.800]   Excuse me.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:30.800]   I as I wing it.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:35.000]   No, I'm just teasing.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.320]   There's nothing over there that's going to get me fired yet.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.120]   But yeah, there we go.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.880]   There's some technology posts by my friends on Google+.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.320]   It's a great idea, but nobody really knows it's there.
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.400]   You just actually have to pick a spark.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.480]   How do you add sparks anyway?
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:50.880]   I think if you do a search, you can save a search as a
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.560]   spark.
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:55.240]   And I think they actually are still calling it sparks.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.520]   I'll do a search for Life Hacker.
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:58.560]   OK.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.040]   And then I can say save the search.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.240]   And there it is.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.480]   There's my spark.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.080]   Now I can see--
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.520]   and you should see every post where someone has just
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.200]   written the word Life Hacker.
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.160]   Or if-- well, if Life Hacker was a person, it would show you
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.120]   every post that that person's been tagged in publicly,
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.360]   that kind of thing.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.480]   So it is supposed to be kind of like-- it kind of seems like
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.720]   what Topsy's trying to get at.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.320]   We still don't have a timeline when businesses can be there.
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:25.080]   General businesses anyway, because I know there's a few
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:26.080]   partnerships out there.
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:29.640]   But Google+, I mean, Google hasn't said anything about when
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.600]   Life Hacker can have a page--
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.440]   what, when Twit can, when smarter aware--
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:38.280]   anybody here any wrong things about that?
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:38.800]   It just--
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:42.400]   I would say it's like going to be very soon.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.840]   Very soon, without breaking an NDA.
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.840]   That's my guess.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:47.360]   Why so?
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:52.720]   I thought you were going to say, because if they're doing
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.840]   all the stuff with APIs, that probably seems like they're
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:55.360]   closing in.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:34:01.640]   I do think that it's-- from--
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.720]   I can't give specifics.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.240]   But we were talking to them right away and really
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.360]   desperate to get one.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:11.960]   Especially, Life Hacker readers are really strong on Google
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.440]  +.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:18.520]   And so, yeah, I actually don't know anything 100% specific.
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:21.720]   But I think it's going to be very soon.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:24.080]   But now it sounds like you really do.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.960]   Yeah, that's what I did.
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.160]   Yeah, OK.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.280]   Just checking.
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:33.480]   Speaking of search, they're enabling hashtags, link
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:34.080]   hashtags.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.200]   And I'm sorry that Jeff Jarvis isn't here, because he's
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:37.800]   a huge hashtag fan.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:41.040]   But they're going to start hyperlinking.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.680]   That's a throwback term.
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:46.120]   They're going to start automatically hyperlinking hashtags
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:46.960]   all out Twitter.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.560]   So if you click on them, then you see a search for hashtag,
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:52.400]   which is really interesting for a lot of reasons.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.840]   So that they don't have that deal for the real-time search
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:57.840]   results with Twitter anymore in search results.
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:01.400]   So they have this live search results and hashtag support.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.480]   So you can imagine being on your Google TV
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:07.840]   and watching the premiere of Glee and having the Google+
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:12.040]   stream of Glee hashtag posts running down the side
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.680]   or across the bottom of your screen.
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:17.160]   And that's something that I do manually with Twitter now.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:20.880]   But you can see that they want to move that kind of functionality
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:21.680]   over to Google+.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.920]   And really interesting to me that they're using hashtags, which
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.960]   really started as kind of a Twitter convention.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:30.280]   But the inventor of hashtags, Chris Messina, works at Google
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:30.960]   now.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.080]   So it's not too surprising.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.960]   So I assume that we're going to see real-time
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:37.040]   search results from plus inside of Google search results soon.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:42.960]   And that hashtags will be used even more.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.400]   I get text messages with hashtags in them.
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.680]   I see people using them on Facebook.
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:52.120]   They're almost just a fact of online life now.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:52.640]   It's true.
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:56.040]   I was going to say, Kudos to Gina to get the Glee mention.
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:01.400]   Well, you know, we have some viewers who play a drinking game.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:01.960]   And so--
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.880]   Earlier we were talking about the Google+ rush,
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.760]   I was going to say it's like when it's Chipotle opens
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.320]   and everyone goes during the first week.
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.240]   And then-- but I decided against it.
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.760]   But then I kind of didn't.
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:11.240]   Exactly.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.400]   All right, now we've got two drinks.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.360]   That's two drinks in the game.
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.160]   Chipotle and Glee.
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.120]   So if you really, really haven't a bad day,
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:18.040]   Glee, Glee, Glee, Glee, Glee.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:18.400]   There you go.
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:19.600]   I'm a moramass.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.680]   Or you could do it.
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:21.120]   You see that?
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:25.440]   Google did a Google+ Hangout ad in newspaper,
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.960]   which I find this very odd.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.600]   The New York Times, it's a small publication
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.520]   in a very tiny town called New York.
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.240]   The New York Times is full page ad.
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.360]   Well, it's a full page, but there's a little bit of text.
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.840]   It's about the Dalai Lama not being
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:40.520]   able to go to Desmond Tutu's 80th birthday party.
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:43.240]   But then he was allowed to because they corrected the ad,
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.000]   the actual ad there.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.560]   You could see with the little red pen there,
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:51.440]   it says he's able to join in a Hangout thanks to Google+.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.520]   I really want to know if you guys think that the New York Times
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:37:00.480]   audience has any idea what that ad means.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.640]   That's a good question.
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:03.800]   Like the I would assume that.
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.840]   It seemed kind of an obtuse ad, didn't it?
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:11.120]   Like for someone who doesn't know what Hangout is, it's true.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.840]   It is a rather subtle ad.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.600]   And the Google+ logo, like the plus sign after Google,
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.000]   I mean, obviously everyone knows what the Google logo is.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.360]   But I don't know that you're like, oh, Google+,
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.840]   that's like another product for someone who doesn't know.
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.720]   It's like an odd ad.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:28.840]   Yeah, I mean, they didn't do anything like interesting.
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:29.920]   It's not even a QR code.
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.840]   I mean, that I think would be more obtuse if it was simply
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.280]   in a QR code.
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:38.360]   But there's a tiny URL on the bottom.
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.800]   I'm just confused about this.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.760]   I mean, if they're trying to get people on Google+,
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.520]   I mean, maybe this is the audience they want.
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:48.840]   But I mean, would this ad get you to go, yes, this is--
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.680]   I will learn about what Hangout is.
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.680]   This is via Hangout.
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.320]   It doesn't even explain what that is.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:57.880]   This is joined at the 80th birthday celebration via Hangout.
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:01.280]   It is definitely probably one of the coolest breakout
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.400]   features of Google+, and in every sense of the word
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.280]   breakout, because you could kind of almost use Hangouts
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.880]   without even really being a Google+ fan.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.880]   You just have to add the right people to your circle
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.960]   or just do all your Hangouts publicly.
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:17.320]   But the group video chat feature of Google+
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:20.280]   is probably one of its biggest appeals
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:23.320]   beyond the I don't like Facebook or I
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.800]   want a different kind of sharing market.
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:28.280]   So it's a good direction to aim and add in,
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:33.760]   but that is really subtle for even a supposedly higher
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.440]   educated audience.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.560]   Well, hopefully they get a lot of people's attention.
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.560]   I know that Hangouts are being used by Felicia Day
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:40.920]   nowadays to promote a new show.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:42.360]   I think it's called Dragon's Age,
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.600]   but I don't want to say the wrong name.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:45.520]   Yeah, Dragon Age.
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.520]   And what she'll be doing is a three-hour marathon session
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:51.280]   where she'll hang out with as many people as she can.
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.440]   She's calling it Hangout House Calls.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.680]   That's coming up on Tuesday.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:57.640]   So if you want to hang out with Felicia Day,
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.800]   I guess you just have to set up a Hangout,
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.640]   and she's going to just keep showing up.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.920]   What do you guys think of this as a marketing kind of idea?
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:07.080]   Just showing up to talk to fans.
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.640]   So it's like, you've got a new show,
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:09.920]   and you just show up.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.720]   Is this going to be--
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:13.840]   are we going to see great tweets about this later,
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:17.400]   or Google+ messages saying, this is fantastic?
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.960]   Or are they going to say this was a disaster,
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.520]   because it was very awkward.
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.160]   I actually think that this happened yesterday.
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.720]   And I didn't get a chance to see how it went.
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:31.080]   I mean, I think Felicia's super savvy social media user,
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.800]   and she's got tons of fans and followers.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.840]   And I think a lot of them are really shy nerds
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:39.560]   who would be scared to ask her for a photo in person
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:43.040]   if they saw her, but would love to get a screen cap of video
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.200]   chat with her.
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.360]   Thanks for the question.
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.240]   It was yesterday.
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.840]   Yeah, I think it was yesterday.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.960]   So I actually-- I wonder if she posted an update.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.480]   I'd love to know how it went.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.840]   I would love to see our political candidates do
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.400]   this kind of thing.
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.920]   Or just anyone who kind of wanted to reach out to fans
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.200]   in a way that was manageable but not--
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.840]   Well, I mean, it's nice to not have to leave your computer
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.920]   and be able to connect with people individually.
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:10.480]   Although I imagine it was a bit of an awkward and long three
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.800]   hours for her.
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:16.840]   I think that what is happening here and what Google knows
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.840]   what they're doing is that, like with Twitter,
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:22.680]   I can broadcast on Twitter and a lot of us
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.680]   can broadcast on Twitter because we have a certain critical
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:29.000]   mass of followers that's not normal.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.640]   So that's not-- the ability to broadcast on Twitter,
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:35.280]   I don't think is why most people sign up for Twitter to start out.
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.560]   I think most people sign up because they
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:40.240]   want to follow Felicia Day or they
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:43.720]   want to follow various celebrities.
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:46.240]   And Google is playing that up big time, I think,
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:50.120]   specifically with Hangouts because it does give them
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:53.080]   the opportunity to show what is cool about Google+
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.880]   and it actually draws a lot of people in.
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:58.760]   So they've had some will I am promotions.
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:04.640]   And then things like this, this is the kind of thing that
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:07.680]   is their best bet to draw in people, like Kevin said,
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:13.000]   who aren't the privacy crowd or whatever, the very specific
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.640]   thing that it definitely does better than others.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.640]   This is the thing that's going to attract people and be like,
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:22.280]   oh, I can hang out with a celebrity I think is cool.
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:22.840]   Awesome.
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:26.840]   I will sign up for and maybe stick around at Google+.
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:27.840]   I don't know.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.040]   This had to be like a chat roulette session for Felicia.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.880]   She did 40 Hangouts in three hours.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.920]   I'm sure that it was a little nerve-racking to collect
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.480]   that join button for her.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.440]   40 Hangouts or 40 different guests in the Hangout?
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:42.520]   40 different-- she says 40 different Hangouts.
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:44.120]   Art, core.
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.160]   It's the ears.
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:49.240]   So you have screen chats post the links on her post.
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.680]   I could see-- yeah, like Gina was saying, potentially
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:52.680]   the chat roulette danger.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.600]   I would hope that you have some kind of screener.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:56.440]   She don't want to necessarily see something
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:59.920]   you don't want to see right away.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:03.960]   On that note, we should thank our sponsor.
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:05.240]   Go to a meeting.

[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:11.960]   it's virtually impossible, but not anymore.

[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.360]   no matter where we go.

[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:45.680]   or a tablet.

[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:29.760]   And actual search news.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:32.880]   Apparently Google had a good September.
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.640]   They apparently had a lousy August
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:37.120]   when it came to market share when it came to searches
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:39.120]   because if you guys forgot Google does searches.
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:40.640]   They're not just an advertising company
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:44.760]   that does social networks and makes phone operating systems.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:47.280]   But they've gained some market share back
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:51.040]   and I'm patiently waiting for the thing to load on my computer
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:52.760]   to tell me the number.
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:53.760]   65%.
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:58.440]   They dipped down below 65% and they went back up to,
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:00.400]   well, they went back beyond 65%.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.640]   So that's what they did.
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:03.480]   Has anybody surprised that Google's market shares
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.960]   diminishing to things like Yahoo and obviously
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.600]   Yahoo is powered by Bing or like,
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.840]   all these searches fungible at this point.
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:16.800]   It's time to everybody.
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.360]   - Yeah. - It's time to do.
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:19.200]   - Sorry.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.000]   - Yeah, I keep it there we go.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:22.840]   - We'll get that then.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:25.440]   Let's go to Google.com and go to the Google Doodle.
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:27.160]   That'll wake everybody up.
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:31.040]   If you go to Google.com you'll see little clay balls.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.760]   - Oh, Gumby.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.040]   - Yes, exactly because it is Art,
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:37.440]   Cloquies, 90th birthday.
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:38.280]   - Wow.
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.160]   - He made Gumby, he also made,
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:41.840]   if you've watched a lot of television
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:43.080]   when you were a kid like me,
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.120]   you've seen Davey and Goliath.
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.000]   He was behind all that stuff.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.800]   - Oh my God, I love claymation.
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.400]   - Yes, you got a claym?
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:51.800]   - How awesome is this?
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:54.960]   - You click on the balls, they all do awesome things.
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:55.880]   Let's see.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:57.600]   - Can I click?
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:00.720]   - I've totally started to come around on people
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.000]   against folks who are complaining
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.400]   that Google doesn't have like a standardized system
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:05.800]   for what they choose to celebrate
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:07.760]   'cause you can click on the clay
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.680]   and it turns into Gumby people.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.320]   I mean, like what?
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:14.200]   The whole, the argument being if, you know,
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:16.120]   if you've been following Twig for a while that,
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.000]   they choose weird things to celebrate
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.400]   and they don't necessarily choose some like major things
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:23.520]   that are just commonly celebrated and recognized,
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.160]   but this is awesome.
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:26.040]   I mean.
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.320]   - There's a challenge in the chat room.
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:29.600]   Can you name all the characters that are on there?
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:32.480]   I can only name Gumby Poked in the blockheads,
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:33.320]   but I don't remember.
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:35.600]   - Comby is the best I could do past Gumby.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:38.320]   - Who's the stan, the stan, the little stan, the source dude?
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:39.960]   I can't remember his name.
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:41.160]   Or is this a Gumby sister?
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:44.520]   I think that's a Gumby sister.
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.160]   If only I could use some kind of search engine
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.720]   to look up Gumby characters.
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:48.560]   (laughing)
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:51.160]   - I don't know their names.
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:53.680]   - This is really, really interesting actually.
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:57.800]   If you, if I paste a link in here to Skype, can you see it?
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.280]   Can we bring that up at all?
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:00.760]   This is the background.
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.600]   - In the doc.
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:05.120]   - Oh, in the doc.
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.560]   - The doc chat.
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.920]   - I'm just putting it right at the top 'cause I don't.
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:11.600]   So if you go to that URL,
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:14.160]   the way that they're doing the animations,
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.520]   I was kind of curious.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:19.320]   They've got a background image for each of those little balls.
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:20.160]   And when you click it,
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.640]   it animates through the background position.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:27.440]   So it's got like the whole animation in one image.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.560]   It's kind of neat.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.160]   - That is really neat.
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.840]   So it is really neat.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.200]   It is true stop motion.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.200]   - And that's probably how they got some
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.440]   Markishear back actually,
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:36.800]   by having lots of fun animations.
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:37.880]   - Straight up. - Indeed.
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:39.160]   - Straight up stop motion.
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:42.040]   - You don't need to actually offer great search results.
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:44.240]   Just have really cool animations that make you play.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.400]   When they had Pac-Man, they're I lost a whole day.
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:47.920]   - Yeah, that aren't Flash, right?
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:48.920]   That are HTML5.
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.920]   Yeah, that Pac-Man doodle.
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:51.760]   I still want my--
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:52.600]   - I think that's still around.
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:53.800]   You can find it somewhere else.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:54.640]   They also have like a,
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:56.160]   I think one where you could record music
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:59.040]   for Les Paul's birthday, which was,
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:00.120]   I know it's not a birthday.
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.160]   I guess anniversary of his birth
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.200]   because everyone is all dead.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:04.520]   But I didn't want to bring everybody down
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:07.120]   because I've already done that a couple times.
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.200]   The chat room was correcting me like crazy.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.320]   Like, "Arts dead."
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.440]   I'm like, "Yes, I know he's dead.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:12.560]   "Sorry, I can't bring him back."
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:17.920]   So Hulu is still for sale.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:20.280]   And apparently, Google's still in the running.
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:23.600]   Now, there's Yahoo just bowed out
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.000]   because they're having all kinds of problems
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.560]   as I'm sure everyone knows.
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:28.120]   They have an interim CEO.
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:31.200]   They're trying to figure out if they're going to be
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:34.520]   going into sale with the private equity firm
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:35.720]   or what are they gonna do.
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:36.840]   But Google's still out there
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:38.720]   and they seem to be interested in Hulu
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:41.440]   only if they get certain conditions.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.080]   They want some exclusive rights,
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:46.400]   exclusive content rights that are guaranteed for years.
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:50.720]   Adam, do you think that Google going into Hulu
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.800]   or buying Hulu is the best thing for them to do?
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.120]   I mean, they seem to already have deals
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:58.440]   with a bunch of content partners for YouTube.
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:01.680]   Why would they necessarily even need something like Hulu?
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:04.880]   - So what I don't actually understand with this is,
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:08.320]   obviously there's pretty clear reasons
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:09.280]   why they would want Hulu.
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.640]   But if they bought Hulu,
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:15.200]   do you think it would stay as its own product?
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.200]   Do you think it would integrate with,
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.920]   it would just become a YouTube channel
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.800]   of an elevated YouTube channel of some sort?
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.120]   - You know, I would think that after what they did
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:26.080]   with Google videos and YouTube,
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:28.280]   that to have two separate entities
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.480]   might be a mess for them at this point.
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:31.320]   - Yeah.
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.760]   - And it creates one, yeah, it creates one place
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.760]   where they can send all their people
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.960]   and integrating with things like Google TV.
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:40.280]   'Cause you also imagine that they're thinking
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:43.400]   some point down the future where you could,
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:46.200]   'cause right now Google TV is best for,
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:50.920]   or it can do web video, but it can also do your cable box,
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:54.680]   but this could potentially bring the cable box
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:57.120]   or take the cable box part out of the equation
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:59.920]   because that web video would do the same thing for you.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:03.400]   - Kevin, do you think Google would merge YouTube and Hulu
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:04.440]   or would they just keep them separate?
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:07.280]   I mean, Hulu does actually have a bit of goodwill
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.000]   to its name and people know it already.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.400]   I mean, it's, but you can't people know YouTube.
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:14.680]   - What Adam just said, but with the cynical footnote
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:16.560]   that like once Google tries to do that,
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:19.080]   every network and carrier tries to shut them down
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:20.680]   for trying to do it.
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:23.200]   Every cable company, I mean,
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.720]   their worst nightmare really is that you would,
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:30.640]   you know, have Hulu integrated into a set top box
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:33.400]   that you get from your carrier and then, you know,
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:37.840]   you can just at any time come home and watch reruns
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:41.160]   where they reduced ad rate with cheaper ads
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:42.760]   that they weren't able to place as easily.
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:45.240]   So it's kind of what some of the tech savvy among us
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:48.560]   already doing with, you know, Rokus and, you know,
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:52.840]   DIY boxes and stuff, but it would be a smart ploy
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:55.920]   if they could figure out some way to make peace with everybody.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:58.440]   - So if they could buy Hulu and they could preload it
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:02.480]   on their Motorola tablets and they could preload it
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.640]   on Google TV unless they want to block themselves
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:07.240]   and to basically be jerked to themselves
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:08.480]   like has been going on,
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:09.600]   do you know what's your opinion on this?
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:12.400]   Do you think Google, the fact that they want
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.800]   all these conditions to buy Hulu,
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:16.080]   do you think they're actually still a serious competitor?
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.800]   Because I mean, they want exclusive deals for a long term
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:21.200]   and that seems like something that the content companies
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.240]   just don't want to give them.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.240]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:25.080]   I don't know.
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:28.680]   I would love to see Hulu kind of come down to their Google
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:31.000]   umbrellas that keep their name and get integrated
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.160]   to my Google TV.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.000]   I'm one of the, you know, one of the 10 people
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.720]   who actually has Google TV and uses it.
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.080]   So I'd love to see that happen.
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:39.160]   I don't know.
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:40.000]   I don't know.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.560]   - Yeah, I mean, the other thing about keeping them separate
[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:44.160]   is that it makes it a little clearer.
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:46.760]   That Hulu is where you go to watch TV
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:51.680]   and YouTube is where you go to watch user generated video,
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:52.880]   even though that's not actually the case.
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:56.480]   Well, can anyone remember, what's the name of the partner,
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:57.800]   the music, the music, the music?
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:58.640]   - Vivo.
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:50:59.480]   - Vivo.
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:00.320]   - Vivo.
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:01.160]   - Vivo.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:03.240]   - So it could be a Vivo situation where it comes in
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:06.280]   and it's like Hulu branded and it, but it's in Google.
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:09.600]   But in ways it does make, I think, still a lot of sense
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:12.160]   to keep Hulu as a separate entity.
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:14.240]   - Kind of do too.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.960]   - But who knows?
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:20.640]   Because there's also the issue of YouTube in a way
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:23.600]   that a lot of Google products aren't, has a really, really,
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:26.240]   or like Google+ I'm sure trying to get to be,
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:29.440]   it has a really strong community.
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:31.760]   YouTube comments aside, like it's a very,
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:33.480]   very active social network.
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:39.320]   So you could see one integrate the social aspects of YouTube,
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:42.720]   but then also they have competing networks like Google+
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:45.080]   that I'm sure they kind of want to get to become
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:49.040]   the de facto network of their various properties.
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:52.120]   So who knows?
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:52.960]   - Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:56.480]   You can rent and buy or stream movies and TV
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:59.520]   from the Android market now, right, to your Android device.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:02.080]   And then, and I still, it's true, I still associate YouTube
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:05.000]   with kitten videos from Japan or whatever,
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.760]   user-generated videos.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:09.240]   So it would be interesting to see how they fit Hulu in.
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:13.280]   I think that, yeah, I think that you're right,
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:15.240]   it'd be interesting to see, I would like to see
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:16.680]   Google have a property that's like,
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:18.800]   this is where I go to, you know, to watch TV
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:23.480]   or to even rent or buy episodes.
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:24.600]   - I just want to, I want Google to buy
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:26.240]   just because of the irony aspect of this.
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:29.040]   I mean, Hulu was created to kill all this piracy
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.840]   on YouTube, all our content's being stolen,
[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:31.760]   nobody's going to watch us,
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.320]   we're going to create our own thing.
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:34.920]   And we're going to kill YouTube.
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:36.400]   Yeah, no, you didn't, you didn't kill YouTube,
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:38.040]   you're going to get bought by YouTube.
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:39.200]   That I think would just be kind of funny
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.160]   to see in the long run.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:42.520]   But I'm kind of curious about, considering how Google,
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:44.880]   also, back to what Adam was talking about
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:47.320]   when it comes to the whole social aspect of Hulu.
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:49.400]   I mean, the fact that you can use Facebook Connect with it.
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:52.040]   I mean, Google and Facebook haven't exactly been pals
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:53.880]   and Google wants to scrape Facebook's data,
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:55.560]   you know they do, I mean, Facebook's got to deal
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:56.560]   with Bing about it.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:59.320]   I wonder if they would do it, if they did buy Hulu,
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:02.000]   if they would try to continue that relationship
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.680]   with Facebook, where they just change the button
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.920]   to sign in with Google Plus,
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:06.680]   or sign in with a Google account.
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:09.040]   It could be an interesting kind of back door way
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:12.120]   to get into a relationship with Facebook if they wanted.
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:14.120]   Because, I mean, real time search and social search
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:16.360]   is, I think that's a big deal.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:19.040]   You know, what your friends think is kind of a big deal.
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:20.280]   Anyone have any thoughts on the idea
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:22.200]   of Google working with Facebook via Hulu?
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:26.280]   Oh God, all your IDs do block us, right?
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.600]   (laughing)
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:31.240]   The utopia would be then that I could share
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:34.600]   Hulu watching habits with my close friends circle,
[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:36.080]   and nobody else can see them.
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:38.880]   Because an incident recently where my wife and I
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:41.080]   share Hulu account and a lot of people think
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:42.920]   I like Grace and Abby now, so.
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:43.960]   (laughing)
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:44.800]   Would really like--
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.640]   Do you know you like Grace, Kevin, come on.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.080]   I watch it over the laptop.
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:49.640]   I'm doing work, Gina.
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:50.480]   Wow.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:51.320]   The fear of showing up.
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:52.160]   Wow, Liz is watching it.
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:53.880]   My obsession with Hell's Kitchen,
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:57.080]   even though it's the same episode, every single episode,
[00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:59.760]   I'll watch all seven seasons over and over again,
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:02.520]   or nine seasons, I guess that could be embarrassing.
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:05.360]   Maybe I should disconnect that kind of thing.
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:06.640]   It's kind of like what's Spotify.
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:10.520]   I make sure that my information is not going on Facebook.
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:12.760]   Oh yeah, sometimes we talk about Facebook on this show.
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:14.720]   Facebook launched an iPad app.
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:15.560]   Is everyone excited?
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:17.480]   'Cause I heard it's not very good.
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:18.880]   Just crashes over and over again.
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:19.880]   You know, you tried out the Facebook app.
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:21.680]   You liked it or you didn't like it.
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:25.280]   Because I heard it's crashing all the time.
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:26.280]   I liked it.
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:27.280]   And I was really relieved.
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:29.560]   The only iOS device I have is an iPad.
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:33.720]   So I get really, really kicked off when apps don't,
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:36.120]   you know, that are in 2X, that small little frames.
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:38.400]   So I feel same way about Google+.
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:39.880]   So I liked it.
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:41.120]   I haven't spent a lot of time on it.
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:42.640]   'Cause I'm not a huge Facebook person,
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:44.200]   but I do like to pop in once in a while.
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:47.680]   So I haven't had too much crashing happening,
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:49.640]   but I'm a casual Facebook user.
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:50.480]   I love it.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:53.680]   Is anyone else just waiting for the Google+ official iPad app?
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:55.840]   Or is the Google, I think the web app's really good.
[00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:57.680]   I mean, I don't even know if there's a need for,
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:00.400]   other than the fact if you just wanna have a dedicated icon
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:02.000]   you can get from the app store.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.400]   I mean, do you guys think there's a reason
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:06.440]   not that Facebook has gone ahead and made
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:08.960]   and finally made their iPad app official?
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:11.600]   Will Google actually come out with Google+ iPad app soon?
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:14.440]   Or are they going to, I don't know, maybe do that for
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:15.880]   Honeycomb or Ice Cream Sandwich
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:18.520]   if they're ready to have those things?
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:21.560]   - It's probably a little bit lower on there to do list
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:23.120]   for Google+ I imagine.
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.680]   You know, in terms of things they wanna fix
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:26.640]   and things that wanna get in place.
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.200]   Facebook took a long time with their iPad app
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:30.160]   and it's not like people started quitting over it.
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:31.360]   I mean, to my knowledge?
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:37.800]   - Yeah, and I actually don't imagine,
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:42.000]   I can't imagine it making,
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.760]   they're not hurrying most of the time to the iPhone stuff,
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:49.440]   but I could see very easily an Android tablet version
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:50.440]   of Google+.
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:53.480]   - Yeah, that's definitely gonna happen.
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:56.000]   That's no doubt gonna happen pretty soon.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   You know, the thing is, the reason why I want the iPad app
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.400]   for Google+ is that the account switching gets kind
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:03.240]   of like wonky for me, I'm a Google apps user primarily
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:05.520]   but I switch to my new vanilla Gmail account
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:08.800]   to login and plus which is the whole other annoying thing
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:11.280]   about plus if they don't support apps users yet.
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:12.560]   So the way that gets gonna funky for me.
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:16.520]   So I really like to just have a native app to log into on my iPad
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:19.400]   but I think they're gonna probably release the honeycomb
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:22.080]   slash Ice Cream Sandwich tablet layout version
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:24.800]   of the Google+ app first.
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:26.120]   - Yeah.
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:28.960]   - Let's thank another one of our sponsors, Vast.
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:31.480]   Now, this episode of Twig is brought to you by Vast.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:33.440]   Vast conference is the ultimate in professionalism,
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:35.600]   clarity and flexibility for your conference calls,
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:38.120]   all at a low price for two Vast conference calls.
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:40.080]   You can try that out, we'll explain some more about it
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.440]   before you go try it out.
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:42.280]   I feel like most of us,
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:44.960]   and you want to try to be professional in your business,
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:46.160]   professionalism really begins
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:47.800]   with those all important conference calls
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:48.920]   because you don't want some weird,
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:50.840]   VoIPy, Skypey thing happening
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:54.040]   while you're actually on a call with a prospective client.
[00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:57.320]   So what makes a call professional, a dial in number.
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:59.160]   You know, some people, they don't want to just have to sign
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:00.720]   up for an account and do an audio thing.
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:04.480]   You can have a dial in number that give out for calls
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:06.680]   at a moment's notice, clear connections when you
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:09.920]   and your participants dial in, the popping delays of VoIP,
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:11.280]   yeah, that doesn't happen on Vast.
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:16.280]   And for large calls, you can manage call participants online.
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:18.120]   Now, I want to tell you about a company
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:19.760]   that's put it all together and that's Vast.
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:22.200]   Vast conference is a professional, affordable
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:23.680]   and quite advanced.
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:26.640]   It enables you to quickly connect two or more callers
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:27.720]   on the phone.
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:30.640]   Many conference calls have three to five participants
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:35.640]   but get this, Vast supports up to 300 callers at once.
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:38.080]   So if you wanted to have some kind of like giant
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:40.240]   conference call, Vast can handle that.
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:42.440]   They give you both a regular dial in number
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:45.400]   and a toll free number and you use these to set up calls
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:46.320]   at any time.
[00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:49.800]   Vast calls are clear because they are using fiber optic lines
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:51.840]   and high end teleconferencing equipment,
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:54.160]   something you just can't get from VoIP.
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:56.600]   Vast includes a well designed conference call
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:59.560]   management interface which you can use on their website
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:01.400]   to manage your users and callers.
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:03.360]   And for large calls, you can even have a question
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:05.520]   and answer session, it'll be right on the website.
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:08.000]   You can record calls as MP3.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.960]   So let's say you want to just use it as a podcasting tool,
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:14.560]   you could even do that, have people call in as your guests,
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:16.120]   you can use Vast for this kind of thing
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:17.560]   because it'll record an MP3 for you.
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:19.600]   So that's doing all the work for you.
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:21.800]   You can also access detailed usage tracking
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:23.680]   and billing codes for internal accounting
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:25.320]   if that's what you're using this for.
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:28.200]   Vast also comes with a friendly, very, very friendly
[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:30.880]   and enthusiastic customer service team.
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:32.640]   They call it above and beyond customer service
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:34.600]   and they're right to call it that.
[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:37.520]   The pricing for this professional conference service is low,
[00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:40.320]   it's pay as you go, 2.5 cents per minute
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:42.280]   for regular toll calls and six cents per minute
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:43.680]   for 800 number calls.
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:45.920]   You decide whether to give out a regular call in
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:46.880]   or a toll free number.
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:48.920]   So your rate will vary depending on what number
[00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:49.760]   you give them.
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:51.280]   Sign up is fast and easy
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:53.240]   and there are no commitments or contracts

[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:24.240]   You can go out there and have conference calls
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:27.080]   with just everybody for a very low rate.
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:30.280]   We thank Vast conference for their support of TWIG
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:32.880]   and now it's time for Gina's tip.
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:37.240]   - My tip, it's a really simple one this week.
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:39.560]   But it's something that I use all the time.
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:43.200]   I constantly use Google as a dictionary to define words.
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:45.760]   You can use the define keyword in the Google search box
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:48.000]   to get definitions right in the Google One Box,
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.960]   which is a little bits of information
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:53.440]   that give you your answer right away, like weather and flights.
[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:54.480]   They added synonyms.
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:56.520]   This made the writer and me really happy.
[00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:58.720]   They added synonyms to the definitions One Box.
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:02.240]   So if you do something like, if you say like define, obviate,
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:04.160]   you get the definition of the verb
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.520]   and then you get synonyms.
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.240]   Avoid, prevent, evade, avert.
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:12.160]   So when you're looking for a word other than awesome
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:14.080]   or something that gets overused,
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.000]   you can get that straight in the One Box
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.240]   in Google search results by using the definition tool.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.440]   And I mentioned this earlier today,
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:21.160]   but I also noticed this is new to me,
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:23.800]   but they're including the number of circles
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:27.960]   that authors of web pages are in in search results.
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:30.360]   So if you search for something that Adam authored
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:33.000]   at Life Hacker, for example, you can see how many circles
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.680]   he's in on Google+ if he has that information public
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:37.520]   on his profile.
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:38.520]   So that's kind of interesting too.
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:40.800]   So Google search results getting a little better.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:41.640]   - That seems really cool.
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:43.680]   I used, as Google is a dictionary,
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:46.400]   far too often than I'd like to admit,
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.640]   but synonyms would be nice too.
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:51.120]   But yeah, the circles thing, that's a cool little feature.
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.280]   Normally we have Jeff Jarvis with a number,
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:56.960]   but we are gonna throw that number segment to Kevin.
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.840]   - Okay, stop me if you've heard this number before,
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:02.560]   but I don't think so.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:06.880]   44% and that is the number of searches
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:08.920]   for last minute holiday gifts that Google says
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:11.040]   will be made on mobile devices.
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:13.640]   It's a little bit of a trick number
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:15.360]   because in some ways they're kind of saying
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:20.560]   that 44% of all searches around the holidays will be mobile.
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:23.200]   And so therefore you can kind of fudge the numbers
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.360]   that way to make it look like that.
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:26.640]   But they also have some other interesting numbers
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:29.440]   in a post-dated recently on their mobile blog
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:31.960]   where they found that basically the tablet buying,
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.040]   the tablet audience, the people who are shopping
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:37.000]   for holiday gifts on their tablets are 45% likely
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.240]   to buy before Thanksgiving and 17% likely to buy
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.560]   after Thanksgiving on Black Friday.
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:45.560]   If smartphone buyers though, they're only 34% likely
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.720]   to buy before Thanksgiving and 35% likely
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.080]   to buy after Thanksgiving.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.560]   So Google is telling you iPad owners
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:55.760]   that you're doing great, you're ahead of the curve,
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.800]   you're totally on top of your holiday shopping
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:02.000]   or smartphone buyers, we're on Amazon and Newegg on Friday
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.840]   trying to fill in the last of our list.
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:05.920]   That's not really what they're saying.
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:08.440]   But there's a lot of interesting statistics
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:12.600]   about mobile use and shopping on Google's mobile blog,
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.040]   I believe.
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:15.640]   - Not to put you on the spot, Adam,
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:16.600]   but do you happen to have a tip?
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.800]   But considering you're at life after you might actually
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:20.440]   have one at the top of your head.
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:22.080]   If you don't, don't worry about it.
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:27.600]   It's a secret tip.
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:30.040]   It's quiet, we can't hear it, it's muted.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:33.040]   It must be shattering.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:34.440]   (laughing)
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:35.960]   - There it goes, there it goes, okay.
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:37.840]   Otherwise, I was ready for charades, I was gearing up.
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:38.680]   Okay.
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:41.120]   - Okay, so I didn't know if there was gonna be a number today.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:43.560]   So just now I scrambled and I have a very good one.
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.920]   So I'm gonna piggyback on the number.
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:46.760]   - Go for it.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:50.520]   - Oh, earlier this week, Google released
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:53.240]   the Chrome Remote Desktop extension,
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:56.120]   which you install on your Chrome browser
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:58.640]   and someone else installs on their Chrome browser
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:01.200]   and you can remotely control their desktop
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.720]   using just Chrome.
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:05.920]   You basically give them a code that's generated
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:07.520]   when you launch the extension.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:09.560]   They paste it into their browser
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:12.120]   and then they can control your entire desktop.
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:13.840]   It's a remote desktop thing.
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:19.120]   19.1 is the number of megabytes
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.160]   that the extension download is,
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:24.440]   which is I think probably the biggest extension
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.480]   I've ever installed.
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.480]   - But that's like a third of them.
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:28.320]   - Well, it works pretty well.
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.520]   - That's a big part of a Chromebook hard drive.
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.240]   - It works really well.
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:35.240]   And the Chromebook hard drives like what, like eight megabytes?
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:37.080]   So I don't know if it's only gonna fit.
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:40.920]   - I've seen the original tester unit I thought
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:43.920]   I saw numbers saying it was like 85, 65 megs or something.
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:47.120]   So yeah, that would be about a third of your hard drive.
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:50.680]   - And I like that the extension needs all the data
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:52.880]   on your computer and all the websites that you visit.
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.200]   It's like, just give us everything if you wanna use that.
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:58.600]   - It's a very, those app access things are very daunting.
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.360]   Now we've seen very scary.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:03.680]   Yeah, I mean, if you want access for anything,
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:05.640]   like if you do a script that wants to read anything
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:09.560]   on any page, then it's all your tabs
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:12.880]   and browsing and data on your stuff.
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.800]   - And some ways for the Chrome remote extension,
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:17.520]   the permission should just be your computer.
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:18.520]   - Right, just install this.
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:22.560]   - And guess what, someone's gonna have your computer.
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.400]   - Listen to being honest,
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.120]   just say you don't wanna know.
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:26.680]   - Right.
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:28.160]   - Just if you trust us, do it.
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:29.640]   If you don't, just don't.
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.400]   - There's a new Yula, trust us.
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:32.240]   - Trust us.
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:33.640]   - Capitalism's a dirty world kid.
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.560]   - And I've got a tool for you guys.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:38.160]   It's for Google Chrome.
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:42.040]   Now I don't like putting extensions that affect Google Plus
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:44.440]   because it's not fully rolled out still.
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:47.200]   I mean, back then it was in a private,
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:48.040]   what do they call it,
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.840]   a thing, field testing or something like that.
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:53.080]   And so I finally got an addition for Google Plus
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:54.600]   and this is for Google Chrome.
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:56.880]   It hides the Google Plus notification.
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:00.640]   The actual extension is called hide Google Plus notification.
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:03.800]   And if you're like me, you see that black bar on the top
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:06.200]   of pretty much everything you are using.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.280]   I use Google Docs for everything,
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:10.920]   including my email and the documents for our shows
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.000]   and things are there.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.280]   And I get so easily distracted when that black bar turns red,
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:17.880]   when that tiny little thing turns red.
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:19.840]   So I have to click it and then somebody's written something,
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.480]   I get infuriated and I started going off
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:22.320]   and doing something else.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.200]   And I forgot that I was supposed to be doing work
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.920]   and then forget it.
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:26.840]   What this thing does,
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:29.200]   it actually takes away that little number
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:32.000]   on every property except Google Plus,
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:32.840]   which makes a lot of sense.
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:35.000]   So if you're an email or if you're in a rundown
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.800]   for I don't know a show,
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:39.080]   you won't see that number there anymore.
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:41.040]   So even though there's all kinds of ways
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.400]   to turn off certain notifications,
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.120]   when somebody adds you to a circle,
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.000]   get a little number.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:45.960]   There's two, there's three.
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.920]   Or you forgot about some stupid comments
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.160]   or in my case, some stupid comment I wrote on Google Plus
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.200]   and then people have written something else on there.
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.600]   So now I get to avoid it.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.600]   So I definitely suggest this for those kinds of people
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:58.720]   who just want to see a black bar
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.320]   and only a black bar and no little one.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.920]   - It's really funny 'cause I noticed in your rundown
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:05.760]   when we got to it before that there was no number.
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.600]   - Yeah, we can go, we can go to it right now.
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:10.600]   You can see that it's just my name.
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:14.320]   And but if I went to Plus, it'd be there.
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:16.480]   - It does it also take the number,
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:17.320]   you know what drives me crazy?
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.160]   The fact that the number of notifications shows up
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.360]   in your Google Plus tab title.
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:24.080]   - Oh yeah, that's why you keep that tab closed.
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.000]   - Yeah, so if you have to open the background,
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.080]   you see that you've unread things like on the tab,
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:29.040]   it makes me crazy.
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:31.640]   I actually enabled that for Gmail 'cause that I want,
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:33.000]   but I don't want it for Google Plus.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.800]   So it'd be great if that extension did that too.
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.240]   - Yeah, I think you can turn off the thing
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:40.520]   in Gmail you can, but not in Plus.
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.080]   That should get on that.
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:44.080]   But yeah, on Plus you can actually see the red too.
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:46.160]   I don't know what, let's see what happened
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:47.560]   in my Google Plus.
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:48.680]   Oh, somebody commented on something.
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:49.520]   And that's fine.
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:52.120]   This is the perfect location for where I want notifications.
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:53.800]   Not when I'm in the rundown.
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:57.000]   And I notice, oh look, pithy comments, that's great.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.480]   And that's also why I usually keep Google Plus,
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:02.200]   the tab closed because of what Gina said,
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.320]   there's a little number up there,
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:04.160]   and I don't want to see it
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:05.400]   because then I'll get distracted.
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.240]   'Cause I'm always a child.
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.760]   - They did something pretty incredible
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:10.760]   with that little notification button,
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:13.280]   that number when it flips through,
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:17.040]   when a new comment comes in, you know, like six,
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.160]   and then six is scrolling up and down.
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:24.160]   It is extremely addictive and really, really hard to ignore.
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:27.000]   - I tried to screw it at nine plus for a while
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.160]   because that's the max it does,
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:30.760]   and then you're like, okay, you're hoping that nothing happens.
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.720]   - I'm just pegged at nine, it doesn't wanna change.
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:33.880]   - You just never wanna click it again
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:35.840]   because then you have to keep clicking.
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:39.560]   It's like a disorder, I think, Google Plus Disorder.
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:43.120]   I think that wraps up this episode.
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:44.640]   Let's plug some things.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:47.000]   Kevin, where can people find you on the internet?
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.160]   - Okay, I'm Kevin Perdy on Twitter.
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:56.240]   And I'm on Google Plus as well, just Kevin Perdy.
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:59.760]   And let's see, the completeandroidguide.com,
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.480]   and most recently, there's a link here on the screen,
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:06.320]   but bit.ly/gplusmm spelled out.
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.000]   That's the link to the O'Reilly book
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.120]   I'm writing right now, Google Plus, the missing manual,
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:13.760]   which should be out just after the holidays,
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:15.680]   maybe before them, who knows?
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:17.280]   - Well, the back of the book have a URL,
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:19.960]   which has updates to the book.
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:24.960]   - Indeed, Google Plus is nothing if I'm moving target
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:27.400]   as I revise every chapter five times.
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:30.920]   So, yeah, we'll also on the missing CD page,
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:32.520]   we'll have all that stuff you should expect
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:34.120]   from O'Reilly products.
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.760]   - That's great, because there's a lot of things
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:37.880]   on Google Plus, and unless you spend all day in there,
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:38.880]   you won't be able to find.
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:41.080]   So, good on you for writing that.
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:41.920]   How about you, Adam?
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.880]   I know you're at lifehacker.com, any other things?
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:48.880]   - Yeah, I'm Adam Pash on Twitter, same on Google Plus.
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:53.080]   Let's see, Gina and I wrote a book,
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:55.320]   co-wrote a book, it's the Lifehacker book.
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:58.000]   It's, you can go to lifehackerbook.com,
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.320]   and yeah, I think that's probably good.
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:02.160]   - What if people wanna see you in video form?
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:03.200]   Maybe if you just like that.
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:08.040]   - Oh, I think you could go to YouTube.com/lifehacker
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.960]   for all the latest, or check us out
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:13.240]   on revision3.com/lifehacker.
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:14.920]   - That's awesome, and Gina,
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:18.760]   would you like to plug anything beyond smarterware?
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:20.480]   - Actually, I just released a new version
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:22.160]   of the software that I work on called ThinkUp.
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:23.600]   If you go to thinkupapp.com,
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.360]   it's a social media analytics tool,
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:28.160]   so, and we just added Google Plus support,
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:31.200]   and our last beta, which came out two days ago.
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:33.400]   So, you can archive, you can capture an archive
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:35.160]   all your Google Plus posts, your Facebook posts,
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:37.480]   your Twitter posts, and you can analyze conversations,
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:39.120]   get like work frequency graphs,
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.960]   and export your tweets to CSV,
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:43.360]   so you can do all kinds of cool,
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:46.080]   you can plot your tweets on a map.
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:48.240]   But this is the best beta ever,
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:50.040]   so if you've been thinking about trying out ThinkUp,
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:52.080]   and I know a lot of Twig listeners have,
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.000]   now's the time to do it,
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.840]   'cause the latest beta is probably the best it's ever been.
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:57.880]   - Yeah, if you've circled Gina in Google Plus,
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:59.040]   you would've known this already,
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:00.480]   so you should be following everybody,
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:02.520]   'cause I'm sure everyone is explaining this.
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:03.720]   Is it circled, is it followed,
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:05.640]   what's the actual verbage?
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:06.480]   - I've been saying it's circled.
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:08.280]   - Oh my head does not think that it's encircled.
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:09.120]   I'll just tell you that.
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:10.400]   - Not encircled.
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.400]   - It's not encircled.
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:13.200]   - Nobody thinks that's cute or funny.
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:14.760]   - That's what I'm confusing.
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:15.680]   (laughing)
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:17.200]   - You were lassued, that's what it was.
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:18.040]   - No.
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:19.200]   - It was like a corral.
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:20.960]   Okay, so next week, Leo will be back,
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:22.600]   so you can watch this show,
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:24.760]   this week in Google with more Leo LaPorte,
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:27.120]   100% more Leo LaPorte next week.
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:30.920]   Thanks for watching this episode with Host by Me.
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:31.760]   Bye.
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.340]   (upbeat music)
[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:36.920]   (upbeat music)
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:49.100]   - All right, I have to go pull some beats out of the oven,
[01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:51.060]   which is not a euphemism.
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:52.700]   (laughing)
[01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:54.420]   Pull some beats out of the oven.
[01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:55.260]   - That's yeah.
[01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:56.540]   - And it takes to roast beats,
[01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:59.220]   like an hour and a half, it's a long time, so.
[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:00.060]   - I did not know that.
[01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:03.180]   - Yeah, no, it was exactly the length of one twig,
[01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:04.540]   so thank you all very much.
[01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:05.780]   (laughing)
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:06.620]   - Thanks Kevin.
[01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:07.460]   - That's why he was on.
[01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:08.300]   - See you Kevin.
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:09.140]   - Bye Kevin.
[01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:09.980]   (beep)
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:10.860]   I'm actually making TNT late.
[01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:11.700]   This is interesting,
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.100]   'cause I don't know what we were even talking about.
[01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:14.100]   Okay.
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:17.460]   And.
[01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:19.180]   - I'll just show kittens and bowls.
[01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:20.020]   There we go, why wait?
[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:21.020]   - Kittens and bowls.
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:23.260]   (laughing)
[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:24.260]   - I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:26.540]   (cheering)
[01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:29.300]   - Okay, so there's a,
[01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:32.460]   there's the, this is twig thing,
[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:33.300]   the recorded thing,
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:34.420]   and then there's the teas,
[01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:35.860]   and then there's the billboard, right?
[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:36.700]   - Yep.
[01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:37.540]   - Okay, so.
[01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:38.380]   (beep)
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:39.220]   All kinds of fun sky faces today.
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:40.060]   - We are.
[01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:42.260]   - Skyp is, I'm just noticing that we're having some issues
[01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:44.340]   with our connection here.
[01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:47.740]   And noticing that the video is,
[01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:50.380]   or load times for the internet is slow,
[01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:51.780]   so I don't know if that's--
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:53.460]   - We've done roping the internet.
[01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:55.620]   Or wait, you know what, it's probably iOS 5.
[01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:56.460]   - It's iOS 5.
[01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:57.460]   - It was downloading iOS 5.
[01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:58.460]   - Stop downloading iOS 5.
[01:11:58.460 --> 01:11:59.780]   - Stop downloading iOS 5.
[01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:02.620]   And, and lie in 10.7.2 and--
[01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:03.620]   (laughing)
[01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:04.460]   - Stop downloading iOS 5.
[01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:06.220]   - And I choose 10.5, come on, guys.
[01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:08.100]   We're trying to run a network here.
[01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:09.340]   - Oh, God, sorry.
[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:11.660]   So I thought that Kevin, are you, are you--
[01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:13.220]   - Kevin's back.
[01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:14.060]   - I think.
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:14.900]   - Frame is better.
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:15.820]   - Frame rates better.
[01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:16.660]   - Okay.
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:17.660]   - Yeah, everybody was siloing.
[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:19.060]   Everybody was freezing.
[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:20.260]   Sorry about that.
[01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:24.420]   So I'm gonna do that.
[01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:26.700]   Okay.
[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:28.500]   You don't wanna see that, but anyways.
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:29.340]   - Cut that part too.
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:30.460]   - Yeah, okay, there you go.
[01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:31.620]   - You got that editor, whoever's edit--
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:33.220]   Who edits this show?
[01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:34.380]   - Tony.
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:35.820]   - Tony, we love you.
[01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:36.820]   - Thank you, Tony.
[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:39.220]   We do love you.
[01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:40.580]   - And now we resume the show.
