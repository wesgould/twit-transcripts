[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.680]   cover the latest news from everybody but Google. Aunt Pud is here. He is from Hands on Photography
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.240]   and Hands on Wellness. It's great to see you at How you doing Aunt? Unbelievable Miss Le Port.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.960]   You're self? I feel great. I feel good. You're still wearing the Clemson orange.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.320]   Because no this is just another random orange t-shirt but the Clemson is always back there.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.440]   That hat behind. It's an orange or orange. Darker orange. Because don't they start pretty soon?
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.440]   Oh we started this past weekend. Last week. First victory over Wake Forest. Very nice. Very nice.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.960]   Aunt is a hardcore Clemson booster. Yep. Do you drive around town with a Clemson flag flapping
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:38.000]   on your car like that? It is what it is. I can't help it. They just automatically pop up on my car
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.560]   every Friday. Are there other people around here or do you feel kind of like an outsider now?
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:52.480]   No. The brand has grown. So when I stop at a red light or something like that I get people
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.520]   hocking at me. Because they've never seen it of course but they recognize it and I think it's
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.000]   oh I'll go tie. That's nice. That's nice.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.200]   Hold that tie guy. Hold that tie guy. That is the only person on the panel besides me who
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.440]   knows that song Mr. Jeff Jarvis because he was around in the 20s.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.240]   Listen around in the 20s. Wait a minute.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.320]   Did you just stick with me? Felt like I was the kids.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.920]   Yeah no I'm just teasing you. He's the director of the townite center for entrepreneurial journalism
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.240]   at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:39.200]   There's his title and buzzmachine.com. He's lower in half. How are you Jeff? What's the weather like
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:46.640]   in lower Bedminster? Beautiful beautiful sunny little bit of clouds so it's nice and cool.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.520]   No breeze. No smoke in the air. No water on the ground. Nothing about that.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.240]   We got the first fresh air in three weeks here. Really nice. That's because we
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:05.360]   fresh with air quotes around the air. Yeah it's only 50. We sent all the smoke up north to Stacey
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.760]   Higginbotham's neck of the woods. Stacey from Stacey on IOT.com in the great Pacific Northwest.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.080]   Hi Stacey. Where you can smoke meat in the backyard.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:21.040]   Yeah I thought about it. Actually it's funny because at first I thought oh the air quality is too
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.400]   bad to run my smoker last weekend. And then I realized well no that's actually just what you
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.760]   want. Maybe a little more eucalyptus than oak but it's okay. It's okay.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.200]   So there's a lot to talk about this week. A lot to talk about. Google
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:43.280]   sent out invites for their event. It's September 30th. We'll be covering it streaming it live.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:53.680]   They say the Pixel 5, a new Chromecast and a new smart speaker will be in. I think you can
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.440]   pretty much count those out. These are done with that stuff. Yeah that's not happening.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:06.960]   Yeah. Bye. That's a Wednesday. So it's going to actually be perfect. We'll do Windows weekly
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.800]   earlier because it's 11 AM Pacific. Normally that's when Windows weekly is so we'll do that
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.040]   earlier and then we'll do the Pixel event and then we'll follow it up with this weekend Google.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.880]   So we can comment it. Launch night in. Get it. Your couch is the best seat in the house.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.720]   All about. They even said Google no longer tries to be cagey at all.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.640]   Right. We know you know. Someone's going to leak this. We're going to stick it up on our product page.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:41.680]   Let's just tell them what it is. In fact there was a teaser video of the Google smart speaker.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:49.200]   Some months ago. Let me see if I can find that where they showed this thing which looks like
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:58.400]   kind of a lozenge. So I gather it's just an interesting descriptor sir. Yeah. Looks like a
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.400]   giant. What was that gum that would squirt in your mouth? It looks like that. Right. Yeah.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:13.760]   So they actually last summer. Let me see if I could find the video. There was a teaser video
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:21.120]   and the guys got this speaker. He's obviously a Google employee and or no. He's sitting and
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.600]   working on his desk and his daughter comes and says, Dad, what's this? Here I'll show you. I
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.640]   think I could show you that. Well, I get in trouble for showing the video. Only with Carson.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:37.920]   Right. So if you look, people are dancing and hearing music, but you don't.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:47.040]   The speaker is so subtle and notice their stereo pairs. So that's good. Yeah.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:57.040]   Did you get that? What is this for? She says, Dad, what is this for? And she's holding the speaker.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.160]   So it's not a big tank like the previous speaker. Well, and there were rumors that Apple's going
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.000]   to announce a smaller version of the HomePod as well. I think maybe people are realizing,
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.040]   I actually love my Google Home Max, which is their big Google Home speaker. And I think it sounds
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:17.520]   great. It sounds really good. But I think they're realizing people don't have room or don't want
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.280]   giant speakers. So maybe these little, but can we make these little speakers sound good is the
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:27.600]   question. Mm hmm. I'm in the market for so I'm eagerly awaiting this because I'm in the market
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:35.840]   for a speaker because I have this huge open plan area that covers a lot of the downstairs area.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:42.880]   And so I'm like, Echo Studio, or do I put these guys at night? I don't know. I don't know.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.600]   I don't know. What about your, you have these little nature speakers. No more Sonos. That's
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.520]   it. It's over for me. No more Sonos. I'm breaking down with Sonosys. I actually,
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.880]   it's just a nightmare. They've sent me emails saying, could we, can we help? I don't want special
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.680]   treatment. They, they, what happened is they have a new series of Sonos stuff, the move,
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.800]   anything in the last couple of years to play the new play five. But those are not compatible
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:12.240]   with the old play fives, which I have a lot. So I finally gave up because I was using two apps.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.400]   It was two different Sonos networks. It's no good. Yeah, it's not cool. It's not cool. I took all
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.440]   the play fives out. I'm going to give him to my son. He can be all play old school and I'll be new,
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.560]   new cool. And, but then I thought about it and I said, I don't really need to buy any more Sonos
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:31.600]   because the one thing that made Sonos so great was the multi-room play. Everything does that now.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:38.000]   Right. I don't really need it. I was looking at a, is it the play bar?
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.040]   Yes. I have a play bar. I have the old one and the new one. And those, by the way,
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:51.680]   we're going to do work. Yeah. Well, we have, I'm not going to justify my fancy lifestyle to anyone.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.760]   I don't know why you know, job is for the job. Yeah, that's it.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:04.080]   Actually, we do this. The studio is wired with Sonos because I think at one point,
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.680]   when we moved into the old studio, they gave us, do they get how many do they give us John?
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.720]   A few seven, seven play fives. Oh, wow.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:19.840]   Eight, one play three and six play fives, seven play fives and one play three. Why did they give
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.720]   us one play three? And they bought a brick and everything. So they were, they're obviously fans.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:31.920]   And I'm sorry, Sonos, but time has marched past you. Right. IOT Stacy, right? It happens.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:43.520]   Yeah. Oh, so wistful. Well, I love. I was a fan. That's two. Yeah. But now you can do it with
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:48.400]   it. Oh, well. Yeah. In fact, I looked at it because I thought, well, I also took out two of the Sonos
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.600]   Connects, those are old school. That's what I would connect Sonos to my stereo, right? So I have a nice
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.920]   stereo. I want to use those speakers. They're better than the Sonos speakers. So you get a little
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:03.360]   box and I priced the new box is like three hundred four hundred bucks. It's like, no, I'm going to buy
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:09.360]   that. I already have an Apple TV. I just I can play through that. I could play through the Google
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:14.320]   and Echo Dot. All of these will play fine and they'll do multi room sync. So I think the time
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:19.040]   it's time to move on. It is good, though. I we've talked about this before, separate the speaker
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:25.040]   from the smarts. That's what happened with Sonos is they couldn't keep up. The old old stuff didn't
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:30.080]   have enough. Although I will say this, people are like, Oh, you've got to separate the speaker
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:36.080]   from the smarts because speakers are expensive as as I discovered with the hue updates.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:42.000]   You know, you still have to buy like a $60. Right. HUB. Right. And so people are it's not like
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.480]   people are like, Oh, I don't have to replace all my light bulbs. No, they're like, Oh, crap. Now I
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.440]   got to spend 60 bucks in a new hub just so my light bulbs work. We should mention this whole
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:56.800]   smart things. Stacey right now is on a hamster run internet service.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:04.720]   Yeah, I'm I don't know why it's so bad. Well, it's not okay. You still glow. She's getting
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:12.720]   municipal internet fiber in the next couple of weeks, which is kind of cool.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.320]   It'll be super cool. But until then,
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.880]   stuck with my Barbara Walters, you know, pass filter.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:26.160]   It's more Max Hadron than Barbara Walters, but okay, we'll take
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:34.400]   with with Google, not necessarily talking about pixel books that are our Chromebooks all together,
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.040]   just going by by. I mean, I noticed
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.400]   your mouth out, young man. What's your
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.680]   Chromebooks are bigger than every such a thought Chromebooks are bigger than every
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.280]   Google's just for some reason, not not making them anymore. Why not?
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:52.640]   The problem is, well, because I think they think the market's taken over or whoever was the person
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.880]   there, you know, who loved them, doesn't love them as much. I don't know. My problem is that
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:02.480]   every time that one comes out, I read Kevin Tofel religiously on this, and I'll see a machine and
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:06.240]   think, oh, maybe. And then it says fan. It says fan. And I say, oh,
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.360]   Oh, you don't want to fan with a fan. I don't want to fan. No, I do not.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:17.120]   It just seems like this is a time to offer a device that's affordable, especially with a lot
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:22.480]   of people that have to do education at home. That's right. I mean, I have a device you
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.880]   Google could easily put out something really inexpensive that's just good enough for,
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:33.200]   you know, and as you're you're you're not getting my drift here. You see, I'm it's like Leo in the
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.600]   lifestyle. This is my lifestyle. I want these expensive. I want these expensive Chromebooks.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:44.160]   Yeah. But you would a only person to buy that expensive pixel books. You had like four other
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:50.560]   people. Well, that makes it quite exclusive, sir. I might have one. That's one way to look at it.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.400]   I might have one too. I like them. I actually have owned all of Google's pixel books, except the
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:13:00.560]   most recent the go the one that nobody's the nubbies on the bottom. So one of the issues with
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:05.840]   Chromebooks that is being about to be solved is kind of interesting. Chromebooks, I really,
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:11.600]   this is true of any computer have a life cycle at the end of the life you stop getting updates.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:18.160]   Now I have to say, if you get a Chromebook these days, it's usually an eight year cycle. That's not
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:22.960]   bad. I mean, eight years for a Chromebook that you paid 500 or 400 or $300 for us, not bad at all.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.920]   But there is a plain like roast to me. Yes, that's what we're about to tell.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.400]   That's why I put that in there. I need you to explain this. I don't get it.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.440]   LACROS.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:44.800]   And this is a solution that decouples the browser from Chrome OS. So Chrome OS won't get updated.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:50.320]   But why not make sure that Chrome continues because Chrome is going to continue to get updated.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:58.800]   Why not keep Chrome updated? So Google apparently is developing something that's Linux and Chrome
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:06.240]   OS, LACROS. It's an architecture project to decouple the Chrome browser from the Chrome OS
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:13.040]   window manager and system UI. The UI won't get updated. But why can't Chrome? So there's a document.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:21.840]   I gather it's kind of part of the Chromium project. So it's more-- yes, it's Googlers working on it,
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.960]   but it's more an open source project than it is a Google sponsored project.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:36.000]   LACROS can be imagined, they say, and this will resonate for some Linux users. As Linux Chrome
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:45.600]   with more Wayland support, Wayland is the graphics compositor underneath the Windows manager.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.800]   So-- is it a compositor like a compiler?
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:55.200]   No. It's basically the graphics primitives, the software that draws the screen.
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:03.200]   Oh, sorry. I was-- for the GUI. So Wayland is a more modern-- you remember X Windows, right?
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:11.280]   It's an X-org. It's a more modern X-window, or X-org. So it's going to support Wayland.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:17.760]   Chrome OS has a Wayland server implementation called Exosphere. It's used to run Android apps,
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:22.720]   and it's used by Krustini. I wish Kevin were here because he probably be able to explain this
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:29.920]   better than I can. Quick, get him on a horn. But the Exosphere will be the Wayland server.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:36.240]   And so in other words, it basically-- it's decoupling the browser from the UI and the operating system.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.400]   And-- In every Chromebook or an old Chromebook?
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.440]   Well, you wouldn't want to do this in every Chromebook probably. The idea is,
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:51.520]   if your Chromebook goes out of service, then you can extend the life of it. Although--
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:56.960]   Oh, my God. Kevin writes, "I don't think it's to extend the life of older Chromebooks,
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.520]   as others have suggested." Yeah, he was disagreeing with it.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.280]   Yeah. He says, "I'm not sure I agree with him." He says, "I'd like to be wrong on that,
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:07.840]   believe me." It doesn't make sense now since all Chromebooks get approximately eight years of
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:13.040]   software update to support. But a lot of older Chromebooks are almost gone.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:18.880]   It wasn't that long for a while. It makes even less sense when you think about older Chromebooks
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.640]   currently out of their software support window. How would they get the required update to break
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.520]   out of the Chrome browser from Chrome OS? I think it's mainly to help Google better manage work on
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:32.800]   the Chrome browser and get browser updates faster to Chromebooks by making the platform more modular.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.040]   And that certainly would be a benefit if you don't-- because right now with Chrome OS,
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.840]   you update the whole thing, right, Jeff? Yeah. In order to get a new browser, you have to update
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:47.440]   the whole thing. Yeah. Yeah. Because it's so simple. It's easy. Well, Kevin says that's why Chrome OS
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:54.000]   updates are lagging two or three weeks behind Chrome updates because they update the browser and
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.400]   then they have to get all the platform updated. So that makes sense. It's kind of what Google did
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:06.480]   with Android, remember, that by decoupling updates, you make it possible to do incremental
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:13.360]   updates. So he might-- Thank you. He might know more. I gather this one. Why else would you do it?
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:19.760]   It's-- Right. No, those are two-- well, let's put it this way. Both reasons are reasonable.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.760]   Maybe they are both-- Yeah. You know, why they're doing it. That's what-- Yeah. Yeah.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:31.760]   Okay. So enough of that. Thank you for that. I needed that. That was my request to the--
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.520]   La Crosse. Yeah. I was-- I was-- when I saw that I was like, "Herberber?" Herber?
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:42.480]   So, well, for-- Let's see. Do we want to talk about the new meeting stuff, which looks-- Sure.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.160]   By the way, you know what I think my issue is? What? Skype has been just
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.960]   suck and win for me, but like, meet, zoom, all the other platforms are great. So I think part of it
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:57.920]   might just be a Skype issue. Microsoft sabotaging you. In their own backyard. Why is it? I don't know.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.680]   Because everybody else-- Well, that's true. Everybody else we work with, look at this beautiful
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:06.880]   picture of Aunt Pruitt. Well, that's because you're at Skype. Well, I'm-- That's because it's Aunt Pruitt.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:12.480]   I mean, if you were-- If you were Skype, would you mess with Aunt? No.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:20.400]   Oh, I would know that. Stacy's right. I get the best picture on Zoom. I get the next best
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:26.560]   on Skype, and I get the worst on Meet, oddly. Other people have no problem with Meet. I don't
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:31.920]   know why it works that way. Yeah. John, maybe you should try Zoom. I don't know. I don't know.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:37.680]   I don't know. I don't know. Against it. Carston says, "Let's get-- Let's do it." So we could try Zoom.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:43.120]   Well, Carston says, then that's it. Can we get an individual picture? The problem is to try
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:49.920]   Caster, right? That's the problem I think. No, no, no. Because Skype actually-- Actually, you can.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:56.480]   Because you can embed it. I did a conference in Buenos Aires this morning,
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:03.360]   and they embedded it differently. Yeah, you can do stuff with it. So Zoom would run just like
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:08.800]   a Skype does on our machines. On separate, they run on little separate machines, and then those
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:15.280]   are patched into the TriCaster as an input. So the TriCaster doesn't care. So any software could run.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.360]   Or Stacey, for that matter, I always found Iptidl to be more reliable when I was in bad circumstances.
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:26.880]   We tried Iptidl. We didn't like Iptidl. One got-- I think we-- Yeah, we tried that one,
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:32.720]   so that was not as much fun. I worked fine for me because I just wasn't as complaining.
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:39.520]   Well, we'll see when we have fiber. And frankly, I think I look better with my pandemic hair and
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:47.760]   you just can't see my cool earrings, which I never wear. So Google is offering now a special meat
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:55.840]   package, but this is for business. This is expensive. Yeah. But it's neat. And I'm-- and part of this is,
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.880]   what the heck is Google doing with their hardware strategy around enterprises? And
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:10.480]   it just-- because they had-- remember their big whiteboard expensive thing? Yes. And so I'm
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:16.320]   looking at this and looking at them like, what is Google doing? So I was just curious.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.560]   Well, they just want to be able to have some input. They want to do, you know, what Microsoft's
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:26.160]   doing with Teams. They want to do-- they want to be part of the enterprise. So the-- and the other
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.960]   thing is secure, right? That's the first word in the description, the secure video meetings for
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:37.440]   Teams and businesses. So that's an issue. And I think it's always been a concern-- But not for
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:46.080]   Teams. Oh, yeah. Like Microsoft. Lower case T in Teams. But Zoom, everybody's-- remember,
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:50.160]   there's security issues that-- now I think Zoom's probably solved most of those, but there's still--
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.040]   Oh, they're-- they'll stay most on the case. Yeah, they-- yeah. There's still a lingering
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:21:02.800]   doubt about it. So by the way, you can use Skype with meat, but that's another matter.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:12.400]   There's a way to get those two together. So, yeah. But this is really aimed at a business,
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.600]   because you have to buy a considerable amount of hardware for this. This is like--
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.360]   You heard anything-- WebEx conference room or something like that. The Cisco conference room.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.600]   The people like this. It's like your old polycom.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:27.440]   Polycom, right? Yeah, yeah, right. What's the kit that the TV networks are giving to home
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:32.560]   correspondence and home-- I see a lot of WebEx, but I think that's just because Cisco's paying
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:36.000]   for that, right? Because there's a little ad on the little bug and all that.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.400]   Yeah, you see-- What kind of hardware do you think?
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:44.880]   I remember Oprah had a Skype kit that she-- because Oprah was one of the first
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:56.400]   on mainstream to do Skype calls. And I remember seeing it was a-- it was a kind of a Pelican case,
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:01.440]   one of those hard shell cases. And here it is. But this is 10 years ago.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:06.080]   Yeah. The Oprah Skype kit lives. I got it. This is so simple. I'm trying to agree with it.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:12.160]   It's got a special microphone. It's got the camera. I don't know why, frankly,
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:17.840]   CNN isn't doing this. I know they're not, because I still see terrible cameras.
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:23.120]   I see people using their iPhone headphones. I mean-- I know, I know. The other one drives me
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:28.560]   crazy is they lose audio from somebody. They were-- All the time. They should have a phone
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:33.440]   backup. Yeah, all the time they lose audio. Just have the phone line open and have them call,
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.880]   and that would be easy. Yeah. So this is-- So when I got--
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:41.040]   There's this is the Oprah kit. So this was somebody who was going to be on Oprah.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:45.200]   They have picture instructions. You see there's an ethernet cable, hint, hint.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:49.680]   Look at that. They even see a think pad. Look at that. Is that a think pad? That's a think pad.
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:56.240]   They send you everything. So I just got one of these to do a prerecorded speech for an event.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.320]   And my Pelican case had a MacBook Pro. It had actually the Logitech--
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:10.080]   The camera actually currently have the C whatever. And then it had-- Yeah. And then it had two of the
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:15.120]   key lights. So the Elgato-- Oh, nice. It's not ringing. It's not ringing.
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.960]   Not shot, kind of microphone. It looks like a road. So what's interesting about--
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:23.680]   I don't know why-- And you had to send it back, right? After you were done--
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:27.680]   Oh, yeah. Yeah. So they're not losing any money. There's maybe some wear and tear and some risk
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:31.360]   to it. But I think that's-- I don't understand why that was-- There's some contributors who are
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:36.320]   on constantly. And I'm dreading the day when they think that they have to pull everybody back into
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:43.840]   the studio. It's great to get more voices on the spur of the moment, in their habitat. It's easier
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:53.200]   for them. It's more variety of people. And you tweeted something-- What? Stacey's agreed.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.480]   I was just-- Because they used to ask for us-- I don't want to--
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:01.120]   Well, no. When I was at Giga Olm, they used to ask for us to come on shows. And I'm like,
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:05.840]   "Are you kidding me? I've got to write 2,000 words a day just to keep up with my-- I can't take
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:13.040]   your car service to-- Yeah. Austin wastes four hours getting-- Two hours of traffic getting there.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:19.200]   But people could always do it. Certain people like Matthew Ingram could always do it,
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:24.720]   because he only had to write two stories a day. And the rest was better. She said, "Better me."
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:33.920]   Just a little salty. I do think the network's interest to fix this and make it work, because
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:37.680]   you're right. They should do this from now on. This is the new-- No, it makes perfect sense.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:41.440]   And I don't think people mind it. No. They're supposed to be something like right now,
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:46.560]   MSNBC's on my TV, Eddie Glaude Jr., who's brilliant, and Princeton is on. His picture quality is
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:50.880]   much better than it used to be. They must have set up some kind of helping people.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:54.080]   Yeah. I think catching up with us is so funny.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:25:02.240]   Bens Lock, Casey Hunt, but she's an anchor. She had a full teleprompter and monitor screen,
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:10.720]   a three-fer in front of her. A few times I see something on television that's live or whatever.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:14.160]   They actually look a lot better than they did a couple months ago.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:20.000]   Yeah, you're right, Ed. You tweeted something to me the other day, because I was getting
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.560]   eager to try it by phone. And then you said-- Oh, yeah. Tell me about that, Will you?
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:33.440]   Remember last week, my pick of the week was Filament Pro. Their app allowed for clean HDMI
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:39.840]   out. And I wanted to try it out with the Pixel 4. Well, apparently Google disabled that feature
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:45.360]   in the kernel for the Pixel 4. So you can do it on a Samsung device and you can do it on an iPhone.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:51.040]   But if you have a Pixel-- Any generation Pixel. That's my understanding.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:59.360]   I sent it one of those support chats to him and tried to say, "Hey, look, I got this feature.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:05.280]   Why can't I use it? This is a $1,200 phone. It's like, yeah, no, can't do it. It's not available."
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.800]   Google people? Are you watching? Huh? Huh? Come on, Google. You're watching.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:14.480]   Or be your friends. Come on. Come on. There's a new Twitter trend. Zoom call,
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:19.840]   work from home versus reality that I quite enjoy. I'm trying to find the one that I saw the other day.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:25.920]   It looked like she was on a newscast. She had an eyesuit, beautiful background room.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.360]   Oh, yes. I do that one, Nia. Yes.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:34.480]   And then she, to her credit, she's then posted next to a picture from the side view. She's not
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:39.760]   wearing any pants. There's kids toys all over the floor. That was the best.
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.720]   I want to see what's the best. What's the absolute best? Yeah. Yeah.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:47.920]   And the laptop was on a chair with two books on the top of the table. Oh, yeah. It was a table.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:52.720]   You would never know any of this. But see, those of us who work in the biz and knows this,
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:56.400]   know that it's all about framing. That's right.
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:00.800]   You got to know what to show. You don't want to see that.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:06.240]   Yeah. I want to see that. It's very honest. I want to see that. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:14.800]   Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I wish I could find. Oh, yeah. Oh, no. Oh, yeah. I chammer them.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:22.080]   Find it. Jeff, go to Jeff. No. Hold on. Jeff Kossoff responded. Chef. Oh, yeah. I found it.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:26.160]   Gretchen T.G. Gretchen T.G.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:32.880]   C.H. and T.G. She's a Ph.D. in Center for Science and Heart. Oh, yeah.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:41.600]   Yeah. I found it. Gretchen Goldman. This is such a great. So here she is. She's on CNN. Nice shot.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:47.520]   I'd say an 8 and a 10. Yeah. You got some plant. But it's plants.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.680]   God, yeah. And here's the reality.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:57.440]   She's on a chair on a table. She's wearing sandals and shorts.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:04.160]   The kids toys are all over the place. Look at her using that beautifully diffused light
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:08.400]   from that window. And she's smart. She's sitting in a bay window, right? Yeah. Yeah.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:14.000]   She's using it. She doesn't specialize. Jay Kossoff. Isn't that great? That's just great.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:21.120]   I love that. Jay Kossoff. Yeah. That's Jeff Kossoff, the expert in section 230.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:25.360]   Jay Kossoff. No, Joe JK, O.D.LS, E.W.F.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:33.200]   You're never ahead, Jeff Hon. I know. I should get him on. He wrote the 26 words of creative
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:40.000]   internet. He is the expert. Oh, yeah. I love that book. He's brilliant. And he has a tweet.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:47.040]   Yeah. Oh, yeah. I showed this one. Yeah. Yeah. So here he is again on C. I hope this is a new
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:56.960]   trend. I'd like to see everybody show the primary color plastic that adorns their floors.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:04.400]   I like, I actually liked Gretches better because you got to see the full shot, which is great. Yeah.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:09.520]   Yeah. It was a cut-seater, too. It was gutsy. But you know, everybody identifies with it now.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:15.600]   Everybody does. I'm wearing pants. It's good for you. I don't have everybody.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:20.720]   They're still pants. Because not, I mean, but I think a lot of people are doing Zoom calls.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:25.520]   Kids are doing Zoom in school and a lot of parents are doing Zoom calls for work.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:29.200]   So I think a lot of people identify with it. So the latest.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:39.520]   I tick-tock. Oh, geez. Oh, geez. Let me take a break. And then, and then that's not a great
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:42.160]   tease. People go, Oh, good. Thank God. I could skip the tick-tock.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:50.080]   We talk about arm. Do we want to talk about? Oh, yeah. So Sunday, Sunday, which normally,
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:55.680]   there's never breaking news during Twit. We had two big stories break the tick-tock story and
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:00.560]   the Nvidia arm story. So I am very curious what you have to say about that Stacey. So we,
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:06.080]   that is a good tease. We will get Stacey's chip expertise in just a second. Our show today
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:13.920]   literally brought to you by CashFly. CashFly is our CDN, our content delivery network. And they
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:21.680]   have been doing it since 1999. We've been using them. I, it was early on. And I was scrambling to
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:26.800]   get enough bandwidth to serve the podcast. It's not an easy thing to do. It was on a website,
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:32.720]   but that was slow and we tried BitTorrent and that was weird. And we had to beg people to
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:37.760]   seed our content and stuff. Matt Levine of CashFly came to me and said, "Leo, let me help." And he
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:44.160]   did. And we've been doing it ever since, but more than a decade. CashFly is the best way to get
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:53.440]   your content, whether it's a podcast, a game, an app, a website, to your end user faster. Like,
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:31:00.000]   you know, the way it works in the name kind of tells you is your content is cached on servers
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.040]   all over the world. In fact, they've been expanding. Look at all those dots on the map. They've been
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:10.000]   expanding their points of presence. They just had six new points of presence in South America.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.880]   They're serving now 10 times the amount of traffic in Latin America over the last year.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:19.120]   They've not only maintained, but drastically improved their performance in that region while
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:23.760]   taking on a much higher traffic load. So it doesn't matter where your end users are. North America,
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:30.560]   Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Pacific, CashFly is there and your
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:36.720]   customers will get their content directly from the server nearest them, even and hard to reach
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:42.560]   regions. That gives you consistency and performance, not just in the Americas, but everywhere. In fact,
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:47.520]   because of the reliable throughput and scalability, they're up to five times faster than other CVNs.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:52.400]   Now they've solved another problem because, of course, you create the content, you've got to get it
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:58.800]   to CashFly. Any time you get a CashMiss, somebody goes to a server where the content isn't there,
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:05.520]   the server has to go to your origin, download it. That can add up to a lot of money if you're on
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:13.040]   Amazon S3 or some other source. We're on S3. So CashFly has created something called SOS.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:20.960]   Yes, wave the white flag because there is a solution. CashFly's storage optimization system.
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:25.040]   What it is, it's actually a dedicated storage space just for you on CashFly.
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:32.400]   On CashFly. So you'll save thousands a month by shielding your origin. They can guarantee no
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:39.440]   CashMisses. Your download speeds will be dramatically improved. Data transfer out fees will be significantly
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:44.720]   reduced. Pretty much you'll load it on a CashFly once and that's that. With CashFly's SOS,
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:50.480]   you get a 100% cash hit ratio. That means happy customers. That means happy accounting.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:56.320]   And you decide how much storage you need and they will help you and take care of the rest.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:05.200]   SOS is backed by CashFly's 100% 100% uptime SLA guarantee and it's industry-leading global
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:13.200]   performance. We could not be happier. We are so glad with CashFly. CashFly is also a great corporate
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:19.120]   citizen. We met the team are just fantastic. They're partnering with World Central Kitchen.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:25.600]   They've donated over $50,000 with a goal of serving over 300,000 warm meals to those who are struggling
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:32.160]   during this tough time. CashFly's the best. With standard powerful throughput, low latency,
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:40.400]   high cash hit ratio and 100% uptime SLA CashFly has got to be your perfect CDN. And with CashFly's
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:45.760]   SOS, you'll even save. Just for Twit listeners, CashFly is giving away a complementary detailed
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:50.720]   analysis of your current CDN bill and usage trends. See if you are overpaying 20% or more.
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:58.320]   For CDNs that aren't nearly as good, CashFly go to twit.cashfly.com and thank you CashFly
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:08.480]   for keeping our podcast going. Twit.cashfly.com. So let's start with NVIDIA and ARM because that
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:16.800]   was an interesting story. Now remember that SoftBank bought ARM for $32 billion. What was it? Four
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:23.680]   years ago? Not too long ago. Sixteen. And as we mentioned before SoftBank running into a little
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:30.720]   fiscal difficulty, their investment fund, well, they invested in Uber and WeWork. Need I say more?
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:39.760]   So trying to raise a scarab-loot cash. Now I was way out of line. I predicted, oh, they're going to
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:48.480]   get $60 billion for ARM. Whoa, really? Yeah, well, I was too far off. $40 billion.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:56.320]   That's a nice $8 billion turnaround in four years. Give them where they are now. Yeah.
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:04.480]   25% over six years. Annualized rate of return on that's only like $2.5. So that's pretty good.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:10.160]   I'd like to get that in my portfolio. These days? Yeah. I'd sell twig in a heartbeat.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:15.520]   Considering we work after WeWork, anything is a good one. Yeah, it's good.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:20.800]   So but the real concern and question is of course for all of us. I mean, ARM is a very important
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:26.240]   architecture. As you all know, ARM is a chip designer. They don't make chips. They license
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:31.920]   their architecture to a lot of people. Qualcomm, Apple, Samsung, and on and on and on.
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:36.560]   So their designs are really important to the mobile world, increasingly
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:44.400]   important to server world and desktop world, thanks to Apple. And I guess Microsoft Windows on ARM.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:50.640]   Softbank. Do you see this as a way of Nvidia saying, you know what Apple, we're still going to get
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.920]   your coin. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:57.360]   actually, I think it's the server play that's more interesting than Nvidia, but I should let
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:04.000]   our chip expert way on that. Why would Nvidia want ARM for $40 billion?
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:11.600]   So really focused, I wrote about this. I really focused on the data center because any time
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:20.160]   Nvidia, about any time Nvidia, a GPU, there's got to be an x86 or an ARM computer attached to it.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:28.320]   And so what happens is, you know, I'm stuck next to Intel everywhere. In the data center,
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:36.000]   there's increasing focus on, you know, price performance, machine learning, those kind of workloads.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.480]   So having their own, having access to the ARM instruction set is going to be increasingly
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:45.360]   important to them in the data center. But and no one's really focused on this, and even I wasn't
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:50.880]   too much attention to it until I started looking at the numbers. But Nvidia, this deal also gets
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:58.720]   them into the car. And Nvidia got kicked out of Tesla, remember, but Nvidia is in the cars,
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:05.840]   have lots of ARM computers, and there are lots of sensors, you know, you need an operating system
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:10.800]   to manage your car, and it can't all to be dependent on the cloud. So this puts Nvidia really in
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:16.480]   an excellent spot there. So I'm going to just put that in there because I wasn't really thinking
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:23.760]   about it. So in for those of all who may not realize it, ARM is the application processor inside
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:29.120]   pretty much every single phone out there. There may be one or two, like old school, like Intel
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:34.080]   beta crappy Intel wanted to get in that mobile market. They made these scale chips and they were
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:40.720]   a flop. They eventually sold it off. So yeah, ARM owns mobile really. So
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:47.040]   our moans mobile and oh, go on. No, I was just going to reinforce your point. If you can own mobile
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:51.760]   and you can own the data setters, you're going to sell the lion's share of chips. You don't even
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:56.880]   care about desktop computing. That's a that's a small fraction of the overall computing market.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:05.760]   Yeah, and ARM is making head rosary. Now I will say dinner, the day still belongs to Intel
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:14.320]   86. I don't see that. I mean, ARM has been working on this 10 years. First ARM based server came out
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:22.960]   in like 2011. So and we're only now like in 2018, maybe, maybe it's 2019 that Amazon introduced the
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:27.120]   computing the Graviton computing instance based on ARM. So that's been like a 10 year journey
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:34.400]   to get it to there. But Nvidia recognized that they have to own an instruction set going forward.
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:44.320]   And you see this think about think about in the last 10, maybe even 12 years, you saw Amazon,
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:49.680]   Google, Apple, all of them licensed, take an architecture license and start developing their
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:55.840]   own chips. Nvidia looks at that and that's a real problem for it's a problem for Intel.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.920]   It's a problem for Nvidia. So owning arm really keeps them in the loop there.
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:05.760]   Okay, that's it. Yeah, I now there's some antitrust issues.
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:11.200]   Regulators have to approve it. There's some real concern in the UK because ARM is a UK company.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:19.120]   And they say we're not going to move arm out of the UK. And for people like Apple,
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:25.600]   we are going to, of course, honor all of arm's existing licenses and continue those. Of course,
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:29.520]   they will. That's why they bought it. They don't want less business.
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:37.200]   So I think the question becomes, I don't think arm is going to shut down licenses like the big
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:43.040]   instruction set CPU licenses, right? So you'll always be able to get that from ARM,
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:48.080]   even if it's owned by Nvidia. What I am curious about is are they going to continue
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:54.320]   building the software that runs around that? So things like getting, you know,
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:40:00.000]   bus from the compute to memory, they make actually lots of software to make it easier to slot your
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:07.680]   arm processor into your existing SOC, right? So they may not, they may be like, eh, we don't
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:12.960]   really care so much about that. And so then companies that rely on that most company or the
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:20.880]   more advanced you are, the less likely you're going to rely on that. Yeah. So, and then the
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:27.520]   other thing, because I'm IOT person, I have to do it, arm has spent like a billion dollars buying
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:32.560]   an IOT services business with like treasure data with Pelion with some other acquisitions
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:38.160]   in the last few years. I don't know what happens with that. They were going to spend that out to
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:42.240]   SoftBank and they're like, no, we're not going to spend it out. And now it looks like what will
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:47.200]   Nvidia do with that? So the regulatory question, the what are you going to do with the billion
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:52.000]   dollars you spend on building an IOT services business that's kind of just so so? And then
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:59.840]   what are you going to do with other at it? Because it's my scapist beeping. Is that y'all?
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:04.720]   You're on actually on zoom right now. I know that's why I was like, what's happening?
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:11.920]   Why is my way at froze now? Oh my God, it's like herding cats. So by the way, I just want to
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:16.240]   report, I didn't realize this, but they quickly switched you our engineering team as top notch.
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:22.160]   And they switched you over to zoom and the picture is much better. The audio is
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:27.280]   zoom is better. The audio is terrible. Don't you hear all the hesitation and the freezing?
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:32.880]   Don't you see all the freezing and it's thinner. Oh, okay. Well, then we can swap me back. No,
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:37.680]   no, it's I just I feel like the audience. What he cares about. Yeah, all I care about really
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:42.080]   the audio and 90% of our audience listens. And well, that's what I'm saying. So do you want me to
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:47.680]   go back to Skype? No, we can. No, it's not that much different. I don't care. The picture is better.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:54.880]   The picture is way. What's happening is zoom is favoring the image over the audio. And that makes
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:59.040]   sense if you're doing, I guess it makes sense if you're doing a business meeting, but it doesn't
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:05.040]   make sense at all for his podcast. We keep, you know, I want to look at, I've wanted to switch off
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:11.120]   Skype for 10 years. We try everything that comes out. For some reason, there's just something about
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:17.040]   Skype and Skype audio. You know, we're having more and more problems than we've ever had with Skype.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:23.200]   So I don't know what the solution is. Is there a setting anywhere on Zoom where you can say,
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:27.920]   I want better audio? I don't know. Let me see. I don't think so. I don't think so.
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:33.280]   Yeah. I can know I don't have automatically adjust microphone volume.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:40.560]   Name? Turn off any automatic stuff for sure. I did. I turned off automatic.
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:46.480]   I don't know. I see here. There's lots of settings.
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:52.240]   Oh, there is a whole advanced thing. Suppressed persistent background noise. That's on all.
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:55.200]   I could turn that to disable. No, don't mess with that. You had to disable all that.
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:43:02.160]   Oh, wait. You want it on disabled? No processing whatsoever. We do all that.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:06.080]   So do not suppress background noise. That's right.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:10.960]   OK. And the solution is either auto or aggressive. So I'm just going to have it on auto.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:18.960]   Sure. It's funny. I was listening to older audio from old from 10, 15 years ago. And we put
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:23.840]   up with terrible audio scopes. Audio was not that good. Maybe it was also because bandwidth was
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:28.320]   a high bandwidth wasn't that prevalent. But the audio quality has gotten better and better. But
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:35.440]   I don't know. Oh, now there's a if I can click to show it says show in meeting option to
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:41.760]   enable original sound from microphone. So what is that? I don't know. Never seen that.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:47.280]   I don't want to rivetive sound. Yes. Somebody said original sound. Oh, it says turn off
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:52.400]   original sound. So I'm going to do that and tell me. Well, go and turn off. I don't know what
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:44:03.280]   you're going to get now. Now what do I sound like better? Porky pig. Sound one. Sound two.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:08.880]   No, that's fine. Leave it. Sound one. I think sounds good to me. Original sound. Do we want
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.480]   or not? One was better. John has perfect eyesight.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:21.680]   What's happening when you get a stutter hesitation like that is because packets are being dropped.
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:29.840]   It can't reassemble them. The video. I don't know why I crash. I don't know why you crash.
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:35.520]   You got lots of bandwidth. I wish we could get Google fiber here. Did you see this? Google
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:44.800]   fiber is now going to offer two gigabit service. I don't I wonder if two gigabit really is worth it.
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:50.160]   Two gig down one gig up. That's awesome. That'll be a hundred dollars a month.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:55.200]   By the way, with that, you will also get hardware, Wi-Fi six router and mesh
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:00.400]   stender to make take advantage of the new speeds. I presume it'll be a Google device.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:06.320]   So the problem is who can get Google fiber? Well, it'll kick off in Nashville,
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:12.240]   Tennessee and Huntsville, Alabama with full rollout in the two cities planted for later this year.
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:20.960]   19 cities in the US not here alas. In other words, we can forget about this after the show is over.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:27.600]   Don't have any dreams about it. It's kind of honestly, it's amazing
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:32.640]   that for 15 years, we've been able to do a podcast network in the middle of nowhere.
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:39.440]   It is. California. I get great hosts from all over the country, all over the world to be on the
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:47.120]   show. Thanks to Skype. That's amazing technology. And as you pointed out, now because of COVID,
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:52.480]   we're seeing every news network use it, every TV show. A lot of TV shows are doing their shows
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:46:01.120]   on Zoom now. Yeah, it's amazing. I kind of find out what year was when I did this, but I'm upstairs
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:06.160]   in this house looking like something on a chair with books on it. I mess in BC in a snowstorm.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:13.040]   Did it years and years and years ago and there was the opportunity to do this for a long time.
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:18.320]   Only COVID. Do they realize, oh, they're always going to opt for what they consider a higher quality.
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:21.520]   Can I remember exactly what they told me? Yeah, exactly what they told me.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:26.000]   I remember going into flash cam sets, having to drive down in San Francisco to do CNN on a
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.480]   flash cam set. And those are satellite uplinks and they don't have this hesitation. They don't
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:35.600]   have dropout audio. They don't have weird audio. So I understand that they consider themselves
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:40.240]   mission critical. And they also say money is not an object because it's satellite time's expensive.
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:46.960]   This is a lot. And they can control the they control what you look like too.
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:51.120]   Right. The lighting, the camera. Don't under it. Yeah. The value of the make
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:58.000]   spends 30 minutes on your face. Oh, they never gave me a makeup artist. Oh, God, I always had a
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.600]   makeup person. Really? Sometimes they know when it's a loss cause Mr. LaPorte. Oh, is that it?
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:07.840]   It took one look at me and said, I'm taking the day off. Well, I bought this.
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:13.360]   I always found it. I found it confusing because it's been 30 minutes on makeup. And I'd walk away
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:19.040]   looking. I mean, yes, better still almost exactly the same. I figured like I'd come
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:23.440]   thinking like fancy that I never did. Well, I don't want to know you're running about Zoom.
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:28.400]   You're running about Zoom. You see the hesitation and all that? Yeah. Okay. I'll go back to Skype.
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:32.000]   Go back to Skype. No, this is not about you. It's about the it's about the interesting.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:37.040]   You're already there. Just leave it. Just leave it because Skype had other issues.
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:41.280]   The low res picture was terrible. It was the most important part,
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:46.480]   but audio is the most important part. Who cares? All right. Y'all. Yeah. The dropout is making me
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:51.360]   kind of it was very impressive. John made the switch like that. I know he's good. I was very
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:56.800]   so good. Isn't he good? Yeah, he is. Ant's been coming in to pick up some tips from John.
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:01.360]   And I think he makes it look so easy when some of the engineering on
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.640]   them. Have I ever asked what's the Can I ask? What's the derivation of Jamerby?
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:08.880]   What is the Gatorivation of Jamerby? That's his chatroom handle.
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:18.080]   I will tell. Okay. A long time ago, I was in the band. I was the engineer road manager for a band.
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:26.160]   The keyboard player came up with a t-shirt one day that said jam or be slammed.
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:35.040]   The next week I came with a t-shirt that said Jamerby, slamina. Oh, because this last thing.
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:41.280]   Jamerby, slamina. So, Mr. John, you're a poor boy every time I talk to you.
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:44.000]   The B stands for bacon. Right.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:50.080]   Slamina. Slamina. What language is that bacon? Check. Check. It's bacon and check.
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:54.080]   While we got you on the mic there, John, did you do the conchio e Pepe?
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:58.640]   I have. I did it before. I had it at home before we brought it to the studio.
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:03.360]   It's just spaghetti. It's just keprys. It wasn't as exciting to me as it was for you.
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:07.280]   It was good, but nothing to write home. Tell it.
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:13.200]   The only thing I have looked forward to on Wednesdays, after I suffer through the show,
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:17.120]   I get my conchio e Pepe. Oh, that's funny. Wait, don't you have heart problems?
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:23.680]   You should not be eating that once a week, man. I know. The Parmesan is a lower fat.
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:30.720]   We maybe we should try this Google AI powered meeting hardware.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:32.960]   No, that'll just give just buy a $3,000.
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:33.200]   Right.
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:34.320]   One gets that much.
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:35.520]   It is. Yeah.
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:38.080]   Yeah. One was up. One was over 3,000.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:39.360]   Depending on packaging.
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:42.000]   Yeah. What does that include? Do you remember?
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.320]   Does it include like the additional microphones?
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:45.040]   Stream, the camera.
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:48.560]   Is that what this box is? Is it a Ray Mike?
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.520]   And high end camera. And then. Oh, that's the Ray Mike, the puck.
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:50:00.160]   And then you get a, I guess they figured out what to do with their Nexus 7 tablets.
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:06.000]   You know, I looked at when we were looking at this earlier, it made me wonder why would an
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:11.280]   enterprise go this route versus the likes of say, a Cisco? Yeah. You're just going to,
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:12.080]   you're going to go with it.
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:16.080]   Oh, no, because it's integrated into your G Suite.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:16.960]   Oh, if you're already.
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.400]   That would be the only reason.
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.160]   Okay. And so.
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:21.280]   Exactly. I did. And there it is.
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:21.760]   Bulldog.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:25.360]   I did want to ask Stacy this because what's the AI for?
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:30.320]   They're using the Coral MDOT2 accelerator modules with the company's Edge TPUs.
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.520]   Why?
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:34.880]   Maybe background noise reduction.
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.400]   Oh, or picture.
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.680]   Improving.
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:41.520]   Or following you where you move or knowing who's speaking in the room.
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:42.400]   That may be it.
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:43.760]   Global speakers in the room.
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:50.800]   Or maybe they'll do something cool like Microsoft two years ago and it still has yet to introduce,
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:56.240]   which is like being able to recognize the speakers, create, generate notes, and generate
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:51:00.240]   action items. Teams actually, I think, oh, no, it's not Teams. It's another software program.
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:04.320]   So eventually that's happened, but I don't know if that's happening today.
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:07.360]   Because that would be bad. Oh, I can't say that word.
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:08.640]   It would be awesome.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:09.360]   I want this.
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:13.200]   This is why I asked before about the kit that's being sent to.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.240]   Right.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:16.000]   The CNN and MSNBC.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.440]   Oh, that's a really good one to send out.
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:18.480]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:19.920]   Somebody's going to productize that.
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:26.240]   Because it's not just for offices every time you're doing Pete Dominic,
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:28.160]   podcaster who I like a lot.
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:32.960]   He has to do an award show for somebody.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:35.600]   He's the MC of a virtual award show.
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:35.840]   Right.
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:38.960]   So he needs a stick and people are going to hire people like that.
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:40.080]   They're going to hire comedians.
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:41.200]   They're going to do all kinds of stuff.
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:46.320]   So I think we should use Microsoft Teams.
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:49.600]   And then you guys could be sitting in the audience.
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.480]   I hate Teams.
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:57.520]   I only use Teams under the greatest duress because every time I have to interact with it,
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:59.920]   Microsoft screws up my login and password again.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:00.880]   I'm freaking hate it.
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:01.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:02.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:04.240]   Oh, well.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.360]   One great thing about Zoom.
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:07.920]   I've done a couple of conferences lately where,
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:12.080]   because I'm an idiot and only speak 1.1 languages being translated.
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:14.480]   The translate function with the translator is amazing.
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:16.080]   Amazing.
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.160]   So you, is it translating your audio?
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:19.440]   No, they're doing, no.
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:20.640]   So human is human being.
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:21.440]   Oh, they have humans.
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:23.520]   Oh, they have simultaneous human checks.
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:24.960]   Yeah, they just changed the channels.
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:26.240]   Oh, really well.
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:27.120]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:28.320]   Nice.
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:29.040]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.360]   You hear the original just down barely,
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:32.480]   or you can turn it all the way off.
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:35.120]   The translator knows and comes back in and out.
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:36.000]   It's well done.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.240]   So today Facebook had an Oculus event and they announced
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:43.760]   they're going to be the first mover when it comes to smart glasses.
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:45.920]   Well, if you don't consider Google Glass,
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:49.280]   these look about as dorky as Google Glass.
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:50.880]   They'll come out next year.
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:52.160]   They'll be Ray bands.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:53.760]   They're doing the deal with Luxautica.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.680]   Wait a minute.
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:56.720]   That doesn't look.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:59.280]   Because that's the only glasses venue ever.
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:00.720]   There's really no choice.
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:01.760]   Yeah, it's Adderall.
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:04.160]   Well, that looks like the Amazon frames.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.440]   Echo frames.
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:06.240]   It does.
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:07.200]   Well, you're right.
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:08.240]   I was thinking of that.
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:08.560]   Yes.
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:11.360]   Well, that's because all frames that do this
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:15.360]   are going to have to have big temples for battery and speakers.
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:17.360]   Now, this one unlike the Amazon has a camera.
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:18.080]   See their camera?
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:19.840]   The little eyeball there.
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:22.560]   I'm getting PTSD looking at this.
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:25.760]   It really does kind of feel like Google Glass a little bit.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.440]   I'm sure it'll have the same issues.
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:31.920]   Here's a close up of it.
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:36.240]   It's very nerdy, big black rimmed glasses.
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:36.720]   Very heavy.
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:39.040]   You know, they may have done this with Ray Bambi.
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:42.160]   But this is no Jack Nicholson glasses here.
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:42.720]   These are not.
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:45.840]   We're getting closer and closer to Daniel Suarez.
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:46.400]   And I like it.
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:48.240]   Yes.
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:50.640]   That was the vision in his book, Demon and Freedom.
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:52.640]   I love that idea.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.160]   And Amy Webb's talked about that.
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:54.880]   A lot of people,
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:59.040]   I think quite reasonably think that this is the future of wearables.
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:01.760]   Because I'd be all in for it.
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:04.880]   Would you get an HUD the way he described in the books?
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:06.560]   I'd be all for it.
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:07.120]   I would too.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:10.720]   They also announced Oculus Quest 2.
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.000]   Now here's the drawback.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.640]   Both of these products come from Facebook.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:18.400]   And they've announced you will have to have a Facebook account
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.320]   in order to use.
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:20.960]   Relax.
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:22.640]   I am not making.
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:23.920]   No, that's not me one.
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:24.560]   I want one.
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:25.440]   I'm not doing it.
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:26.000]   I don't.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:26.640]   But relax.
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:27.760]   I wouldn't do it either.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:28.880]   By the way, Leo,
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:31.040]   Luxautica does own Oliver Peoples.
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:31.920]   Oh crap.
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:34.000]   Damn it.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.480]   I thought that was the last good glass.
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:39.040]   Or be Parker.
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.480]   They own Warby Parker.
[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:41.680]   Waterwall.
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:43.360]   No, no, no, those are the only independent.
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:43.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:44.560]   Warby's independent.
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:45.760]   Otherwise they bought a wall.
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:47.600]   Do they own?
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:48.160]   Oh man.
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:51.920]   How about I see exclamation mark in Berlin?
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:54.560]   That's not owned by Luxautica.
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:55.840]   That's who makes my glasses.
[00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:58.160]   I see Berlin.
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:01.760]   No, they're not owned by Luxautica.
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:03.200]   That's why I buy them.
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:05.280]   Today.
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:06.960]   Yeah, today.
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:08.480]   They don't wear glasses.
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:11.680]   That is well, no, but if I did, I'd wear these.
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:14.960]   I do wear glasses.
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:16.320]   I just don't wear them on the air.
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:17.840]   When you're being vain.
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:20.800]   My I see glasses, which I really like,
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:27.280]   are made out of stainless steel spring steel sheet metal.
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:30.960]   And the hinges are weird.
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:34.560]   They don't have any screws in them,
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:36.960]   because that screws always fall out of my glasses.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:40.480]   They're just like some sort of weird spring steel metal.
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:41.280]   I just love these.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:42.320]   I've never broken them.
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:44.720]   They're really good.
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:47.200]   And they're from Germany.
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:50.000]   So you know they're made beautifully.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.040]   Engineering.
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:51.760]   Engineering.
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:55.840]   And they are not owned by Luxautica,
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:58.640]   which is a shameful story, by the way.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:03.520]   They basically, that's why glasses frames suddenly cost so much money.
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:03.760]   Yep.
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:09.040]   They're just pieces of plastic, unless there's spring steel.
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:12.160]   Facebook.
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:12.960]   But this quest too.
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:15.440]   Yeah, the quest to let's talk about it.
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:18.000]   You're a VR guy, right?
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.840]   And sorry, I was not trying to digress too much.
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:23.440]   You know, that's Mr. Howl.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.480]   He's the VR guy.
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:27.440]   I like it to a certain to a certain extent.
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:29.840]   It's gotten so much better the last couple of years,
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:31.920]   far as to track it and stuff, because I used it.
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:35.840]   I suffer from Vertigo really bad.
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:36.560]   Oh, yeah, you can't play that.
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:37.200]   That'll make you sad.
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:38.960]   But is way better now.
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:40.720]   Now I like it.
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:42.960]   The nice thing about the quest, and I have the quest one,
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:44.640]   but I guess I won't get the quest too,
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:46.080]   because I don't have a Facebook account.
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:48.960]   Is it inexpensive and it's not wired?
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:52.320]   So it's all done in the visor.
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:56.640]   These run by the way, Qualcomm Snapdragons.
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:58.320]   Stacey, another place.
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:00.480]   Arm is dominant.
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:01.760]   Arm is crushing it.
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:02.480]   All right.
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:08.400]   So these are less expensive, $2.99.
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:13.600]   For the 64 gig version, if you want a lot more storage,
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:15.920]   it's $3.99 for $2.56.
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:19.280]   They have a Snapdragon XR2,
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:20.400]   six gigs of RAM.
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:21.760]   That's a 50% increase.
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:24.880]   The main thing though, I think is the,
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:27.680]   as exactly as you said, is the
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:32.240]   refresh rate on the screens and the resolution.
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:36.960]   They're 1832 by 1920 per i,
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:39.680]   and they're 72 Hertz fast switching LCDs.
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:42.400]   So I think these would be even better for you, Anne.
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:51.600]   But I'm not, honestly, if I were all in on VR,
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:53.280]   I'd get them anyway, but I'm not.
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:58.080]   The other news though, is the fact that they're saying,
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:01.360]   "You know what, we're done with the wired version altogether."
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:01.680]   Yeah.
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:02.160]   See that?
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:04.800]   You know, it kind of irks me,
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:06.880]   because I put in, that was a Kickstarter,
[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:09.760]   the original Oculus Rift, which I put in for,
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:11.360]   I got my Kickstarter edition.
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:15.600]   And then they sold a Facebook, which really made me mad.
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:18.400]   I did get the new version for free,
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:20.320]   because I'd done the Kickstarter.
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:23.200]   But the wire is definitely an on-starter.
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:25.440]   We have a Vive, which is also wired,
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:30.160]   but we've got the wireless attachment,
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:31.600]   which makes you look like an alien.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:34.320]   So then you can get it on wired.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:37.040]   The one I gave you is the Oculus Rift.
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:39.520]   That's still wired, and that's kind of not great, is it?
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:42.080]   I don't have a problem with it,
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:44.080]   but I'm a lot easier to please.
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:45.760]   Apparently.
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:51.680]   Anne snapped it up at my biennial Leo's garage sale.
[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:52.880]   Quickly.
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:53.840]   Good.
[00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:58.400]   I'm glad you got it, in which I take everything I don't want anymore.
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:00.560]   You know what's going to be in the garage sale next week?
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:03.120]   I don't know if it'll be next week, next time.
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:05.040]   This Surface Duo.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:06.400]   I'll be there.
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:10.240]   Actually, let me take a break,
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:11.520]   and then we'll talk about it,
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:12.800]   because it is an Android device,
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:13.920]   so I guess it's appropriate.
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:16.240]   I've been talking about it all about Android,
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:17.360]   and on Windows Weekly,
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:19.680]   because it's Microsoft's first product
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:22.800]   based on something other than a Microsoft operating system.
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:24.640]   This is Android.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:26.240]   And you know what, the hardware is gorgeous.
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:33.840]   I didn't have an issue with the split screen the way you did.
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:37.360]   I think it's going to have some good uses down the road.
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:38.880]   Oh, you know, before I send it back,
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:39.760]   because I think I'm a...
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:41.360]   You have 60 days to return,
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:43.200]   so before I send it back, I'll let you borrow it, okay?
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:45.040]   Roger that, so I'm going to do a little...
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:48.480]   I was going to say Kevin actually,
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:50.800]   he wrote about one, but he got one too,
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:52.240]   and he actually really enjoys it.
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:54.720]   He's been calling me on it, playing on it.
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:56.160]   There's a lot to say for it.
[00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:58.880]   Actually, instead of doing the ad, I'll do it,
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.240]   as long as we've got started.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.280]   The hardware is amazing.
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:02.720]   I mean, it's beautiful, super thin.
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.720]   This is five millimeters, so even together,
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:05.920]   it's 10 millimeters.
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.760]   It's thinner than most phones.
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:10.880]   The battery life spectacular goes all day, no problem.
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:12.880]   It's got a fingerprint reader on the side
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.000]   that works quite well,
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.360]   and it does some really cool things.
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:16.960]   So the idea is,
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.800]   and they don't call it a phone,
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:20.320]   and I think they're right not to,
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:24.080]   it's really a dual screen, small, or pocket computer.
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.080]   That's really what it is.
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:30.640]   With some capabilities to do phone calls,
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:31.760]   you can make phone calls,
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.120]   you can put a sem in it,
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:37.280]   and because it has a very poor camera,
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:39.520]   and I think a lot of people today buy a smartphone
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:40.560]   because they want the camera,
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:44.400]   this is not only a bad camera experience,
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:45.120]   because when you...
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:46.720]   There's only one lens,
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:47.360]   it's right here,
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.360]   it's right here on the phone.
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.480]   When you turn on the camera,
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.920]   it starts in selfie mode,
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:53.520]   and then to get it in camera mode,
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.360]   let's see if I can get it to work,
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:56.240]   you close it,
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:58.480]   oops, I pressed the wrong button.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:01.280]   Little clunky UI, huh?
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:02.720]   Well, no, it's actually...
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:05.280]   It's just, I'm not used to the form factor, right?
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:06.240]   All right.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.760]   You close it,
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.880]   it worked,
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:12.320]   and then it turns into a camera.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:14.160]   It's just not a great camera.
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:14.720]   Nice.
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.800]   Yeah, it's not a great camera.
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:17.840]   Actually, you don't...
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.440]   We did...
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.040]   He and I meet,
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.000]   Kevin and I were on meet,
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.360]   and the camera actually looked...
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:24.160]   It's perfect for that.
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:24.880]   Pretty good.
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.560]   No, it's perfect for that.
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:27.760]   Oh, okay, it was like...
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:28.960]   What they should...
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.880]   They don't even want to say it's a phone.
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.800]   It's not a camera phone camera,
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:35.200]   it's a meet camera,
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:37.840]   or a Skype camera, a Duo camera.
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.320]   It's fine.
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.760]   Good enough to do that job.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.920]   Great, and because the form factor,
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.200]   I'm sure Kevin did this,
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.920]   it's a little laptop,
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:47.840]   and so you can do this.
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.360]   You can watch TV that way.
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:51.200]   It has a really interesting feature,
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.600]   which is to take advantage of the dual screens.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:54.000]   You can...
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.120]   Dedicate...
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.040]   You can create folders of two apps
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.560]   that work side by side.
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.960]   So this one is my chess group.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.400]   So when I launch that,
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:05.600]   I get my chess book and running in Kindle on one side,
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:07.680]   and I get my little chess program
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:10.160]   on the other side to do the moves,
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:13.200]   and that is actually a really nice combination.
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.120]   Kindle is...
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.480]   It's a great book reader.
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:17.840]   I'm sure Kevin noted this,
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.160]   because let me see if I can...
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:20.400]   It's...
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:21.360]   The software's a little...
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:25.120]   I'd say it's not great.
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.280]   It's a little bit clunky.
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:29.520]   So to get this to a two screen,
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:32.640]   I have to drag it up,
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.400]   drag it to the middle,
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:35.840]   then like this,
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:36.320]   but now...
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.960]   Well, it's not working, right?
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:41.600]   Yeah, that was a little rough.
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.240]   Well, that's...
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.640]   No, but it's supposed to be like a two-page book,
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:46.960]   but now for some reason it's spread over.
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.080]   I guess it must be a setting
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:49.920]   that I have to fix in that Kindle book.
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:50.480]   But that's the...
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:51.360]   Well, you're not a best book.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:53.360]   And it's like a book that you might read on the...
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:55.360]   Here's my little chapbook.
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:59.360]   Well, and I will say what Kevin said that I thought was pretty...
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:00.800]   He was like,
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:02.320]   "I don't think you should think of it as a phone."
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:02.960]   Right.
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:03.840]   Yeah, it's a small picture.
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:04.720]   Yes, it makes calls.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.040]   He's like,
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.960]   "Yeah, and...
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:11.360]   if it is a small tablet,
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:14.000]   and he's really loving it,
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.920]   because he can get side-by-side apps."
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:19.120]   And see, I agree with that perspective
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:20.800]   of being a smaller tablet,
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.720]   because the only thing that I thought about
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:25.040]   was opening up Lightroom on it,
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.360]   and looking at my assets and things like that,
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:28.880]   or opening up Premiere Rush,
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:31.920]   and going through and editing content that way.
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.360]   The last thing across my mind
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.960]   was answering a phone call on them,
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.320]   or sending a text.
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:38.560]   Who uses their phone that much for phones anymore.
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.800]   I'll tell you why you're not going to want to do that, Ant.
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:43.600]   Let me open the Photos app just to...
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:46.400]   And if I move it to two screens,
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.800]   so I have a photo...
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.080]   Can you do the over the shoulder?
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:51.120]   Do you have that, John?
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:51.600]   Or no?
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:55.120]   Yeah.
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:56.320]   So I have a photo...
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.840]   Now I can make it two screens.
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:00.560]   Any app this can be done with.
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:04.160]   But this hinge hides part of the picture.
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.360]   You see that?
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:06.240]   Yeah.
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.840]   So you don't see the whole picture.
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.440]   No, it's nice, but it's not as...
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:10.320]   It's like...
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:11.760]   Well, it doesn't have to,
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.360]   because it's two screens.
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:14.240]   The software could say,
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:16.320]   "Well, this ends here and starts there."
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.200]   Oh, I see.
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:18.160]   But for some reason,
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.080]   it treats it as a single screen,
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.640]   which means it occludes whatever's under the hinge,
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.360]   which is a little...
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.560]   Because otherwise it would look...
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.680]   Well, I'm not justified.
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:26.960]   Otherwise it would look wacky,
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:27.840]   because it would look like the...
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:31.200]   If you had a human being,
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.920]   it might get six inches taller if they're lying down.
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:34.480]   I guess.
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:36.160]   I mean, but look at a map, for instance.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.080]   And Google has, by the way,
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:42.320]   just updated their maps to work with this phone.
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:44.160]   I mean, part of it is going to be
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:48.480]   Microsoft polishing the software in Android,
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:50.880]   but part of it's also going to be third parties
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:55.600]   getting their stuff to work a little bit better.
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.880]   So Google, apparently, they say,
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:57.840]   "Oh, no, we've made the...
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.360]   But the map still hides stuff."
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:01.520]   See, let me hide La Gonita.
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:02.240]   Oh, yeah, you're...
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:02.720]   You can see it.
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:04.160]   Okay.
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:06.080]   See, he says, "To whom?"
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:06.560]   No, I mean...
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:09.680]   Right?
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:10.160]   So that's a...
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:13.200]   I mean, but there's nothing there.
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.440]   So of course that's not going to show it.
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:16.400]   But there is something there.
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.800]   There is something there.
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:20.240]   There's...
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.840]   It's hiding what's under the hinge.
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:25.360]   So I'm just saying what it could do is what we would do here.
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:26.320]   It's divided.
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.040]   It's divided.
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.000]   It's two screens.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:34.640]   So if I put half of you in that screen and half of you in this screen,
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:37.360]   your head would be divided in half,
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.600]   but it would end there and start here.
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:41.760]   It wouldn't be hidden by the gap.
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:43.920]   There's a difference.
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.240]   So I don't understand why they chose to do that,
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:47.280]   but you're right, Stacey.
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.520]   Maybe they had some good reason for it.
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:50.800]   And I just thought...
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:51.200]   Oh, yeah, Kevin.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:53.600]   I just have to tell you.
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:54.080]   Okay.
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:54.880]   Kevin loves it.
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:58.560]   Well, no, Kevin has been sharing things.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:00.080]   Apparently he popped online.
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:01.920]   So he...
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:04.800]   So his article tells you how to make the camera mode switch work.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.160]   Okay.
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:07.440]   And he's also saying that, "Yes,
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:10.960]   app developers have to optimize their apps to use the dual screens."
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.720]   But this isn't a Microsoft problem.
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:15.360]   The way to do that is going to be part of Android 11.
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:16.240]   Okay.
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.880]   Well, dual screens are built into Android.
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:21.840]   They have been since Android 10 since Fold.
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:22.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.640]   But this is...
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:31.280]   But those folds had a contiguous screen, though, right?
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:31.760]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:33.360]   That's the big difference, right?
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:40.000]   No, let me be clear that that gap is not a show stop, by any means.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   So it's the things that are awkward, we're fixed.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.280]   Do you get the concept of using a hardware?
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:52.160]   There's some advantage to using a big screen that folds up.
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.840]   I think the fold might be a better...
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:54.800]   I don't know.
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:55.440]   So here's...
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.440]   Does it replace a tablet?
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:00.640]   No, because of that gap and because the software isn't...
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:01.280]   So here's the thing.
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:02.400]   You close it.
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:04.640]   And now you have a very funny-shaped phone.
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:06.000]   You have a 3x2 phone.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.480]   So it's kind of...
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:10.000]   That we can get around.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:10.800]   You get around.
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:14.080]   I think a lot of the objections to it were from people who said,
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:15.520]   "Well, it's not like any other phone."
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:18.000]   You know, they were used to how it worked on other things.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.680]   And so that is part of it.
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:21.920]   The software's a little janky, I have to say.
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.040]   The software isn't...
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:26.000]   Well, of course, it's the first product.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.200]   And these aren't...
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:28.560]   This isn't like Apple, where...
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:29.840]   And even Apple didn't have...
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:31.360]   I mean, it had a lot of software,
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:33.760]   but it took them a whole year to get that straight out
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:34.800]   after the first iPhone.
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.360]   I have to say, this is the hardware spectacular.
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:38.880]   The hardware is except for the camera.
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:40.160]   The hardware is really beautiful.
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.280]   It's elegantly done.
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:42.240]   It's just gorgeous.
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:43.040]   Great screens.
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:44.080]   Go ahead.
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.400]   What is this replace in your bag?
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:47.520]   So I'm traveling...
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:47.920]   That's the problem.
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:48.880]   ... normally I travel with a phone,
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:52.480]   a Kindle and a computer, a MacBook.
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:53.520]   Replace is the Kindle.
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:54.960]   This replaces your Kindle.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.080]   You can't get rid of your phone.
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:58.720]   For instance, when it's closed,
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:07:59.920]   if I get a notification,
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.520]   I have no idea.
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:03.360]   There's no indicator at all on it.
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:04.880]   That does not bother me at all.
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:05.280]   Yeah.
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.400]   Some people that doesn't bother,
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:06.960]   some people that don't.
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:07.200]   Yeah.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:10.640]   The fingerprint reader works quite well.
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:13.760]   I think it's a little book-like computer,
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:14.640]   is what it really is.
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.720]   And it's really good for the Kindle.
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:17.120]   It's great.
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:19.040]   If you want what you want to do is read books,
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:21.200]   I think you'd be very happy with it.
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:24.160]   Okay.
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:25.040]   There's some little...
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:25.360]   There's...
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:26.240]   I mean, there's glitches.
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.640]   There's hesitation and stuff.
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:29.600]   When you've played with it,
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.200]   I want to hear what you...
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:32.640]   Because whenever I look at the...
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:35.360]   I'm like, is this additive to my baggo gadgets?
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:37.040]   Because I really don't need any more.
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.640]   Why is it too too too easy to phone?
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:39.360]   Is what I think.
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:42.400]   That's kind of the part of the problem.
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:43.520]   I don't think it's a phone.
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:47.200]   Also, we just want to see how it fits in my hands too.
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:48.720]   Well, you have big hands.
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:49.600]   It's a little awkward.
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:52.880]   It's not comfortable to hold this way all the time.
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.520]   If I were on an airplane and I had it on the seat,
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:56.080]   that'd be great.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:57.200]   Look how the books look, though.
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.080]   This is great.
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.440]   Can you do the over the show?
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:00.640]   This is really nice.
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:01.760]   This is really like...
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:02.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:03.680]   That's nice.
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:04.960]   You're reading a book.
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:05.680]   It's just like it.
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:08.880]   And the screen is very crisp.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:11.360]   When you say phone,
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:14.080]   are you talking about texting and talking?
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.360]   Because if I'm the best,
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:22.320]   I've made phone calls on this and just use it with a speaker,
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:23.280]   which is fine.
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:24.640]   You can hold it to your head.
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:25.520]   It's not awful.
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:27.280]   It's not bad.
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:29.440]   I don't ever hold my phone to my head anymore.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:29.600]   Right.
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:30.800]   Like ever.
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.240]   So you have earbuds.
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:33.360]   There's no headphone jack,
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:35.200]   so you'd have to use Bluetooth earbuds.
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:39.440]   I think the camera is the biggest downfall.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:42.080]   There's no NFC, so you can't use touch to pay.
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:43.840]   There's no wireless charging.
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:44.800]   I can live with that.
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.960]   It's not waterproof.
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:49.600]   It's the 855 Snapdragon.
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.040]   Last year's Snapdragon.
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:52.320]   I think some of the issues,
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:54.720]   the hesitation and stuff and the freezing,
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:57.040]   might be because it's an older Snapdragon.
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.000]   But I bet you Microsoft...
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:58.640]   Oh, that's right.
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:09:59.120]   Yeah.
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:01.200]   I bet you Microsoft can optimize it.
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:04.240]   This is...
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:05.440]   They haven't...
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:08.160]   It's just come out.
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:08.720]   So they'll be...
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.000]   You need your gloves.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.040]   You need your glove.
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.080]   This is a glove.
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:12.880]   This is the glove.
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:13.680]   No, it's not a glove.
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:14.560]   A glove would be...
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:15.840]   That'd be whatever screen you want.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:16.560]   A glove would be a...
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:19.040]   An unseen...
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:20.320]   A glove would be whatever you...
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:24.800]   It's like a Chromebook on a anywhere that pops up a screen.
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:25.520]   Or a Chrome...
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:27.520]   Your Google account everywhere.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.600]   I do like the dual screen.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.800]   So I can...
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:31.600]   I can...
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:32.400]   Here's my...
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:33.760]   This is a TV dual screen.
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:34.800]   So I have...
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.360]   In one screen, I have a YouTube TV.
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.280]   In the other screen, I have a browser.
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:42.080]   And if I turn it, I can watch the TV.
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:43.280]   This doesn't excel around.
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:44.400]   There's a little sticky.
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.400]   I have to do it like this.
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:47.280]   Well, see, now...
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:51.040]   Now I want to accept the challenge of trying out that camera.
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:55.280]   Because I had the OnePlus Nord from Mr. Howl
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.320]   and played around with it.
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:57.200]   And I was able to...
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.680]   Pull out some decent shots with it.
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:00.880]   It's not the best camera,
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:03.280]   but it was still quite serviceable.
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:05.520]   And so I'd like to see if this would be the same thing.
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:06.240]   Even you.
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:09.360]   I'm going to get a great...
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:11.280]   Let me take a picture of...
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:12.240]   Let's see.
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:13.600]   Here's a picture of the set.
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.760]   And I'll do a quick picture.
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:16.480]   Let's see.
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:17.680]   It's got portrait mode.
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:18.560]   It's got slow-mo.
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:19.280]   It's got video.
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.320]   It's got panorama.
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:21.920]   I don't know.
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:23.200]   This isn't a very well lit.
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:26.640]   I just feel like even you are going to have a hard time getting.
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.800]   A great image of this.
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.960]   No, I'll put it on the big screen.
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:31.760]   This is the...
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:32.960]   This is photos syncs.
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:36.560]   Because you're going to want to see more detail.
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.320]   Now I'm getting error loading message.
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:39.200]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:39.680]   No.
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:40.640]   And it's not responding.
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:42.080]   See, this happens a lot.
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.560]   There's just these moments when it just goes,
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:45.440]   "I don't know.
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.160]   What do you want?"
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:47.680]   Process or just like you said.
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:48.080]   What do you want?
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:48.720]   What do you want?
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:51.840]   Nothing's launching.
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:52.560]   This is hard.
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:53.520]   Nothing is launching.
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:54.800]   See that?
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:55.520]   Nothing's happening.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.040]   This works.
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:57.680]   Okay.
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:00.240]   When you keep punching, when it's trying to launch,
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:02.160]   that's not going to help.
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:02.640]   Oh, really?
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.240]   It's like...
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:05.040]   Should just let it go.
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:05.760]   That's always fine.
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:07.520]   Give it a minute.
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:07.920]   Oh, there.
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:08.160]   Yeah.
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:09.120]   Now something's launching.
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:10.880]   This is cool.
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:12.800]   So if you have a Microsoft program,
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.720]   and you go dual-screen with it,
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:15.520]   some of the micro...
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:17.280]   Not all, but some of the Microsoft programs.
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:18.080]   This is one note.
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:21.200]   We'll be smart about the screen.
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:23.040]   And that's what everything should do.
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.720]   So you see, here's the note.
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:26.640]   Index over here.
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:27.520]   Same thing with email.
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:28.640]   I'll show the list of emails
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.320]   and then the content over there.
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:31.600]   That's kind of nice, right?
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:34.560]   Yep.
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.600]   And how long have you had it?
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:38.320]   Since last Thursday, almost a week.
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:39.760]   Since it ain't been very long.
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:40.880]   No, no, no, it's pretty new.
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.400]   But I've...
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.200]   Well, I would love...
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:45.520]   Come back in a couple of weeks and tell it.
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:46.160]   Because that's...
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:46.880]   Keep using it?
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:47.680]   This is so new.
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:48.480]   I feel like...
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:50.720]   Yeah, I think you should use it for longer hours.
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:51.120]   Sorry.
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:54.640]   Or give it to Aunt to use it.
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:55.280]   I just...
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:57.040]   I feel like with new form factors,
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.560]   it's really tough to...
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:12:59.280]   But you nailed it.
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:00.240]   That's the hardest thing,
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.000]   because you have expectations.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.400]   And this is not...
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:06.400]   You don't know what you're going to do with it yet.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:06.720]   Right.
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:07.920]   You know, a lot of times.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:10.320]   Well, but you kind of know what you want a phone to do, don't you?
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:12.880]   Well, I'm going to...
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:15.280]   But if you had told me when the iPhone launched,
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:18.400]   that I would want my phone to be my own camera,
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:19.120]   I would have been like...
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:20.400]   Crazy man.
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:21.040]   Right.
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:26.960]   So here is an example of the hinge failing me.
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:29.920]   See, I want to play this game and it says...
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:31.200]   Oh, look at that.
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:31.520]   Yeah.
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:34.000]   So that's not...
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.320]   On the other hand, it's kind of nice to have the game this big.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:41.680]   I don't think they ever planned for you to do things across the screen.
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:42.320]   No.
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:43.600]   As one image.
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:44.960]   You never watch a show that way.
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:46.160]   But I think that's the decision...
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:48.240]   Never look at a photo that way.
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:49.600]   That's also a decision to roll.
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:50.560]   In the hardware.
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:51.360]   You're using it wrong.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:54.720]   Couldn't the hardware just say the screen ends there and starts there?
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:57.360]   No, you see, you're trying to make it do something that it wasn't...
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.240]   It shouldn't do.
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:00.880]   It's...
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:03.040]   I'm going to confess something here which will shock some people.
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:06.240]   Remember when on the show I did the re-boxing of the iPad?
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:06.560]   Yeah.
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:11.280]   Because my complaint was that it wasn't a good creation tool.
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.240]   At the time it wasn't.
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:13.680]   It was only a consumption tool, right?
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:18.480]   But Apple caught up to the desire to turn it into a creation tool.
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:23.040]   And that's what the Spacey's point is right that when a new form vector comes out,
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:25.200]   even the company that makes it may not know what all of them.
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:26.320]   Oh, that's always the case, right?
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:27.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.560]   Yeah, it's true with other...
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:29.280]   With software too.
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:30.400]   Look at Twitter.
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:31.840]   That's more from quite a bit of an argument.
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:35.360]   They thought it was going to be an analog for text messaging.
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:38.160]   Everybody, I'm in the bar.
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:41.920]   Oh, those bros.
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:45.120]   They know what they want.
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:50.240]   Let me... let's take a little teeny-leany break arena.
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:53.520]   And we will continue on in just a bit, Jeff Jarvis,
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:57.200]   the city university in York, buzzmachine.com.
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:01.760]   I feel like you should be a judge like at Appeals Court Justice.
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:04.640]   I was going to go to law school.
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:06.560]   That was my original plan when I went to Claremont.
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:07.040]   Oh.
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:09.520]   And I decided pretty quickly and that saying yes, your honor,
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:10.880]   was not something I was built to do.
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:14.800]   No, but see if you're the judge, they say yes, your honor to you.
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:15.600]   Yeah, but you got it.
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:16.480]   You got it.
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:18.480]   I'll also say FU to the people I don't like.
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:20.000]   So it's not the one I'm even...
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.680]   So that's what judges get to do.
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:24.160]   They are gods in their own courtroom.
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:28.160]   Judge Jeff Jarvis, this is my column from now on.
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:28.960]   Judge Jeff.
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:33.680]   Stacy Higabotham is also here from StacyOnIOT.com.
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:34.560]   Get that newsletter.
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:36.000]   It's free and it's fabulous.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.640]   And of course she and Kevin do a great podcast,
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:40.560]   Kevin Tofel, the IoT show.
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:45.920]   And Mr. Anp Pruitt from Hands on Photography, Hands on Wellness,
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:49.440]   our beloved Anp Pruitt.
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:51.280]   So good to see all three of you.
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.960]   Our show today brought to you by Zip Recruiter.
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:55.680]   There's a lot to think about these days if you're an employer.
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:58.240]   Tell me about it.
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:02.720]   Hiring can be challenging, especially when you have to think about enforcing social
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:04.720]   distancing, supplying masks.
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:08.400]   But you know, when you need to fill a post, you need to fill a post.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.480]   Monica Starks could relate.
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:14.320]   She needed to hire for a pivotal role in her construction company, the GS Group.
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:17.360]   She's just having a hard time finding the right person
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.520]   during quarantine.
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:21.920]   So she switched to Zip Recruiter.
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:24.160]   And honestly, I have to say we've used it for years.
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:26.080]   It really does make hiring easier.
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:31.520]   The one of the keys is Zip Recruiter's technology will actually identify people with
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:35.600]   the right experience for your job and actively invite them to apply.
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:38.000]   You really should try Zip Recruiter.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.440]   It's free right now at ziprecruiter.com/twig.
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:45.280]   They also make it easy because when you post on Zip Recruiter,
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:49.840]   the job listing goes out to 100 plus sites, including social networks.
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:55.200]   All of the applicants roll into the Zip Recruiter interface where it's easy to rank them.
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:59.440]   You could screen them with questions and pick the right person fast.
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:01.120]   That's how Monica found Lamont Jenkins.
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:05.040]   She said Zip Recruiter sent Lamont's profile to her five minutes.
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:09.440]   Five minutes after she posted the job because he was a perfect match for the roles.
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:12.880]   He's Zip Recruiter has hundreds of thousands of active resumes.
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:14.400]   People go there to apply.
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:20.560]   So they look through them, obviously, with AI, and find the right person for the job.
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:21.680]   Then invite them to apply.
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:25.520]   And that's how Lamont started working for GS Group.
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:29.840]   Zip Recruiter does this so well, by the way, that four out of five employers
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:33.600]   who post on Zip Recruiter get a quality candidate in the first day.
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:35.360]   Last time we used it, we posted it at breakfast.
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:38.240]   We got like a slew of great candidates before lunch.
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:43.200]   Zip Recruiter is the way to hire.
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:46.160]   They make the whole process more efficient and more effective.
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:50.560]   I think you're going to love it, but the best way to find out is to try it for yourself.
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:52.320]   The minute you need to fill a post.
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:57.360]   And by the way, thank you because God knows we need more jobs out there.
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:04.560]   If you're one of those golden people who's hiring, go to zipprecruiter.com/twegantryit for free.
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:09.040]   zipprecruiter.com/tweig.
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:12.400]   Zip Recruiter is the smartest way to hire.
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:16.800]   And I will vouch for that ziprecruiter.com/twig.
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:21.120]   So we're doing TikTok now because it got funnier.
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:23.280]   It gets funnier by the minute.
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:24.640]   It gets even funnier, brother.
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:29.280]   So Sunday, Microsoft started the avalanche of news saying, "Yeah, we lost the bid."
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:33.680]   And then Oracle at first refused to comment.
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:38.560]   And then they said, "Well, it's not that we won the bid.
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:40.800]   There were only two companies as far as we know, bidding.
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.400]   Microsoft, Walmart, Oracle."
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:46.720]   When Microsoft said TikTok has informed us they don't want us,
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:51.360]   Oracle said, "Yeah, they don't want us either, but we're going to be their technology partner."
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:59.920]   Their hope was the president would accept it if the database was run by Oracle, a US company.
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:05.360]   But TikTok would still be a Chinese company, but they wanted to create a US subsidiary
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:06.320]   with tech.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.080]   And it'd be the majority shareholder.
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:08.320]   Right.
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:10.080]   Dancer would still own the majority.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:10.880]   They're not selling it.
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:16.240]   But Oracle and by the way, Walmart switched tables.
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:18.640]   Said, "Oh, we'll be in on this bid too."
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:20.320]   Because I think they want the e-commerce side.
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:24.720]   So the question now is, "Will the White House accept it?"
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:26.080]   They made the deadline.
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:28.160]   They announced it on Sunday.
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:29.440]   Well, that's the next punchline.
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:30.320]   Uh-oh.
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:35.040]   So the first thing that happened was Republican senators went after Trump and led by Cruz
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:38.880]   and said they were against the deal because China is still involved and China apparently has
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:39.520]   kudos.
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:40.640]   So they don't like this deal.
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:44.480]   That includes Marco Rio, Tom Tillis, Roger Wicker, Rick Scott,
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:47.520]   Dan Sullivan, John Cornyn, your favorite Stacy.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:49.040]   Okay.
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:51.760]   So that was the next chapter.
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:56.320]   And then a few minutes ago, Trump was at the podium saying that he's going to get
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:00.960]   updated on the deal tomorrow and decide whether he signs it.
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:03.520]   Like he's like, "Are you just a bill?"
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:04.320]   Like it's a bill.
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:05.600]   Yeah.
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:10.880]   This man, his ego, it knows no bad.
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:14.560]   He may still scotch the deal.
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:18.640]   Ultimately, they're pretty much...
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:21.920]   Ultimately, who really does weigh in, and this is Cepheus, right?
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:24.480]   The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:29.360]   They are the, as far as I know, the only governmental body was I guess Congress could scotch it,
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.520]   that could say, "No, this isn't a good deal."
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:35.440]   Isn't that only if other companies want to acquire...
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:39.040]   Is there is it when US companies want to acquire foreign companies?
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:40.480]   Does Cepheus work both ways?
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:42.880]   Oh, you're right.
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:43.360]   It doesn't.
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:48.880]   But if Oracle is a partner and it's China...
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:49.520]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:50.080]   It's a fork.
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.440]   If China wanted to buy Oracle.
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.360]   What happened is Oracle makes bite dance even richer.
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:55.520]   Oracle invests in the company.
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:55.840]   Right.
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:56.400]   Really what's happened.
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:00.320]   Oh, but Oracle's...
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:00.560]   And so the other thing is...
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:03.040]   The troubles are going to host on Oracle's imaginary cloud.
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:04.400]   Right.
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:04.640]   Right.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:05.520]   He said, "Hey, well said."
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:11.680]   The other thing is that I can't find the quote, but he apparently said something like,
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:12.960]   "Oh, I found out that I...
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:14.720]   We can't make money in the treasury from this."
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:15.680]   He just discovered that.
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:18.480]   Incidentally, Alex Stamos weighed in.
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:21.680]   He's the former Yahoo and Facebook security guy.
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:23.120]   Well respected in the security community.
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:24.640]   He's been helping Zoom.
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:28.080]   He said, "A deal where Oracle takes over hosting
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:31.760]   without source code and significant operational changes
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:34.960]   would not address any of the legitimate concerns about TikTok."
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:39.920]   And then he had to throw in a little elbow shot.
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:42.960]   The White House accepting such a deal would demonstrate
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:45.680]   that this exercise was pure grift.
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:55.520]   So here he even posted a beautiful...
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:22:00.240]   Is that a Venn diagram?
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:00.560]   Okay.
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:02.800]   That's still a, I think a Venn diagram.
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:03.040]   Yeah.
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:03.440]   Yeah.
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:04.240]   Still a Venn.
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:08.480]   So TikTok and other PRC-owned apps,
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:11.200]   that's a little bit of an overstatement PRC doesn't own it,
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:15.680]   but another PRC-owned apps poses serious risk to the United States.
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:17.600]   That's one circle.
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.080]   The US needs a federal data protection framework
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:22.880]   that is both more effective and less disruptive than GDPR.
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:24.160]   That's another point of view.
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:27.040]   It is racist to conflate the actions of the...
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:30.720]   People's Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:34.160]   with the Chinese people, students, immigrants, or Chinese Americans.
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:36.240]   That's another point of view.
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:38.720]   The current president's obvious anger at First Amendment
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:42.240]   protected speech on TikTok makes this situation more complicated.
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:42.720]   Yeah.
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:44.000]   That's another point of view.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.280]   That's fine.
[01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:48.480]   The president unilaterally banning an app
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:52.320]   without due processes un-American and that goes the Great Firewall.
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:57.520]   And then in the middle, you can be here, all of the above.
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:59.360]   How do we get that?
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:03.440]   How do we get that to all record style?
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:08.240]   Now, what will happen?
[01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:09.280]   Any prediction from the...
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:12.480]   You're in the dark and blurry.
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:14.160]   Sorry.
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:16.640]   Is it a little hot over there?
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:20.720]   It was for a second trying to get the focus, focus, focus.
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.160]   That's all right.
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:24.720]   I think somebody put Vaseline on Antsline.
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:26.000]   And you're the one that doesn't need a pretty...
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.520]   Because Ant was too pretty.
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:28.160]   That's the problem.
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:29.840]   This is the glitch show, I guess.
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:33.280]   That's all right.
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:34.080]   You could talk with that.
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:35.440]   I like the point.
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:35.920]   Okay.
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:36.800]   Well, I was going to ask...
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:38.560]   Just pretend you're in the shower, Ant.
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:41.600]   A little bit off of the subject,
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:45.440]   but I'm looking at this story and I want to ask you all personally.
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:49.840]   Like, if you have some conservatives in your own personal circle,
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:53.360]   with all of this stuff going on about the TikTok acquisition
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:54.800]   and the threats and so forth,
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:59.440]   what are the conservatives in your circle saying about this?
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:00.800]   I'm going to wear no mask!
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:03.200]   I can't imagine...
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:05.440]   Yeah, my conservative circle is not...
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:06.000]   They don't care.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:06.880]   They're not on the...
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:07.360]   They're not...
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:08.400]   Don't care about TikTok at all.
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:08.880]   No.
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:09.360]   No, not at all.
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:09.600]   Okay.
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:10.320]   Is that your point, Ant?
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:11.040]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:11.280]   No.
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:12.240]   Okay.
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:16.400]   Okay. So we'll watch with interest as the world...
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:16.880]   As...
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:18.160]   It's a real soap opera.
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:18.720]   It's a real truth.
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:19.760]   As the world turns,
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:23.200]   these are the days of our lives.
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:26.000]   Is that still on?
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.040]   No, I think all of them are on.
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:27.760]   Nothing's on now.
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:29.280]   Yeah, all the soap operas are over.
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:30.400]   They're...
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:30.960]   No, wait a minute.
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:32.400]   One of them started...
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:33.680]   Started taping.
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:34.160]   Really?
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:34.400]   Yeah.
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:36.080]   In a socially...
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:36.960]   You know what they're doing?
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:42.640]   When one of the actors has to make out with another actor for the show,
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:49.440]   they quickly swap out the other actor for the original actor's significant other.
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:51.040]   You serious?
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:51.680]   Yeah.
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:52.400]   They make out.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:54.000]   They show only like the back of their heads.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:54.960]   They make out.
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:57.360]   Then they quick cut and they put the actors back in.
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:00.080]   The actor back in 1980 all over the world.
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:01.440]   What if a...
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:01.840]   What if a...
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:02.320]   What if a...
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:04.640]   If a gay actress played in a straight character?
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:06.880]   Hmm.
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:07.120]   But...
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:08.080]   They don't get to kiss.
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:10.800]   And then...
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:11.840]   That's a really great question.
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:13.040]   I don't know what you start white.
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:13.840]   Yeah.
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:14.640]   I don't know...
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.560]   I actually...
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:18.720]   That's a really good question.
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:19.200]   I don't know.
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:22.320]   They've probably done the permutations and commutations of it.
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:23.200]   So, yeah.
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:24.400]   This is from...
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:26.000]   There's lots of Amazon news today.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:26.400]   All right.
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:27.920]   Let's do some Amazon news.
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:28.080]   Yeah.
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:31.040]   Amazon opening up...
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:34.640]   Planning to open up 1,000 neighborhood delivery hubs.
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:36.160]   To get closer and closer.
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:39.040]   Pretty soon, they're going to have a store on everybody's front yard.
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:42.400]   But that gains you nothing because you still have to drive a truck from delivery hub
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:43.360]   to delivery hub.
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:44.480]   I don't know.
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:45.360]   I don't get it either.
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:46.960]   It's just speed.
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:47.440]   It's about speed.
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:47.840]   Well...
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:48.080]   Well...
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:51.120]   You have fewer hubs than you have places.
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:55.120]   Well, you can also use machine learning.
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:58.880]   Well, there's not a pandemic swapping out demand suddenly to like
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:03.600]   grab what people locally need and want more often and stock those things.
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:06.240]   Don't...
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:06.960]   Yes.
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:07.600]   Yes.
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:10.480]   You can offer more things for me delivery.
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:12.640]   When I go on to order and it knows where I am,
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:15.280]   you could say you could have this now.
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:17.760]   Working with newspapers and getting them to do commerce.
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:21.600]   Well, do we found very clearly is that primed
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:27.680]   markedly increases the click through to a commerce offer.
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:28.160]   Oh, really?
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:28.720]   Yeah.
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:29.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:29.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:30.560]   Well, but I also...
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:33.280]   I have to say any convenience does.
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:35.040]   So on Apple, with I have...
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:36.800]   Because if I have Apple Pay button,
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:39.440]   or if I see a Google Pay button or an Amazon,
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:40.320]   anything that makes it...
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.720]   So I don't have to fill out a form and put in a credit card number.
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:43.200]   I'm going to...
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:46.000]   Completely reduces the friction.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.760]   Those are going to be dominant players.
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:51.760]   I could see now why Apple created Apple Pay.
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:56.880]   And so, you know, COVID has been very, very good to Apple.
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:59.840]   Because of course, the Apple Watch was a touchless payment.
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:00.720]   Everything is touchless.
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:04.720]   Apple just announced Fitness Plus,
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:06.560]   which is going to be touchless fitness.
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:10.880]   This is going to be part of their new Apple One bundle.
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:12.320]   You pay 10 bucks a month.
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:15.040]   You wear the Apple Watch.
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:18.400]   Your numbers are projected on your Apple TV screen,
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:20.880]   as are the workout, the fitness screws.
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:23.440]   It's kind of like a Peloton, except it's live,
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:24.480]   but it's not just a bicycle.
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:26.800]   There's yoga, there's weightlifting,
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:28.640]   there's rowing, there's bicycles.
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:32.000]   I think Apple is going to score big on this,
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.760]   because nobody wants to go...
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:35.360]   Do you not go into the gym, are you in?
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:36.000]   Yeah.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.040]   I can't, sir.
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:39.120]   But I hate that I can.
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:41.520]   It's driving me a little bit crazy.
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:42.480]   So there's going to be...
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:43.840]   I think that's going to be a mess.
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:46.080]   Peloton, which does the same thing,
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:47.040]   but only with spin.
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:48.800]   Actually, no, they have a treadmill too.
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:49.920]   No, no, they have sensors.
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:52.160]   They have a treadmill, they have a spin thing,
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:54.480]   but they also have classes where you have yoga.
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:55.040]   Yeah.
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:55.600]   Yeah.
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:56.320]   It's kind of hard.
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:57.200]   My bike is in the way.
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:58.240]   I have to climb over it.
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:27:59.440]   But...
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:02.400]   They always say,
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:03.600]   after I do this, because I have a peloton,
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:05.280]   after I do the spin class, they say,
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:08.720]   "And now stick around for the cool down warm up stretch class,"
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:09.280]   or whatever.
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:12.640]   I'm just like, I just bicycleed 48 miles.
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:13.440]   I am done.
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:14.560]   Done so.
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:15.680]   You take that class.
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:17.760]   That's why I was sore.
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:18.640]   No, you should do the stretching.
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:19.840]   Do the cool down, man.
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:21.200]   You got to do the cool down.
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:22.000]   Okay.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:22.480]   Yeah.
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:24.960]   I cool down in the hot tub.
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:26.640]   That's where I'm cooling down.
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:28.880]   Haven't you watched Hands on Wellness on Twitter?
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:29.680]   I know, I did.
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:30.800]   TV slash How?
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:31.520]   I know, I know.
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:33.680]   You should be like...
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:35.840]   So Leo, what are you going to rebrand Twit?
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:36.880]   To what?
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:38.240]   Twit plus?
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:39.600]   Good Lord.
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:43.200]   Did you see that CBS All Access is going to become Paramount Plus?
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:44.400]   Yeah.
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:48.480]   You said yesterday on Mac Break Weekly,
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:54.720]   that Apple pretty much is making the big brand and way to go.
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:57.440]   And I had to argue with you, but I was off the mic.
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:57.760]   Okay.
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:58.480]   You get to Google.
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:28:59.440]   What about Google?
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:00.080]   Google.
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:00.880]   Google plus.
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:01.680]   They invented plus.
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:02.640]   That was first.
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:03.760]   But they were spelled it out.
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:04.160]   They didn't.
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:05.200]   Did they or did they not?
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:06.560]   No, that was a plus sign.
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:07.440]   It was a plus sign.
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:07.840]   Right.
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:08.480]   Google plus.
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:09.760]   Yeah, it was.
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:10.880]   Give them their do.
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:11.840]   Apple's good in front.
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:15.040]   I with the used or plus what they used to do for I.
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:16.320]   People just have short minute brings.
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:17.440]   How about TikTok plus?
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:18.560]   Now with more Oracle?
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:21.360]   I think just cut everything down to I plus.
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:22.240]   Everything is just nine plus.
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:22.720]   Is this plus?
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:23.680]   How about plus plus?
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:24.960]   I, no I plus.
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:25.680]   I plus.
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:26.720]   I already eat a plus.
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:28.320]   How about Twit Pro one wins?
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:29.600]   Twit Pro will do Twit Pro.
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:29.600]   What Pro?
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:31.760]   One plus.
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:35.440]   Well, you could do the Twit Luxury version,
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:36.480]   which is what Amazon is.
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:38.720]   Oh, what's Amazon going to do?
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:43.440]   Amazon is opening up luxury stores where you have to be invited.
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:44.160]   Oh, please.
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:44.720]   Spend the fortune.
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:46.240]   I can't wait for me invite.
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:47.280]   I am so excited.
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:50.400]   So how much do I have to spend on Amazon to get an invite?
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:54.320]   I think you need to buy luxury goods.
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:58.960]   It's designed for like luxury brands to meet people who would buy their stuff.
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:02.080]   Although if I'm going to buy something from a luxury brand.
[01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:05.520]   Do you think I'll meet Kim Kardashian if I go?
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:07.760]   She's not luxury.
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:09.200]   Will Paris Hilton be there?
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:10.160]   She's luxury.
[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:11.360]   Are you kidding?
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:12.640]   I was in this business.
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:13.360]   Leave it or not.
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:15.760]   I was in this business when I was a Condé.
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:16.880]   The luxury business?
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:17.600]   File.com.
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:23.200]   Yes, we started Style.com and the idea was we said we create demand.
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:24.480]   Now we need to be able to fulfill it.
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:27.200]   We want that piece of the business because we were Condé Nash.
[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:29.520]   We could get designers that even Neiman Marcus couldn't get.
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:34.320]   So we did a deal with Neiman Marcus where they gave us a ready to buy
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:37.200]   open to buy.
[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:38.960]   I mean, and that was a budget.
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:43.280]   And then our people would go to the designers and pick the items.
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:46.240]   And then Neiman Marcus would stock them and Neiman Marcus would fulfill it.
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:50.480]   And this is an idea where we were going to be suddenly as a magazine.
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:54.000]   We're going to be a retailer at a very high end because we were going to give the designer
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:54.960]   comfort to be there.
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:56.240]   What happened?
[01:30:56.880 --> 01:30:57.360]   Crash.
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:31:02.720]   So then Neiman Marcus said, we don't really want to share revenue with anybody because we really
[01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:03.120]   have enough.
[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:07.760]   But what they did was the site stayed exactly the same.
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:09.360]   The consumer wouldn't know a difference.
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:10.640]   The business model changed.
[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:12.800]   No one was just now advertising.
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:17.360]   We sent them a customer and they paid for the space basically.
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:18.240]   And that's how it works.
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:19.920]   So it reverted to the mean.
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:22.160]   But there's been efforts.
[01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:26.080]   I remember when Sephora opened the cosmetics brands.
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:30.080]   Way against it because they had all their special things, their special counters,
[01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:32.240]   their special disks, special that until they find out the cells.
[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:34.880]   And they were way against online sales.
[01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:37.520]   They have have Connie Nash come in to make them comfortable.
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:41.280]   Well, now Neiman Marcus and Lord and Taylor are bankrupt.
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:43.760]   And people aren't going to stores.
[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:47.280]   So Amazon stepping in at just the right moment here.
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:51.360]   And to give them exclusivity to make them comfy.
[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:53.440]   So it will be interesting.
[01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:55.440]   It will be a physical brick and mortar store though.
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:56.800]   No.
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:57.840]   Oh, it's not.
[01:31:57.840 --> 01:31:59.200]   Oh, it's probably the app.
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:00.720]   It's just going to add parts now.
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:01.680]   Yeah, it's part of the app.
[01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:03.840]   So Amazon's been playing with this invite thing.
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:06.800]   They did do this with the dash buttons.
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:08.640]   They do it with the halo band.
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:10.320]   You have to request.
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:11.600]   This is different.
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:14.720]   The permission to buy from the great Amazon.
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:17.040]   You know, you and I aren't getting in on those.
[01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:18.160]   Stacey might, but we're not.
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:18.640]   Yeah, so.
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:20.800]   And I'm not sure.
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:24.960]   I spent thousands of thousands on, well, not now.
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:25.440]   It's sad.
[01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:29.040]   I have so much money left over from not buying crazy outfits.
[01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:29.920]   Oh, speaking.
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:30.480]   Yeah.
[01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:34.720]   So they're not going to come to me because all they see is the guy that's buying
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:38.320]   probiotics for his dog and packs of socks and.
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:40.480]   Oh, you're you're wearing the sucker hat.
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:41.360]   We're inviting you.
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:48.720]   So interactive features will begin rolling out with select garments at a launch allowing
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:54.240]   customers to explore styles in 360 degree detail so they can visualize fit.
[01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:58.960]   And making shopping for luxury easier and more engaging.
[01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:00.480]   They're going to launch with.
[01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:04.320]   Is Oscar De la Renta still luxury?
[01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:07.440]   It depends on he's got it.
[01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:10.880]   He's got a brand, but some of his clothes are some of the clothes designed by that
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:12.320]   brand are like multi thought.
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:14.480]   Is he sure though?
[01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:15.120]   He's not good.
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:15.680]   You're still.
[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:17.200]   Oh, is he?
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:21.200]   I don't buy Oscar de la Renta, but.
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:25.760]   It feels like that's kind of an older brand, to be honest with you.
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:28.000]   Here, Cardage.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.120]   Well, well, hold on.
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:32.320]   Even Marcus Oscar de la Renta coat here.
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:36.000]   First thing comes up, $20,996 and 50 cents.
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:36.240]   Okay.
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:39.360]   It's expensive, but is it good?
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:43.360]   I like the verge headline here.
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:48.080]   Amazon launches luxury store to separate the Huy Paloy from the Huy Koteur.
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:51.200]   Which are you Huy Paloy or Huy Koteur?
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:52.720]   Oh, very Huy.
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:53.920]   I think most people are both.
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:58.960]   I mean, like I buy Amazon basics tank tops and I buy Amazon basic.
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:01.200]   What else I buy?
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:04.080]   Stacy, what's your most expensive dress?
[01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:08.320]   Gonna get.
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:09.200]   Does Andrew know?
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:09.680]   It's.
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:11.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:14.560]   I have some Carolyn.
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:16.160]   Cara, is it Cara?
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:17.360]   Cara Lynn Herrera.
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:18.080]   Oh, Herrera.
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:18.400]   Yeah.
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:18.480]   Yeah.
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:19.440]   Those are beautiful, actually.
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:19.920]   I like her.
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:20.960]   They're beautiful.
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:21.280]   Yes.
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:22.800]   Yeah.
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:24.240]   What's your most expensive suit?
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:29.120]   I have, let me think.
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:37.360]   I buy like one suit of a decade, but my tuxedo, I think, is done hill or something.
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:38.240]   It was expensive.
[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:39.840]   Maybe a thousand bucks.
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:40.800]   I mean, that's, I mean.
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:42.160]   And what's your most expensive t-shirt?
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:46.720]   Maybe 25 bucks.
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:50.800]   And I didn't want to pay that.
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:51.600]   Yeah.
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:55.840]   $10 and we could talk.
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:56.720]   It could be.
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:59.520]   Hoyko, yours or hope.
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:02.800]   I used to have the protective coloration when I worked a condit.
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:03.120]   Yes.
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:04.800]   You probably had to look like Anna went tour.
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:06.160]   Did you have a, a Bob?
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:11.680]   I never pulled it off.
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:16.720]   Well, you know, this, this whole luxury thing for Amazon is a little confusing to me,
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:20.480]   but I guess it's just showing the change of times with all of the COVID stuff now.
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:26.640]   Because when I think about the shopping in the luxury stores, it was an experience, you know,
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:32.720]   something with that came along with actually going in there and getting that particular service
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:36.960]   right there in person and the way they spoke with you and the way the whole transaction went.
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:41.040]   It's not as satisfying versus pulling it up on a app hitting sin.
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:47.760]   I've seen you wear this, Carolyn, Carolina Herrera, Raglan, Maxi dress.
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:49.840]   I think I've seen you wear that.
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:52.160]   Oh, you know what?
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:55.840]   I realized I think my most expensive item is actually like an actress.
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:58.320]   I can totally stay in this.
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:00.480]   Pull it off.
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:01.280]   She can pull it off.
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:01.760]   Yes.
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:02.320]   Work it.
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:08.640]   Even the model doesn't look too happy about this.
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:15.120]   So Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian is going to stand up against hate.
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:19.680]   She's going to freeze her Facebook and Instagram accounts for a day.
[01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:20.480]   Just for a day.
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:29.360]   Hey, one day she's going to join two dozen celebrities in temporarily freezing their
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:31.440]   Instagram and Facebook accounts on Wednesday.
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:40.320]   Cheat you in the next day, her posts are going to be 1.5 million per endorsement.
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:41.600]   She says 1 million.
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:46.720]   She tweets, I love Facebook.
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:50.960]   I love that I can connect directly with you through Instagram and Facebook.
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:54.240]   But I just can't sit by and stay silent.
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:59.040]   While these platforms continue to allow the spreading of hate, propaganda, and misinformation,
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:04.400]   created by groups to so division and split America apart, I'll miss you all day Wednesday.
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:05.920]   That's some bull.
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:08.800]   Show me a sacrifice Kardashian.
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:10.480]   Show me a real sacrifice.
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:11.760]   Well, given that she has-
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:13.440]   She's married to Kanye.
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:14.480]   Yeah, that's a sign.
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:14.960]   Yeah.
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:15.600]   Yeah.
[01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:16.480]   That's less than art.
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:18.240]   She's got a hundred-
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:19.760]   That's gotta be difficult.
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:22.960]   She's got 188 million followers on Instagram.
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:26.320]   So she's the seventh most followed account.
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:30.160]   It's bringing attention to the hashtag #StopHateForProfit campaign.
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:32.640]   But, you know, we've taken one day off.
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:35.040]   Destroy your account.
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:36.720]   They're giving up the show.
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:38.640]   What does she need to be on Instagram for?
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:40.320]   So, Rich-
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:45.040]   It's a show because she can make more revenue off of her social-freaking media.
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:45.280]   Maybe.
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:46.720]   This is not a sacrifice.
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:48.240]   No, you're right.
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:49.040]   She's actually-
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:52.480]   It really funding these operations.
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:54.320]   Actually-
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:54.480]   Yeah.
[01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:56.000]   Yeah.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:56.480]   Yeah.
[01:37:56.480 --> 01:37:56.720]   Okay.
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:01.200]   Well, I'll give up my Facebook and Instagram.
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:02.160]   How about that?
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:06.480]   You do that, sir.
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:09.440]   Amazon is offering a thousand-dollar signing bonus?
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:18.160]   Um, that's a little weird because they're paying $15 an hour in most of those places, correct?
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:21.280]   That they're offering those jobs?
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:21.600]   Yeah.
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:25.760]   And a thousand-dollar signing bonus is really good,
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:30.880]   but you still think about the history of Amazon for those positions in the warehouse and
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:31.520]   things like that.
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:35.120]   That $15 an hour still seems a bit low, in my opinion.
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:35.440]   Yeah.
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:37.040]   Well, what about stripe?
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:38.640]   I read a hundred thousand people.
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:38.960]   Yeah.
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:40.240]   I mean, at least they're hiring.
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:42.880]   Yeah, at least they're hiring, but it's still-
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:49.760]   And don't get me wrong, I do understand a business trying to keep overhead
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:55.600]   at bay, but here Amazon, you can afford more than $15 an hour.
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:57.520]   Certainly looks like it.
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:58.000]   It affects the brand.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:58.880]   It affects the brand.
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:03.120]   Today is their hiring, today is their virtual hiring fair.
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:04.160]   Yep.
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:05.600]   And they have-
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:06.000]   My category.
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.880]   Are you going there, Stacy?
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:11.840]   You want to be a picker?
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:14.080]   Stacy, you're worth more than $15 an hour.
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:14.400]   Picker?
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:15.120]   Just so you know.
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:16.960]   How about this one?
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:18.160]   My time in the warehouse?
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:19.440]   I don't know.
[01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:20.000]   I would do it.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.520]   I actually want to be a Starbucks-breasted.
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:22.080]   That's my-
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:22.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:23.040]   That's my-
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:23.440]   You know what?
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:25.680]   My daughter's having so much fun working at Trader Joe's.
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:26.720]   I think you'd enjoy that.
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:28.480]   Probably.
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:29.280]   Yeah.
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:29.840]   You go out and-
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:31.360]   Because I love customer service.
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:34.160]   She likes it.
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:36.240]   She loves it because she loves people.
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:37.120]   She's really having fun.
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:38.720]   She's bringing some katyo e pepe home?
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:39.600]   Uh, better.
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:40.560]   She better.
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:42.000]   Actually, she's coming over Friday.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:42.960]   I was going to say,
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:44.240]   bring some katyo e pepe.
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:45.760]   They also have-
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:46.800]   They just talk to confusing us.
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:48.880]   They also have katyo e pepe ravioli.
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:50.400]   Oh, that sounds even better.
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:51.440]   Well, no, it's not better.
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:51.680]   It's-
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:52.160]   It's good.
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:52.560]   It's fine.
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:53.440]   It's just ravioli.
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:53.920]   It's fine.
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:55.440]   It's just ravioli.
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:56.960]   This is spaghetti.
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:00.880]   That's just ravioli.
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:01.360]   Which-
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:03.200]   is rolling his eyes right now.
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:03.920]   He literally is.
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:04.320]   There will be-
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:05.760]   No, he's so disappointed.
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:06.720]   So disappointed.
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:08.880]   I thought I had an ally to find out.
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:09.920]   What about-
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:11.040]   You know about Stripe, right?
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:11.920]   The company Stripe.
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:14.160]   They're the online payment step.
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:17.520]   So they are offering a $20,000 bonus
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:19.760]   to workers who move,
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:22.080]   but then you get a 10% bank cut.
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:25.840]   What?
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:27.760]   If you move out of San Francisco,
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:28.880]   New York or Seattle,
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:30.480]   which will save you a lot of money
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:31.680]   if you move to the right place,
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:33.600]   don't move to New York from San Francisco.
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:34.800]   That's not worth it.
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:36.160]   But if you're moving to somewhere,
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:37.600]   you know, in Idaho or somewhere,
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:39.920]   you'll save money on rent,
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:42.960]   but they're going to take 10% off your salary.
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:44.000]   What do you think of that?
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:44.800]   That feels-
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:45.440]   I wouldn't do-
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:46.480]   You probably in the long run,
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:48.640]   you're going to be given the cost of living in San Francisco.
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:49.840]   You'll still be ahead.
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:50.800]   You're going to make money.
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:51.280]   You're going to make money.
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:51.840]   You're better off.
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:52.480]   I just feel like-
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:52.800]   I don't-
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:53.120]   So-
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:54.880]   A company pays you for the work you do.
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:57.760]   It doesn't matter where you do it.
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:40:58.640]   What do you think, Stacy?
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:01.200]   No, you do so having not worked-
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:03.280]   Having worked four places,
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:06.000]   not in high cost cities for a really long time.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.080]   I will say that they-
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:13.760]   I never was paid less-
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:17.600]   Sorry.
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:18.480]   At a certain point,
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:19.840]   it becomes what you're worth,
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:21.200]   and you're worth what you're worth,
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:22.240]   no matter where you are.
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:22.560]   Right.
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:23.680]   And for those companies,
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:24.720]   it was worth it.
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:25.600]   Now, I will say,
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:28.720]   if a company is gaining an advantage
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:33.600]   from having a virtual workforce,
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:39.200]   then they shouldn't be cutting people's cost of living.
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:39.920]   Yeah.
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:40.320]   Or-
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:41.280]   Cliches and pay-
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:42.560]   Be cutting people's salaries.
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:43.520]   Right.
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:44.480]   But I also-
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:45.520]   So I will say though,
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:47.040]   a couple things.
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:48.240]   When I left New York,
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:49.120]   when I wasn't there,
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:49.680]   I-
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:52.080]   My company subsidized our MTA,
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:52.880]   our Metro cards.
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:54.960]   They still have Metro cards.
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:55.920]   I don't even know.
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:56.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:57.600]   Oh yeah.
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:41:58.080]   They do.
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:41:59.360]   Now you can use your iPhone, right?
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:00.320]   You're Apple Watch.
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:00.880]   Yeah.
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:02.080]   So advantage, right?
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:03.600]   So I lost some advantages
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:04.880]   by not being in the place.
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:06.720]   So there were things,
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:08.960]   but if they had tried to cut my salary,
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:11.440]   that would have been insulting because-
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:15.440]   I mean, they paid crap anyway,
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:16.640]   even though I was living in New York,
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:17.760]   because I was in journalism.
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:18.960]   So I don't know.
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:19.280]   I mean,
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:23.200]   maybe they should structure it better.
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:25.520]   Like you get a bonus when you-
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:27.520]   if you have to move to San Francisco,
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:28.960]   to buy your house or whatnot,
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:30.480]   and maybe you don't get that if you-
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:30.960]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:32.320]   Move to Idaho.
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:34.480]   But if you're winning,
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:36.880]   it goes on forever.
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:37.760]   You're in San Francisco.
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:38.720]   It's wildly expensive.
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:41.440]   I'm not sure what to do.
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:42.560]   I mean, I think you-
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:44.160]   But then there are costs-
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:45.920]   There are things you pay for.
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:49.360]   There are advantages that aren't part of your salary
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:50.240]   if you live in the place.
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:51.600]   Like you get your free lunch.
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:53.520]   You get free dry cleaning.
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:56.480]   You get subsidized transit
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:59.280]   that other people and other places don't get.
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:01.520]   I pay for my air conditioning bills,
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:03.360]   even though it's a lower cost of living,
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:07.360]   because they don't have to heat and cool the space for me.
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:10.080]   Call a leg of mine at my school,
[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:12.000]   the Craig Dumark Graduate School of Journalism,
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.400]   is moving to New York,
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:15.360]   which is in Canada.
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:17.120]   And she said the other day that she's got a-
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:19.120]   I think there's a room she would have rented out,
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:21.360]   but now she has to use it as the place where she teaches class.
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:24.800]   And if she moves to New York,
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:25.840]   if we're virtual,
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:28.480]   then she has to get a bigger apartment in New York,
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:29.440]   which is really expensive.
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:32.400]   So this virtual thing does cut both ways.
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:33.840]   Well, since you've been-
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:34.320]   I'm very sorry.
[01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:35.760]   Can I give a plug here?
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:36.320]   Yes.
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:39.120]   Kate Lee, who was my wonderful agent to Sherlock Business,
[01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:40.480]   is in charge of publishing there.
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:41.680]   They do really neat books.
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:43.840]   This one just came out of interest.
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:46.480]   The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:47.520]   by Nadia Eggball.
[01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:51.120]   And this books they do are very, very cool, very good.
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:53.120]   So I just wanted to give a little quick plug for that.
[01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:53.520]   Thanks.
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:59.520]   I've been on the side of the hiring part for
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:02.400]   looking at salaries, where company I worked for,
[01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:05.280]   we were trying to beef up the development team.
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:09.760]   But we also had the option of having people local
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:12.000]   to the facility or working remote.
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.600]   And now these people were doing the same task.
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:17.200]   They're on the same project, whatever.
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:19.600]   So the pay scale was pretty much even.
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:24.320]   Except it changed depending upon where those people were residing.
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:28.080]   Because say like Alexandria or Virginia,
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:30.880]   the cost of living there is going to be way more expensive than,
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:35.040]   I don't know, say Portland, Maine, something like that.
[01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:38.080]   So that had to be part of the negotiation,
[01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:40.880]   even though they're still going to be doing the same job.
[01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:44.960]   But the pitch today almost like we got to try to keep up
[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:47.040]   with your cost of living in your area too.
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:50.960]   So I get it from both sides of the spectrum.
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:55.680]   But at the same time, if the company is going to somehow
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:59.600]   still make money off of you, I don't like the idea of pay cuts.
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:05.680]   Yeah, you should never cut someone's pay unless you have to as a business,
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:06.960]   because it's otherwise untenable.
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:09.280]   I mean, they're going to free up real estate.
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:12.400]   Those costs are going to go down to their employees.
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:18.240]   And I'm like, you shouldn't cut these existing things.
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:20.160]   Then there's also the other end of the spectrum,
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:25.040]   where maybe these companies have leases that have some
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:29.520]   tremendous buyout clauses that's going to cost them a lot of money.
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:34.080]   Even though they're not there, shut down because of COVID or whatever.
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:38.320]   They're still having that extra expense of trying to get out of it at least,
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:39.520]   or keep the lease going.
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:40.480]   Who knows?
[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:44.640]   But that's what you do when you're a business.
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:50.960]   If you're not struggling, you don't optimize your operational costs at the expense of your
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:52.880]   employee base unless you have to.
[01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:55.920]   It should be the way we work.
[01:45:55.920 --> 01:45:57.440]   But that's not the way we work.
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:45:59.680]   But Stacy gets a different model here.
[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:03.040]   If you're a government employee and you're working for the State Department
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:07.120]   and they move you to Paris, you're given a cost of living in expense to be in Paris
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:09.120]   versus being in Nairobi.
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:12.480]   When you leave Paris and go to Nairobi, you know you're going to lose that money
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:15.440]   because that was earmarked for the cost of living there.
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:18.880]   Which is a better way to do it conceptually.
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:21.440]   The problem is, "Oh, we're going to hire in San Francisco.
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:23.120]   Here's the rate we pay in San Francisco.
[01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:24.480]   Oh, we're moving you to Chicago.
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:27.840]   Well, now you're going to get a pay cut as way it seems."
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:32.000]   Versus, "Here's the rate we pay for everybody for doing this work, no matter what."
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.320]   But if we require you to live in certain markets,
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:37.840]   we give you an adjustment while we're there.
[01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:40.160]   Would be a better way to have set it up long ago.
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:40.880]   But they didn't.
[01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:43.760]   So now they're trying to change into something that doesn't make any sense.
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:46.480]   So they make people piss off.
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:46.480]   Right.
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:47.920]   And they should, yeah.
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:52.400]   And they really should eat those costs because it's not like people stay at these companies forever.
[01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:57.920]   So, and being a tech company, when these people are like 45, they'll just
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:46:59.280]   lay them off anyway.
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:02.240]   I like to say that I am not people.
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:07.520]   Prior to coming to Twit, I worked at a company where I was there
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:10.640]   for a little over a year.
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:12.000]   It was almost two years, I think.
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.880]   But prior to that, I was at the company for 16 years.
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:17.680]   So I'm not people.
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:18.800]   I like to stay.
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:19.840]   I'm loyal.
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:20.560]   Good man.
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:23.360]   You better stay.
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:28.720]   I got a 16 pound brisket with your name on it.
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:30.560]   You better stay.
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:33.520]   I was like, "I don't know where this is going.
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:36.400]   I really feel like Aunt is people, but maybe he's not."
[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:39.840]   You're not that kind of people.
[01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:42.400]   There's a new American Girl doll.
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:45.440]   I know Stacy, you have, yes.
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:46.720]   And you're going to like it.
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:47.680]   It's Girl Power.
[01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:51.200]   She's a Pac-Man champion.
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:53.920]   Comes with a working arcade cabinet.
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:56.240]   She's it's 80s gamer Girl doll.
[01:47:56.240 --> 01:48:00.480]   I was meant to say she looks like I did when I was in elementary school.
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:01.360]   Isn't that cute?
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:05.040]   With the denim skirt, the pink tights, the leg warmers.
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:06.080]   Leg warmers.
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:06.960]   Creamed hair.
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:08.480]   I think her hair is crimped.
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:10.080]   Oh my god, I had a hair grip that was crimped.
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:12.320]   Is that a chapstick on a string around your neck?
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:14.560]   What is that you wear?
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:15.440]   Is it a lip gloss?
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:16.400]   Probably lip gloss, right?
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:17.360]   Is that a walk?
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:18.400]   She's got a Walkman.
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:18.960]   Look at that.
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:22.160]   Dude, the Wet N Wild.
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:22.480]   Yep.
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:26.960]   So for people who don't know, and obviously a few of us do,
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:29.120]   the American Girl is kind of cool.
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:34.160]   It's a doll series where the dolls represent young girls in different
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:36.800]   American points in the history, American history.
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:38.320]   So it's it's kind of fun.
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:39.760]   My daughter was so into it.
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:42.080]   I know your daughter is Stacy.
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:42.800]   She was.
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:44.480]   She's she's outgrown it now.
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:44.960]   I guess.
[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:46.000]   As was ours.
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.080]   Yeah, they outgrow it, I guess.
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:49.040]   Oh, yeah, they do.
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:50.080]   Yeah, it's too bad.
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:51.600]   Then you're stuck with a bunch of dolls.
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:53.360]   Nope.
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:54.560]   Sell them what do you think?
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:56.480]   Yeah, that's actually most of my god.
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:58.400]   Oh, I'd be shot.
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:48:59.120]   Oh, no.
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:00.160]   No, you have to keep them?
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:01.600]   Yeah.
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:04.080]   Do you is her bedroom exactly as it was when she left?
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:05.440]   Do you charge her storage?
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:08.560]   Because well, my wife's likes to get rid of a lot of things.
[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:08.960]   Yeah.
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:11.200]   Love to do my bookcases and that kind of stuff.
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:14.800]   But there's other things that just have a certain set of metal value that don't go.
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:16.320]   Her name is Courtney Moore.
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:19.040]   She grew up in California, San Fernando Valley.
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:20.640]   She's an.
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:21.040]   You be sure.
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:22.400]   Go ahead.
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:23.600]   It should be Stacy.
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:23.600]   Stacy.
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:27.120]   Because Stacy or Jennifer are the most 80s names.
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:27.760]   Yeah, Stacy.
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:28.320]   Yeah.
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:28.560]   Yeah.
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:29.760]   She and her steps.
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:32.160]   There are no Stacy's outside of that era.
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:32.880]   She and her steps.
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:34.240]   Is Stacy short for anything?
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:37.520]   Some people are Anastasia.
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:38.800]   Oh, okay.
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:39.440]   You Stasia?
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:40.400]   Stacy and Opolis.
[01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:44.720]   She's a total 80s girl whose favorite place is Smiley's Arcade.
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:46.640]   Because she loves playing video games.
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:48.560]   Courtney likes being in control of what happens,
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:50.880]   which isn't always the case in real life.
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:53.920]   She and her steps as to Tina don't always get along.
[01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:56.480]   And now that Courtney's mom is running for mayor,
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:58.160]   things are changing at home.
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:00.400]   It's a whole new game for Courtney.
[01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:03.280]   And she's figuring out the rules as she goes.
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:07.440]   And by the way, they're tying it into a scholarship.
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:14.320]   The American Girls Team with Girls who code a nonprofit mission
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:17.760]   to close the gender gap in technology to offer $5,000
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:20.960]   scholarships to girls to help further their education
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:24.960]   in computer science or related field.
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:26.960]   So good on you.
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:28.480]   I always liked American Girl.
[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:30.480]   That's even this is great.
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:31.440]   That's really great.
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:33.280]   Good for her.
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:34.640]   She's from 1986.
[01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:39.440]   I like Luciana was two years ago.
[01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:43.120]   She came with all these cool things like a rover.
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:45.680]   That's fun.
[01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:46.320]   But that's okay.
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:47.280]   And then they have a book.
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:48.080]   Luciana Vega.
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:49.680]   Yeah, then they have a book here.
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:52.640]   She is Courtney 1986, changes the game.
[01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:55.040]   There she is in her Pac-Man with her Pac-Man game.
[01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:56.160]   Well, those aren't leg warmers.
[01:50:56.160 --> 01:50:58.320]   Those are those boots with the open.
[01:50:58.320 --> 01:51:00.960]   It's so funny.
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:01.840]   It's so cute.
[01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:04.720]   Let's do the changelog.
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:05.760]   Johnny, you got the music?
[01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:06.960]   You got the drummers ready?
[01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:08.400]   Get the horns.
[01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:08.880]   Let's go.
[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:12.480]   The Google changelog.
[01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:19.040]   New stuff from the Goog.
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:21.920]   Google Duo is now available on Android TV.
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:24.720]   You won't find it in the launcher yet.
[01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:26.320]   And only half works.
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:30.880]   It's not fully functional.
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:32.800]   But that's good.
[01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:33.360]   It's coming.
[01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:36.320]   If you see it, is it even available?
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:40.000]   Yeah, no, this really kind of stretch the word available here.
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.120]   It's...
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:43.680]   You can sideload it, maybe.
[01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:44.080]   I don't know.
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:44.960]   You can't place...
[01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:46.480]   You can't receive calls.
[01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:48.480]   You can't place calls.
[01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:49.440]   No, you can.
[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:50.720]   You can install it and make calls.
[01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:53.120]   Keep your eye peeled.
[01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:53.760]   It's coming.
[01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:56.400]   Because you have to have a TV with a camera.
[01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:57.680]   But I think a lot of TVs do.
[01:51:57.680 --> 01:52:02.480]   Google Meet has added the largest grid known to man
[01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:06.800]   seven by seven, a 49 person grid view.
[01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:10.000]   If you're in that meeting, I am so sorry.
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.480]   Oh, I am so sorry.
[01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:14.160]   Wow.
[01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:17.040]   I don't even know what you would do in that meeting.
[01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:19.920]   Jesse, you probably have more than that here.
[01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:21.040]   You keep taking the boxes all in a row.
[01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:21.760]   Yeah.
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:22.880]   Yeah, tikki tak.
[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:25.840]   You have more than that in your classes, but they don't all...
[01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:27.040]   They're not all on screen.
[01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:28.800]   Oh, I don't have that one.
[01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:29.760]   No, no, no, we're small.
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:30.480]   Oh, you're small.
[01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:31.440]   We're small and intimate.
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:31.920]   No, no, no.
[01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:34.160]   I'm like, the social journalism was 16 students.
[01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:36.000]   But I was...
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.800]   My intro to journalism's were 500, so...
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:40.560]   I probably could use it.
[01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:40.960]   Yikes.
[01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:43.920]   How many of those people are still working in journalism?
[01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:44.800]   That's my question.
[01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:50.880]   Well, it's all included are PR people too.
[01:52:50.880 --> 01:52:52.880]   So my actual Jason classes.
[01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:53.440]   They went to the dark side.
[01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:53.920]   They were...
[01:52:53.920 --> 01:52:54.160]   Yeah.
[01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:55.920]   The dark side.
[01:52:55.920 --> 01:52:56.560]   Dark side.
[01:52:56.560 --> 01:53:00.320]   Waze has added lane guidance.
[01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:03.440]   Maps, one of the best features in Google Maps,
[01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:04.560]   knowing, you know,
[01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:08.400]   getting the second lane from the left now is very...
[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:12.640]   That's been popular on Google Maps for a couple of years now.
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:13.120]   Yeah, I love it.
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:13.520]   I love it.
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:13.520]   I love it.
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:14.640]   I don't know.
[01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:16.480]   Yeah, it's a huge...
[01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:19.200]   Of course, I have not used Waze since March.
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:21.200]   Well, who has?
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:22.160]   You don't need it anymore.
[01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:24.960]   You were a religious Waze user.
[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:25.760]   Oh, yes.
[01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:28.000]   Kevin Tofel had the story.
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:33.360]   Chrome OS 85 has quietly added AI-based handwriting
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:36.160]   that can recognition to some Chromebooks.
[01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:36.720]   That I control it.
[01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:38.160]   It'll never get me, man.
[01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:42.560]   This is something you got an iPad now with iOS 14,
[01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:45.120]   which came out today, iPad OS 14.
[01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:45.600]   It's called...
[01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:46.640]   They call it Scribble,
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:47.840]   where you have a little box you're writing
[01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:49.360]   and it translates it into text.
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.880]   Still, you know, this was always kind of the...
[01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:54.560]   For some reason, the Holy Grail of computing...
[01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:56.880]   I handwriting did generate it to the point
[01:53:56.880 --> 01:53:58.640]   where I definitely couldn't read it.
[01:53:58.640 --> 01:53:59.920]   I type everything.
[01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:02.000]   Doesn't everybody want to keep it?
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:02.000]   It wants to keep it.
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:02.960]   It wants to keep it.
[01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:04.160]   It wants to write.
[01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:05.360]   Who is writing?
[01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:09.920]   I still write notes every day for my task or what have to do.
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:13.280]   But it still looks bad when I look at my little...
[01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:14.960]   Both and Stacey think.
[01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:17.120]   Maybe that's the problem.
[01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:17.520]   I never...
[01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:17.840]   Wow.
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:20.080]   It'll stop when you get older, believe this.
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:22.160]   You won't bother anymore.
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:24.000]   I'm trying to think, but nothing happens.
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:30.880]   Google can now scan malicious files for advanced protection users.
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:34.560]   So Google Advanced Protection is intended for
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:36.880]   people in politics, public figures,
[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:41.600]   people who would be at higher risk of being hacked online.
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:46.640]   You have to use physical hardware keys to log in.
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:48.480]   There's some limits on what your account could do.
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:51.040]   And they're going to add a new feature today.
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:55.280]   Those enrolled will be able to send files
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:59.040]   that advanced protection suspects are malicious to be scanned and full
[01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:02.720]   by Google's Safe Browsing Malware Detection technology.
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:08.240]   So it's kind of like an antivirus scanning your files, your emails.
[01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:09.760]   That's a nice...
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:10.720]   That's a good feature.
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:13.200]   I bet you Google's scans are pretty reliable.
[01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:14.480]   How about...
[01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:16.080]   Did you know this?
[01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:21.040]   The Google Home app has a new presence sensing feature.
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:23.520]   It can sense...
[01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:24.480]   Oh, no, I didn't.
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:24.800]   Yeah.
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:27.920]   So let me see how this works.
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:32.000]   It uses Google's AI smarts to determine whether or not people
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:33.600]   are home based on their device activity.
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:37.120]   Now, NEST has always done that simply by your phone joining...
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:38.240]   The actual sensor.
[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:38.720]   The network.
[01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:39.200]   But this...
[01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:41.680]   Does it have an actual sensor?
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:43.280]   No, it's just your phone can be used.
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:44.960]   I was thinking of your Nest thermostats.
[01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:45.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:46.080]   That's right.
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:48.160]   Nest thermostats does see you, right?
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:48.640]   That's right.
[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:51.280]   It knows there's people moving around.
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:57.040]   But with the Nest cameras, you can say only turn on the cameras when I'm not here.
[01:55:57.040 --> 01:55:58.560]   And it does that for your phone.
[01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:00.080]   This is different.
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:01.520]   This is different.
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:05.520]   But if you have home and away routines or you want to set up home and
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:06.000]   retain...
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.320]   or away routines, you can do that.
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:10.000]   So I think that's...
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.240]   For instance, here, after everyone's away,
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:15.920]   you know, do this to the lights, lock the door, do all of that,
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:17.120]   I think that's really interesting.
[01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:20.720]   Yeah, and Netatmo has had that for years.
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:21.840]   And I was...
[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:25.600]   I wouldn't nest to introduce their cameras and they're hoping to waste stuff on the Nest alarm.
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:30.800]   I was like, "Why aren't you using presence detection to automatically set this?"
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:33.520]   And they're like, "Because we have other focuses right now."
[01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:34.160]   But eventually...
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:35.520]   They got around to it.
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:38.320]   You'll need version 2.28 of the Google Home app.
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:39.360]   It's coming as usual.
[01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:41.440]   They roll it out a bit at a time.
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:48.640]   And you can now share your screen in Google Duo.
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:51.280]   It's the only other person on Earth using it.
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:54.400]   My daughter and I duo.
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:56.000]   I got just this week.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.880]   I had five more of my contacts pop up on Duo.
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:56:59.200]   Nice.
[01:56:59.200 --> 01:56:59.760]   Wow.
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:00.080]   Wow.
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:01.440]   You know, Duo maybe...
[01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:02.800]   What if we use Duo over Stacey now?
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:03.840]   Would it work better?
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:04.720]   It's a slow burn.
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:06.000]   You want to try Duo next?
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.840]   There we go.
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:08.320]   I've got it.
[01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:09.680]   And that's...
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:10.400]   But then you're...
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:11.440]   I'm sorry.
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:16.000]   I was like, "But then you're stuck on this."
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:16.960]   I was like, "We're late."
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:17.280]   "We're late."
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:19.120]   Sorry.
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:20.000]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:20.560]   And that's...
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:23.360]   Your Google change line.
[01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:30.000]   Coming up next, it's our picks of the week.
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:33.280]   Why don't you start us with the pick of the week this week?
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:34.080]   Can't approve it.
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:36.720]   Some other news.
[01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:39.120]   You know, we talked about NVIDIA and ARM.
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:43.200]   But I don't think we mentioned CNET in that acquisition.
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:45.120]   You used to work for Tech Republic.
[01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:46.080]   Now it's not clear.
[01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:48.400]   Is Tech Republic one of the companies?
[01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:50.960]   I didn't see them listed in that acquisition.
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:51.280]   Yeah.
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:52.880]   It was one of the properties.
[01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:53.200]   But...
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:56.960]   It was funny because I had Ed Bot who works for ZEDI NET
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:57:59.440]   and Bill Detweiler, who's your former boss...
[01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:00.240]   My boss.
[01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:02.560]   At Tech Republic on Twitch on Sunday.
[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:04.640]   And I said, "You know, I hear CNETs for sale
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:05.920]   and Red Ventures might buy them."
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:07.600]   Zip.
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:08.000]   Yep.
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:08.560]   Not a word.
[01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:10.960]   So they might have known.
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:14.960]   But I would actually like to ask Bill if Tech Republic went.
[01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:16.080]   But everything else did.
[01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:18.880]   This was part of a CBS Viacom.
[01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:20.160]   They acquired a bunch of stuff.
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:22.640]   They've been slowly selling off bits and pieces of it.
[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:26.320]   They bought CNET for $3.2 billion.
[01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:28.960]   Is that my memory sold it for half?
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:29.440]   That's about right.
[01:58:29.440 --> 01:58:29.920]   A billion.
[01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:30.880]   Yeah.
[01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:31.840]   Four years later.
[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:32.000]   So...
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.960]   It happens.
[01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:35.680]   It happens.
[01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:38.240]   But I was talking to Mary Jofoli about this
[01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:40.720]   because she works for ZEDI NET.
[01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:45.680]   So many of the people on our shows work for CNET or ZEDI NET,
[01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:48.080]   which is the same thing in one way or another.
[01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:49.680]   And so...
[01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:52.720]   But it sounds like this would actually be a good thing.
[01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:53.840]   This is a...
[01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:56.960]   CBS Viacom is a massive conglomerate.
[01:58:56.960 --> 01:58:58.400]   And B2B focus, you know.
[01:58:58.400 --> 01:58:58.560]   Yeah.
[01:58:58.560 --> 01:59:02.400]   But also very marketing focused.
[01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:04.720]   I think there's probably some concern there about that.
[01:59:04.720 --> 01:59:06.080]   Right.
[01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:10.080]   So how long did you write for ZEDI?
[01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:12.640]   For ZEDI, CNET or tech republic?
[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:13.440]   Tech republic.
[01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:15.120]   I think it was three years.
[01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:16.800]   Well, that's a long time in this business.
[01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:17.920]   I think it was three years.
[01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:21.920]   But I wanted to share this article.
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:24.080]   And this was back when...
[01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:25.600]   I think it was 2012.
[01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:27.040]   And I was writing for...
[01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:30.480]   Writing for your friend, Miss Gina Smith,
[01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:31.840]   on her website.
[01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:35.200]   And it was the first thing that I had published.
[01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:37.360]   And it got picked up by ZEDI NET.
[01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:39.280]   And it just blew my confidence...
[01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:40.880]   Not to opt water.
[01:59:40.880 --> 01:59:45.120]   Mr. Jason Heiner saw it and linked to it on ZEDI NET.
[01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:47.920]   And it just really made my head big.
[01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:48.880]   And it just...
[01:59:48.880 --> 01:59:49.440]   It was great.
[01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:51.040]   And I just knew I wanted to keep doing that.
[01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:52.480]   Because I wanted to keep chasing it.
[01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:54.560]   Was this your first published piece?
[01:59:54.560 --> 01:59:57.520]   The Windows 8 article was.
[01:59:57.520 --> 01:59:57.840]   Nice.
[01:59:57.840 --> 01:59:58.960]   But now you can't find it.
[01:59:58.960 --> 02:00:00.560]   Because I guess the blog is down.
[02:00:00.560 --> 02:00:02.560]   But I said I'd never forget that.
[02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:04.480]   That's cool.
[02:00:05.120 --> 02:00:06.160]   That's cool.
[02:00:06.160 --> 02:00:07.920]   And I think this is going to be good for
[02:00:07.920 --> 02:00:10.560]   tech republic and ZEDI NET and the crew.
[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:13.440]   I hope this will be a good owner.
[02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:16.080]   They own a bunch of other consumer blogs.
[02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:18.720]   And so this will be their first tech venture.
[02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:20.320]   So I think this is a good thing.
[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:23.280]   I, of course, have worked for both ZEDI NET and ZEDI NET
[02:00:23.280 --> 02:00:24.720]   back in the day.
[02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:27.680]   And when I worked for ZEDI TV,
[02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:30.960]   we went through four owners in about five years.
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:36.880]   So Mary Jo said this is the fourth company to own her or ZEDI NET.
[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:39.840]   So yeah, everybody's worked for ZEDI NET at one point or another.
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:42.320]   It's a great, it's the like Zodica of tech.
[02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:43.200]   No.
[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:44.960]   That's not true.
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:46.720]   That's not true.
[02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:49.040]   Jeff Jarvis, do you have a number for us?
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:51.040]   Yeah, I'm going to pull something that I put up in the other,
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:52.080]   at the top of the other.
[02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:57.200]   Bessemer Ventures decided for God knows what reason to put up their investment
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:01:00.560]   numbers for a bunch of their investments over time.
[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:04.080]   Which I found really interesting.
[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:06.160]   So Bessemer's Adventure Capital Fund.
[02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:13.120]   So these are the memos they wrote before they invested or as they were invested.
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:14.720]   As in a good example, like a twitch.
[02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:20.880]   We recommend that they invest $30 million in Twitch,
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:24.240]   formerly known as Justin TV at $53 million in preview money.
[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:31.360]   Data-driven resource hidden efforts to give us the early indicator of the company's growth.
[02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:33.360]   Because it's got, yeah, sorry, that's what I picked up at one.
[02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:34.080]   I picked up at one here.
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:35.200]   There are more interesting ones.
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:39.360]   But this is if you were a startup or you were thinking about becoming a startup,
[02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:42.320]   this would actually be really interesting to read.
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:42.720]   Exactly.
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:47.200]   What made a venture capital fund sink money into you?
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:48.880]   What was it that they saw?
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:53.760]   Or at least what was it that the memo writer decided to highlight?
[02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:54.320]   Highlight.
[02:01:54.320 --> 02:02:02.960]   Solicicle when Yelp is a San Francisco-based early stage quotes Web 2.0 yellow pages company.
[02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:07.760]   First launch with a million dollars raised to Angel funding from Max Levchin at
[02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:09.520]   the California CTO PayPal.
[02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:10.960]   Founders to people who worked for him.
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:13.200]   They spent less than half the capital.
[02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:16.800]   We had the opportunity to lead the company's first venture financing with a
[02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:20.560]   five million dollar one handed investment and a 13 million pre-money evaluation.
[02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:23.280]   This is the part that I enjoyed.
[02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:26.240]   I've been tracking the company for several months was planning to propose an investment
[02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:27.840]   and bring them into a presentation next week.
[02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:33.600]   However, Business Week named Yelp, the top services company on the internet ahead of Craigslist.
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:36.880]   In their latest issue, which is the newsstanders on Friday,
[02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:41.520]   therefore, I tried to preempt Yelp's financing plans with the term sheet last week and agreed
[02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:42.960]   to terms with the company over the weekend.
[02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:43.680]   Oh, shoot.
[02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:44.880]   This must be a partner.
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:46.320]   This is a partner.
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:49.600]   I guess if he could write a term sheet, you know, sight unseen.
[02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:51.520]   Buy it.
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:52.560]   Nice.
[02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:54.640]   Yeah, you sometimes have to jump on it.
[02:02:54.640 --> 02:02:56.720]   There are a lot of ones that are kind of fun to read through.
[02:02:56.720 --> 02:03:00.880]   Well, and if you look at the portfolio for Bessemer,
[02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:04.240]   these are pretty good investment.
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:06.400]   Shopify wicks, pay-ger-duty.
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:12.800]   Bessemer is also famous for publishing every year a memo on the deals that got away.
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:19.120]   So they published deals that they saw and they passed on, which I always thought was kind of fun.
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:22.080]   I don't know if they still do it, but they used to do it in the early and late,
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:23.120]   early and mid-aughts.
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:28.240]   The anti-portfolio honoring the company.
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:28.240]   Yeah.
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:28.240]   Yeah.
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:28.720]   Yes.
[02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:37.120]   I'm going to be in the Apple Atlassian eBay, Facebook, FedEx, Google, Intel,
[02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:43.840]   Intuinous, Tia, Octa, I remember that word PayPal, Snap, Tesla, and Zoom.
[02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:46.800]   So that's gots you have them.
[02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:48.480]   Can I do a number two?
[02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:51.760]   I actually have way too many picks, but I'll do a number then we'll let Stacey
[02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:58.080]   do. But I given that you're talking about for high finance, how about $8 billion?
[02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:00.560]   This guy Chuck Feeney.
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:01.360]   Should we do a car now?
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:02.480]   Should we do a car now here?
[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:04.720]   $8 billion.
[02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:10.480]   This guy Chuck Feeney founded the duty free shops.
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:12.880]   Oh, wow.
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:13.760]   Outstanding.
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:15.360]   And made $8 billion.
[02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:16.480]   It has been his goal.
[02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:21.200]   He's the guy who inspired Warren Buffett and Bill Gates to do their foundation work.
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:25.920]   It was his goal to give it all away in his lifetime.
[02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:32.080]   He created the foundation is the Atlantic philanthropies at one point.
[02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:33.600]   It had offices all over the world.
[02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:38.080]   300 employees day before yesterday he finished.
[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:41.840]   He kept $2 million for himself and his wife.
[02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:50.640]   He's in his 80s just to live on gave away $8 billion.
[02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:52.160]   Oh, right.
[02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:57.120]   Some amazing causes including Cornell University, which he went to on the GI Bill.
[02:04:57.120 --> 02:05:01.600]   He it's really a great story.
[02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:02.640]   I was pretty amazing.
[02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:04.800]   I knew somebody important who worked there.
[02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:08.400]   And then one day his job was gone because the money was almost gone.
[02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:16.400]   There's a great picture of Chuck and his wife signing the papers on Monday to dissolve it.
[02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:17.680]   Wow.
[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:18.240]   It's over.
[02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:22.480]   And man, this is what billionaires should do.
[02:05:22.480 --> 02:05:24.320]   Okay.
[02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:26.640]   This is what they should do.
[02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:28.240]   You don't make money in a vacuum.
[02:05:28.240 --> 02:05:30.800]   You make money because society supported you.
[02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:34.640]   And he gave back to Cornell, but he also gave to a lot of really great causes.
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:38.560]   And I got a I got a commendant for that.
[02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:40.240]   Stacy, what's your thing this week?
[02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:46.640]   Well, so I wanted to offer an update from a thing a couple of weeks ago.
[02:05:46.640 --> 02:05:47.680]   So wanted to do that.
[02:05:47.680 --> 02:05:48.880]   Firewalla gold.
[02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:50.160]   I think I told you all about that.
[02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:57.360]   Kevin got the review unit and man, if y'all are like we talked about network segmentation last week,
[02:05:57.360 --> 02:06:02.320]   this is a device that would actually help you do this in addition to provide VPN.
[02:06:02.320 --> 02:06:05.120]   Constant network awareness.
[02:06:05.120 --> 02:06:07.840]   This is an indigo go actually.
[02:06:07.840 --> 02:06:09.920]   This is an indigo go.
[02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:12.160]   So if you go to our site, you'll see Kevin's review.
[02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:12.480]   Okay.
[02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:13.440]   Oh, there you go.
[02:06:13.440 --> 02:06:14.080]   There's the indigo go.
[02:06:14.080 --> 02:06:17.760]   You can get it early still or 409, I think.
[02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:18.480]   It's expensive.
[02:06:18.480 --> 02:06:19.120]   Or 19.
[02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:20.080]   But you can.
[02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:24.560]   So it's a little hardware box with built in powerful built in stuff.
[02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:25.680]   Super powerful.
[02:06:25.680 --> 02:06:28.240]   And you can actually run containers on it.
[02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:32.480]   So if you wanted, you could run your home bridge on this or home assistant.
[02:06:32.480 --> 02:06:37.840]   Mine will show.
[02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:39.840]   I don't remember.
[02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:44.080]   So yeah, if you want the review, Kevin wrote that up.
[02:06:44.080 --> 02:06:45.280]   And then my other thing.
[02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:47.520]   Crap, I had it.
[02:06:47.520 --> 02:06:48.400]   Now I've forgotten it.
[02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:48.960]   Oh my god.
[02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:52.880]   So they, this isn't their first firewalla.
[02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:54.320]   They did a couple earlier.
[02:06:54.320 --> 02:06:55.520]   I think you mentioned this.
[02:06:55.520 --> 02:06:56.560]   Yeah, I had a blue one.
[02:06:56.560 --> 02:06:58.240]   Yeah, this is the update.
[02:06:58.240 --> 02:06:58.640]   Yeah.
[02:06:58.640 --> 02:07:00.720]   I had told y'all about the firewalla gold.
[02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:02.800]   And then I was like, "And Kevin's going to review it?"
[02:07:02.800 --> 02:07:05.360]   And lo and behold, he has now reviewed it and it is good.
[02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:09.680]   Did he review it on about Chromebooks or on your site?
[02:07:09.680 --> 02:07:11.440]   He reviewed it on Stacey on IT.
[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:12.480]   Sorry, this is me.
[02:07:12.480 --> 02:07:14.720]   Pro, this is pushing my site.
[02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:15.600]   I think you should.
[02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:16.000]   Well, more precisely.
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:17.200]   Did he like it?
[02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:18.640]   Your audience will like this gadget.
[02:07:18.640 --> 02:07:19.520]   Yeah, he loved it.
[02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:19.920]   Yeah.
[02:07:19.920 --> 02:07:20.880]   He sold me on one.
[02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:22.000]   I just went and bought one today.
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:25.120]   Oh, I'd like to hear your experience setting it up.
[02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:27.360]   You just bring it in.
[02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:28.160]   Really?
[02:07:28.160 --> 02:07:29.200]   It's just plug and play?
[02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:32.560]   No, you got to set this got to be work for this.
[02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:33.520]   This has got to be work.
[02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:37.120]   Reed, Kevin, see, he said it was pretty easy.
[02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:37.680]   Yeah.
[02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:37.840]   Wow.
[02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:39.040]   He said it was pretty plug and play.
[02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:39.920]   No, nice.
[02:07:39.920 --> 02:07:40.640]   That's what I'm like.
[02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:43.680]   They make a lot of very difficult to use features.
[02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:44.720]   Easy, T.
[02:07:44.720 --> 02:07:45.120]   Easy.
[02:07:45.120 --> 02:07:47.920]   And as someone with a wacky network,
[02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:50.240]   plus an interest in seeing where all my packets go,
[02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:52.560]   I'm like, "Hey, yeah, I want this device."
[02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:54.240]   Okay.
[02:07:54.240 --> 02:07:58.320]   Crap, I totally forgot what my thing was.
[02:07:58.320 --> 02:08:00.560]   And I'm going to remember when we hang up and it's going to be so sad.
[02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:01.840]   How often have I said that?
[02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:02.960]   Oh, oh, okay.
[02:08:02.960 --> 02:08:03.840]   I remember.
[02:08:03.840 --> 02:08:04.080]   Yes.
[02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:06.960]   Actually, I always forget where my thing is.
[02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:08.640]   So it's a little different.
[02:08:08.640 --> 02:08:09.280]   Okay, go ahead.
[02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:12.880]   I was looking for my physical cue and I was like,
[02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:13.600]   "Where is it?
[02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:14.480]   I don't see anything."
[02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:15.760]   Oh, wait a minute.
[02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:17.120]   You know what, this firewall,
[02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:20.560]   while a gold would actually be good for what we were talking about last week,
[02:08:20.560 --> 02:08:23.840]   for network segmentation of your IoT devices.
[02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:25.040]   Because...
[02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:25.520]   Where did God?
[02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:26.480]   I just said that.
[02:08:26.480 --> 02:08:27.200]   Did you say that?
[02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:29.280]   But wait a minute, Stacy.
[02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:32.480]   Did you notice it'd be good for the network segmentation?
[02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:34.080]   See, there it is, your IoT network.
[02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:36.480]   Oh, I'm getting this.
[02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:37.120]   That's good.
[02:08:37.120 --> 02:08:39.680]   Did you just say that really?
[02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:41.200]   She did.
[02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:42.560]   I'm busy typing stuff in.
[02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:43.120]   Thank you.
[02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:44.880]   Yeah, I'm trying to find pictures.
[02:08:44.880 --> 02:08:50.960]   Stacy, I used to be on KGO with Ron Owens.
[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:51.920]   Who did you do that to you?
[02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:54.080]   Well, we know.
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:55.920]   We're talking with each other, right?
[02:08:55.920 --> 02:08:57.600]   And he starts something going on about...
[02:08:57.600 --> 02:09:00.080]   Oh, I think what the president did today.
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:05.680]   And I was here from Stacy in Washington and hit the button.
[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:09.760]   And Stacy's talking away, and then he just tunes it out and starts talking to me for five minutes.
[02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:10.080]   Yep.
[02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:14.640]   And then occasionally he put his hand up and he just turned the mic back on and said,
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:15.520]   "Why do you say that?"
[02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:17.360]   Turn the mic back off and the conversation with me.
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:21.840]   I was a secret of the radio stars, my friend.
[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:23.600]   So, he's never paid attention.
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:24.800]   I do that all the time.
[02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:26.640]   Oh, really, Stacy?
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:27.280]   Did you show where we saw...
[02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:29.280]   You know, that'd be good for network segmentation.
[02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:30.000]   That'd be great.
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.240]   You could use that for net, really.
[02:09:32.240 --> 02:09:34.320]   I'm sorry, Stacy.
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:36.080]   I'm going to say something, meet on Facebook.
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:39.120]   I got five minutes by it because Jarver's going to go off and that's fine.
[02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:44.080]   Actually, I used to do run all the time, too.
[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:45.440]   We have something in common.
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:49.760]   I was his regular tech guy, legend in...
[02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:50.160]   Whatever the...
[02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:51.680]   If the lights...
[02:09:51.680 --> 02:09:56.240]   I took it as personal if the phone lines wouldn't start jamming up.
[02:09:56.240 --> 02:09:59.200]   So, whenever I got to that point where I was desperate, I'd just say,
[02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:01.840]   "You know, you can't get a decent pizza in San Francisco."
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:03.840]   Oh, yeah.
[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:06.560]   So, let me ask Stacy, though, one more time.
[02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:08.560]   Would this be good for network segmentation?
[02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:10.720]   I think it would.
[02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:12.400]   Like, we were talking about last week.
[02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:17.920]   I'm just worried that it'll be too complicated for my little brain.
[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:19.680]   No, no.
[02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:20.640]   It's really not.
[02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:21.120]   It's not.
[02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:23.120]   Or, I'll tell you again next week.
[02:10:23.120 --> 02:10:25.760]   But Kevin says it's not, and Kevin actually does...
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:28.320]   I know he's smart and adept at things, but he's also
[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:30.880]   like aware of normals.
[02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:35.120]   So, you know, you can read Kevin's review,
[02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:36.480]   because it is expensive.
[02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:41.200]   But I feel like people who play with their networks and like value these things,
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:42.960]   this is actually not a crazy thing.
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:45.360]   And, tons of horsepower.
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:47.280]   Although it gets hot, he says, because there's no fan.
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:50.400]   Okay, so don't stick it in the closet, y'all.
[02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:56.000]   Okay, here's my actual new thing,
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.640]   because that was just an update to a thing that I promised I'd tell you about.
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:10:59.440]   Yes.
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:04.960]   I did a list of things that you can use that are not if in response to if going pro.
[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:07.520]   For people who don't want to.
[02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:11.040]   And the two apps that we talked about, Zappia,
[02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:13.600]   but the two apps that I wanted to remind everybody exist,
[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:17.120]   one is an app called, you know me, Y-O-N-O-M-I.
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:21.040]   And that will actually put that on your phone.
[02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:24.080]   It autodiscovers things on your network.
[02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:26.720]   And it actually suggests recipes that work,
[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:29.120]   but you can also build recipes or routines.
[02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:31.280]   The other, and that's free.
[02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:38.960]   The other option is a company called O-L-E-S-T-O.
[02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:40.400]   This is a European company.
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:44.000]   They're instead of applets, they call it Triggs.
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:50.400]   And they actually let you do more things to trigger your events.
[02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:56.000]   And they have a fairly wide list of devices that you can set up your Triggs for.
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:59.040]   And if you're a smart things user, it's going to be great for you,
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:01.600]   because they support smart things, they support Philips Hue,
[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:06.320]   Somfi, Sonos, a lot of European brands.
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:07.760]   Like is it Mille?
[02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:08.320]   I don't know.
[02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:10.000]   Fancy, fancy, full appliances.
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:14.960]   Nuki, that's a lot company in Europe, they support TPLink.
[02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:17.920]   They say they support Nest.
[02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:20.720]   I don't actually believe them because Google Nest thing,
[02:12:20.720 --> 02:12:23.600]   but they support Netatmo and LaGroll.
[02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:26.720]   Cool stuff.
[02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:36.240]   I was just wondering about the segmentation issue on that firewall.
[02:12:36.240 --> 02:12:36.880]   I was going to say that will not happen.
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:40.320]   [laughter]
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:41.840]   He was laser focused.
[02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:47.360]   All right, I got a lot of picks, but I'll do a couple here.
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:51.520]   First of all, I forgot to mention this on the Twit.
[02:12:51.520 --> 02:12:55.040]   I'll have to make it up to Corey, because I was going to mention this on Twitter.
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:12:57.040]   On Sunday, Corey Doctorow was on Twit two weeks ago.
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:12:59.440]   It's one of my favorite people in the world.
[02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:03.360]   Super smart EFF, competition guy.
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:09.920]   He's responsible for a lot of great novels and nonfiction works.
[02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:17.840]   He may know Little Brother, which is a great book about privacy and about modern technology.
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:20.320]   The third in the Little Brother book is coming out.
[02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:23.920]   And Corey is dead set against copy protection.
[02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:28.560]   So he decided he doesn't offer his books on Audible because they insist on copy protection.
[02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:34.240]   He doesn't offer them on kindle or not, but he decided to do a Kickstarter
[02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:42.480]   for the third of these books, Attack Surface, which is coming out pretty darn soon.
[02:13:42.480 --> 02:13:47.760]   It succeeds Little Brother and Homeland with the--
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:50.400]   Is your production value he hired actors for?
[02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:58.960]   Oh, he hired a star to do the reading, which he says, "I use the same producer Audible uses."
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:02.480]   I mean, he decided to do a really good job with this.
[02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:03.680]   I love Corey.
[02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:05.600]   I think he's super talented.
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:06.880]   20 years at EFF.
[02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:10.000]   You remember he was one of the founders of Boing Boing.
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:13.920]   His current blog is at pluralistic.net.
[02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:18.640]   But if you want to support Corey and his plan to create a great audiobook
[02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:25.440]   without having to make it copy protected, his goal was to raise $7,000.
[02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:28.480]   He's already raised $195,000.
[02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:31.040]   But there's three weeks to go as he well deserves.
[02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:37.760]   There's two weeks to go on this Kickstarter, but I think getting the audiobook of Little Brother,
[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:40.400]   and by the way, you could-- For only $15.
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:41.680]   Yeah, you can pledge-- You can pledge.
[02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:42.960]   You know, $15 bucks and get--
[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:43.520]   For the war.
[02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:44.160]   Yeah.
[02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:46.720]   I mean, I think that's a really good deal.
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:50.560]   And you also get the ebook, I think, as well.
[02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:53.360]   And then Amber Benson's version of this.
[02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:57.680]   "AudioBook 15," audiobook and ebook is 25.
[02:14:57.680 --> 02:14:59.360]   So that's one plug.
[02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:02.480]   And another plug, our friend, Baratunde, has a new podcast.
[02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:09.440]   Baratunde is going to be on Twitter on Sunday, but his new podcast is called How to Citizen.
[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:10.720]   How to--
[02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:11.680]   Oh, I saw this.
[02:15:11.680 --> 02:15:12.640]   I think I can play this.
[02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:14.160]   Yeah, he's the greatest.
[02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:17.760]   He is a sweet guy, smart guy.
[02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:19.040]   He wrote How to Be Black.
[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:21.040]   He's been on our shows for many years.
[02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:26.720]   And I just think he's well worth-- You can see the trailer.
[02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:31.440]   But if you just go to baratunde.com, B-A-R-A-T-U-N-D-E.com,
[02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:32.160]   you could find his podcast.
[02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:32.800]   Love that, dude.
[02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:33.360]   He's a podcast.
[02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:34.320]   Yeah, isn't he great?
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:41.520]   How to citizen-- reimagines the word citizen as a verb and reminds us how to wield our collective
[02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:50.400]   power. Now's the time to stand up instead of as I often do despairing or giving up or just going,
[02:15:50.400 --> 02:15:52.880]   I can't take it.
[02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:58.400]   It's time maybe to get activated and he'll help us do that.
[02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:04.640]   So a couple of plugs for dear friends who've been regular on Twitch, and I want to give them
[02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:06.560]   good plugs.
[02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:12.560]   Now, though, I'm looking for some way to segregate my IoT network from my main--
[02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:13.520]   Oh, I have a sense of pride for you!
[02:16:13.520 --> 02:16:15.200]   I'm wondering if Stacey--
[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:15.680]   Yes, that's a product for you!
[02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:18.160]   --has anything that might do that.
[02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:20.160]   She probably knows.
[02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:22.960]   Stacey Igebotham. She knows everything.
[02:16:22.960 --> 02:16:24.640]   She's the smartest person I know.
[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:28.400]   She's at StaceyOnIOT.com, @GigastaceyOnTheTwitter.
[02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:32.320]   She does the podcast with the Kevin Toffle, the IoT podcast.
[02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:36.560]   And someday we're going to get her gigabit and, man, you will be blown away.
[02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:38.480]   --by how--
[02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:39.760]   May just be skypating me.
[02:16:39.760 --> 02:16:45.600]   Yeah, I don't know. Zoom looked great, but then Skype sounded bad again, and I don't know.
[02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:46.160]   Yeah, I did.
[02:16:46.160 --> 02:16:46.400]   Yeah.
[02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:47.040]   I don't know what to do.
[02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:49.440]   You should move, Stacey.
[02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:52.640]   I'm not here next week, so you don't have to-- it's one less week of me.
[02:16:52.640 --> 02:16:53.200]   Oh, no.
[02:16:53.200 --> 02:16:54.800]   Oh, no.
[02:16:54.800 --> 02:16:56.160]   Are you doing an event?
[02:16:56.160 --> 02:16:58.640]   Something that we should tell the world about?
[02:16:58.640 --> 02:17:00.240]   Oh, you know what? I lied to you.
[02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:01.040]   It's not next week.
[02:17:01.040 --> 02:17:02.800]   Oh, I'm a week ahead of myself.
[02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:02.960]   Car--
[02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:04.880]   No, I'm not doing my event.
[02:17:04.880 --> 02:17:06.000]   Pants off, Carston.
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:07.680]   Sorry, Carston.
[02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:08.080]   Sorry.
[02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:09.680]   No, she will be here next week, Carston.
[02:17:09.680 --> 02:17:10.080]   Don't worry.
[02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:14.720]   I don't want to get this vision of Carston without pants.
[02:17:14.720 --> 02:17:15.440]   Stop doing that.
[02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:17.200]   I'm pretty sure he's not wearing them now.
[02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:18.000]   The Leonard Ta--
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:22.880]   That's the Leonard Taill Professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark
[02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:25.520]   Graduate School of Journalism at the C. University of New York.
[02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:30.160]   He is Judge Jeff Jarvis, the Citizens' Jurist.
[02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:31.920]   Border in the court.
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:33.520]   I'm going to send you a gavel.
[02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:34.480]   You need a gavel.
[02:17:34.480 --> 02:17:36.080]   You need a gavel.
[02:17:36.080 --> 02:17:38.720]   Stacey's--
[02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:39.440]   Wait a minute.
[02:17:39.440 --> 02:17:39.920]   --what's going on up your head.
[02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:42.560]   Stacey will not be here next week, according to Carston.
[02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:44.800]   Baratunde will be here next week.
[02:17:44.800 --> 02:17:46.000]   Yay!
[02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:46.800]   You're a lovely girl.
[02:17:46.800 --> 02:17:47.600]   That was just you, but yay.
[02:17:47.600 --> 02:17:48.560]   Hey.
[02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:49.600]   Yeah.
[02:17:49.600 --> 02:17:50.400]   Hey.
[02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:51.920]   How come Baratunde is going to be in the wrong one?
[02:17:51.920 --> 02:17:52.720]   I'm on.
[02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:55.440]   I like-- he's one of my heroes, man.
[02:17:55.440 --> 02:17:57.360]   So Carston, I got it wrong.
[02:17:57.360 --> 02:17:58.800]   Baratunde's not going to be on twig.
[02:17:58.800 --> 02:17:59.680]   He's going to be on twig.
[02:18:00.400 --> 02:18:03.040]   I would wonder I saw it on the schedule and I was worried that we--
[02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:04.320]   Yeah, no, that's good.
[02:18:04.320 --> 02:18:04.640]   No, that's good.
[02:18:04.640 --> 02:18:05.200]   No, that's good.
[02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:06.400]   That's great.
[02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:06.720]   Yeah.
[02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:07.520]   I love Baratunde.
[02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:07.760]   Yay.
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:09.200]   Yeah.
[02:18:09.200 --> 02:18:10.080]   That'll be fun.
[02:18:10.080 --> 02:18:14.320]   So even if you could be here, Stacey, you really shouldn't.
[02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:17.840]   Stacey!
[02:18:17.840 --> 02:18:21.200]   No, actually, actually, I will make you this offer.
[02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:24.480]   We'll just put another TV screen on the stage,
[02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:26.400]   and you can all be here.
[02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:26.880]   Yeah.
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:28.880]   Just widen the shot, baby.
[02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:30.720]   Do we have enough inputs to do that, right?
[02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:33.040]   Burke's going on, baby.
[02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:33.600]   I don't know.
[02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:34.080]   I don't know.
[02:18:34.080 --> 02:18:34.480]   Maybe.
[02:18:34.480 --> 02:18:35.840]   He's like, no, no, he's got--
[02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:35.840]   I don't know.
[02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:36.640]   I don't know.
[02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:37.600]   I don't know.
[02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:39.600]   Actually, our Tri-Caster's starting to break down.
[02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:41.360]   Use your overhead.
[02:18:41.360 --> 02:18:43.360]   Yeah, we can do it.
[02:18:43.360 --> 02:18:44.480]   I don't need an overhead shot.
[02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:45.120]   Yeah.
[02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:45.680]   No, no, no.
[02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:47.200]   Or Baratunde could be over my head.
[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:47.200]   Okay, y'all.
[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:47.680]   Y'all, y'all.
[02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:50.880]   Hey, Baratunde, what do you think?
[02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:53.680]   Thank you, Jeff Jarvis.
[02:18:53.680 --> 02:18:54.640]   Thank you, Stacey.
[02:18:54.640 --> 02:18:55.440]   Ant-Pruit.
[02:18:55.440 --> 02:18:57.520]   Don't forget hands-on photography,
[02:18:57.520 --> 02:18:58.880]   hands-on wellness,
[02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:01.120]   twit.tv/hop,
[02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:03.920]   and twit.tv/how.
[02:19:03.920 --> 02:19:06.400]   And it's great to have you.
[02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:07.920]   Thank you, sir.
[02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:10.720]   Everybody, if you want to watch us do this silly thing live,
[02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:11.280]   you can.
[02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:13.680]   We're on twit.tv/live.
[02:19:13.680 --> 02:19:15.840]   That's our live audio and video streams.
[02:19:15.840 --> 02:19:17.600]   You can tune in.
[02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:18.640]   It's usually around--
[02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:20.160]   we try to get about 2 p.m.
[02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:21.760]   Pacific, 5 p.m.
[02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:22.160]   Eastern.
[02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:26.240]   That's 2100 UTC of a Wednesday afternoon or even.
[02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:27.280]   Come on by.
[02:19:27.280 --> 02:19:27.920]   Come on by.
[02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:29.040]   Watch us do the show.
[02:19:29.040 --> 02:19:31.280]   If you're doing that, your fingers are up to it.
[02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:32.080]   Join us in the chat,
[02:19:32.080 --> 02:19:35.440]   rmirc.twit.tv.
[02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:39.680]   You can also get on-demand versions of the show audio or video
[02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:42.000]   from our website, twit.tv/twig.
[02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:45.280]   We are, of course, on YouTube.
[02:19:45.280 --> 02:19:47.600]   There's a whole YouTube channel devoted to twig.
[02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:49.760]   But the easiest thing to do is go to the main twit channel
[02:19:49.760 --> 02:19:52.400]   and find a link there that's youtube.com/twit.
[02:19:52.400 --> 02:19:56.400]   I think probably all of you by now have a podcast app,
[02:19:57.040 --> 02:19:58.880]   pocket castor, overcastor,
[02:19:58.880 --> 02:20:02.720]   stitcher, slacker, Google podcast or Apple podcast.
[02:20:02.720 --> 02:20:05.600]   One of those, you can find the show there.
[02:20:05.600 --> 02:20:06.640]   Press the subscribe button.
[02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:07.520]   It won't cost you anything.
[02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:09.120]   You'll get it every week, the minute it's available.
[02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:10.320]   It's not a notification.
[02:20:10.320 --> 02:20:11.680]   It just appears.
[02:20:11.680 --> 02:20:12.960]   It's even better than that.
[02:20:12.960 --> 02:20:17.600]   Don't forget, we are also on the Amazon flash briefing page.
[02:20:17.600 --> 02:20:19.120]   If you listen to a flash briefing,
[02:20:19.120 --> 02:20:22.320]   you can add twit to each day's flash briefing
