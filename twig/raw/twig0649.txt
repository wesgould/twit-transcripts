[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.040]   Yes
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.640]   Is that yes, I do or yes, I don't yes you do you do okay the Leonard Tau professor for journalistic innovation at the

[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.760]   That never gets old although what I really wanted this point
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.360]   I really want like like a selection of like 30 different options and I realize that right people
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.200]   Yeah, exactly every every week you get a different one and the kind of
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.160]   Audience people let's let's hear some singing. Yeah, say no
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.160]   Hard rock kind of version you
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Folksy version
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.640]   Look at our strumming. I think I think a Baroque version be very nice
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.520]   Baroque version would be good. Yeah
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.400]   Coral Corral
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.280]   Corral they shouldn't all be fancy singers a cappella singers. We should have yeah, you get some barbershop in there do walk
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:01.280]   Okay, I think we also need someone to represent just the standard like bad karaoke singer version would be good
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.440]   I could do that. Oh, Cheryl. Yeah, yeah, anyone of us could be that I'm both tone deaf and loud
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.520]   Have you done karaoke Stacy of course I have oh
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.760]   Okay, I
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.520]   Alright, it's just a need for something like cuz I'm yeah, I embrace all that's
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.240]   But I'm you know, I'm not afraid to get up in front of people and say crazy things so
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.680]   Yeah, yeah, why not do it off key. Yeah
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:40.080]   So then f and have you done karaoke before are you fans of karaoke? Nope. I have I've done it
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.120]   um
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.400]   Just as
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.520]   To goof off. I used to manage a support team and we would go out and they want to do karaoke
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.400]   So I would do it with the team just for morale purposes or whatever it's not really my personality
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.160]   But you know I'll do it but you do it you take one for the team
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.040]   Is there is there a go-to song? We're like if I got to be up here
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.680]   I bet you anything Whitney Houston because she can actually sing unlike
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.960]   That one person mica sergeant loves
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.000]   Who who is that?
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.560]   What kind of internal host drama is happening here?
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.200]   I'm serious. I've missed out on this drama
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:21.920]   Oh, man me and mr. Sergeant. We go at it over the on say, you know, oh
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.320]   Okay, okay. Beyonce does not have the range that uh Whitney Houston is but I mean she's talented
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.640]   but when I think of people that can sing, you know, when I think of people that can sing
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:38.400]   I think of people where when the sound comes out you can tell it came from their toes. I mean it's rich
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.160]   Yeah, I can say okay. I'll give you that
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.480]   Yeah, that's true. That's true and jeff. I'm disappointed
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.600]   I thought for sure you had some karaoke in your in your history. No, no
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:58.400]   I mean look at how he was watching right now folks. You think he's going to do karaoke. Just look at that posture
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.880]   Yeah, that's not a karaoke face right there
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.720]   No, but that's that's exactly why I want to see it
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:11.600]   Or never in person again acquire
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.840]   Mr. Ant
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:20.080]   I'm just imagining you in the bar right now with that posture singing journey or something
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.560]   Don't stop it's believing
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.440]   Yes
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.480]   See
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.760]   Even that's fine. Even that would be your hand. You're quite right
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.680]   The thing I hate most about any gathering anywhere is the icebreaker
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.800]   Yeah, I hate icebreakers. I despise I bring I don't do ice breaking. I stay iced
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.360]   I respect that. I am ice. Don't break
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.200]   I do not fall
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.080]   There we go. There we go
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:08:00.160]   Awesome. Well, we I hate to disappoint anyone who thinks that we're going to have a karaoke challenge right now on the show
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.680]   We save that for after the show for club twit so
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:14.320]   That's not a threat. That's not a threat. I promise
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.120]   It's often karaoke. You don't have to hear it
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.600]   Right
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.600]   Well, why don't we stop splits?
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.440]   Let's yeah, let's talk about stock splits google for one
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.040]   Has has a plan to split some stock
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:36.080]   Because I guess it was you know too expensive and now they're like we want more people to get on on this and it was by the way
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.480]   A really good earnings
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.680]   report
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.640]   Oh the breaking 200 billion dollars of annual revenue for the first time
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.680]   Pretty big deal
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:54.080]   Yeah, you just imagined 200 billion dollars and I mean that's not even real money. No, it's not
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.560]   I know I can't imagine it
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:02.960]   Actually, it kind of makes my brain hurt in the same way as when I think about the vastness of space like I start to bring down when I think of
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.960]   Money in that yeah, it's if it came in cash
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.560]   How long would it in hundred dollar bills? How long would it take to count that?
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.200]   a long time
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.640]   eternal
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.440]   What percentage of that is from the ad revenue
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.400]   Oh, I the basic
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.400]   96 percent. I think it's lower now. Yeah
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.880]   Um used to be 98 percent. I mean it was it was they were so dependent upon it
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.920]   Let me see if it's in there. There was it there's a point to me asking that I meant to grab it before the show
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.920]   There's a point to everything you say
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:40.080]   I don't know the true answer to that question, but I mean I have to imagine it's it is still absolutely the majority and blows
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.960]   Everything out of the water. I mean, I don't know and also separates
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.360]   I think it's interesting to look at at the ad
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.760]   Infrastructure versus Google ad versus YouTube ad. Yeah, it's also interesting to see
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:58.320]   Um more than 80 percent of the company's revenue and it grew 41 percent in 2021
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.640]   Which is a lot is there
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.080]   Insane
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.160]   Insane
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.200]   Oh man. Yeah, 41 percent owed year over year
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.120]   um to
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.120]   257 billion dollars
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Um, so it's interesting about the stock splits
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.240]   It's very yeah, so I didn't yeah tell me tell me a little bit about stock split because I'm not
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.360]   I'm not incredibly familiar with
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.880]   With the why I mean I guess I understand the why when a stock gets too valuable splitting
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.520]   It allows more people to get in but if you own the stock and it gets split
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.480]   You're like you're you're part of your celebrating right because that doesn't really go up
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.840]   It doesn't it doesn't always have that it's a 24 one split
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.200]   So a share valued at 27 53
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:50.240]   Goes into 20 shares values at 138 dollars. What interests me though is this
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:55.440]   That gets below the threshold of going on the Dow Jones
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.320]   So what that says is google becomes a
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.160]   An economy driving grown-up company
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.760]   Finally they grew up
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.040]   Exactly. They finally finally could shave yes
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:14.240]   Unlike in Jason. Well, that's that's if you still think the Dow Jones industrial average is
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.760]   It's like a good proxy for the economy and I don't think
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:24.400]   Yeah, it's a media thing. I agree, but but it's like I don't think most investors are like oh, yes
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:30.160]   You know google who cares. It's not on the Dow Jones, but yeah, right? Yeah, like us
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.320]   Think it's a
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.440]   I don't know. It's it's like the actual graduation ceremony
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:41.040]   You're like, yeah, but really, you know, of course you're graduating. That's a really bad. Yeah, what did you learn? Yeah
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:46.480]   You've been getting days your entire life. Of course you're graduating google
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:52.880]   Um, like a journal says that apple and tesla splits helped extend rallies in their shares
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.800]   It did
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:12:00.800]   Yeah, usually a split is a great news for everybody because you only split when you think that your stock is way too expensive
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.720]   And there's demand for it. So then you split everybody gets excited
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.960]   and more people buy it and brings it down to like reasonable levels
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.280]   and
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.920]   You see this all the time the you know only
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:21.920]   I can't think of a poorly performing company that has done a stock split right? It's just it's a sign that things are going well
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.760]   alphabet stock right now at
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.400]   2,960 a share
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.160]   so
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.000]   not bad so so that
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   So then would that be factored?
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.200]   Essentially like that number divided by 20 and you've got your new share price is that how that works?
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:44.400]   I'm 7% today because of these results last night. Oh, okay. That was a huge jump
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:51.280]   You know because some people I mean you really want to buy a share in a company, right? So yeah for sure gives you
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:56.080]   If you're that type of person now you can buy a share instead of a quarter of a share
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:01.920]   Yes, or an eight give it to your like, you know, like your grandparents give you like five shares
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.640]   of a stock that they feel is meeting you know, and I
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.960]   Was given I was given one share of Reebok when I was a kid
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:13.280]   And it was wow a single share of Reebok
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:18.880]   Yeah, I mean, no, I mean that's that's a way that you teach her. I mean we did it with our kid
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:24.640]   It's the way you teach your kids about owning stocks. You're like have them pick that you just are like hey pick out a stock that you
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:31.440]   You know and then they get to follow it and you teach them about they get to track it. Yeah, I remember tracking that stock track
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:37.120]   Reebok and a ledger every day opening up the newspaper and tracking it until I got really bored of doing that
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.120]   And then I just forgot about it, you know now
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:49.280]   I mean today's kids get a beta crypto. Yeah, yes exactly. Yeah, there's a ether kid
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.440]   I know
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.440]   3% of a bitcoin
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:00.480]   Yeah, heart is always watching bitcoin because the the likes of paypal and
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:07.040]   I was a cash app made it easy for people to buy into a share of bitcoin
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.960]   So they're always sort of just looking well my oldest is anyway
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.280]   Just sort of looking at it and seeing if he's gonna get any kind of money out of it
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.840]   I'm like dude. You don't have 30 grand. So just just sit it and leave it, you know
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:25.280]   Yeah, yeah, do your kids own NFTs and no sir
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.680]   Not yet would you know if they own NFTs
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.240]   That felt like such a part of your kids in the back alley buying NFTs
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:40.160]   I'm pretty sure they would ask me about it. They ask me about a lot of different things
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:45.520]   If they're not quite sure when it comes to trendy stuff in tech
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:52.560]   They'd ask me or they go look up something mica sergeant said on one of his shows is what it boils down to
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:59.200]   Um, but no they haven't gotten into NFT said they knew that I started doing them and just sort of oh
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.360]   Okay, good luck and when I'm about the business
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:11.360]   I mean it is interesting from from the perspective of you know the kids who are growing up now like like your kids old enough to be aware
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:18.240]   Aware that there is a thing called cryptocurrency and that there's something going on there and that maybe you can make a lot of money
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:24.640]   Maybe you don't or whatever but that awareness like they're young enough to evolve and grow with right technology
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.960]   and it seems like they tend to have more than you or
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:33.360]   They tend to have more of a grasp on it than most adults our age. Yeah, that makes sense. I
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:39.520]   Don't know if they have a actual grasp or they just understand the social shenanigans
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:44.240]   So like my daughter for example, she has her school has a computer
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.520]   She's an IB school. So they have an IB computer science program
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:52.960]   And those kids actually built their own NFTs and sold them as part of like learning about them
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:58.880]   And she I was like that sounds really fun, you know like way to way to get a sense of
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:04.720]   Understanding this and she's like yeah. Oh my god, mom. It was so stupid because all the crypto bros
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.920]   Do I even want to be loved him at that? I'm like oh wow
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.720]   I mean like so so there's like
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:15.440]   Oh god. Yeah, like the biggest eye roll for those guys those crypto bros
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.280]   Yeah
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:23.920]   Theater kids. You got the theater kids. You got the brainiacs and you got the crypto bros
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:28.320]   She just like it's not her friends
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.560]   It's it's not the high school click. It's just everybody on the internet who talks
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.600]   She's just like they're just she's like it's just a pump and dump
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:41.760]   Which i'm like, how do you know what i'm pumping? Wow? She knows a pump and dump all the terminology. It's out there
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:44.960]   Yeah, we'll see that's nice
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:52.480]   It's exactly what I mean. I mean they but they might not have a deep a deep seated understanding of exactly what's going on
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:57.840]   Man as hard as I try I have I I barely understand so much about you know
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:04.320]   crypto and web 3 and all that all that craziness but but if they're starting at a point where this is
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.520]   It's not even at the the point of maturity
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.200]   It's it's really still at the point of like proving it's that it is a thing
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.280]   And what is that thing in defining itself?
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:18.560]   But they're young enough to kind of grow and evolve with the development of it
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:23.760]   And I I mean a part of me has to believe that that that that means something
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:29.920]   I don't know. I I guess I just don't feel like something like cryptocurrency is automatically like
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:34.880]   That's totally shady. It doesn't have any legs. It's not going anywhere like there's enough
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.040]   There seems to be enough energy with it including this example that you know
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:45.360]   Maybe it maybe it leads to somewhere and maybe they they will ultimately end up understanding away better than the knots
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.560]   As a result. So peter kafka did a really good piece this week
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:53.440]   Um recode in which he tried to kind of figure out. I don't understand
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.040]   uh
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.800]   Crypto and I tried to get into it and and went through and tried to do things in it
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.520]   So it was it was a good piece, but it what really strikes me is that there's a couple things one is that
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:10.080]   It's still a solution looking for a problem. Two is the people who represent it are generally obnoxious
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:15.760]   And then three it gives kudis to a technology that could be useful
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:20.720]   If people turned it around the other way and started with the need and said oh that could solve this problem
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:25.520]   But instead it's people saying this is so hot you're not gonna believe it and if you know you're stupid
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.640]   That doesn't help the cause very much. Yeah
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:33.520]   It's like a gold rush mentality. There are actual use cases
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.120]   Oh, yeah, or distributed ledgers and blockchains
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.240]   there's I mean
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.840]   if I look at
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:48.160]   cryptocurrencies as an incinivization incinivization, I don't know there was a way to incentivize people to
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.360]   Like participate in like a network
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:56.720]   So i'll go with helium because it's the most obvious of those, but there are several others that are
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.920]   coming around maybe that aren't as hyped as helium
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.080]   and
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:06.720]   I think they might be a good incentive for like a distributed network. So I
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.560]   Yeah
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:12.400]   I think so I wrote a piece years ago now 2015
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:18.800]   Talking about what I called credit rate as an alternative to copyright where you want to have a way to record and reward
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.200]   contributions to a chain of creativity
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.440]   I did that not knowing about bitcoin not knowing about about crypto or blockchain
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.800]   But in fact what I want to do could be done on the blockchain
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:34.160]   Or another example I tweeted about today is is that when I buy I buy mine tons of used books lately because
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.760]   of research
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.400]   And I wish that the author could get you know 10 cents of it
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.080]   Yeah, well
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.240]   You could set up a contract such that if the book gets resold
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.920]   Um, something can happen of course a physical object that's not so easy. I know I know I know
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.160]   But you can imagine those kinds of models
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:54.560]   Where you say that there's an ongoing reward to someone and it's okay to pass it along
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.640]   And and profit from it because you do have first sale rights and you do own it
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:03.600]   But but you can also set it up so that it benefits others along the way along the chain of
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:10.160]   Of ownership those kinds of things then it would create a used market for digital books, which would actually be lovely
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.840]   Yes
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.440]   Thank you
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.120]   If you had the rights to get them out of the
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.720]   Yeah, you don't sit in prison didn't but yes
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:23.200]   Uh by the way
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:29.600]   Yeah, um folks in chat were we're correcting this is no longer nft by the way. It's nefed
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.680]   Apparently apparently that's okay
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.720]   I
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.560]   I'm glad they brought this up
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:38.960]   Because I have real strong feelings about this and I saw this article and I was like
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:43.440]   One who is this like somebody who's just trolling us all with like a gift
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:48.160]   Debate kind of felt like that like hot dogs being a sandwich because that's what it feels like
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.560]   I say it's not nefed. It's nift. It's nift. I did not see it
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:58.160]   I'm gonna insist on nift just an nft y'all really we gotta say nefed
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.920]   I mean who else show of hands is gonna call it a nift
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.280]   Hey, the bigger question is did y'all fernge today?
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:15.040]   Say fun. Yes, but I able like
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:20.000]   That just sounds wrong
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.880]   Wait, what is the rationale for it being called a nift? I'm sorry
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:29.600]   That's a really that's a really cool question and and know something you don't know
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:34.000]   Yeah, no, come on the verge wrote a whole article about it. It's got to be something
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.360]   What is it? I mean it's go to be quite all this. I did not I did not read the article
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:44.080]   I saw the headline and I was like yeah now. I don't even just not go that's what I did too
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.720]   But maybe they've got a really good reason
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:52.800]   Yeah, she stays always so nice. She always thinks that there's got to be some people have to do things for a while
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.520]   I'm just a journalist. I want to understand. I know
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:59.520]   All right, I'm reading the article
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.480]   Is this taking forever to load?
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.880]   It's almost like
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:09.840]   I mean in my very very, you know brief scanning of this is almost as if
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.880]   Oh, no, this is just the verge
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.360]   Yeah, the folks who wrote it had some sort of like a a chat
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:22.800]   Like a slack chat or something like that where they went off on this and then ultimately ended up writing an article
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:30.080]   Like one of the points here is that nft is already filled when you phonetically spell it out with tons of ease
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:34.800]   Therefore, why not just have it be nift as an eft right?
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:38.400]   That's sorry
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.320]   I kind of don't know why those articles are
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.840]   Pure gold we used to do them all the time at kick it home our slack
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:50.960]   Silly things and everyone clicks on them it gets in the comments and we all talk about it on twitter
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.280]   It's kind of what the internet's for
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.520]   Yeah, yeah, that's true. That's very true
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:03.840]   Um, the other the other part of the results were um had to do at least that a lot of people were you know kind of
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:09.440]   Writing about had to do with a comment that soon DARPA CHI CEO the company made
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:17.360]   About the company's hardware a division said in q4 we said an all-time quarterly sales record for pixel
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:22.080]   This came in spite of an extremely gee a supply chain environment. So
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:29.360]   Internally like we don't actually know if the pixel six is their best selling pixel device yet
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:33.600]   You know, we still got the rest of the year of sales for for it to get there
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.520]   but
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:42.880]   Google sounds pretty uh pretty happy with the performance that it has received and i'm kind of not surprised either
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.320]   If if the performance was was good google was very
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:52.080]   Um very vocal in the beginning about its plan to market the heck out of this device
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:58.240]   Um prior to it even being officially announced there was a lot of energy and excitement about it
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.520]   It's a very different looking piece of hardware. So it's really easily
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.400]   Identifiable when you go into a carrier store
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.840]   Number of reasons why it would do better than there are other pixels but
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:12.480]   Doesn't hold a candle to you know any of the other major hardware players
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:17.520]   Let's let's be honest google is not the next samson here with uh with their picks and it's too heavy
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:22.240]   And it's too reemium this stacy is premium
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:26.240]   Yes, it's too heavy for my delicate sloppy wrists
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:31.600]   Just damaged me forever
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.160]   Yeah, you you got rid of it. How is your wrist?
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:39.680]   Otherwise, um, I did get rid of it and my arm is getting better, but is still not great
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:47.680]   Um still hasn't recovered from the pixel six. Wow. It wasn't the pixel six. I got some shots in a tent in last week
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.400]   Oh, okay. All right
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:56.160]   It's good. It's good. It's not like the pixel six did not help my arm beforehand for the reason I needed the shots
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.480]   So sue them
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:03.840]   No, I just instead I bought a pixel five and i'm so sad. I do not like that phone at all
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:11.440]   You don't oh, i'm sorry. Maybe it's a five. Is it a five a no? It's a five a the five a no?
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.520]   I got the five. I had to buy it used. Yeah, what don't you like about it?
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.720]   Exciting I still have the camo case on it
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:25.520]   Um, I don't like that it doesn't have a phone jack. I just it's just a boring not very exciting
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.240]   It's like a mere phone. It just feels like oh
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:35.680]   I upgraded but I didn't really upgrade now. No, it's it's kind of seem to six felt like an upgrade until the next
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:40.160]   The six felt like an upgrade, but it was an upgrade. I literally could not hold for very long
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:43.440]   So I couldn't I literally could not use it. So it was
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:50.640]   I'm like, you know, it's kind of how I feel like when you go by a car and all they've got us sub's and you're like, but I just
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.520]   Want a car?
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:26:01.120]   I wish I got the six not a six one. No. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I wonder about that too
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.800]   I mean, I do really love having a telephoto
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:11.760]   So that's kind of the primary reason that like I want the six pro because I have a lot of moments where I want to use a telephoto
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:17.760]   And I don't want a digital zoom if it wasn't for that. I probably would would be absolutely fine with the six
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.320]   I think the six it was probably the better value all around
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.960]   Yeah between the two
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:27.840]   But and then and then there's the ants of the world who it you know all this kind of doesn't matter
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.600]   It's just kind of a
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:35.360]   A craptastic device. It sounds like you've you've been no no no no no no no the device is
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.840]   12
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:42.320]   That's right. That's right. The device is okay, but okay, but at one point
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:49.280]   Do you find any sort of confusion separating the device from the os because I I don't know through my experience
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:55.280]   They're so intrinsically kind of connected to a certain degree and other pixel. I just think thanks to my previous
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.680]   the previous phones that I've
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:59.920]   Worked worked with or what have you in?
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:06.880]   The os got out of the way, you know, the phones were not necessarily rated to be the best of the best
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:12.720]   Kind of thing but it didn't matter because the operating system allowed me to do whatever it was I needed to do
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.440]   We're here with android 12
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.920]   You know up until this last update
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:26.640]   It was a buggy mess everything was just a flat-out mess any type of um navigation with the freezing and crashing and
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:32.400]   It wasn't good. It's better now, but it's still not quite perfect
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:37.120]   Yeah
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:42.240]   Yep, I don't think you're alone as far as as far as but I'm glad they're selling because they'll make more of them
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.680]   That's a good thing
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:52.000]   Yeah, yeah, and I mean there's you know, there's been some leaks and some kind of details getting out there about the next a series
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.840]   The pixel 6a sometime in may it's gonna have you know, it's gonna be a different a series phone
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:06.880]   Um my understanding it's gonna kind of follow the design aesthetic of the six which makes sense, right? They'd want to keep that that um
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.960]   So it'll be heavy
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:15.680]   Well, that's a good question. No actually because like like are the materials gonna be glass or is it gonna be plastic?
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:22.720]   You know or or something which is what they've done on the a series prior is kind of go for a more plastic design instead of the glass
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.880]   And that might reduce some weight. Is it gonna be smaller? Like I don't really know the answer
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.000]   We you know, we don't have the answers all of this stuff here is
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:38.560]   Good and interesting or whatever, but I just wish google would prioritize just core functionality of that operating system
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:44.240]   There's been a lot of talk about this update like this. We're just gonna do this and this
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:49.760]   Service will do that this ai service will do that for you on the cloud and yada yada yada
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:58.000]   But yet just swiping through is a pain in the butt because it hangs so often or crashes so often
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.560]   Fix the core functionality before you get into all your bells and whistles
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:08.480]   Yeah, what is it mind doesn't crash. What is it you tended? Is it is it photographic stuff that makes it crash?
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:16.400]   Or this was before the update, but just you know swiping from the tray back up to your main screen or even going to the
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:20.080]   Didn't was that feed all the way to the left the news feed thingy?
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:26.000]   Swiping over this gabber or whatever it is. Yeah, and even launching stories out of that would crash it
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.960]   You know, I'm never you trying to get me to read this stuff and you won't let me read it because it's just
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:36.240]   Constantly crashing. Um, but it's but that's way better now now. I'm just seeing
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.440]   I still see some bluetooth
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.040]   toggles off
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:44.400]   Here and there but nowhere near as much as I used to so I'm not even going to
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.840]   Sweat that right now because that may be me doing it
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:54.480]   Yeah, yeah, and what's so frustrating too is when you're talking about a device like, you know
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:58.240]   Like the pixel six is not everybody has the same experience, right?
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:05.280]   Even when you're talking about software and hardware inconsistencies or frustrations that one person has it, you know
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:12.000]   When I when I experience something it feels like this should be something that everybody that also has this phone has also
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.640]   Experience but that isn't ever the case right like there's a number of people that never experienced that
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:22.000]   Um, and so he's like so then you're left, you know questioning what you just said like no
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.320]   Maybe it's just me and how I'm using my phone, but at the end of the day your big gas split my phone
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.800]   But I know exactly the whole work
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:35.840]   Even down to the whole fingerprint scanner thing and how much of an uproar that caused I did see improvement on it
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.720]   Um after that update, you know, so it's
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.080]   They worked on it. They just need to continue to
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:46.960]   Work on that stuff a little bit more and prioritize just core functionality
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:51.600]   Make sure you can actually use the dad gum phone before you start making it all cute
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.640]   Yeah, but that'll never happen
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:02.080]   Cute is what says I get it, you know, that's that's what sells
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:06.880]   You know because they've got cute or giant heavy slabs of glass
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:12.880]   Oh, we she's I've got to figure out. I'm not the grumpy one today to you
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.640]   Wow
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.760]   Crumpy
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:23.040]   Yeah, you are but giant heavy slabs of glass. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you're grubbing you're you're doing the
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.920]   floppy wrist here
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:34.240]   I've got to earn my my princess floppy hands moniker
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.520]   How is your post shot?
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.280]   treatment going
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:44.960]   It's getting better. I tried I tried to have my husband help me to do my hair and this is the result
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:51.600]   Did a great job. That's good. That's great. Yeah, he he did a great job
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:58.080]   But yeah, I'm still waiting talk to me in another is this is that moment when he asks you what it's done and you say it's fun
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:01.840]   Oh boy. I might have please check on mr. Andrew
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:10.560]   He's doing no he did a great job. He's he was I was like, look, I don't I'm dubious about this, but let's see what happens and he's like
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.520]   All right. Oh boy
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:18.560]   Look, he just wants to help. Yeah, he just wants to get in there. I hope you know
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:24.000]   You gotta you gotta try. So let's see. We're gonna talk about more google stuff for facebook or
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   metal earnings
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.400]   We could yeah, I mean I think we go from earnings to earnings and we get uh get these earnings out of the way the facebook
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:35.120]   earnings just posted I haven't had a chance to
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:40.160]   Read through these because literally it happened right as we were going to show time has anyone
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:45.280]   Pull I went through pretty quickly. I mean it wasn't it wasn't dreadful, but it was but it was warning
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:51.680]   Saying that um things aren't going to be so quite so rosy in the future and that's what they buy is the future and so
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:57.200]   But it took it took a real nose time 20 drop in stock one fifth of the value of the stock
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:00.560]   I'm sure it's a dead cat balance. It'll come back up but still
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.640]   A lot of stocks all the tech stocks are testing new bottoms
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.800]   You know, it's been happening the last week and a half or so
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.480]   And so facebook hadn't hadn't finished right in the bottom
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:14.000]   So do you think it's because of potential regulation
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:18.320]   Hold up hold up y'all. All right y'all are talking about
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.800]   A financial report
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:24.480]   Only from the perspective of the stock market as opposed to what they actually did
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.360]   So I feel like we're like looking at the you're right
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:33.360]   But it's 20% drop the shadow and playdoh's cave as opposed to the item so real fast show it off there
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.760]   They they dropped
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:39.680]   Because they didn't meet their analyst expectations
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:45.120]   They only reported 10.3 billion dollars in profit below a 10.9 billion profit
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.520]   And they were the profits declined a little
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:50.080]   Okay, the same thing
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.160]   Every single year
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:58.880]   Where apple is yeah in trouble because they didn't meet the analyst expectations even though they made a gazillion
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.280]   Yeah
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.680]   Well, apple used
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.640]   And found a way to to to
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.840]   Bring the expectations down that was apple's game for a long time
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:13.040]   Yeah, and the other thing is
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:18.640]   You know facebook is like hey y'all we're gonna do this whole virtual reality metaverse thing
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:23.200]   That's our new that's our new jane right in wall streets like all right
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:30.480]   A month and a half later. Let's see how that's going and you know what it's going really poorly because the metaverse isn't real yet
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.640]   They're just figuring and you know, they're doing
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:38.000]   They're the reality labs unit that sells the hardware and stuff. They post a 3.3 billion dollar loss
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.680]   and so
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:43.360]   Wall Street all of a sudden is like oh my god. You're betting the company on this
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.080]   And freaked out, but you know what
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:51.040]   They do that all the time like remember when they freaked out about facebook not having a mobile strategy
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:54.240]   Yeah, to be fair facebook felt a little late on that
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:35:00.960]   Um here they feel a little early but facebook was like well walson. Oh, we're the great evil empire. We'll do it
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.240]   Go
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.760]   Facebook had also, you know definitely put out
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:12.960]   Kind of the warning signals ahead of their earnings to say, you know, we're
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:18.480]   This is this is a different road that we're going obviously with the metaverse and everything. I think they said
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:23.760]   Uh that you know, it's going to cause a 10 billion dollar hit in 2021 profit
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:28.960]   And that the the division would not be profitable anytime in the near future
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:33.680]   So really kind of setting the groundwork not only that. I think the apple
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.320]   um, the apple decision
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:43.600]   Uh that that happened not too long ago with you know, the privacy and apps and everything that kind of has a longer standing effect
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:47.520]   On facebook that they you know, they say they're still kind of struggling with
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.960]   But at the end of the day like like you pointed out
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:58.160]   The company's doing okay. It's just they said they were going to be here and one centimeter below that is where they actually were
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:04.560]   And so right. So stock market loses their mind, you know, well, what does that mean? I don't know
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:12.560]   But so yeah, I mean, would I like to see facebook just crash and burn utterly? Yes, I would love it
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.800]   But you know and also I would say
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:18.640]   You know, the market is probably rightly asking questions at facebook
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:23.120]   Is it doing a great job answering part because they don't know about you know, anti-trust and
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:29.680]   They're definitely in the crosshairs of the government. So that's a big uncertainty for all the tech companies going forward
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.520]   Yeah, indeed indeed
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.360]   This was the first earnings report
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:41.120]   By meta by the way where they are actually breaking out their reality lab segment, which is their their metaverse efforts
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:46.000]   Division and that unit posted a 3.3 billion dollar loss
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.480]   Um just for for giggles there we go
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:56.240]   You know, I would think facebook would have been saying we've had such a good two weeks everybody's paying attention to spotify
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.720]   Nobody's yeah, right
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:02.320]   And then then they release this report that's oh heck here we are again
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.760]   meta
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.760]   meta, yes indeed meta
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:11.280]   Yeah, well
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:14.640]   You've got a nice little entree into spotify. How about we do?
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:17.040]   Uh, how about we take a break
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:20.880]   And then we come back and we talk a little bit about the developments there because last week
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:26.880]   I think we were on like the the cusp of things happening with spotify and then this whole week
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:29.680]   It's been spotify everywhere. Yeah, you know, it's
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:35.120]   It's just been on it would be so grateful when I no longer have to think about Joe Rogan again
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.800]   Yes
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:42.640]   I agree. I wonder when that or or his people who when I went after Rogan, well, all they've been on me. Oh
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.280]   They think they're so clever

[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:58.480]   All right, so
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:02.560]   Spotify the changes continue or you know the the
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:08.480]   The ends and the outs of the people who are who are on the service who have fed up with the service
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.560]   It just keeps on happening keeps on rolling
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:17.520]   Last week we talked I think we talked about Neil Young basically making the threat saying it's me or Rogan
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:23.840]   And ultimately they do and then we didn't know where it was going to turn out. Yes, and we didn't know where it's going to go
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:28.080]   Ultimately, Neil Young's music is no longer on Spotify as a result
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:30.400]   Uh, and he's not alone. Joni Mitchell
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:33.040]   Niall is here
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:35.680]   is low-grin logrin from the e-street band
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:40.320]   Loffgren. Oh, yeah. Thank you. Of course it is. I just had a typo
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.040]   Um, so others are kind of following
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:48.080]   It really is apparently I live by typos today. I apologize
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:52.400]   Um other people are following uh, Neil Young's example
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:59.840]   Um, I don't know how much impact it's making on spotify. I mean spotify really it really seems like they're kind of doubling down and saying hey
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.320]   We've got this, you know this content
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:05.680]   Policy we're gonna let you see it and everything
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:13.280]   But uh, you know, we want diverse opinions and and yada yada on the on the spotify platform. So
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:17.040]   No, what do you do? What do you think? What are your thoughts on this?
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:21.200]   So I I have a question for jeff because this this to me feels
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:27.280]   A little bit different like spotify, you know, there's the argument that it is a content platform
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.920]   You know, it can host whatever it wants
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:35.360]   And I feel like there's a distinction between being a content platform and actually being more like a
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.840]   A cable news
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:43.680]   Station that's actually paying for a particular person or content. So jeff do you think
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:48.960]   They're within their rights to argue that they're free to be a neutral content platform
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:53.440]   Are they more akin to like a fox news that host someone like tucker karleson
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:58.240]   They're within their rights private company to do whatever they want. Well. Yes, that's sorry. That's true
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:01.520]   So are they being disingenuous in their arguments?
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:06.720]   Oh, yeah, I think I think so and and you know, I constantly argue that the internet is not a medium
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:12.800]   That the platforms are not media. They are a place for people talk but spotify is different because they hired joe rogan
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:16.480]   They pay him a hundred million dollars. They own his rear end
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:22.240]   And they're responsible for that. Now. What is what is responsible mean responsible to whom responsible for the market
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:27.280]   Responsible to who else wants to be associated with them or not what advertisers want to be associated with them or not
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.600]   Um, I listened to twit this weekend
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.960]   Because I was curious to hear the talk about about that leo said that the the
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:39.840]   The minimum in ad buy for rogan now and pardon me is a million dollars. Well, you know, somebody's gonna
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:42.800]   That's not just oh, yeah, we got put on the show by
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:50.800]   Some automated stuff. No, you can spend a million dollars on joe rogan then customers are going to judge you by your association
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.120]   So you're responsible to
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.360]   The marketplaces the whole the stock market
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:58.000]   critics
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.680]   Other artists and advertisers and and so right now
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:06.960]   There's the people who pay for it. Yes. I feel like they're seeing defection from
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:10.960]   the a few small people in the audience and then a few
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:16.320]   Content producers that they want on their platform. Yeah, I don't think you're ever gonna see I mean
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:20.800]   And it's not boycotting by the way in my mind. If you know, I don't want to associate with joe rogan
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:25.600]   So I I deleted spotify from my phone. It's my perfect right to do their perfect right to have them
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:31.360]   It's my choice in a marketplace and and rogan. I think only makes it worse of course his video
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:36.640]   I thought was just pathetic where he didn't apologize to anyone but spotify he basically said oh, I'm sorry
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:41.600]   On the back end we'll be doing things like I mean look
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:46.480]   I know like as a journalist sometimes I would get out ahead of
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:52.160]   my editorial people like when I I may have actually called Comcast evil
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:57.040]   In fortune and you know fortune came back and they were like look stacy
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:00.240]   I don't want to tell you like what to write
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:03.040]   But i'm going to tell you that we're not going to call
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.280]   Comcast evil in a headline
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:07.520]   That's just not how we do it here
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:14.640]   So it's possible that spotify is having those same conversations in the back end with joe rogan saying look you've got
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:20.880]   Well, yeah, what happens if he actually has a contrasting view
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:28.160]   Or somebody on the show that has a contrasting view from the things that he's been talking about and that seems to get out of airways
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:34.320]   Uh because I thought I heard him mention something along the lines of saying hey, I want to have a conversation
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:38.000]   I want to have a conversation from both sides of the aisle
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:45.440]   What happens if if you know with the masses if he's actually putting his money where his mouth is and doing stuff like that
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.920]   But there's not a real bull side to one of these things
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:51.920]   But but aunt that's the problem. There's not there's there's science and then there's stupidity
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:58.800]   And and and ivermectin is not another side is not and so what rogan said was well
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:02.560]   I still want to have controversy he kept on calling he called everybody who says wrong
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:08.640]   Unscientific dangerous things he calls them calls them controversial and then he drags his heels and says well
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.800]   I might have some other views on that is to say the experts
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:18.080]   So he's trolling the world media has become whether whether it's making elon musk the person of the year on time
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:26.640]   Or whether it's joe rogan this doesn't just happen obviously in in online. It happens now in all of media and in such a crowded marketplace
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.200]   trolling is now the business model
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.840]   Well, it's really is a little
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:37.840]   Different. I mean, let's think back in the days of howard stern or someone like andrew dice clay
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:40.880]   both of those people gotten a lot of trouble because they were
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:44.000]   section they were they were
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:51.280]   I would say misogynistic but um women hated them they they used terrible language and were pretty
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:54.400]   pretty misogynistic and and
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:58.000]   That was controversial and yeah
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.800]   Objectifying all that good stuff. So if you look at
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:05.120]   That and that was the controversy at the time today's controversy
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:11.360]   And that was a winning strategy for them and I think controversy today is still a winning strategy
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   it's just more people are
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.080]   I guess you're moving from like objectifying women to
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:22.480]   Public telling people with bad medical advice
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:28.320]   I look at this dude and i'm like, why does he have so much attention?
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:34.240]   And I guess i'm just in a real real small minority because i've never listened to this cat show
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:41.440]   I have no desire to listen to a show and the more I see stuff popping up on my twitter feed or whatever about him
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:48.000]   Pissing off some group or whatever the last thing I want to do is go and listen to him piss off another group
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.480]   It's why is he
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:53.920]   Why does he earn so much attention from from us?
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:58.880]   But spotify has a whole lot of other content that we can go and depend on
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:02.480]   And then listen to and enjoy and not give this guy
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:09.280]   It's so much credit and attention to where spotify is probably going to give him even more money because he's just getting more eyeballs on their platform
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:12.400]   Who knows that's how crazy this crap works nowadays
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:16.160]   Well, and there's a whole audience of people who are
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:19.200]   Excited by
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:29.840]   That sort of thing like the boys will be boys argument. Maybe of yes by gone errors now. It's the so there's there's definitely an audience and you know, if you just
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:34.080]   You we have always had
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:37.680]   Media organizations that paint i'm so sorry
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.640]   Yeah, we have always had really
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.880]   unethical
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:48.240]   Media organization that pander to the lowest common denominator and we will always have that going forward
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:50.080]   and that's
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:51.600]   what this is
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:54.960]   It's just that the type of pandering you do now
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:48:01.520]   In this particular era has like real world consequences that are killing people
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:06.160]   You could actually argue that you know people arguing for anti-Semitism
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:11.360]   Have also killed people and that's been a feature of papers forever. So
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:21.760]   It's not we're also in we're also incredibly sensitive right now to the topic of health, right?
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:26.240]   Which which is not to say that this is not important any other time
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:30.080]   But right now of all times in the past let's say 10 years
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:37.120]   Everybody has like this idea of of health and staying healthy and protecting ourselves from this
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:39.600]   this nasty covid thing
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:41.600]   on the mind so when it comes to
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:47.520]   Any sort of topic or or conversation that that that does
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:50.080]   attempt to illuminate
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:57.200]   Something that maybe goes against the mainstream. I think that you know people react much strong much more strongly to that
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:02.960]   On either side right on one side. It's how dare you you bring that person on because you know
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:06.640]   This is this is disproven and this is just this is a fault
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.720]   This is false information that's going to make people
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:12.560]   And you know sick or possibly kill them and then on the other side
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:17.520]   It's well, but this you know as rogan said right I bring guests on that are highly credentialed
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:22.880]   Very intelligent very accomplished people and they have an opinion that is different from the mainstream narrative
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:26.480]   That's what the other side of that equation is saying is well
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:32.240]   Do I want to live in an environment where everything that I watch doesn't challenge this?
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:38.640]   This you know that the mainstream narrative as as rogan puts it and that's all wrapped up around this thing
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.960]   We can there's also three years fearing
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:47.840]   But there's science at some level. Yes. No, no question. I react and is not a proper treatment for covid
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:53.040]   And so to say well, but people have that opinion. Yes, we will have an as a medic opinions too
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:57.600]   So we will have racist opinions too. So people have have sexist and misogynistic opinions too for sure
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:02.720]   That doesn't mean that we need to give it and I think that that you know, I celebrate speech online
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:08.960]   So I'm with these folks about that. I celebrate the fact that voices too long not heard and mass media are heard now
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:12.800]   To my mind what we need to build is the next layer
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:18.960]   Which is a layer of recommendation and authentication and fact checking and and
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:25.760]   relevance finding and finding this stuff. It's worth listening to and that's what the media need to become now
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:34.800]   That's what rogan actually advertises himself at he brings on people with ideas and lets them have in-depth conversation
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:37.280]   now
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:44.560]   I may look at joe rogan and be like well, that is not a guy I would listen to based on his lack of science credentials, right?
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:48.400]   Whereas I might be like hey rachel meadow you're my bud because
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:52.080]   You really seem to understand and do the research on things
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:57.520]   A lot of rogan has said yeah joe rogan's like yeah, I don't really do a lot of research. I don't know
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:04.240]   So he's just have a conversation. Yeah. Yeah, right? Well, some people. I mean people will always find that interesting
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:12.320]   The reason the spotify is doing it is because he supposedly has 11 million
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:16.800]   listeners. I don't necessarily believe that number now that it'll be on twitch
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:22.720]   But yeah, he has it he for this world. He has a big audience right the new york times to celebrate right now
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:27.520]   They just got 10 million subscribers because they bought the athletic joe rogan by that measure is bigger than the new york times
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:32.560]   Which of course is ridiculous. I know it but but but that's we're still in a mass scale business
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:34.960]   where where
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:41.840]   Subscription revenue or advertising revenue still goes to scale rather than to quality and and that's still no
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:43.840]   I think it goes places
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:49.280]   Yeah, I know I think it goes I feel like I am quality over scale and I have
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:55.280]   That's where it's lovely revenue and I make money off of it and it's it's fine. So I think
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:59.840]   I think the mass mindset
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:03.360]   That is what I'm saying. Well, I think the mass mindset you will always get
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:09.040]   If you if you want to get to the mass you're gonna have to buckle up and accept the controversy
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:13.680]   Is there's no such thing as a mass? That's what I'm saying. What I'm saying Stacey is that is that I mean
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:16.640]   There is a mass we more of you and less of that. I don't know
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:18.400]   I think a mass is an insult
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:20.400]   Mass says the people are the same
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:26.480]   And and so it becomes this target of talking down to people who have no identity and who have no respect
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:28.560]   Audience for that. There is an audience
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:31.920]   There's an audience for people who want that and they're you know what?
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:37.360]   I'm that audience after the end of a long day in certain areas not in generic
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:41.280]   Newsy things because that's what I care about like that's my job, but like
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:46.640]   I will totally page through vogue or vanity fair and be like, uh-huh
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:50.400]   Okay, those are probably not as mass. That's not mass
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:56.160]   But you get the point like I would I would want like wander through like
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:58.480]   bustle or
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.960]   You're but you're not going to weekly weekly world news
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:03.840]   Joe Rogan is the equivalent of weekly world news
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:08.720]   How is the equivalent of weekly world news? That's what I don't understand
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:14.800]   How does he even get to that? What the heck is wrong with our society? You know, it's not everybody
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:19.120]   News at most. Yeah, it's true. I'm percent of the society
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:22.400]   Watching the business of Joe Rogan. It's a tiny portion of society
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.880]   And so what we act as if if it's big
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:28.400]   We extrapolate as if that's everybody it is not
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:34.400]   No, it's not news is a tiny proportion of society. Yeah, so you're trying to make sure this is more proportion of society
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:37.360]   Right
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:41.440]   As if scale is all that is is is what matters in judging
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:45.440]   Their impact and their importance and it's not
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:53.200]   I've not listened to a show but I have watched I do recall watching a couple of his youtube
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:57.520]   snippets because of the people he he had on there like
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:03.920]   He usually have some power lifters and and people like that on there and because he's got a fitness background
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:11.040]   So I was I would tune into that because youtube's algorithm knows huh ant likes watching people lift weights and bodybuilders and
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:13.600]   And those conversations were were
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:19.760]   Fascinating and that was the end of it. That was the end of my relationship with Joe Rogan because that's that's all he earned
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:25.040]   No, no more than that period and I just don't see why this cat continues to get
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:28.880]   So much attention, especially from people that
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:36.480]   I don't know that that I know can do better and have better taste. You know why you're giving this dude so much attention stop
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:38.240]   It's not it's not worth it
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:45.680]   But and is it some of this these days that there's there's there's kind of a thorough going anti institutional world and and being against
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:48.640]   Doesn't matter what you're against you're against something
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:55.360]   Is sufficient it's contrarian this right and I got accused of that because I take opinions that that aren't yours
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:58.240]   Um, right and Leo takes opinions that aren't mine, right?
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.480]   And so so that's part of the dynamic of what we do too
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:03.440]   but but to
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:07.680]   Dislike and want to dismantle the institution for its own sake to be seen that way
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:10.000]   Is a lot of what's going on these days?
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:15.200]   And a lot of institutions need to be challenged and and need to change and I'm not defending all the institutions
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:21.280]   I just wrote a testimony to the senate arguing that the the news industry is an institution that needs to be challenged
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:26.240]   Um, but but it's this it's for its own sake. It's it's the againstness
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:32.320]   For its own sake, which is where we are right now. And that's not productive and it's not constructive and it's not
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:36.560]   Useful that's where we are
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:42.080]   It is you mentioned the whole qualifier of
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:46.880]   Having people go in and do more fat checking and and
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:52.800]   Raising awareness about okay. This is this is a fact. This is an opinion
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:54.720]   uh, what
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:59.440]   When is that going to happen because we were where there's joe rogan or whether it's the new york post
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:02.080]   We're still just going to get click baity discussions
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:10.000]   That are controversial and usually are all just opinion and it's going to rouse up society and get people all in the tussy for no reason
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.960]   When is this going to change?
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:17.440]   Never because that's what drives clicks. That's what engages people
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:23.040]   That's our tribalism at play. I mean you have to rise above it and when you do yeah, it's super boring
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:27.840]   And that's why we always come back to things like give that's why i'm the boring person. I guess then
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:30.560]   Or and that's you versus nuffd
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:33.200]   Yeah, you're so reasonable
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:38.080]   Important issues like n at the important thing. Yes. Yes, right
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:39.920]   Jason
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:44.400]   I know that I just put a story in quick takes. I don't really know if it belongs there
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:47.200]   But we should talk about it because it's all right long curse
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:54.240]   Let's see it. Um, but we can do it later. It is line 37. That's right. I did a jeff jarvis
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:56.400]   You told a jar
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:57:00.080]   I see it. I see it. I see it. I see it. Do I use one of my wired stories of the month or not?
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:02.640]   I'll wait for you to oh
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:05.200]   Is it? Yeah, it's true. I
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:06.720]   I have a subscription
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:09.280]   How about this before we get to that story first of all?
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:12.400]   I I want to circle back one one quick moment to jeff
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:18.080]   And then we'll get to your story stacey. Okay jeff you wrote this post on medium
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:21.600]   And i'm curious to hear your take it because you only just briefly mentioned it
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:24.080]   Uh in the context of the spotify
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:25.760]   Um news
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:30.800]   But I want to give you the chance to kind of set that up a little bit because I read some of it
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:36.400]   But I want to hear hear what you have to ask Jason. It's another it's another jeff. I'm being polemical
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:37.760]   I will confess here
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:41.120]   Um, there was a some committee hearing today that ended this afternoon
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:44.320]   uh judiciary some committee breaking the news and
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.160]   um
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:51.520]   What upsets me here is that people in our industry journalism are now lobbyists
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:55.360]   the actual news organizations and their publishers and
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:58:01.360]   Uh, their associations there what we're trade associations are now lobbying associations and I find that to be a
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:02.960]   abhorrent
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:07.280]   Uh break from the independence and integrity of journalism. We're supposed to be watching people in power
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:09.600]   Not asking favors of them
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:15.360]   But that's what's going on is that the news industry is going for protectionist legislation and regulation
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:20.400]   And we've talked about it lots of times in this show in australia. We've talked about it in germany and the eu
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:23.440]   Um, we've talked about it in the uk
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:26.400]   Well, it's happening in the un, Canada. It's happening in the u.s
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:26.960]   Now
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:30.000]   And so there was a house hearing earlier and today's senate hearing
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.960]   So it doesn't mean anything and I send it to my senator who's cori booker and try to get into the record
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:38.400]   My last one was in the record who cares. It's there. That's it's cool
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:40.560]   uh, but I put up my medium
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:42.560]   um, and and
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:48.800]   Part of what i'm saying here is that I love news. I love newspapers and magazines. I care about the future of journalism
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:50.080]   We all do
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:50.960]   but
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:54.320]   It's not necessarily in the best hands with the legacy people who have owned it
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:58.000]   The majority of newspapers changed in this country are not controlled by hedge funds
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.680]   And I worked with one of them. I was on I was on an advisory board for one of the companies
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:05.040]   They owned and I know that they don't fund innovation
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:10.560]   And I know that some of these tax breaks and credits are going to go to the pockets of the limited partners
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:16.720]   Not to the journalists not to the public and so I just wanted to be contrarian and say
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:22.880]   Senate before you act as if all these newspaper publishers are pure as driven snow and wonderful
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:24.480]   uh
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:27.520]   Think twice about about the news we want
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:32.720]   And and the news that we need and the kind of innovation we need and not just
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:35.360]   protecting the past
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:38.000]   So that was my polemical spiel
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:42.480]   And at the same time by the way, it was interesting that
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:44.320]   um
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:48.000]   The intercept dropped a report about how media companies are lobbying
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.960]   Against regulation of advertising targeting
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:56.880]   Because they depend upon it now there i'm contrarian is that I think we got to have advertising and we got to have targeting in some form
[00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:59.280]   find to regulate it
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:07.120]   But so i'm not in line with the intercept says but there again as an example of media companies that are charged with
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:11.600]   Watching government watching institutions of power now asking favors
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:14.880]   From them to protect their business. That's not right
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.840]   So that was it. Thank you for asking. Yeah
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:21.280]   Absolutely. Thank you for walking through that appreciate it
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:23.760]   And then
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:29.840]   There was north korea hack and some didn't we get to bonkers north korea and some dude hack and north korea back
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:34.080]   This is your story. The states he was setting up. Yeah, tell us about it
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:39.520]   I will save you a click but essentially a security researcher
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:43.680]   an individual security research goes by p4x
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:46.720]   um, he realized that
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:52.000]   His he was getting hacked and he was trying to figure out why and he realized it was north korea
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:58.240]   And he was kind of miffed about this because nation states attacking individual security researcher seemed unfair
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:02.560]   Is he had he done something north korea to warrant this or they just kind of picked him?
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:09.520]   No, this is part of like a general like nation state just checking in on you know people like every every nation
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:14.800]   tracks hackers in other nation they they all it's part of the like
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:18.880]   They might be I got it. Spading actively in the zero day market, but it might just be like
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:23.040]   They know who's active in security research. We're watching you
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:29.760]   Well both that and just to see like this guy figured out anything cool that we can steal great
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:34.000]   so it really upset p4x and
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:39.200]   Nobody did anything so that that didn't sit well with him. So he said, you know what?
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:44.480]   Effort, I'm gonna hack him back. Um, so here's his quote
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:48.880]   It felt like the right thing to do here if they don't see we have teeth is just going to keep coming
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:53.840]   Said the hacker. Uh, I want them to understand that if you come at us
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.720]   It means some of your infrastructure is going down for a while
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:01.120]   So p4x went and found unpached vulnerabilities in north korean
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:07.680]   internet systems and basically took the country's internet down using ddas. So he's the guy who did that
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:13.760]   We mentioned that last week. There was down when he's the guy who did that. Wow. He's that guy and he was doing it because he felt
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:16.720]   Pissed
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:20.400]   So this is the debate about hackbacks, but I just thought it was bonkers that
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:23.760]   This dude in his pajamas
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:27.440]   Has the power to take down korea's internet or north korea's internet
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:33.200]   Yay, such as such is the internet in 2022, right?
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:37.520]   So many people have you know so much power
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:42.240]   Yeah, they can just do it from their pajamas in the writing in the living room, you know, it's
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:47.360]   It's wired. So it's really good wire. It's good writing. You know, they're yeah. Wow
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.840]   So
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:52.640]   Here i'll do this because as a journalist, I like it
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:59.200]   But responsibility for north korea's ongoing internet outages doesn't lie with us cybercommander any other state sponsor hacking agency
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:05.600]   In fact, it was the work of one american man and a t-shirt pajama pants and slippers sitting in his living room at night after night
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.400]   Watching a alien movies and eating spicy cornstacks
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:15.840]   And periodically walking overdose home office to check on the progress of the programs he was running to disrupt the internet of an entire country
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.400]   jeez
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:21.760]   Holy
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:27.600]   Okay, so that was my bonkers cyber security story of love it right on thank you for throwing that in there
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:31.440]   I missed that somehow somehow I missed it. It just came out today
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:34.720]   All these cool stories
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:38.080]   Yeah, you have actual stories that we haven't talked about yet
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:44.000]   All right, that's what it was android tablets. I know I just we'll get get back to it
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:49.760]   Yeah, yeah, no, so so here's what I was thinking is I don't know where are we at right now?
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:53.600]   Oh, yeah, I think we're we're about good for um for a break
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:58.560]   And how about on the other side of the break nothing but google it's like nothing
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:03.680]   Whoa, we got a lot of google a google show about google
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:07.040]   See about talking about surprising our audience
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.120]   I know
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:13.040]   Wait a minute. So you're telling me this week in google has some stories about google in it
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.680]   That's amazing
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:17.040]   All right, so let's do that
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:20.640]   Uh, but so get you know, maybe maybe take a look at the google stories
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:23.840]   And if you have any any that you are uh totally, you know
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:28.400]   Big fan of us talking about, you know jot that down and we'll talk about them
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:32.400]   Uh, but first this episode of this week in google is brought to you by our crowd
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:35.840]   All around the world tech companies are innovating
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:38.080]   We're talking about them all the time on these shows in fact
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:41.600]   They're driving returns for investors in fact and our crowd
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:45.920]   Analyzes companies across the global private market
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:51.600]   And then selects those that have the greatest growth potential and then brings them to you
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:05:01.280]   It's a really good opportunity from personalized medicine to cybersecurity to proton therapy a 20 billion dollar total addressable market
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:06.000]   Yeah, it covers the gamut and in state-of-the-art labs start up garages
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:14.720]   Anywhere in between our crowd is identifying innovators so you can invest when growth potential is greatest and as you probably know
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:19.360]   That's early you want to get in there early and then you've then it's all upside
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:25.280]   Hopefully our crowd is the fastest growing venture capital investment community
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:31.280]   Our crowds accredited investors have already invested over one billion dollars in growing tech companies
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:39.440]   21 of the portfolio companies are unicorns in fact and many of our crowds members have actually benefited from over
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:43.440]   40 ipos or sale exits of portfolio companies
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:48.400]   Accredited investors can participate in this in single company deals
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.880]   Uh, and in doing that
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:58.240]   You know you only need as little as ten thousand dollars to get started or one of our crowds funds for as little as
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:07.520]   $80,000 a minimum of $10,000 is required to invest and investment terms actually may vary depending on where you invest

[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:13.840]   All right, so
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:17.520]   Google all the time here. I guess we can start with this one
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:21.760]   Which doesn't really have a whole lot to it, but man did it get a lot of attention? It seemed like
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:28.000]   Uh everybody was was talking about oh wait, andry tablets are coming back google's getting serious about andry tablets
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:34.720]   Basically, this has to do you know there were a couple of articles jr ray field from computer world and then uh nine to five google
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:41.280]   Spotted a job opening essentially there's like a number of things happening right now andry 12l is right on the cusp
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:44.880]   They're testing the beta that's meant for foldable devices, but
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:48.720]   inherently because foldable devices become larger devices
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:52.160]   It ends up also being really good for tablet form factors
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:59.840]   So there's that happening nine to five google spotted a job listing for a senior engineering manager of the andry tablet app experience
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:02.240]   And in reading through that
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:08.560]   There's one quote we believe that the future of computing is shifting towards more powerful and capable tablets
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:16.240]   So that ends up being a clue from uh from google that you know, perhaps they're kind of putting more effort and energy into their tablet
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:17.280]   um
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:23.920]   Ecosystem and then jr ray field who I mentioned from computer world also spotted that rich miner who is a co-founder of andryd
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:28.240]   Is actually now he had he'd stepped away from andryd for a while to work on other projects
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:31.600]   He's now back and has involvement with the tablet
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:35.120]   Efforts and of course anytime this comes up
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:42.480]   Anyone who's been following andryd for a while, uh, you know is is reminded of the nexus seven which was google's
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:44.000]   uh
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.920]   andryd tablet
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:50.080]   Product to beat I suppose because when it came out seven or eight years ago
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.320]   I can't remember how long it was at this point
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:55.760]   It was a really fantastic tablet and everybody was super excited about it
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:59.280]   And then somewhere along the line google does what it does and it just kind of like
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:02.000]   dropped the football I guess but
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:02.720]   uh
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:04.720]   do any of you have uh have
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:10.240]   Any optimism that google can reinvigorate andryd tablets and uh make it compete
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:16.160]   I suppose with the ipad at this point it feels late to me, but what do you think I do I feel really
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:19.280]   Okay, here's my thinking
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:22.400]   All right, this is a very small data points. I
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:29.760]   Use today an ipad is my home tablet for connecting gadgets that everyone in the family needs to control
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:35.520]   But the gadget makers are idiots and haven't made it possible for multiple account holders, right?
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:40.400]   So that way everyone my husband and I can both control it despite having two phones, right?
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:47.280]   So there is a demand or a need for like that sort of device in homes with smart home stuff
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:49.920]   there's also like we
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:56.240]   Individuals in my house grab either the ipad or the ipad mini to wander off and watch their television shows
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:02.080]   Almost no one watches tv on the big tv. So I think there's a market for
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:09.120]   More tablets that are maybe more economical. My mom freaking loves her tablets. She had a
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:14.160]   Android tablet then she got like a Samsung tablet and then she got
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:22.240]   Like a kindle not a kindle an amazon fire fire fire. Yeah. Yeah, she's so desperate for a tablet
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:29.200]   That's not as expensive as an ipad that she will buy an amazon fire tablet. I mean, I feel like there's a market there
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:34.800]   But doesn't sound already on that space or people that are just looking for something less
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:38.560]   Dispensive than an ipad because their tablet seems to be okay
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:44.640]   Yeah, but don't you want more I feel like people love more options, but maybe that's just me
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:49.920]   Jeff you're a tablet. You know, I loved I loved loved loved loved my nexus seven
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:53.840]   Yeah, I cried when it became obsolete
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:57.040]   And I complained and I
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:01.120]   Mature horrible things
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:03.040]   Um
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:05.040]   And so I was thinking well what if it came back
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:11.520]   One idea is I think what what google was playing with was trying to come up with chrome tablets
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:14.240]   No, I love the chrome os
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:19.520]   But to run apps on chrome is cluji as hell still it doesn't work
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:26.080]   So that was a that was a big detour that went nowhere in my view. I'll be really curious here jay, you know, dr. Androids view of this
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:29.120]   um
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.800]   You know
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:32.000]   So
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.480]   Going back to android tablets would make sense
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:40.080]   The question is do I really need anymore when I have this, you know phone that weighs according to stacy
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:43.040]   40 pounds
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:49.040]   Actually when I complained I gave you the actual weight of the phone. It is roughly half a pound
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:55.200]   Okay, it's roughly it's almost seven point something else's too much for stacy's wrist
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:56.720]   Scaled
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.080]   It's risk
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:04.160]   floppy risk scale so um, you know, do I need a tablet now part of the problem is I'm not traveling anymore what I love the
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:07.440]   tablet for was I would watch it was it was small to carry
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:12.320]   And I'd watch it and I had a bigger laptop my laptop now is tiny and thin
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:15.120]   Um, you know, it's a google product
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:21.200]   So as much as I loved it, I don't know that I see a market need myself for it right now
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:25.120]   I think you're right stacy. I think there are needs. I don't think it's very big
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:30.320]   I think anti-earpoint about samson is that people some people are still allergic to samson craft
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:35.760]   Uh on it. So, you know a google pure android version of a tablet
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:38.560]   Would be nice
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:43.200]   And I might get it because I get all you know, I get stupid things. I don't need uh point of privilege
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:47.920]   Um, but yeah, I don't know that there's a big business there. Dr. android. What do you think?
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:52.800]   Dr. android I feel like I need a name tag at this point. Um,
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:55.360]   Uh, yeah
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:57.680]   Oh that that's better. I like that
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:00.720]   Uh, a green lab coat
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:02.800]   Um, yeah, I don't know
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:06.240]   You know how it feels like this is this is one of those
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:12.800]   One of the things where google has tried and failed and tried and failed like I get the same taste of my mouth about tablets
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:19.760]   on android as I do about wearables on you know running android is that google has been really
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:24.320]   Interested and excited about it and then wavered and then got excited about it again
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:28.080]   And then you know, yeah, and even after that with wearables like
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:34.640]   Okay, cool. So they they released the new wearOS, you know last year and uh had uh had a
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:41.360]   Primary device, you know with samson the galaxy watch for to launch it with and then we haven't really heard much about it
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:47.600]   Is kind of like, you know, maybe there's some action there. Maybe there isn't but is it lighting the wearable world on fire?
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.760]   I don't know that it necessarily is yet
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:55.200]   Not saying that it couldn't at some point and I kind of get that same feeling about tablets like man
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:14:01.600]   They you know if if they're strategy right now is hey, we're getting serious about tablets because we think it's the future
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:06.320]   They're about 10 years behind the bus that's leading that charge
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:07.920]   and
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:12.080]   And they were in a good position then to do something about it like
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:18.560]   And so it's kind of like really now, okay like sure you got to be in all places
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:22.480]   Maybe maybe google's hardware division, you know, it really does seem like you know
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:27.920]   There is more energy and attention in their hardware division to pay to all these different things, you know
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:31.280]   We hear rumors about a pixel watch we hear rumors about a
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:36.800]   A pixel foldable. I'm sure there there's some sort of a pixel tablet or something like that
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:44.240]   That might come out. So, you know, maybe this is just part of their effort to like be in all places and have a hero device to point to but
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:47.120]   And and I would totally support it
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:52.080]   It doesn't address the chicken and egg scenario of the fact that
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:57.360]   Having the hardware is one thing having software that works really well with it
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:01.760]   Uh is another and if andry 12l is the thing that makes that happen great
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:04.320]   But then you still got to get developers excited about it
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:07.440]   And that's just seems like a really tall hill to climb
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:10.720]   That's what I wanted to ask miss Stacy about was just the
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:19.600]   Hardware side of things for a chipwise because apple has the the pro the op-head pro and they're running their own apple silicon
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:25.920]   And I think it's nice. It's it's from a productivity standpoint. It is it's quite nice
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:31.280]   Is this the time where google has the opportunity to to be able to
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:37.200]   um even with this pandemic and the supply chain stuff can they still have some have enough
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:43.920]   To be able to create a tablet that's going to be powerful like the ipad pro and and still draw
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:46.240]   developers in because
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:48.240]   I I say
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:52.080]   Okay, um
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:55.440]   No, I'm just thinking like if you're using basic android apps
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:58.880]   You know on the tablet, which is what I would assume they would do
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:07.120]   Then they're fine like you're probably not going to get someone to develop specifically for your like a tablet form factor
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:10.000]   Um, but that's going to run like a snapdragon
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:17.520]   Which is an armbase chip and which developers are already building apps for so I don't know like I don't think google's going to build their own chips
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:23.600]   For their tablet experience unless they're going to just fundamentally rethink what a tablet is and can do
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:26.400]   Right. I mean we're roughly
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:30.960]   If you look at like eras of
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:33.760]   Like when the ipad came out
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:38.640]   We could be due for new form factor. I know we talked like that's why i'm excited about foldable phones
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:40.080]   Um
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:45.840]   My hunch is the form factor coming next might take a little wire while and it's going to be holographic versus
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.280]   You know
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:49.360]   Another slab of glass, but I could be wrong
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:55.520]   um, and if they're thinking about a new form factor for that then they would need that kind of developer and chip support but
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:58.560]   I don't think they're doing that
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:03.680]   They're not like super innovative on the hardware side. I guess yeah, that's what everyone. Yeah, I think you're right
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:06.960]   They'll buy somebody who's doing they'll buy the danger
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:10.880]   It's like the holographic thing or whatever, you know, right? Right, right
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:14.000]   Yeah, they tend they tend to buy for a lot of that stuff
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.040]   You know, uh, what was it fit bit for for the wearables and
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:21.600]   And that was a late deal fit bit is always to me and since they haven't done much with it
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:25.840]   I'm just like the hell or they haven't no totally totally and they bought it
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:29.920]   Who what was the glasses company that they bought? Was it focal?
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:36.720]   Um, you know, and then now we're hearing you know, the uh, I can't remember if it was focal or what the name of the glasses company that they bought
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:41.680]   But that that's fueling, you know, their development of um of air glass
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:48.720]   Then the next generation of google glass even though google glass still exists and google was there first but
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:53.920]   You know, so um, so even when they buy to to give themselves a leg up
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:59.440]   Sometimes it doesn't really it's not really obvious whether whether it made sense or not, you know, it's like, okay
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:02.080]   Well, they did that and they get why they did that but what did you do with it?
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:06.160]   I don't even know. Yeah, I would love the horse. It's a watch product was focal
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:09.040]   It was fun. You would
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:11.040]   That was
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:14.880]   Sorry, it's right
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:20.400]   Oh, no, I'm saying I would love to have a watch this running just pure clean android a smart watch that
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:28.640]   With google assistant and all the bells and whistles that actually runs but android where in my experience a couple of years ago terrible
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:31.600]   Horrible
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.360]   Horrible
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:39.200]   You know, so why would I believe in it android 12? Yes. Yes
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:42.080]   You know, i'm a merman
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:46.960]   Take the way back machine dr. android Sherman Sherman android dr. Sherman android
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:51.520]   Sherman take the way back machine to the last days of the nexus 7
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:54.080]   Why do you think google let it drop?
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:58.720]   It was a beloved product. I don't know how much the soul, but it was beloved product. It was a good product
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:03.760]   Why do you think they got bored with it just general google boredom or was there a market reason?
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:09.760]   That's a really good question. I'm trying to i'm trying to get dead in the comparison to the ipad
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:15.120]   You did it was a different problem selling that one. Yeah, yeah very different product
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000]   And i mean apple was just sized
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:23.440]   Dom the ipads were with the ipad. Yeah, totally totally. Yeah, I can't remember i'm having a hard time
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:25.680]   Putting myself in the way was it was it the
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:28.800]   Market forces or whatever was going on at that point
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:34.080]   Was it the fabulous at samson that killed it was it i'm just trying to remember i'm just
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:37.040]   Why would they get out of it and then come back to it now?
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:39.760]   And I think your point about timing is really right
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:42.800]   Yeah
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:46.240]   Yeah, I mean I I couldn't tell you right off the top of my head
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:49.120]   the
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:54.640]   You know i'm having to resort to wikipedia right now to try and kind of remind myself but that the
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:57.120]   the last nexus seven
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:05.760]   Lasted until june 28th. It was the fourth most popular tablet used in the world fourth most popular tablet used in the world
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:07.280]   That's a pretty
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:11.280]   That's a pretty notable stat there. All right, like so google was doing something
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:14.160]   We didn't have that many tablets. Well, that's true. That's true
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:17.600]   That's
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:25.040]   If ipad was one and then you have everything else fourth probably doesn't yeah matter that much when you don't have that many out there but
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:27.680]   Still, you know, it's cute
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:37.120]   Sorry, still the the nexus seven was it was a really great start and i don't know the reason why google didn't continue to kind of develop it and iterate it
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:43.120]   I think part of it had probably has to do with just the fact that like their whole hardware effort
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:45.200]   prior to
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:48.400]   The hardware division as it is now under greg australow
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:57.040]   Um, you know and being kind of like a pixel family and everything it was all in that like nexus era where they were making deals with other companies
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:04.720]   Anyways, it wasn't truly theirs and I think it was just it was just kind of murky what exactly it was like we understood
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:11.360]   Why they were creating these nexus hardware to give some sort of like a hero device for developers to use and know
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:18.080]   This is the true android but but outside of that like what was the motivation for them to keep continuing?
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:23.040]   To create these hardware certainly wasn't to sell devices because they were hardly selling these things
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:27.200]   Um, maybe the nexus seven but even then that's still you know
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:33.280]   It's part of the nexus line and the nexus line ultimately was kind of like an experiment. It seemed like to me anyways
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:37.360]   So I just don't think google really got serious about hardware until recently
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:45.200]   Didn't recognize why they should be still seems like a bad time to get serious about hardware right now
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:53.760]   I don't think i'm a little serious about anything. I really don't i'd like i'm not kidding. I think no, I know i know i've really smart people
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:56.800]   Yeah, other than ads
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:00.800]   Which it makes sense. That's the bulk of the revenue and they know they need to like
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:03.840]   figure something out, but
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:07.840]   It's you know how they joke about like changing the engine while the planes going down
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:11.680]   Google knows that one day their plane is going to go down
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:18.240]   But it hasn't and maybe it's like slowly losing altitude like by a meter each year
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:23.040]   But it's at no point ready to rush and it's just like oh
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:29.920]   Well, let's grant this person the power to change the engine and see what they come up with you know and I just feels like
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:34.400]   As long as the ad machine is still chugging along
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:37.840]   Everything else is kind of like yeah, well, let's just see what happens
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:40.320]   And I mean, you know, we've heard time and time again
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:44.000]   kind of the incentivization inside of
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:53.120]   Google if you are an engineer at least my understanding of this anyways is if you are an engineer or a creator of one of these services or whatever
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:57.360]   You know you get this thing to a certain point and your incentive is to
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:01.120]   It's it's almost like you graduate from that to something else right?
[01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:05.840]   Google recognizes your brilliance and they move you to a different place and when that happens
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:08.400]   It seems like these things rarely
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:12.080]   Survive it's it's like they needed the energy of that person
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:14.720]   To really kind of be the one to go to bat for it
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:20.240]   And once that person is gone because that's their incentive right that they again are getting paid more they get more accolades
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:23.280]   all that kind of stuff then the product dies on the vine and
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:30.480]   That is not you know tenable long term or that certainly doesn't ultimately at a road's customer trust
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:34.160]   I feel like that's that's where we end up in this position where we're like damn
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:41.040]   Google kills everything good because and we don't we don't believe anymore that anything is long for this world coming from Google
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:45.040]   Um, maybe i'm speaking for myself, but I think there's a lot of that right now
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:48.000]   And they throw their spaghetti at the wall
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:55.120]   Yeah, but they're also like how do you measure if the spaghetti sticks when you're measuring it against what is it?
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:24:00.960]   80 of 200 billion dollars and totally I mean, right nothing looks good next to that
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:03.200]   Nothing
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:08.400]   Like i's a really interesting theory that I put I put down on my number just so I would get to it
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:10.480]   So you can do it now
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:14.480]   Um that said that what we're what we might be seeing in google's report
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:17.120]   and facebook's report is
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:19.680]   tim cook
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:24.000]   That by cutting off the visibility on data and advertising
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.440]   Um
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:29.520]   People went back to search went back to google like crazy and they abandoned facebook
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:36.960]   Uh, and then he has a there's two tweets in a row there. Um, the next one after the one I linked to looks at pinterest
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:41.040]   And twitter and other companies that depended upon apple
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:43.920]   For data in a way that google does not
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:51.520]   So I found that really interesting this is a as a if you go to my, um to the rundown under my number
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:54.240]   Oh, okay, sorry
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:57.040]   Down I guess I need to give a line number
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:59.600]   Uh, one forty nine
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:03.440]   One forty six, uh, so the charts are there
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:06.000]   Yeah
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.080]   So it's so it goes to your point states. He is that is that you got 80 of 200 billion
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:15.200]   Right, it's still if you put attention into that that's still where the money he is
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:21.920]   And yeah, that's not 96 percent anymore. And yes, you do. Yes, they need to get higher than 6 percent share for uh cloud
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:28.000]   Versus 40 percent for amazon. There's growth there too. That's hard. That's hard. Yeah
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.640]   Yeah, there we go
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:36.320]   Charts
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:39.760]   It's beautiful. The audio listeners love charts
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:44.960]   That one is so red. It doesn't say anything
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:52.800]   All right, we've got other google stories here to talk about what should we talk about is there anything that that stood out to you all
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:58.720]   Um from this last week going on with google there was what was it? Um
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:03.520]   Yeah, I'll surprise you. Yeah, go for it hit this stuff. Okay. It's the tablet
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:06.960]   so, um
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:10.000]   I would agree with republican about right or uh
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:12.640]   adding regulation to google
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:17.920]   Okay, that's not okay. Um, I've always said that google's uh, uh,
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:22.000]   Uh, kiddies heal when it comes to regulation is not search. It's not shopping
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.360]   It's not any of that it's advertising and mike lee
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:28.800]   Uh republican is about to introduce a bill
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:36.640]   that uh goes after google's control of the buy side and the sell side and the marketplace in between
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:39.600]   and and at a at a at a
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.000]   architectural level
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:48.080]   I agree that having one party be dominant in those three parts of any transaction
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:50.960]   Is trouble and needs?
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:52.400]   Um
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:56.320]   Investigation if not regulation so put this in the history books
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:59.520]   That I said this may be a good idea
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:05.280]   A good way to approach regulation when it comes to to google in the area that matters
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:08.000]   Where where they have domination, which is advertising?
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:11.920]   Hold on. Excuse me. I think I hear hill freezing over
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:20.160]   Is sloshing cracking noise? Yes, ice melts in a
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:23.280]   Was for our for our audio listeners. Yes
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:29.840]   Yeah, this has to do with the with with google being the broker
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:36.560]   For a buyer or seller. I'm trying to both the buyer and the seller. Yeah, buyer and the seller. That's right. Yeah
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:42.640]   Right. Wow, simultaneously owning the exchange. I'm reading from the article where where the ad space is traded
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:48.080]   Yeah, yeah, that's and how much they take out of every transaction. No, there's an argument here
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:53.440]   They I don't know how much they do and it's not just them taking stuff out its agencies and others as well
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:56.080]   Uh, but when when an advertiser buys
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:00.320]   Space time people whatever we want to call it now advertising
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:01.760]   Um
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:05.280]   Uh, the guardian did some experiments a couple years ago where they bought their own ads
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:08.960]   Just to see how much actually landed in their bank at the end of it and
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:15.200]   A lot got taken out of one of the way by various parties. Mm-hmm. Not just google
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:18.960]   All right, those might turn stacy and
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:24.000]   Oh more i thought the i was i was reading about
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.760]   Oh, sorry crew
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:33.200]   Yeah, well, I thought the combo s story with it. Yeah, good. The gaming
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:36.080]   Capabilities, I thought that was pretty fascinating
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:42.000]   Uh, even though it still doesn't quite sell stadia. It just says hey, we're gonna put another
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:47.280]   Hardware out there that you could play games, you know such as stuff that's on steam
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:50.720]   Um, you know, there's one mention of stadia
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:56.960]   In this I mean there's there's so much cloud gaming happening, you know in all different directions
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:01.600]   Stadia is just one one component of it and uh, I mean there's no reason why chrome books
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:06.320]   Couldn't participate right that's if that's where it's all about streaming from the web
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:09.360]   I think it makes perfect sense that there would be gaming chrome books
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:15.200]   I mean, I don't know what what exactly makes a gaming chrome book that it has, you know, uh, leds behind the keys
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:19.040]   Yeah, that was like a super 5g connection
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:21.840]   and uh
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:24.880]   But yeah, I think that makes perfect sense
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:27.440]   Um, i'm not too thrilled about it being
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:30.240]   Something that you would have to run in a virtual machine
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.560]   At least that's what it says here on nine to five google
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:35.600]   Um, but I guess they got to start somewhere
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:38.000]   Um, do any
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.240]   I'm assuming you guys don't game like that
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:44.240]   But i'm wondering if any of our other listeners that are all pro linux and things like that
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:49.120]   Are they using vms to do gaming? Are they just doing it natively through the cloud?
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:55.040]   Good question. Any survey says watching in the chat
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:58.320]   Nobody says anything
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:02.240]   And like we're not a gaming audience. Yeah, some of them are gamers, but
[01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:06.640]   Yeah, I think that makes sense though to have a gaming chrome book sure
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:12.640]   I don't know how many people are going to rush out and buy them, but I think it you know, it will it will suffer the same
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:19.840]   Kind of uh challenges that regular chrome books have is like why would I spend the the money on a gaming chrome book?
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:23.620]   When I can spend the money on a gaming pc in the next game in reeg
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:27.120]   Yeah, exactly exactly
[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:30.320]   Our truck is behind me. Sorry. He's loud
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:34.800]   It's all my my story that I am super questioning
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:37.440]   Is the story about?
[01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:40.320]   Google's cloud business trying to build
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:43.120]   features for blockchain developers
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:50.480]   And what's wackadoo about this story who is by actually my mentee jordan
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:53.760]   So he's he's a savvy smart fellow
[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:58.880]   um, which is why he's pointing out the weird hypocrisy happening here, which is
[01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:01.520]   a lot of people focused on
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:07.760]   blockchain and distributed ledgers are also worried about the power of too many people only they do it
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:14.640]   They do a lot of lip service to too many companies, you know having a chunk of the internet and the centralization of that power
[01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:17.920]   Um, so it's weird that google's like
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:24.240]   So he's he's pointing out that it's weird that google's trying to build something for people who ultimately hate the fact that google
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:30.560]   Is one of the three cloud providers, although as the smallest I guess it doesn't have a great enough concentration
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:37.440]   Um, and then I think it's kind of a bunch of bs because tomas korean is like, you know what the biggest areas are for this
[01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:39.920]   is retail health care and
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:47.520]   Other big industries, which are the big targets for google cloud as a whole. So I just um, is this blockchain washing? What the hell is this?
[01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:50.640]   That's all
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:52.960]   Thoughts
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:55.840]   You lost me at blockchain
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:32:02.000]   I was kind of thinking the same thing. I
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:07.760]   Just like I really want to understand this stuff more but anytime I try it makes my brain hurt
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:12.800]   Well, that's the question here is if you're gonna print I mean
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:16.960]   What can google possibly offer?
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:22.000]   If you're gonna like tweet blockchain developer and that's what I don't understand
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:24.640]   because
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:30.160]   The benefit of a blockchain is you're gonna run an algorithm on as many places as possible
[01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:33.600]   So that's
[01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:39.600]   In nowhere in this does it answer it and it sounds honestly like google's just like, uh, we're just gonna do something
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:44.880]   There's potential growth here to to go with the you know, they got to find another way to make money
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:48.720]   I just want to know another avenue for our cloud to be relevant
[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:53.360]   To be used so yeah, they they've basically created a new blockchain group
[01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:56.080]   um and
[01:32:56.080 --> 01:33:00.000]   Yeah
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.240]   It feels like you're just throwing around like
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:08.240]   Like terms like hype terms. Okay, that's all I was just hoping someone could explain this to me
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:10.960]   But no one can't I wish I wish that I could
[01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:13.840]   I cannot
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:16.960]   I have no explanation on that one. No one in the chat anyone
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:25.440]   No, I think the line 66 is worth mentioning. It's not yeah, I was actually it is worth mentioning
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:31.840]   Yeah, I was I was circling that as well google is making some changes to their parental leave policy
[01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:35.280]   Um actually some really fantastic changes
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:41.360]   Uh, they are offering a man their benefits are crazy. Sorry. I have text overlapping here
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:42.960]   um
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:48.320]   Expanded parental leave to 18 weeks for all parents. It had been 12 prior
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:52.400]   So that's pretty nice. Basically a half years is it paid leave
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:58.560]   Yeah, that's that's my understanding. Okay. Yeah, sorry. I'm like, you know
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:00.480]   what I
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:05.280]   I was like I didn't have paid leave 15 years ago when I had my baby
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:12.160]   Wow things have changed right like a half year. I mean, I'm glad I helped push for paid leave for our employees
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:15.760]   Before I left gigo because I was like, yo, come on
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:18.560]   Did you win and I think they got it. Yeah, them
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:21.520]   Outstanding
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:23.760]   Yeah, yeah, I think this is also about
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:26.080]   So go ahead
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:30.800]   No, you know, I was just gonna say 18 weeks for all parents 24 weeks for parents who give birth
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:38.720]   Uh previously 18 weeks as of uh, april second also eight weeks of caregiver leave for employees to take
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:42.400]   Uh, which doubles the previous allowance where we can say Jeff
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:44.640]   just um
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:48.080]   There's nothing to do with google, um states he can kick me or punch me
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:50.480]   Um, but starbucks
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:52.560]   Um, I asked the crew
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:55.040]   One of my local starbucks where they were closing
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:35:00.080]   Earlier all the time and one of them around here has not been open for two weeks one of them closes every day at noon
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:03.440]   But I said what's going on? They said we can't get anybody to apply for the jobs
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:06.240]   We just can't I said did they finally raise your salary?
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:10.480]   They said actually yeah, they did even so we can't get anybody to apply for jobs
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:16.240]   We're all yeah short staffed as heck and and so that's obviously not the case at google
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:22.800]   But it is the case that in the great resignation, which is actually probably the great redistribution
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:25.280]   uh people um
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:29.200]   Are a lot freer to try to find other jobs the job marketplaces change
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:32.000]   This is you know the complaints about about inflation
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.040]   are also about redistribution of
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:40.640]   Wealth in the hands of salary employees, which is a wonderful thing and needs to happen
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:42.640]   and and so
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:46.240]   Uh, you know, I think google does these kinds of things because they're the right thing to do
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:51.760]   Yes, but they're also the smart thing to do because uh, if you're if you're going to start a family
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:56.960]   And you know you can work at google and get that kind of benefit then I think it'd be a lot more loyal to stick around
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:00.560]   Oh, yeah, I believe the green
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:04.000]   Although again for low wage workers or for other googles
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:10.320]   For anyone who isn't an engineer google's a crappy place to work because engineers kind of look down on you
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:14.720]   And they try to contract out as much of that as possible, but yes if you're an engineer you're fine
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:20.560]   Although I might go try to work at starbucks in the afternoons
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:23.600]   Oh
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:33.920]   I actually I absolutely hate going to some of the stores around
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:36.960]   here because they're so short staffed and
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:40.960]   I go in there and I'm paying more for food
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:47.280]   You know that I then I normally would have to pay and then I'm doing the check out myself
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:49.040]   and
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:55.600]   I'm like this this just is is bad, but I I I salute the people that says you know what I I can do better
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:37:02.640]   Elsewhere, you know, I I whether it's getting money from the government or just trying to start something on their own
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:05.680]   But man, it's really making shopping
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:09.200]   Here locally just a bit of a pain in the butt for me
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:16.160]   It's not you aunt, but my brother worked at starbucks another it's not just pay it is that they're customers
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:21.600]   Yeah, and their customers are horrible. I yes. Yes. Yes. I mean like like even if
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:27.040]   Like I think it'd be fun to do that for a little while, but I mean I have had
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:32.480]   I mean I worked in public store like I I worked at a grocery store when I was a kid
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:33.520]   but
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:39.760]   I mean you did get some real awful people and my understanding is we've only got worse and more aggressive
[01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:44.800]   People are feeling way more entitled nowadays according to my hardhead up in college
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:47.360]   I'm not going to say where he's working, but he
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:54.080]   He he doesn't like people anymore because people are so entitled where they come into these places and
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:59.840]   You know want this and that and want it be this way versus that way, you know as if they're at
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:04.640]   Burger King where you can have it your way, you know, it's and they and they want it fast
[01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:12.560]   Which you know and they want to be part of this naked in its own tail of where we're at with the great resignation because I because I completely agree
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:14.800]   I am all four people
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:19.920]   Recognizing and standing up for themselves and realizing hey, I'm worth more
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:27.040]   Both from a value standpoint and from like an emotional standpoint of where we were like I I deserve more than I'm getting
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:33.680]   But because of the those shortages caused by that then you end up with the people coming in and saying okay your short staff
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:40.240]   I'm not getting the service that I expect and then those people you know it feeds itself. Yeah, it's a problem. You can be proud brawl
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:42.720]   Oh
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:45.360]   Oh, there was a broad there was brawl. I mean everybody was throwing
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:50.320]   First they were throwing high chairs then chairs then tables at each other
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:56.320]   Carrying up the whole place because one guy got a stake that was rare before somebody else got a stake that was medium
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:02.640]   It was quicker and so one of them got enraged and tempers went wacky
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:05.680]   Oh, yeah to say the least
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:14.160]   Angry people. Yeah, I'm hanger. It's real. It's a real thing. I mean work at ponderosa steakhouse myself
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:24.000]   Uh, let's see here google is going to possibly be introducing limits to what's app chat backups
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:28.160]   Um, and apparently I didn't I didn't realize this so apparently what's app
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:32.960]   I mean I did realize that what's app backups end up on drive, but I didn't realize
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:40.000]   Until I read this article that apparently this has been freed. It doesn't count towards your google drive storage quota or your account
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.920]   I had no idea about that. I had no idea about that either
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:47.040]   That's kind of crazy and it kind of blows me away
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:51.600]   Google has its own efforts that are counter to you know what what meta
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:58.800]   Slash facebook does with you know, what's app? It's chat efforts and yet google's just been kind of to a certain degree like bankroll
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:03.280]   And they're they're free storage for backups. So apparently this is going to be changing here pretty soon
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:07.440]   Uh google's probably going to be implementing some limits
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:14.240]   I think this might have to do with some code strings that were found in the whatsapp beta that show a preparation towards this and uh
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:19.200]   I don't know. Something tells me facebook will be fine. They'll figure it out, but
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:24.400]   Still I had no idea. I didn't know I just I thought everything counted against your storage quote at this point
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:27.760]   That's a nice google nugget. Yeah
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:30.560]   Nugget
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:36.400]   Yeah, are we still on google? I want to ask Anna question this non google sure go for it
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:42.160]   We can go where our line since since I feel like the cats away we can we can we can say all right
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:45.520]   He's not gonna complain you decide
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:47.840]   He doesn't have to scroll
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:49.120]   uh
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:53.600]   Line 39 and I don't know even opinion about this but a a a c2pa
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:55.520]   spec
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:58.720]   to assure provenance and and and
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:03.360]   creator credit for media especially for top photography
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:05.920]   is this something this music to your ears or
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:12.400]   Doesn't that yeah, I remember adobe talking about this a couple years ago. Yep, and
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:17.040]   It's it's quite promising, but again with standards
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:23.440]   Uh, you got to get everybody on board and that's that that could be part of the problem right there
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:26.960]   It's just getting everybody on board with doing things a certain way
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:32.160]   Um, but yeah, I remember this a couple years ago. So this is there's been an update to that
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:37.600]   Yeah, now they have kind of the first standard out. So you're right. That's that shows how much time it takes
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:46.000]   Yeah, first one point. Oh one point. Oh is now out of the tech specification outstanding. Okay. I didn't catch that
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:50.320]   So I'll be curious that if you tried to implement that on your photos
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:54.160]   I haven't seen not I have not
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:42:02.000]   Um again because I when when adobe was talking about it. It was all the the whole beta talk and stuff and yeah, it was 2019
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:07.360]   You're right. I didn't want to take chances and have something get screwed up. So no
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:11.280]   But it's nice to see that now we do have version one
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:14.000]   Ready to go. Yes. Good
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:19.840]   Will will this ever come into play with naps and f t's a good question
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:23.600]   This is just his thing today. Do not make neft happen
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:25.840]   Jason
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:29.120]   For now and having to say you're right i'm coming back to you in the verge
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:31.680]   This is how it happens. This is how it starts, right?
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:36.960]   You make fun of it and then at some point it you're not making fun of it anymore. You've just adopted it
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:39.280]   So you're right. Yeah, I will stop it. Stop the nap
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:42.640]   Yeah, when iron goes too far
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:45.280]   It's just reality
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:47.040]   That's right
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:53.360]   That's right, but I mean seriously. I wonder if that would that would be uh useful for for nft's
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:43:00.800]   Um just because we you know we hear about these nft's being repurposed and oh, that's not the real one that that person posted that person's image
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:05.440]   Over here at one hundred there but at the same time blockchain was supposed to
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:11.680]   Give you that authenticity was supposed to yeah, it's supposed to be true. Well, it gives you authenticity
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:13.840]   that
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:15.840]   well
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:19.200]   It depends on who creates the contract. I mean that's yeah, yeah
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:20.800]   I mean
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:26.240]   Basically, it says the the digital item you have is the digital item you have now if someone says
[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:27.600]   like
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:33.600]   If I lie and say i'm the creator and I create the digital item and I you know put it on the ledger as the
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:36.640]   I am the creator of this item
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:37.920]   then
[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:40.720]   You know, I've just committed fraud, but my fraud is
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:44.240]   It has a provenance. I guess is how you should think about it
[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:49.280]   The interesting thing is if I decide if I am a creator someone steals my work puts it on the blockchain
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:53.360]   I have a very clear trail back to who created it when I'm seeking redress
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:57.280]   And so I'm wondering when we'll see those kind of court cases
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:03.920]   Because it's perfect for that in one effect that will have on some of these nft's does that make sense?
[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:06.960]   Yeah
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:10.720]   Uh should we pour one out for um
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:16.160]   What was it called dm for uh meta's dm, which is now shutting down?
[01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:19.840]   Oh, I was like direct messages. They're still here. Oh, sorry
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:28.400]   Dm's are not going anywhere, but dm once known as libra launched back in 2019. It was facebook's
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:31.040]   Great to know did save it
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:33.680]   Yeah, nothing saved it apparently
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:40.000]   Uh, they're selling it to silver gate capital corporation for 182 million dollars the assets
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:42.720]   of that and uh
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:48.240]   Yeah, based on what I was reading through and you know, of course jaktor sees weighing in on it too saying like it was a total waste
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:51.040]   Time they should have just like put all their efforts into bitcoin
[01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:52.960]   That's that's what they should have done
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:55.040]   But ultimately it sounds like you know
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:58.720]   The people who are really close with this just from day one
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:04.720]   It was all about you know federal regulators had had a problem with it and uh, there was just nothing they could do to undo
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:07.520]   kind of the the view of
[01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:08.800]   Facebook
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:15.520]   Creating its own currency in light of you know all of its other kind of uh chaos happening the past couple of years
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:19.680]   And it's ultimately it sort of makes sense for facebook to have wanted to
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:23.760]   To create its own little cryptocurrency like that because they're a platform
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:26.160]   um
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:31.120]   If they're if they're a platform and they're building out worlds, you know
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:36.320]   Years down the road where people can exchange goods. It makes sense to have their own in
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:40.560]   inclusive um exclusive currency to me
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:44.480]   But then yeah, you I guess regulation would
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:50.160]   What about jack's point is just go with the currency? Well, I have to build all that why not go to build it
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:52.560]   Buy or build kind of the old and the old ways
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:53.840]   Uh
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:59.520]   Why not support which he he's doing with with his transactional platform? What is this?
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:04.400]   Yeah, but who's to say that bitcoin is really accessible to
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:06.400]   um
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:10.960]   I mean, hick some people feel bitcoin is exclusive because it's not as
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:13.120]   um
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:14.480]   accessible
[01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:17.840]   You know, I that I can put up digital money out there
[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:21.840]   But getting digital money and turning into bitcoin is quite a challenge for some people
[01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:28.160]   Yeah, it's not obvious. It's certainly not an obvious process. It's way easier now than it then it was
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:34.800]   Now but it's you you also I mean not obvious you also want you have to establish some sort of
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:37.680]   friction in these because otherwise
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:45.520]   Yeah, people would be stolen their buddy would be stolen left right although. Yeah, they begin big time trouble. Yeah, you're right
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:48.560]   But you know what let's not talk about it because it died
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:54.800]   Yeah, okay. So see you later. Oh, how cruel how heartless how soon forgotten
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:58.000]   Jim we hardly knew you
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.160]   Right
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:02.160]   But dms you're still cool
[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:05.120]   You can learn okay. Yeah, cool. Thank you
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:13.200]   Uh, how about we uh do a little changelog? We've got some actually really great stuff in the changelog this week. So um, I'm excited
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:17.680]   about some of this when you're doing it you give yourself good stuff when leo's doing it
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:25.920]   I get it. I have nothing to do with the quality of the news. All right. I just walked out this week. Nice
[01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:27.440]   lies
[01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:29.440]   sound the horns
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:31.680]   the google changelog
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:34.320]   oh
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:40.800]   All right starting with google announcing a new layout for gmail
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:48.160]   It's going to be changing how google chat meet and spaces are um, sorry are integrated onto the page
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:51.840]   Uh used to be that these things kind of have their own little modules
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:54.960]   And so you could see your email and all the other things kind of you know
[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:57.200]   Like your chat down in the bottom corner or whatever
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:02.320]   Now things are going to shift so that I think it's so that there's icons along the side
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:09.280]   So basically you have like a g a mail icon on the side when you click that the entire window represents your gmail
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:13.440]   If you click chat, then I think everything changes to chat. It's a more
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:17.280]   I don't know what you call that, but it's definitely different and uh stacey
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:20.560]   It sounded like prior to the show you were talking about this a little bit you have some thoughts on this
[01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:23.840]   Yeah, I just I was
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:30.560]   This is for no, I just want to be clear. This is for the g sweep
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:38.480]   That's right. I failed demote space. Sorry. Yeah, I think I failed to mention that it's uh, it is for the workspace
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:42.160]   Sweet tools. So so workspace so we actually get a benefit
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:46.720]   Apparently you've waited long enough Jeff
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:53.760]   Wow, okay because like as a workspace customer, I think I've had
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:55.760]   Oh
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:57.760]   No, I have
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:03.520]   Okay, I can't tell what's the new view and what's not is what I I don't have thoughts. I have confusion
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:06.320]   I was trying to figure out which view I was like google
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:14.800]   Each of like because I am I have my personal google account and that I have my workspace account and they both look different right?
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:16.880]   so I'm like
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:19.840]   Which which one am I getting? I don't know
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:22.960]   That was my question
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:29.920]   So if you look at if you I mean if we if we pull up that that uh the article
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:35.600]   On the screen I can I can kind of point out to you that they basically the hero image on the screen
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:39.200]   If you if you take a look at this and you see the far left you see how
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:46.160]   There's that like very first toolbar on the far far left and it's got mail chat spaces and meet
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:50.560]   And my understanding is when you tap the mail button
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:56.080]   Everything you get what you see on the screen right now, which is just like a general gmail layout
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:00.800]   But that control kind of tab on the on the left underneath the sandwich
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:07.040]   Icon, you know if you hit chat there, I think oh guessing the entire screen
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:13.120]   To the right of that shifts to the chat functionality and then spaces and then meet
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:16.320]   It's it's just it's laying things out a little bit differently
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:17.760]   It's kind of cleaning it up a little bit
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:23.360]   But I think some people are going to have a problem with the fact that it doesn't give you everything on the screen at one time
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:26.880]   The way the current layout kind of does right like I can have my
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:32.000]   On the screen along with my email and that's what i'm used to right now. This this implementation
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:33.920]   I think changes that
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:37.520]   And that's what I was worried about I was trying to figure that out because I don't want that
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:44.080]   Yeah, yeah, I'm working within my email and i'm chatting with people while i'm working within my email
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:51.840]   So i'm like right. Oh, this is not and so if you're in your email and the chat comes through instead of seeing the chat on your screen
[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:54.320]   Like down in the little module you'll get a little
[01:50:54.320 --> 01:51:01.360]   A little color or a number next to the chat button on the left that says oh you have a new chat and then you have to click over there and
[01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:04.240]   You know it'll pull it up
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:08.640]   So I don't know if it's any better, but it's different and apparently it's rolling out soon
[01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:11.360]   Yeah, so there you go. So i'm gonna
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:13.360]   Knock you off that
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:16.800]   Off any sort of excitement that you may have had about a gmail redesign
[01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:24.880]   Uh, I don't know we might end up growing into it, you know and liking it. I don't know. I'm multitasking my inbox
[01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:27.280]   Anyway, it comes up February. So we'll see
[01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:29.840]   Yeah, we'll see very soon
[01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:34.480]   Uh, but I mean their plans are like yes, this is uh, we're starting it in february
[01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:41.120]   It's the default option in april. It's the only option by the end of q2 2022. So they're like this is the future
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000]   Okay for it
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:50.800]   Um the g suite legacy free edition couple a couple a couple of years ago kind of feels like that a couple of weeks ago
[01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:53.680]   Um, there was the whole thing where you know
[01:51:53.680 --> 01:52:00.560]   Users of g suite legacy free edition have had like free access to this for like the last 10 years google
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:04.240]   Stop supporting it, but never like booted them off or made them pay
[01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:10.080]   Um, and then they said well that's ending you're gonna have to pay and here are the service prices and people
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:14.800]   You know lost their their minds about that as people are want to do with these things
[01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:17.280]   Uh, so apparently they're making changes
[01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:18.880]   Um
[01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:26.160]   There will be an ability to transfer your non google workspace paid content and most of your data to a no-cost option
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:35.120]   I don't know if we know exactly what that option is yet, but it seems to be something about transferring the the legacy free edition to a regular gmailik
[01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:38.800]   Uh, dot com address that's likely anyways, so
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:44.960]   So if you fall into that category there will hopefully be still a uh, an alternative for you
[01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:49.680]   I think a lot of people did I I was not one of those free users so but
[01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:56.400]   Her film i've been paying and angry about it every time I get screwed from a new function. Yes exactly
[01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:59.840]   Pan and wonder what wonder and why
[01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:07.360]   Uh, youtube's rolling out a new um, a new mobile interface for full-screen video basically just
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:12.720]   Uh, it kind of cleans up the the presentation. This is on android and ios to bring comments
[01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:17.360]   Uh, share that sort of stuff onto the screen in a more elegant way
[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:21.280]   So I mean not a whole lot new to you know talk about there
[01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:27.120]   It's just kind of a redesign of the player on android and ios this started rolling out on monday
[01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:33.520]   Um, so yeah, I guess look at look for that. It only appears if you're watching in full-screen
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:36.160]   So there's that
[01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:38.880]   Uh google one
[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:43.600]   Vpn is now offered for iphone so I guess this was only
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:49.520]   For android i didn't i didn't realize that you couldn't get this on iphone before but apparently you couldn't and now you can
[01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:54.160]   So that's yeah, I thought it was cross platform too. Yeah, yeah
[01:53:54.160 --> 01:54:00.160]   Uh available to people in 18 countries including the usuk, canada and mexico
[01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:03.360]   So if you are an iphone user and you want google ones vpn
[01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:06.080]   Apparently you can start getting that right away
[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:12.960]   This one's cool and I haven't received a message from an iphone user since this has hit my phone
[01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:14.480]   but
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:19.280]   Uh, if you use google messages and you were chatting with someone who has an iphone
[01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:22.320]   And they do some sort of reaction to your chat
[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:27.440]   That is to say instead of saying like oh, I like what you just sent they hit the heart
[01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:32.560]   Uh before if they did that you would get a message that said so and so
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:38.640]   Loved and then quote your entire message like all entire darned message
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:42.160]   Yeah, it was annoying and ugly and it's like, you know
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:45.600]   Once once we started knowing that google is working on actually
[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:49.280]   Taking that text and converting it into actual like images
[01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:53.040]   It was like why did you do this sooner and finally it's rolling out?
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:55:00.400]   Uh, and I I have the setting on my phone, but like I said, I haven't received a message from is this an rcs thing mr
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:02.640]   How is this just google magic?
[01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:06.400]   No, this is google magic. This is only in in google messages
[01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:10.800]   This is google basically saying taking the string that I mean if I understanding it
[01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:13.440]   It was taking the string that comes back from an iphone
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:20.080]   And recognizing that string and converting it in the way that it knows how like if an iphone says
[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:25.840]   Loved then we put a heart next to your message. Yeah. Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah
[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:29.280]   Um, but I do know that some people have had kind of mixed
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:35.920]   Experience with it like sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't like I think we're a ron Richards all about and reko host
[01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:41.600]   Uh, he said that he didn't think that it was working on images. It worked on on some of his text
[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:44.240]   Um messages back and forth
[01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:49.520]   But if it was an image it didn't work. It said liked the image or something like that. So what about google?
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:52.560]   I wonder about google voice people. Yeah
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:55.280]   I don't know
[01:55:55.280 --> 01:55:59.920]   um text and feature through that instead of messages is still a google product and
[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:02.400]   Yeah
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:05.120]   Yeah, I don't know but I mean even if it fixes
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:10.720]   Let's say two thirds of of those comments coming from an iphone that'll still be better than nothing
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:14.800]   You know and it does look nice when it works. It looks nice based on the screenshots I've seen so
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:18.960]   So that's neat. Um
[01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:21.360]   Any pixel for a fans in the house
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:26.800]   If so, you're not gonna be able to buy one in yeah, I liked it. Okay. I thought it was a good phone
[01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:28.960]   Yeah, um
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:33.600]   Yeah, maybe maybe that's the device you should have got stacy instead of the five but you can't
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:36.400]   It's gone. No, I got that
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:41.440]   I was moving from a three a and I didn't want to go. Yeah one up that felt lame
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:46.240]   Yeah, totally and also it's you know, it's it's an older phone. It's one a year older than the five
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:48.880]   more or less, but
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:50.880]   um, but yeah, this was uh
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:55.120]   This was 350 at launch if you remember it long it was delayed
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:59.840]   Um, this was 2020 right so it was the beginning of covid
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:05.200]   It was supposed to come out like march or april or somewhere around there and it ended up getting delayed delayed summer
[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:07.760]   Um, it was the truck phone
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:14.240]   It was uh, we're looking for our best here. We we got it out. We should be happy that we got it out at least
[01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:18.720]   Uh phone and uh, it is also the last a series device
[01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:22.480]   Uh to get a wide release the the five a 5g
[01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:27.200]   Uh actually was very limited to a handful of markets because of the supply chain. So
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:30.400]   So any who
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:33.840]   Uh, you won't be able to get that at the google store anymore. It is so it is out of stock
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:36.560]   And not going to be sold anymore
[01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:40.000]   And then finally if you have the pixel three
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:46.960]   You may remember google's promise that you would have unlimited original photo backups
[01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:52.640]   Until a certain time well that certain time has happened that certain time was january 31st
[01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:55.680]   2022 it seemed like so long
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:58.880]   When you first bought that phone, I know but now
[01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:03.040]   Roughly three and a quarter years later. Uh, that has expired
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:09.360]   Come on. I'm your roost. I worked for an employer that had lifetime job guarantees and then they had to redefine life
[01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:12.800]   What is life? Yeah
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:15.680]   Who's still around
[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:18.160]   Leave
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:21.760]   It's important to determine. Yeah, who's life are we talking about here?
[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:24.560]   Or what's life anyways?
[01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:27.600]   All right, and that is the google change log
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:34.400]   There we go
[01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:35.200]   Um
[01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:41.680]   Any last stories before we take a break and do our our tips tricks and numbers and all that anything that you were itching to
[01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:45.520]   Talk about that we didn't quite get to there's a lot of stuff in here and I know we
[01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:52.480]   Did you tell us this was really small about fy other people did zucker bird's warning if you take a screenshot of a messenger
[01:58:52.480 --> 01:59:00.080]   Oh, yeah, the person the other people in that in that conversation will get a notification. Hi kacha
[01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:06.560]   That's right, but that's good. That's good for prime. It's good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it is good instead
[01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:09.040]   Was it too party curse that that what that is
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:11.040]   Kinda
[01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:15.120]   Well, it's not a matter of the proof because it's like a notification, but yeah, yeah
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:22.400]   It just says line 49 just a question for you west coasters. Would you take an air taxi flight over San Francisco bay?
[01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:24.560]   Um, sure
[01:59:24.560 --> 01:59:27.760]   Why don't I would take an air taxi flight over to no pilot
[01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:31.120]   No pilot
[01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:32.080]   Oh, why not?
[01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:37.440]   No pilot if it drops being the sound it's gonna be real cold, but i'm pretty sure let me refresh that
[01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:44.080]   I'm not i'm not doing that this this month or this quarter. Yeah, I'd do it next year perhaps
[01:59:44.720 --> 01:59:46.960]   What was the best sharks though, right?
[01:59:46.960 --> 01:59:50.800]   Shark shark meets good
[01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:54.560]   No, he's tough. He he killed the shark
[01:59:54.560 --> 01:59:59.120]   No shark, it's like I just punched that guy in
[01:59:59.120 --> 02:00:05.360]   I dare a shark to find me when I fall out of my air taxi
[02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:10.160]   I'll take that shark down. That's a challenge. I
[02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:13.120]   I feel that that I may not
[02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:16.480]   Farewell against a shark or it might be
[02:00:16.480 --> 02:00:19.760]   I've been pretty sure. Yeah, I would not either
[02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:25.920]   And on the other hand, I think and could single-handedly take down a shark. I'm just yeah. Oh, yeah, I'd give a shout
[02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:31.120]   You try your best. I think we don't try our best. I think you just have better
[02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:35.680]   What kinds of sharks? Oh no
[02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:44.000]   Some people jump the sharks. Yeah, but I don't worry about it. It's scary. She's on the water
[02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:46.560]   She's worried about the shark then coming together
[02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:53.200]   You know what the sharks that live in the bay are pretty benign, but there are 11 species of them
[02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:55.280]   Okay
[02:00:55.280 --> 02:01:00.080]   Well, they might not they must not be that bad because there are um, there are
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:05.200]   A lot of people who you know challenged themselves by swimming across the bay and
[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:09.840]   Apparently they do have a lot of riptides. So that would be bad. Yeah
[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:14.080]   I would never swim across the bay. That just sounds like a nightmare to me, but
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:16.880]   I mean, it's hard to hold
[02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:18.720]   Very yeah
[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:21.040]   I mean, I landed up in the pacific up here
[02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:26.880]   In the summer and I was like I am gonna die hypothermia. It was so cold
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:29.600]   Yeah
[02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:33.920]   How about how about this one in it? How did you land? I fell out of a boat
[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:37.360]   Oh, no. Oh my goodness. No way
[02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:40.320]   I can swim. It's okay involved
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:43.680]   Yeah, still was a who was Jen involved
[02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:49.120]   Oh, I have a friend named Jen and I was like
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:57.520]   Excuse me. No Jen the other day and she told me no
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:04.480]   I fell out of a boat while rowing and it was I was totally sober. I don't believe in
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:09.840]   Drinking and rowing good. I hope not. I'm worried. Yes. Okay. That's good. That makes me happy
[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:12.480]   How about this one lord?
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:15.520]   Metaverse real estate
[02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:20.480]   To top 500 million dollars projected to shuffle board every minute
[02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:26.160]   This is just like it blows my mind, but I mean you need a place to put your fake. Hey
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:33.520]   Yeah, kind of inevitable though, right that that there would be some sort of value out of these this virtual
[02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:39.680]   Real estate because if there are virtual worlds built and if there are virtual worlds built with
[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:41.280]   Uh
[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:47.120]   Episenters or places where everybody is positioned and then you know worlds outside of that
[02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:53.920]   Something closer to that is you know, if you sell it anyways if you choose to sell it would be worth more than something that's far far off
[02:02:53.920 --> 02:02:57.280]   So this is kind of inevitable, right? I guess I just didn't think it would be this
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:02.320]   Expensive are we missing out an opportunity? Should I invest in virtual real estate?
[02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:05.200]   What I find fascinating
[02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:11.040]   And my friend yanko did a story for protocol this week about like who owns who owns his address in the metaverse
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:14.480]   Yes, I'm talking to him tomorrow on tech news weekly. Yeah
[02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:17.040]   About that story
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:22.560]   You know, he had a dedicated fan place of like women who thought he was so hot when he was doing our shows for
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:25.280]   Uh gig ome and he's adorable
[02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:28.480]   Anyway, the point being that yanko
[02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:31.520]   His story is so fascinating to me because i'm like
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:38.160]   Not only do you have to buy like the company that's going to actually create the layer that's over your house, but there's going to be multiples, right?
[02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:39.920]   so
[02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:43.200]   You're basically just investing you're basically betting on a horse
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:46.400]   So do you stretch your bet across all the possible horses?
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:48.560]   Probably if you're smart
[02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:55.600]   And then we haven't discussed rights, but it's probable that you will have rights. We had all this back in pokemon go remember when we were like
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:03:58.400]   Oh, so
[02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:03.760]   And then they'll be best practices like should you buy out like a museum or do they get to own it?
[02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:06.560]   I'm sure some senators are going to be like
[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:14.640]   Uh, no, you should own your own house. You don't want to be like, I don't know your kids walking up with their ar glasses and seeing
[02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:19.360]   You know nudes in their bedroom. Actually your kids might like that. I don't know
[02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:25.980]   - What's your second thoughts?
[02:04:25.980 --> 02:04:28.620]   - Well like, wait a second, this might be ideal
[02:04:28.620 --> 02:04:30.420]   for certain people.
[02:04:30.420 --> 02:04:31.260]   (Laughing)
[02:04:31.260 --> 02:04:32.100]   - Probably.
[02:04:32.100 --> 02:04:35.620]   - Yeah, crazy stuff, crazy stuff.
[02:04:35.620 --> 02:04:37.520]   Well how about how about we take a break
[02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:41.160]   and then when we come back, we'll do our tips and our tricks,
[02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:41.980]   all of that.
[02:04:41.980 --> 02:04:45.500]   - You are so efficient, you with your tons of stories,
[02:04:45.500 --> 02:04:46.340]   good job, sir.
[02:04:46.340 --> 02:04:50.740]   - Yeah, if we could get out of here before like,
[02:04:50.740 --> 02:04:52.640]   4.45, I did already have a waffle,
[02:04:52.640 --> 02:04:54.180]   so I am, I am do it, okay.
[02:04:54.180 --> 02:04:55.020]   - You're waffle.
[02:04:55.020 --> 02:04:56.340]   - For those of you who didn't come on before,
[02:04:56.340 --> 02:04:59.580]   we talked about, I want to have a Stacey blood sugar
[02:04:59.580 --> 02:05:02.700]  ometer and that'll determine how long the show goes.
[02:05:02.700 --> 02:05:03.820]   It kind of counts down.
[02:05:03.820 --> 02:05:06.860]   Oh waffle, oh that's full again, it's okay, you know.
[02:05:06.860 --> 02:05:09.100]   - I'm curious to see how fast we get that,
[02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:11.620]   that request filled.
[02:05:11.620 --> 02:05:12.460]   Does that know our listening?
[02:05:12.460 --> 02:05:13.300]   - Blood sugarometer.
[02:05:13.300 --> 02:05:14.300]   - So you're back, I'm passionate.
[02:05:14.300 --> 02:05:15.700]   (Laughing)
[02:05:15.700 --> 02:05:17.660]   (Laughing)
[02:05:17.660 --> 02:05:19.020]   - All right, well let's take a break.
[02:05:19.020 --> 02:05:20.740]   And if you do need to get a waffle,
[02:05:20.740 --> 02:05:22.780]   now would be the time you're clear to do it,
[02:05:22.780 --> 02:05:23.820]   but it sounds like you're okay.
[02:05:23.820 --> 02:05:25.580]   But go for it.
[02:05:25.580 --> 02:05:27.260]   - A waffle delivery.
[02:05:27.260 --> 02:05:28.620]   - That's right, right.
[02:05:28.620 --> 02:05:29.860]   This episode of This Week in Google
[02:05:29.860 --> 02:05:31.500]   is brought to you by CashFly.
[02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:33.980]   We love CashFly here at Twit
[02:05:33.980 --> 02:05:38.940]   because we rely on them and we have for so many years.
[02:05:38.940 --> 02:05:40.700]   We've been with them for 10 years actually.
[02:05:40.700 --> 02:05:43.940]   We love using them so we know how amazing CashFly can be.
[02:05:43.940 --> 02:05:45.780]   And you do too because you see it on the quality
[02:05:45.780 --> 02:05:48.380]   of the video that you get on your end.
[02:05:48.380 --> 02:05:50.300]   Deliver your video with CashFly,
[02:05:50.300 --> 02:05:53.540]   the best throughput and global reach,
[02:05:53.540 --> 02:05:55.940]   making your content infinitely scalable.
[02:05:55.940 --> 02:05:57.860]   That's the beauty of CashFly, right?
[02:05:57.860 --> 02:05:58.820]   It scales.
[02:05:58.820 --> 02:06:01.060]   You can go live in hours, not days,
[02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:03.300]   with sub one second latency.
[02:06:03.300 --> 02:06:04.980]   It's super fast.
[02:06:04.980 --> 02:06:07.900]   You can ditch your unreliable web RTC solution
[02:06:07.900 --> 02:06:10.980]   for their web socket live video workflow.
[02:06:10.980 --> 02:06:14.620]   It's scalable to millions of users.
[02:06:14.620 --> 02:06:17.900]   No one wants to wait for content to load.
[02:06:17.900 --> 02:06:19.860]   I've certainly been there where you click the play
[02:06:19.860 --> 02:06:21.620]   and then you're like, all right, it's still waiting,
[02:06:21.620 --> 02:06:22.460]   still waiting.
[02:06:22.460 --> 02:06:25.140]   CashFly's ultra low latency video streaming,
[02:06:25.140 --> 02:06:28.020]   you're going to dramatically increase your sites
[02:06:28.020 --> 02:06:31.300]   and application speed for global audiences.
[02:06:31.300 --> 02:06:33.580]   Doesn't matter where they are, it's gonna be fast.
[02:06:33.580 --> 02:06:36.460]   With more than 50 locations around the globe,
[02:06:36.460 --> 02:06:38.740]   that content's gonna be delivered closer
[02:06:38.740 --> 02:06:39.940]   to wherever they happen to be
[02:06:39.940 --> 02:06:43.580]   from those outperforming local CDNs.
[02:06:43.580 --> 02:06:46.580]   You can reduce bandwidth and increase your cash hit ratio
[02:06:46.580 --> 02:06:51.580]   to 100% with CashFly's storage optimization system.
[02:06:51.780 --> 02:06:54.380]   And with CashFly's elite managed packages,
[02:06:54.380 --> 02:06:56.060]   you're gonna get VIP treatment.
[02:06:56.060 --> 02:07:00.180]   That's 24/7 support, response times in less than an hour.
[02:07:00.180 --> 02:07:02.620]   And in most cases, they're gonna already know
[02:07:02.620 --> 02:07:06.380]   of any of the issues and will actually be actively working
[02:07:06.380 --> 02:07:08.580]   to fix them before your team does.
[02:07:08.580 --> 02:07:10.500]   That's just how awesome they are.
[02:07:10.500 --> 02:07:12.940]   With CashFly, you're gonna get ultra low latency
[02:07:12.940 --> 02:07:14.060]   video streaming.
[02:07:14.060 --> 02:07:16.180]   It's gonna deliver video to more than a million
[02:07:16.180 --> 02:07:18.500]   concurrent users.
[02:07:18.500 --> 02:07:20.180]   That's just amazing to think about.
[02:07:20.180 --> 02:07:23.020]   Lightning Fast Gaming, which is gonna deliver
[02:07:23.020 --> 02:07:26.820]   downloads faster, zero lag, no glitches or outages,
[02:07:26.820 --> 02:07:28.180]   nothing like that.
[02:07:28.180 --> 02:07:31.020]   Mobile content optimization that actually offers
[02:07:31.020 --> 02:07:33.380]   automatic and simple image optimization.
[02:07:33.380 --> 02:07:37.660]   So your site is gonna load faster on whatever device
[02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:40.060]   you wanna reach on the other end.
[02:07:40.060 --> 02:07:43.100]   And multi-CDN for redundancy and failover,
[02:07:43.100 --> 02:07:46.220]   which actually intelligently balances your traffic
[02:07:46.220 --> 02:07:48.060]   across multiple providers.
[02:07:48.060 --> 02:07:49.780]   That gives you the shortest routes
[02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:51.860]   and mitigates against performance glitches,
[02:07:51.860 --> 02:07:54.140]   those things you really don't want in there.
[02:07:54.140 --> 02:07:58.100]   CashFly is 10 times faster than traditional methods
[02:07:58.100 --> 02:08:00.140]   and on six continents as well.
[02:08:00.140 --> 02:08:03.460]   They are 30% faster than other major CDNs
[02:08:03.460 --> 02:08:06.500]   with a 98% cash hit ratio.
[02:08:06.500 --> 02:08:10.100]   They've had 100% availability in the last 12 months.
[02:08:10.100 --> 02:08:13.380]   Best of all, they have 24/7, 365 days a year,
[02:08:13.380 --> 02:08:15.300]   priority support.
[02:08:15.300 --> 02:08:17.620]   So you know they're always gonna be there for you
[02:08:17.620 --> 02:08:18.620]   when you need them.
[02:08:18.620 --> 02:08:20.100]   They've definitely been there for us
[02:08:20.100 --> 02:08:21.300]   when we've needed them as well.
[02:08:21.300 --> 02:08:23.260]   So just for Twit listeners,
[02:08:23.260 --> 02:08:27.460]   CashFly is giving away complimentary detailed analysis
[02:08:27.460 --> 02:08:31.020]   of your current CDN bill and usage trends.
[02:08:31.020 --> 02:08:34.660]   So you can actually see if you're overpaying 20% or more.
[02:08:34.660 --> 02:08:37.180]   You can learn more, go read about it yourself.
[02:08:37.180 --> 02:08:42.180]   twit.cashfly.com, that's twit.cashfly.com.
[02:08:42.180 --> 02:08:46.540]   And we thank CashFly for their continued support
[02:08:46.540 --> 02:08:50.020]   of the Twit Network and this week in Google.
[02:08:50.020 --> 02:08:53.340]   All right, so we are on the,
[02:08:53.340 --> 02:08:56.580]   I think Leo calls it the back of the book, I believe.
[02:08:56.580 --> 02:09:00.180]   We've got the tips, the tricks, the things.
[02:09:00.180 --> 02:09:02.980]   Let's start with you Stacey, what you got?
[02:09:02.980 --> 02:09:03.820]   - Y'all.
[02:09:03.820 --> 02:09:06.980]   - I have an exciting book for y'all
[02:09:06.980 --> 02:09:11.620]   because I am reading Neil Stevenson's termination shock.
[02:09:11.620 --> 02:09:13.300]   Actually, I'm listening to it on audiobook,
[02:09:13.300 --> 02:09:14.340]   which is unusual for me
[02:09:14.340 --> 02:09:16.580]   because this is a 23 hour audiobook.
[02:09:16.580 --> 02:09:21.780]   Okay, so this is Neil Stevenson's latest.
[02:09:21.780 --> 02:09:23.700]   - You make it go faster?
[02:09:23.700 --> 02:09:25.220]   - Yeah, I do, I make it go,
[02:09:25.220 --> 02:09:27.900]   I went with 1.25 for this one.
[02:09:27.900 --> 02:09:30.900]   I like when I can go all the way to 1.5, but okay,
[02:09:30.900 --> 02:09:32.540]   here's the thinking y'all. - I can't be 1.5.
[02:09:32.540 --> 02:09:36.100]   - Oh, I can do it, a lot of them are pretty slow,
[02:09:36.100 --> 02:09:39.260]   but this is a man reading and he's a little faster.
[02:09:39.260 --> 02:09:43.420]   And Neil Stevenson, I am not a Neil Stevenson fan.
[02:09:43.420 --> 02:09:46.260]   I'll just throw it out there y'all.
[02:09:46.260 --> 02:09:49.820]   Not a fan usually didn't like many of his books.
[02:09:49.820 --> 02:09:53.140]   I did read, you know, what is the metaverse?
[02:09:53.140 --> 02:09:54.500]   Snow crash way back in the day.
[02:09:54.500 --> 02:09:58.780]   Anyway, point being, this is an okay book.
[02:09:58.780 --> 02:10:01.420]   If you like his stuff, you will like this.
[02:10:01.420 --> 02:10:05.140]   It starts out with the, I cannot curse.
[02:10:05.140 --> 02:10:08.340]   I have to curse on this, I'm sorry,
[02:10:08.340 --> 02:10:11.420]   get ready to be a bad crazy intro
[02:10:11.420 --> 02:10:14.540]   involving pigs, an airplane crash,
[02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:17.260]   and meth gators in rednecks in Texas.
[02:10:17.260 --> 02:10:19.020]   And the fact that I lived in Texas
[02:10:19.020 --> 02:10:20.700]   made me feel real close to this.
[02:10:20.700 --> 02:10:22.780]   So that was the positive side.
[02:10:22.780 --> 02:10:25.420]   The downside is it took for freaking ever for him
[02:10:25.420 --> 02:10:27.580]   to like describe this like way too long,
[02:10:27.580 --> 02:10:28.940]   needed as an editor.
[02:10:28.940 --> 02:10:31.140]   But I think the engineering types will like it
[02:10:31.140 --> 02:10:34.140]   because he really goes into everything.
[02:10:34.140 --> 02:10:36.220]   The research shows.
[02:10:36.220 --> 02:10:38.460]   It might actually be like talking to me.
[02:10:38.460 --> 02:10:39.660]   Okay.
[02:10:39.660 --> 02:10:43.660]   So I put this in the category of kind of boring,
[02:10:43.660 --> 02:10:45.660]   but at least it sort of tries to have a plot
[02:10:45.660 --> 02:10:46.900]   climate change novels.
[02:10:46.900 --> 02:10:50.260]   It feels very much like Kim, what's his name?
[02:10:50.260 --> 02:10:54.140]   Stanley Robinson's book that everyone was so hyped
[02:10:54.140 --> 02:10:56.260]   about Ministry of the Future,
[02:10:56.260 --> 02:10:58.260]   which had a really killer beginning
[02:10:58.260 --> 02:11:01.780]   and then really devolved into like a plotless list
[02:11:01.780 --> 02:11:04.460]   of things you could do to help prevent climate change.
[02:11:04.460 --> 02:11:06.100]   There was a moderate plot.
[02:11:06.100 --> 02:11:09.340]   This is, has more of a plot, but it's such a slow going
[02:11:09.340 --> 02:11:10.540]   because all of the engineering.
[02:11:10.540 --> 02:11:13.020]   But if you like Neil Stevenson, you'll probably love this.
[02:11:13.020 --> 02:11:13.860]   It's a good book.
[02:11:13.860 --> 02:11:15.580]   It's a good audio book.
[02:11:15.580 --> 02:11:16.420]   There you go.
[02:11:16.420 --> 02:11:21.020]   - And it's going to occupy a lot of your time.
[02:11:21.020 --> 02:11:23.820]   So if you got time to fill this,
[02:11:23.820 --> 02:11:25.900]   like sometimes when I'm looking for an audio book,
[02:11:25.900 --> 02:11:27.700]   it's like, I want the really long one
[02:11:27.700 --> 02:11:30.060]   because I got a lot of extra time coming up here
[02:11:30.060 --> 02:11:31.900]   and I don't want to have to like, you know,
[02:11:31.900 --> 02:11:33.060]   find another something.
[02:11:33.060 --> 02:11:35.660]   So sometimes I'm like reaching for the book
[02:11:35.660 --> 02:11:37.620]   that's going to take a while.
[02:11:37.620 --> 02:11:38.660]   - I'm getting like it.
[02:11:38.660 --> 02:11:40.500]   - Yeah, if you've got a long road trip or in my case
[02:11:40.500 --> 02:11:43.300]   because I can't for my arm thing,
[02:11:43.300 --> 02:11:45.380]   I couldn't hold up a book very easily to read.
[02:11:45.380 --> 02:11:47.340]   So I was like, well, I'm just going to pace
[02:11:47.340 --> 02:11:49.820]   and listen to this book and let me tell you,
[02:11:49.820 --> 02:11:52.860]   I've walked many miles to this book now.
[02:11:52.860 --> 02:11:56.220]   (both laughing)
[02:11:56.220 --> 02:11:57.540]   - Nice stuff right on.
[02:11:57.540 --> 02:11:58.380]   All right.
[02:11:58.380 --> 02:12:01.980]   So that is termination shock.
[02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:02.820]   The novel.
[02:12:02.820 --> 02:12:04.180]   - Oh, Kim Stanley Robinson.
[02:12:04.180 --> 02:12:05.020]   Yes. Thank you.
[02:12:05.020 --> 02:12:06.100]   (laughs)
[02:12:06.100 --> 02:12:08.060]   I was really struggling there.
[02:12:08.060 --> 02:12:09.540]   Kim Stanley Robinson.
[02:12:09.540 --> 02:12:11.940]   Oh yeah. Thanks, out of sync and chat.
[02:12:11.940 --> 02:12:13.860]   Awesome. Thank you, Stacey.
[02:12:13.860 --> 02:12:16.540]   Let's see here.
[02:12:16.540 --> 02:12:18.620]   Jeff, how about you? What you got?
[02:12:18.620 --> 02:12:21.500]   - So a quiz, if you haven't cheated or I looked at it.
[02:12:21.500 --> 02:12:24.060]   - Which company do you think makes more money?
[02:12:24.060 --> 02:12:25.300]   Netflix or YouTube?
[02:12:25.300 --> 02:12:28.380]   - I've cheated. I can't answer.
[02:12:28.380 --> 02:12:30.860]   (both laughing)
[02:12:30.860 --> 02:12:31.900]   - Netflix or YouTube?
[02:12:31.900 --> 02:12:32.900]   - Netflix. - Yeah.
[02:12:32.900 --> 02:12:36.220]   - I would say...
[02:12:37.220 --> 02:12:39.380]   - No, I'd say YouTube.
[02:12:39.380 --> 02:12:40.740]   Ding, ding, ding, ding.
[02:12:40.740 --> 02:12:42.020]   - We're going to have a winner.
[02:12:42.020 --> 02:12:43.020]   - I was surprised.
[02:12:43.020 --> 02:12:44.020]   I was surprised.
[02:12:44.020 --> 02:12:45.860]   I would have fought as Stacey did.
[02:12:45.860 --> 02:12:47.780]   - That one.
[02:12:47.780 --> 02:12:50.420]   - Netflix all wins a lot of money.
[02:12:50.420 --> 02:12:51.260]   - Yeah.
[02:12:51.260 --> 02:12:53.500]   - They spent a lot of money on their original content.
[02:12:53.500 --> 02:12:54.340]   - Right.
[02:12:54.340 --> 02:12:55.660]   - There's lots about profits.
[02:12:55.660 --> 02:12:56.860]   This is just revenue. - That's about revenue.
[02:12:56.860 --> 02:12:57.700]   - But yeah.
[02:12:57.700 --> 02:12:59.940]   - And they just raised their prices, but okay.
[02:12:59.940 --> 02:13:02.900]   - So, wow.
[02:13:02.900 --> 02:13:04.220]   - Yeah, I was surprised.
[02:13:04.220 --> 02:13:06.580]   - And YouTube's is from advertising?
[02:13:06.580 --> 02:13:07.980]   - Yes.
[02:13:07.980 --> 02:13:09.420]   - Okay. - Yeah.
[02:13:09.420 --> 02:13:11.740]   - I mean, they have the YouTube premium.
[02:13:11.740 --> 02:13:13.860]   But I got to believe that's De minimis.
[02:13:13.860 --> 02:13:15.460]   And they just killed all part of that.
[02:13:15.460 --> 02:13:17.380]   They killed all their original programming for that.
[02:13:17.380 --> 02:13:18.380]   So, I don't know if YouTube...
[02:13:18.380 --> 02:13:21.940]   - But, you Jeff, I am hearing you all wrong.
[02:13:21.940 --> 02:13:24.180]   Instead of De minimis, I heard it's too venomous.
[02:13:24.180 --> 02:13:25.180]   And I'm like, what?
[02:13:25.180 --> 02:13:26.980]   (both laughing)
[02:13:26.980 --> 02:13:28.980]   I'm really enjoying you today, Jeff,
[02:13:28.980 --> 02:13:31.020]   with my inability to hear your voice from release.
[02:13:31.020 --> 02:13:33.300]   - Slow that book down to .9, I think.
[02:13:33.300 --> 02:13:35.100]   I think that's my advice here.
[02:13:35.100 --> 02:13:36.580]   - I don't know what's happening here.
[02:13:36.580 --> 02:13:39.580]   - 1.25, which is the normal speed I speak at,
[02:13:39.580 --> 02:13:42.780]   is about 1.5, little too fast for you, I think.
[02:13:42.780 --> 02:13:44.780]   (both laughing)
[02:13:44.780 --> 02:13:45.620]   - Oh, Lord.
[02:13:45.620 --> 02:13:48.020]   - Jen, Jen wouldn't throw me off a boat.
[02:13:48.020 --> 02:13:50.020]   How would you dare say that about Jen?
[02:13:50.020 --> 02:13:51.020]   (both laughing)
[02:13:51.020 --> 02:13:52.820]   - I'm so confused. - I'm so confused.
[02:13:52.820 --> 02:13:53.660]   - My friend.
[02:13:53.660 --> 02:13:54.660]   (both laughing)
[02:13:54.660 --> 02:13:56.860]   - Okay, this is like, how does he know Jen?
[02:13:56.860 --> 02:13:59.740]   - Why does he think she would throw me off the boat?
[02:13:59.740 --> 02:14:01.500]   - She got really nervous.
[02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:02.900]   - She's so much. - She don't know.
[02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:03.740]   - Oh, yeah.
[02:14:03.740 --> 02:14:04.580]   (both laughing)
[02:14:04.580 --> 02:14:07.220]   - It was a great three beat response too.
[02:14:07.220 --> 02:14:09.300]   Look at my, what?
[02:14:09.300 --> 02:14:10.140]   - Wait a minute. - Why?
[02:14:10.140 --> 02:14:11.140]   - Yes.
[02:14:11.140 --> 02:14:12.900]   - I tried to pick it apart.
[02:14:12.900 --> 02:14:13.740]   - Yeah.
[02:14:13.740 --> 02:14:15.140]   - Confused, Stacy face.
[02:14:15.140 --> 02:14:16.260]   It's, yeah.
[02:14:16.260 --> 02:14:21.260]   - So YouTube, $28.8 billion in advertising revenue in 2021.
[02:14:21.260 --> 02:14:25.500]   And I guess what's coming to mind for me was another article
[02:14:25.500 --> 02:14:26.980]   that we had in here.
[02:14:26.980 --> 02:14:28.540]   I got a scan for it.
[02:14:28.540 --> 02:14:33.060]   It was somebody from a creator on YouTube.
[02:14:33.060 --> 02:14:34.540]   Where is that?
[02:14:34.540 --> 02:14:37.060]   Talking about the take for the creator.
[02:14:37.060 --> 02:14:38.260]   - Oh, is it to hey, green?
[02:14:38.260 --> 02:14:39.100]   - Hey, green.
[02:14:39.100 --> 02:14:40.420]   - Yes, that's what it is, okay.
[02:14:40.420 --> 02:14:43.420]   - YouTube versus TikTok.
[02:14:43.420 --> 02:14:44.580]   - TikTok.
[02:14:44.580 --> 02:14:47.940]   Yeah, I just, I don't know, in reading through that,
[02:14:47.940 --> 02:14:49.740]   just made me realize, man, you know,
[02:14:49.740 --> 02:14:51.940]   if you are a creator on YouTube,
[02:14:51.940 --> 02:14:55.420]   you have so much potential to make some serious cash there.
[02:14:55.420 --> 02:14:57.700]   Like, I guess I just never really considered the fact
[02:14:57.700 --> 02:15:01.420]   that the partner programs AdSense split 55% to creators,
[02:15:01.420 --> 02:15:03.100]   45% to YouTube.
[02:15:03.100 --> 02:15:06.260]   So that number that you're seeing, you know, from YouTube,
[02:15:06.260 --> 02:15:08.300]   I mean, obviously not all of that, you know,
[02:15:08.300 --> 02:15:11.540]   you couldn't apply that math to this
[02:15:11.540 --> 02:15:13.940]   and come up with an accurate number.
[02:15:13.940 --> 02:15:17.500]   But I'm sure a lot of that, like, take from this number
[02:15:17.500 --> 02:15:18.820]   and then apply it to creators
[02:15:18.820 --> 02:15:21.980]   and the creators are making some serious bang.
[02:15:21.980 --> 02:15:22.820]   Not that we didn't know that.
[02:15:22.820 --> 02:15:24.500]   - And the two big creators are making ridiculous money,
[02:15:24.500 --> 02:15:26.340]   but yeah.
[02:15:26.340 --> 02:15:28.820]   Two things that makes a point up here.
[02:15:28.820 --> 02:15:33.420]   One is that the ads are associated with you and your video.
[02:15:33.420 --> 02:15:35.620]   So it's attributable and you get the money.
[02:15:35.620 --> 02:15:39.500]   But second, TikTok puts out a $200 million fund
[02:15:39.500 --> 02:15:43.100]   and the more popular people get, the less people get.
[02:15:43.100 --> 02:15:43.940]   - Yeah, right.
[02:15:43.940 --> 02:15:44.780]   - 'Cause it's static.
[02:15:44.780 --> 02:15:46.540]   - And YouTube does never see it.
[02:15:46.540 --> 02:15:47.380]   - Right.
[02:15:47.380 --> 02:15:48.220]   - No.
[02:15:48.220 --> 02:15:51.540]   YouTube is just primarily like, of all the money we make
[02:15:51.540 --> 02:15:53.300]   from placing ads in your videos,
[02:15:53.300 --> 02:15:55.020]   you're gonna get 55% of it
[02:15:55.020 --> 02:15:56.500]   and we will get 45% of it.
[02:15:56.500 --> 02:15:58.700]   And TikTok says, "We've got a fund
[02:15:58.700 --> 02:16:00.620]   and you can have some of this fund."
[02:16:00.620 --> 02:16:03.140]   But the fund is finite, right?
[02:16:03.140 --> 02:16:04.620]   Like it has an influence.
[02:16:04.620 --> 02:16:05.460]   - It's just 200.
[02:16:05.460 --> 02:16:08.620]   - So the more people that get on TikTok and are creating,
[02:16:08.620 --> 02:16:11.940]   it's actually bad for the creator ecosystem.
[02:16:11.940 --> 02:16:14.700]   Because the more people are the one from that fund.
[02:16:14.700 --> 02:16:15.700]   - I love Hank.
[02:16:15.700 --> 02:16:17.780]   I love both brothers, both John and Hank.
[02:16:17.780 --> 02:16:22.500]   And at VidCon, I don't know, probably five years ago now,
[02:16:22.500 --> 02:16:26.780]   he started a guild for creators.
[02:16:26.780 --> 02:16:28.780]   It ended up dying because the companies
[02:16:28.780 --> 02:16:31.020]   just wouldn't negotiate with him kind of.
[02:16:31.020 --> 02:16:32.620]   And it wasn't worth keeping going.
[02:16:32.620 --> 02:16:36.780]   But he always looks out for the creators as a class.
[02:16:36.780 --> 02:16:38.820]   And God bless them for that.
[02:16:38.820 --> 02:16:39.700]   - Yeah.
[02:16:39.700 --> 02:16:43.820]   Yeah, really interesting look into how all that works
[02:16:43.820 --> 02:16:45.020]   for creators in the back end.
[02:16:45.020 --> 02:16:47.700]   So it just kind of reminded me of that.
[02:16:49.660 --> 02:16:52.780]   And what you got, would you like to go?
[02:16:52.780 --> 02:16:57.980]   - Sure. Well, first up, I want to say thank you
[02:16:57.980 --> 02:17:02.420]   to the San Diego Mobile Film Festival for having me.
[02:17:02.420 --> 02:17:05.140]   I was interviewed by them here recently
[02:17:05.140 --> 02:17:09.820]   because I am a guest judge for their film festival.
[02:17:09.820 --> 02:17:12.380]   It's gonna be held, I think it's April 29th.
[02:17:12.380 --> 02:17:15.740]   It's sometime in April, I can't remember.
[02:17:15.740 --> 02:17:18.820]   But I'm a judge for that.
[02:17:18.820 --> 02:17:20.180]   And I'm really looking forward to it
[02:17:20.180 --> 02:17:24.780]   and seeing what people create with their mobile devices.
[02:17:24.780 --> 02:17:28.500]   Not just people out there capturing funny meme stuff
[02:17:28.500 --> 02:17:31.060]   with their iPhones, but you know,
[02:17:31.060 --> 02:17:33.020]   a natural film with these things.
[02:17:33.020 --> 02:17:35.220]   So I'm looking forward to that being a judge.
[02:17:35.220 --> 02:17:41.140]   Miss Susie is a great host and had a fun time chatting with her.
[02:17:41.140 --> 02:17:45.660]   And then lastly, this is Black History Month's recognition.
[02:17:45.660 --> 02:17:47.900]   I don't do too much celebration and all of that,
[02:17:47.900 --> 02:17:50.100]   but I figured, all right, let me just at least go ahead
[02:17:50.100 --> 02:17:53.300]   and mention one of my favorite videos
[02:17:53.300 --> 02:17:55.740]   and it's titled Finally Got 'em.
[02:17:55.740 --> 02:17:56.980]   I'm not gonna get into it.
[02:17:56.980 --> 02:17:59.340]   So go over there and listen to it
[02:17:59.340 --> 02:18:01.500]   and let me know your thoughts on it.
[02:18:01.500 --> 02:18:05.460]   - Hmm, I'm intrigued.
[02:18:05.460 --> 02:18:08.060]   - Me too. I was like, what happened to Ant?
[02:18:08.060 --> 02:18:09.980]   And then it was just Ant.
[02:18:09.980 --> 02:18:12.220]   (laughing)
[02:18:12.220 --> 02:18:15.780]   - I'm easily confused, apparently.
[02:18:15.780 --> 02:18:19.860]   - Dot com slash int-proit and just search for Finally Got 'em.
[02:18:19.860 --> 02:18:23.020]   - Awesome, cool, thank you, Ant.
[02:18:23.020 --> 02:18:28.700]   As for me, you know, we didn't talk about it in the news block,
[02:18:28.700 --> 02:18:32.300]   but I should mention Wertle, yeah, the game that
[02:18:32.300 --> 02:18:33.140]   seems to love it.
[02:18:33.140 --> 02:18:34.740]   - Oh, yeah, I'd say it.
[02:18:34.740 --> 02:18:36.580]   - Except of course for Jeff.
[02:18:36.580 --> 02:18:37.420]   - Of course for Jeff.
[02:18:37.420 --> 02:18:38.260]   - Of course for Jeff.
[02:18:38.260 --> 02:18:40.060]   (laughing)
[02:18:40.060 --> 02:18:43.020]   - Bought by the New York Times, this is announced to yes,
[02:18:43.020 --> 02:18:46.620]   no, sorry, Monday that they're going to,
[02:18:46.620 --> 02:18:51.500]   they're, you know, the terms of the deal were not disclosed,
[02:18:51.500 --> 02:18:54.100]   but they noted it was in the low seven figures,
[02:18:54.100 --> 02:18:55.660]   which you just have to imagine, like, man,
[02:18:55.660 --> 02:18:58.500]   the person who made that probably could have done better
[02:18:58.500 --> 02:19:02.940]   than that if they had any, if they had the ambition
[02:19:02.940 --> 02:19:06.100]   or desire to really go the monetization route,
[02:19:06.100 --> 02:19:09.420]   which it really sounded in interviews and news that I read
[02:19:09.420 --> 02:19:12.580]   sounded like that person was really interested in that.
[02:19:12.580 --> 02:19:14.980]   - Yeah, he's a kind of guy who's like,
[02:19:14.980 --> 02:19:17.300]   oh, I'm going to just try, he built like a smart button
[02:19:17.300 --> 02:19:19.420]   for the, you know, he's done a couple, like,
[02:19:19.420 --> 02:19:21.900]   just crazy things and I think he just,
[02:19:21.900 --> 02:19:24.580]   I'm with him, man.
[02:19:24.580 --> 02:19:26.740]   I mean, who wants the monetization slog
[02:19:26.740 --> 02:19:28.460]   if you don't make something that was,
[02:19:28.460 --> 02:19:29.460]   gave people to me and me?
[02:19:29.460 --> 02:19:31.340]   - Yeah, how much is it really worth?
[02:19:31.340 --> 02:19:33.500]   - Right, it's a fad that's going to go away.
[02:19:33.500 --> 02:19:35.460]   I hope, I hope, I hope it, he did, now.
[02:19:35.460 --> 02:19:38.660]   A, and B, just because people are spamming me
[02:19:38.660 --> 02:19:42.540]   with their bloody boxes, and B, it's just JavaScript.
[02:19:42.540 --> 02:19:43.620]   Right, or something like that.
[02:19:43.620 --> 02:19:46.500]   And C, it's, it doesn't actually,
[02:19:46.500 --> 02:19:48.980]   there's not much intellectual property there.
[02:19:48.980 --> 02:19:51.140]   So what are the times really by?
[02:19:51.140 --> 02:19:53.620]   So I think he made out like a bandit.
[02:19:53.620 --> 02:19:54.780]   - Yeah, he did all right.
[02:19:54.780 --> 02:19:55.620]   - Yeah, he kind of.
[02:19:55.620 --> 02:19:59.380]   - And he can just kind of, you know, be done and walk away.
[02:19:59.380 --> 02:20:03.420]   If you are wondering what New York Times is going to do
[02:20:03.420 --> 02:20:07.260]   with this, they say not at this time when asked,
[02:20:07.260 --> 02:20:08.580]   are you going to include ads?
[02:20:08.580 --> 02:20:11.060]   So, you know, that might happen.
[02:20:11.060 --> 02:20:13.900]   They say at this time, no changes will be made
[02:20:13.900 --> 02:20:15.180]   to its game play.
[02:20:15.180 --> 02:20:17.380]   So who the heck knows what's going to happen here?
[02:20:17.380 --> 02:20:19.860]   But, if you like it the way it is,
[02:20:19.860 --> 02:20:22.500]   and you don't want to have to go to the New York Times,
[02:20:22.500 --> 02:20:23.500]   hey, guess what?
[02:20:23.500 --> 02:20:26.300]   All you have to do is right click and save,
[02:20:26.300 --> 02:20:30.100]   and you can save this game to your computer hard drive,
[02:20:30.100 --> 02:20:31.260]   and run it the same.
[02:20:31.260 --> 02:20:34.420]   In fact, all of the words that are used in the game
[02:20:34.420 --> 02:20:37.580]   are embedded into the game itself.
[02:20:37.580 --> 02:20:39.140]   It's not pulling those words forever.
[02:20:39.140 --> 02:20:40.700]   - Yeah, like a cloud database.
[02:20:40.700 --> 02:20:41.780]   - Yeah.
[02:20:41.780 --> 02:20:44.140]   - Yeah, I mean, it's a standalone game.
[02:20:44.140 --> 02:20:45.580]   You could literally just right click
[02:20:45.580 --> 02:20:47.020]   and save the whole game and have it,
[02:20:47.020 --> 02:20:49.020]   and no matter what New York Times does with it.
[02:20:49.020 --> 02:20:51.380]   - I think the New York Times is going to do
[02:20:51.380 --> 02:20:53.380]   like a gameplay subscription.
[02:20:53.380 --> 02:20:56.180]   Like they have the cooking, they have the wire cutter.
[02:20:56.180 --> 02:20:58.740]   I know they already have like a cross word subscription,
[02:20:58.740 --> 02:21:00.700]   but I think they're just going to put a bunch of these
[02:21:00.700 --> 02:21:04.740]   for like, you know, so you can like get Sedoku
[02:21:04.740 --> 02:21:08.060]   and a cross word puzzle and a word find and word old.
[02:21:08.060 --> 02:21:10.420]   - Right, and they're counting in their subscription
[02:21:10.420 --> 02:21:11.260]   as a subscription.
[02:21:11.260 --> 02:21:14.940]   Right, so a game subscription and a food distribution
[02:21:14.940 --> 02:21:16.580]   and a new subscription are the same to them.
[02:21:16.580 --> 02:21:18.500]   So now they bought the athletic.
[02:21:18.500 --> 02:21:21.020]   They've reached their 20, 25 goal
[02:21:21.020 --> 02:21:23.740]   of 10 million subscribers, which is still pretty amazing.
[02:21:23.740 --> 02:21:24.580]   Pretty good.
[02:21:24.580 --> 02:21:25.900]   - Yeah.
[02:21:25.900 --> 02:21:27.260]   - Yeah.
[02:21:27.260 --> 02:21:30.220]   - I am a twofold NYT subscriber,
[02:21:30.220 --> 02:21:34.220]   but I really resent having to pay for a third subscription.
[02:21:34.220 --> 02:21:37.340]   Like, wire cutter, not yet.
[02:21:37.340 --> 02:21:40.100]   - They should be viewers that you pay for food.
[02:21:40.100 --> 02:21:42.780]   - I do and that's super valuable.
[02:21:42.780 --> 02:21:47.340]   - I get kind of that I peeved that I buy the paper
[02:21:47.340 --> 02:21:49.580]   and the recipes come out in the paper,
[02:21:49.580 --> 02:21:52.380]   but then I can get the archive of all the rest
[02:21:52.380 --> 02:21:54.500]   of New York Times, but not the recipes.
[02:21:54.500 --> 02:21:57.140]   - No, I'm with you.
[02:21:57.140 --> 02:22:01.180]   I feel that there are definitely that's a legit
[02:22:01.180 --> 02:22:04.940]   moment of pee-viness, pee-vitness, pee-vitness.
[02:22:04.940 --> 02:22:06.020]   - Pee-viddness.
[02:22:06.020 --> 02:22:07.020]   - Pee-viddness.
[02:22:07.020 --> 02:22:11.820]   - Your pee-vish, I just don't know.
[02:22:11.820 --> 02:22:13.900]   No, I feel for you, but I do like--
[02:22:13.900 --> 02:22:15.580]   - Pee-vicious, I'm just interested in the sit-to-visges,
[02:22:15.580 --> 02:22:17.380]   that was the other word earlier today.
[02:22:17.380 --> 02:22:18.220]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:22:18.220 --> 02:22:20.020]   I just struggled with language.
[02:22:20.020 --> 02:22:20.860]   - I think we made up words today.
[02:22:20.860 --> 02:22:22.780]   - It's very nifty, I would say.
[02:22:22.780 --> 02:22:23.620]   Wouldn't you say that?
[02:22:23.620 --> 02:22:24.900]   - It's niggas, no.
[02:22:24.900 --> 02:22:25.740]   - No.
[02:22:25.740 --> 02:22:26.580]   - No.
[02:22:26.580 --> 02:22:28.580]   (laughing)
[02:22:28.580 --> 02:22:30.340]   - Don't do that.
[02:22:30.340 --> 02:22:32.420]   I already got struck down doing that once.
[02:22:32.420 --> 02:22:33.700]   I will never do that again.
[02:22:33.700 --> 02:22:35.860]   (laughing)
[02:22:35.860 --> 02:22:36.820]   - All right, y'all.
[02:22:36.820 --> 02:22:37.900]   This is a lot of fun.
[02:22:37.900 --> 02:22:40.060]   We've reached the end of this episode of This Week in Google.
[02:22:40.060 --> 02:22:43.380]   Thanks so much for allowing me to crash the party.
[02:22:43.380 --> 02:22:45.340]   Again, I really do appreciate it.
[02:22:45.340 --> 02:22:49.540]   Let's see here, Jeff, BuzzMachine.com,
[02:22:49.540 --> 02:22:50.900]   anything you want people to leave people with?
[02:22:50.900 --> 02:22:53.420]   - That's good for now, yeah, that's fine.
[02:22:53.420 --> 02:22:57.740]   - Well, actually, no, no, we have extended.
[02:22:57.740 --> 02:23:00.100]   We found that recruiting students works better
[02:23:00.100 --> 02:23:02.180]   actually closer in the spring.
[02:23:02.180 --> 02:23:06.180]   So the thing I'm proudest of in my entire career
[02:23:06.180 --> 02:23:07.780]   is starting our engagement,
[02:23:07.780 --> 02:23:09.980]   formerly known as social journalism program.
[02:23:09.980 --> 02:23:12.980]   It's the place for people who are really innovative
[02:23:12.980 --> 02:23:15.140]   and really doing amazing things.
[02:23:15.140 --> 02:23:17.460]   Our students get amazing jobs.
[02:23:17.460 --> 02:23:19.820]   If you're all interested in journalism
[02:23:19.820 --> 02:23:21.380]   and changing our field,
[02:23:21.380 --> 02:23:23.020]   or you know someone who is,
[02:23:23.020 --> 02:23:27.500]   look up journalism, look up the, of course, the crag, crag,
[02:23:27.500 --> 02:23:29.420]   crag, crag, Newmark, you know the name,
[02:23:29.420 --> 02:23:30.820]   "School of Journalism."
[02:23:30.820 --> 02:23:33.260]   (all singing)
[02:23:33.260 --> 02:23:34.260]   You asked for it.
[02:23:34.260 --> 02:23:35.260]   (all laughing)
[02:23:35.260 --> 02:23:40.260]   ♪ Crag, crag, crag, crag, crag, newmark ♪
[02:23:40.260 --> 02:23:46.140]   School of Journalism and to see it there.
[02:23:46.140 --> 02:23:47.060]   So I will point that.
[02:23:47.060 --> 02:23:48.340]   Thank you.
[02:23:48.340 --> 02:23:49.180]   Yeah, absolutely.
[02:23:49.180 --> 02:23:50.020]   - What did you just plug?
[02:23:50.020 --> 02:23:51.460]   - Well done, John.
[02:23:51.460 --> 02:23:53.500]   I'm applying to come and be in my classroom,
[02:23:53.500 --> 02:23:54.980]   which would be a wonderful thing.
[02:23:54.980 --> 02:23:57.540]   - Apply to join the program?
[02:23:57.540 --> 02:23:58.780]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[02:23:58.780 --> 02:24:00.540]   Oh, okay, sorry.
[02:24:00.540 --> 02:24:02.020]   (all laughing)
[02:24:02.020 --> 02:24:03.500]   What are you?
[02:24:03.500 --> 02:24:05.060]   Jeff, we're just not on the right wavelength.
[02:24:05.060 --> 02:24:05.900]   I'm so sorry.
[02:24:05.900 --> 02:24:06.980]   - No, you're not today.
[02:24:06.980 --> 02:24:08.180]   No, no, I would--
[02:24:08.180 --> 02:24:09.620]   - I'm just all wrong.
[02:24:09.620 --> 02:24:10.460]   All wrong.
[02:24:10.460 --> 02:24:11.540]   - I thought you were writing down the information
[02:24:11.540 --> 02:24:13.140]   so you could apply to be part of the--
[02:24:13.140 --> 02:24:14.460]   - I thought that actually I was like,
[02:24:14.460 --> 02:24:16.540]   do I want to go to another J-School thing?
[02:24:16.540 --> 02:24:17.780]   No, I don't.
[02:24:17.780 --> 02:24:18.620]   Sorry, but I,
[02:24:18.620 --> 02:24:22.780]   if I did want to go, it would be your program, Jeff.
[02:24:22.780 --> 02:24:24.100]   - Oh, thank you, Steve.
[02:24:24.100 --> 02:24:25.700]   - There we go. - Thank you.
[02:24:25.700 --> 02:24:28.460]   - Instead, I probably, if I went to school today,
[02:24:28.460 --> 02:24:30.340]   I would do comp-sigh, sorry.
[02:24:30.340 --> 02:24:31.180]   - Software.
[02:24:31.180 --> 02:24:32.020]   Yeah, I know.
[02:24:32.020 --> 02:24:33.740]   (laughs)
[02:24:33.740 --> 02:24:35.340]   Still good, just saying.
[02:24:35.340 --> 02:24:38.140]   Stacy, thank you so much.
[02:24:38.140 --> 02:24:41.540]   Stacy Higmotham, Stacy on IOT.com.
[02:24:41.540 --> 02:24:44.180]   You want to tease anything that you have coming up
[02:24:44.180 --> 02:24:45.860]   or have anything to share?
[02:24:45.860 --> 02:24:48.980]   - No, I mean-- - No.
[02:24:48.980 --> 02:24:50.220]   - Go newsletter. - Okay.
[02:24:50.220 --> 02:24:51.060]   - Feel free to sign up.

[02:24:56.020 --> 02:24:57.140]   Yay. - There we go.
[02:24:57.140 --> 02:24:57.980]   Right on.
[02:24:57.980 --> 02:24:59.180]   - Yay, thank you, Stacy.
[02:24:59.180 --> 02:25:01.140]   Oh, it was a lot of fun getting to do this with you.
[02:25:01.140 --> 02:25:04.340]   And then finally, and, and Pruitt,
[02:25:04.340 --> 02:25:08.020]   hands-off photography, club twit extraordinaire,
[02:25:08.020 --> 02:25:09.580]   anything you got coming up?
[02:25:09.580 --> 02:25:11.420]   Do you want to let people know?
[02:25:11.420 --> 02:25:14.780]   - Just to show this week, hands-off photography,
[02:25:14.780 --> 02:25:17.620]   I'm going to get into some listener feedback
[02:25:17.620 --> 02:25:19.740]   because I asked for it and,
[02:25:19.740 --> 02:25:20.900]   "Ford you all send it."
[02:25:20.900 --> 02:25:23.220]   So we're going to dive in some of your feedback
[02:25:23.220 --> 02:25:24.740]   on this week's episode.
[02:25:24.740 --> 02:25:29.260]   And, yeah, if you follow me on Twitter,
[02:25:29.260 --> 02:25:31.540]   follow me on Instagram too, please and thank you.
[02:25:31.540 --> 02:25:34.060]   I'm trying to balance out my follower counts
[02:25:34.060 --> 02:25:37.940]   'cause one is like way up higher than the other one.
[02:25:37.940 --> 02:25:40.340]   So give me a follow on Instagram,
[02:25:40.340 --> 02:25:42.860]   and underscore Pruitt.
[02:25:42.860 --> 02:25:44.460]   - Nice. - Please and thank you.
[02:25:44.460 --> 02:25:46.220]   - Yeah, thank you, Adam.
[02:25:46.220 --> 02:25:48.340]   Always a pleasure. - Thank you.
[02:25:48.340 --> 02:25:50.980]   Real quick before we wrap this up,
[02:25:50.980 --> 02:25:52.700]   we have the Twit Audience Survey
[02:25:52.700 --> 02:25:54.740]   that actually just went live earlier this week.
[02:25:54.740 --> 02:25:58.380]   So go to twit.tv/survey22.
[02:25:58.380 --> 02:26:00.580]   This is just basically a way we do this every year, right?
[02:26:00.580 --> 02:26:03.580]   This is a way for you to share with us
[02:26:03.580 --> 02:26:06.700]   as much as you feel comfortable who you are,
[02:26:06.700 --> 02:26:09.180]   what you're looking for out of our content,
[02:26:09.180 --> 02:26:10.260]   things we can do better.
[02:26:10.260 --> 02:26:12.900]   It's just, you know, it helps us to formulate
[02:26:12.900 --> 02:26:14.580]   what we do here at Twit,
[02:26:14.580 --> 02:26:16.580]   and to keep, you know,
[02:26:16.580 --> 02:26:18.980]   making sure that we're giving you what you're looking for.
[02:26:18.980 --> 02:26:21.660]   So, twit.tv/survey22,
[02:26:21.660 --> 02:26:23.260]   it only takes a couple of minutes,
[02:26:23.260 --> 02:26:26.220]   and we really appreciate it if you take that couple of minutes
[02:26:26.220 --> 02:26:28.900]   and send us some of that, those details.
[02:26:28.900 --> 02:26:29.740]   Thank you.
[02:26:29.740 --> 02:26:30.580]   (laughing)
[02:26:30.580 --> 02:26:32.180]   Oh, yes.
[02:26:32.180 --> 02:26:35.300]   - I'm about to age out of one of your categories.
[02:26:35.300 --> 02:26:36.780]   Oh no! - Oh no!
[02:26:36.780 --> 02:26:37.620]   Oh no!
[02:26:37.620 --> 02:26:39.260]   (laughing)
[02:26:39.260 --> 02:26:41.620]   - Ants Stacy. - Did they come in?
[02:26:41.620 --> 02:26:42.980]   I'm sorry.
[02:26:42.980 --> 02:26:45.380]   - Yes, and I know there is a part.
[02:26:45.380 --> 02:26:48.020]   There's a part of the survey where Linux is not present,
[02:26:48.020 --> 02:26:50.420]   so it's not a perfect survey.
[02:26:50.420 --> 02:26:52.860]   You might age out, and Linux is not present
[02:26:52.860 --> 02:26:53.860]   on one of the questions, so.
[02:26:53.860 --> 02:26:56.980]   - I didn't expect my moment of reckoning to happen,
[02:26:56.980 --> 02:26:58.380]   at this time.
[02:26:58.380 --> 02:27:00.900]   - I had to say that moment during the show.
[02:27:00.900 --> 02:27:01.700]   - During the show, live.
[02:27:01.700 --> 02:27:03.460]   - During the show, all right.
[02:27:03.460 --> 02:27:05.020]   (laughing)
[02:27:05.020 --> 02:27:07.900]   - It's okay, it's okay. - Yeah, it's okay.
[02:27:07.900 --> 02:27:10.180]   Well, we're all there at some point,
[02:27:10.180 --> 02:27:11.940]   like it happens for all of us.

[02:27:40.340 --> 02:27:45.500]   and watch us in real time, twitter.tv/live.
[02:27:45.500 --> 02:27:46.660]   It's a lot of fun.
[02:27:46.660 --> 02:27:50.260]   And then also finally, I just want to mention Club Twit,
[02:27:50.260 --> 02:27:51.980]   mentioned it briefly a little bit before,
[02:27:51.980 --> 02:27:54.940]   but this is our ad-free subscription tier,
[02:27:54.940 --> 02:27:58.660]   twit.tv/clubtwit, seven bucks a month,
[02:27:58.660 --> 02:28:01.060]   you get no ads in your shows,
[02:28:01.060 --> 02:28:04.380]   you get access to the Discord,
[02:28:04.380 --> 02:28:06.660]   you get so much awesomeness,
[02:28:06.660 --> 02:28:11.100]   all wrapped up in there, twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:28:11.100 --> 02:28:12.700]   You also get the Twit Plus podcast feed,
[02:28:12.700 --> 02:28:14.420]   that's the one that I was forgetting,
[02:28:14.420 --> 02:28:19.420]   where you get extra moments that didn't make the shows,
[02:28:19.420 --> 02:28:22.700]   a lot of times some pre-show discussions are a lot of fun,
[02:28:22.700 --> 02:28:24.380]   so we throw that in the Twit Plus feed,
[02:28:24.380 --> 02:28:27.180]   and it's been doing some amazing interviews
[02:28:27.180 --> 02:28:30.620]   and producing some cool extra bonus content.
[02:28:30.620 --> 02:28:35.340]   Sometimes we are introducing shows that aren't,
[02:28:35.340 --> 02:28:38.180]   for everyone, it starts off just for Club Twit members,
[02:28:38.180 --> 02:28:40.580]   and then as it grows in popularity,
[02:28:40.580 --> 02:28:42.860]   then we, who knows, we might open it up for everyone.
[02:28:42.860 --> 02:28:47.860]   So all that can be yours, twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:28:47.860 --> 02:28:49.260]   But I think we've reached the end,
[02:28:49.260 --> 02:28:50.660]   I have not much more to say,
[02:28:50.660 --> 02:28:53.140]   I'm Jason Howell, find me on Twitter @JasonHowell,
[02:28:53.140 --> 02:28:54.740]   and on Tech News Weekly tomorrow
[02:28:54.740 --> 02:28:58.140]   with my cusargent twit.tv/tnw.
[02:28:58.140 --> 02:29:02.180]   But thank you so much for welcoming me into your ears.
[02:29:02.180 --> 02:29:05.940]   For the week, Leo will be back next week, well rested,
[02:29:05.940 --> 02:29:08.340]   and it will no longer be a democracy.
[02:29:08.340 --> 02:29:10.580]   We'll see you next time on this week.
[02:29:10.580 --> 02:29:11.420]   Bye everybody.
[02:29:12.260 --> 02:29:13.220]   (laughing)
[02:29:13.220 --> 02:29:14.820]   - Well done sir, very well.
[02:29:14.820 --> 02:29:16.300]   - The democracy is dead.
[02:29:16.300 --> 02:29:18.700]   - Don't miss all about Android every week.
[02:29:18.700 --> 02:29:21.660]   We talk about the latest news, hardware, apps,
[02:29:21.660 --> 02:29:24.500]   and now all the developer-y goodness happening
[02:29:24.500 --> 02:29:26.180]   in the Android ecosystem.
[02:29:26.180 --> 02:29:28.580]   I'm Jason Howell, also joined by Ron Richards,

[02:29:34.620 --> 02:29:35.580]   Really great stuff.
[02:29:35.580 --> 02:29:38.620]   We also invite people from all over the Android ecosystem
[02:29:38.620 --> 02:29:40.820]   to talk about this mobile platform we love,
[02:29:40.820 --> 02:29:41.940]   so much.
[02:29:41.940 --> 02:29:45.580]   Join us every Tuesday, all about Android, on twit.tv.

[02:29:50.740 --> 02:29:53.320]   (upbeat music)
