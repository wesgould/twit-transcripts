[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Yes, I'm all alone with my cozy fireplace and my bottle of mezcal
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   because it's time for our annual This Week in Google best of.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Of all the best ofs we've been doing, and of course all the shows this week
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   and the year are doing best of episodes.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   This one is I think the most fun.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   We have a lot of fun on This Week in Google and I think we've got some great stuff for you.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   One of the things that sticks in my mind most, and I know it drives me up crazy,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   is we had a lot of fun with TikTok.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Remember those sea shannies that were all their age? Listen.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Leo did you trust me? Did I not take you to the blob opera?
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   You did and I love the blob opera.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   You got another one?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   I got a trust beat for another show opening.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Okay.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   You got to play a few verses of it.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Okay.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   TikTok.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Are you sure he's tick tock one?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   See, there aren't sea shannies like.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I guess I really need to get into the car.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Like sailor.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   What do you do with the truck over?
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Lady.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   What do you do with the truck?
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Right.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   You go to one 15.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Okay.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Sea shanty.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I might even sing along.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Apparently, is this a trend on TikTok now?
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Yes, it is.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Yes, it is.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Sea shanty talk.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Have you checked your volume yet?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I got to make it come out of the right hole.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Hold on.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   It's coming out of the wrong hole.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   What happens when you're ready to come and come?
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   But I go back to the beginning.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Go back to the beginning.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Oh.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   You're messing it up.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   See the name of the ship was a bully of tea.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   The wind blew up her bow.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Turn a blow, my bully boys blow.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Soon may the women come to bring us sugar and tea and rum.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   One day when the tongue is done.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   That's actually awesome.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Then go.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Is it?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Let it go.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   She's from shore and down on her.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I write well for a captain called all hands on swarit.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Take that wheel and go.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Soon may the women come to bring us sugar.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And tea and rum.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   What do you find?
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   What do you find?
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   The tongue is done.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   We'll take off.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Alright, Jeff, you're ruining it.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Where do you find?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Where do you find lyrics to this stuff?
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I mean, how do these people know?
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   It's the Wellerman song and I just searched Google.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   We could all do it.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   We could do a quintet here.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Alright, here's another one.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Yeah, that's the problem is we're on Skype there on TikTok.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Here, let's go.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   So walk to the Wales tail game up.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Is this the same song?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Pooned and fought and was she died down below.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   We may the Wellerman come to bring us sugar and tea.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   He's actually kind of lit.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Soon may the Wellerman come to bring us sugar and tea and rum.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   You know what?
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   This is actually what makes TikTok pretty amazing.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Isn't it?
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Because that's the collaborative part where you can do it.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   People have on and do edit and do edit and do edit.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Right?
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   It's pretty cool.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Wow.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   If you go down, you also go to I think the original one.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Hold on here.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   So I'm on the wrong page.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   I've got some from CNET.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Let's see.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   C-Shannings are taking you from Wellerman to drunken sailor.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   C-Shannings are attracting the attention of landlubber TikToks.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   It went wild.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   I don't know what happened said a guy at the center of it all.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Here's the original.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   So he starts it solo.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   And then other people on TikTok pick it up.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   One guy comes back.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   So one guy comes back with a really deep voice.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   The bass.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   He's great.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   And then another one does it and another one does it and it becomes a chorus.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Oh, and this is...
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   That's the thing that's cool about TikTok.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   TikTok is people can take somebody's track.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Here's one with strings.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   They've added strings to this.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Strings?
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Yes.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Yes.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   I like the horn.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   You bring the sugar and tea and the rum.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Why you make it a tremendous amount of tea?
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   All right.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   That's pretty awesome.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   See the best part is the coffee.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Now it's in the public domain.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   So you don't have to worry.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   That's probably why I see Shannys.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Now here's the club ready remix.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Where's the drop?
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Here comes the drop.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   I'm sick of the song already.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   But still it's going to stay in your head for the next 24 hours.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   If you enjoy that kind of music, I encourage you to listen to Stan Rogers doing the song.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   I'm going to be doing the first one.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   I'm going to be doing the first one.

[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   I'm going to be doing the first one.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   You know these, you've all know a Harari books like Sapiens
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   that humans are the only animal on the planet
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   that believe in fictions.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   We all believe in a lot of fictions as it turns out.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   You can't see a meter.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   You can't weigh it, but we all agree on how big a meter is
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   so then we can use some debate stuff to say the thing with money
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   and now the same thing with digital art.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   You can see so many people are buying it
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   that there's enough people that believe in it just to keep it going.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   Same thing I was Bitcoin.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   People didn't know.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   We got to get more and more people to believe in this story.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   But now so many people believe in that story.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   The story grows.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   You could put code into the image too, right?
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   Like sort of stegenography or you could insert something
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   into the actual image itself.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   But that would be copy.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   Yeah, you can add to you.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   If I copy bit for bit the thing I bought
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   that's going to be copied with the bit for bit.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   Yeah, well, yeah.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Technically you can go screenshot my photos any time
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   and make them your screen saver or whatever background.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   But there's only one that exists in the Ethereum blockchain
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   and it's authenticated.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   That's the real one.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Okay, I get it.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   Right.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Yeah, that's the real one.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Trey tells me that I think he sold one NFT of his for half a million
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   dollars.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   They're doing quite well for talented artists like Trey Radcliffe.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   God, he could come on and explain it all.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   We're going to take a break.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   When we come back, lots more of the best of this week in Google.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   We're going to talk more about TikTok.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   Yes, we got some Linux and well, a lot more.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   But first, let me talk to you about the company that has a name
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   that just doesn't match my experience.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   It's imperfect foods.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   And, you know, we started doing imperfect foods, Lisa and I,
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   because we realized that we wanted to help the world.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   We wanted to help the environment.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   Did you know this is a stat that just is terrible?
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   35% of the food supply in the United States goes unsold or uneaten
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   every week.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   More than a third down the drain.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   That's not right.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   That's crazy.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   And it's all because grocery stores want everything to look just
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   right.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   They don't want anything that's going to bruise.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   You know, they'll put aside a third of all the produce just because
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   it doesn't feel right.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   They think it won't sell.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Well, you know what?
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   It will sell because it's great.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   It's delicious.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   It's not imperfect.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   It's just different.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   Like you and me.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   Imperfect foods is sourcing quirky yet delicious foods,
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   delivering them to you in a way that reduces emissions,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   reduces packaging waste, saves you time, saves you money.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   I mean, it is perfect.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   It's perfect.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   But they still call it imperfect.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   I'm not going to change that.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   Wouldn't it be great if getting your favorite groceries put time
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   back into your week instead of taking it away?
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   Especially now, it's getting a little colder, a little scarier to
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   drive.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   Why not stay home?
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   Cozy.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Let imperfect foods deliver you.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   They call it, and I love this, intentionally sourced groceries
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   with just a few clicks.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   Imperfect foods, I-M-P-E-R-F-E-C-T foods, is a perfect
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   grocery delivery service.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   They offer an entire line of sustainable groceries.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   They taste delicious.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   They reduce waste.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   The only catch they may not deliver in your area.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   Please go to imperfectfoods.com.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   I'll see if you can get them.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   Imperfectfoods.com.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   See if you can get them.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   If you can, how will you?
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   Once you sign up, you personalize your weekly grocery order.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   By the way, it's not just produce.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   There's pantry stables.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   We've got blue corn chips on our last basket.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   Oh, Lisa got some blueberries.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   She knows I love blueberries.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   They're really great.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   They're not imperfect, but they call them imperfect.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   Okay.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   Yummy snacks.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   Plus your order comes on the same day every week.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   Ours is Thursday.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   Your day will vary because you know what they do that's really cool?
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   To save emissions, they deliver weekly by neighborhood.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   You're all bundled together in a day with everybody else in your neighborhood.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   That produces 25 to 75 percent fewer emissions than all those people going to the grocery store.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   Right?
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   It actually reduces emissions compared to people driving to the grocery store.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   Plus who wants to drive the grocery store?
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   The problem is I think people when they hear the name they go, "Oh yeah, they're going to
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   be bruised.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   They're going to be funky looking."
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   They're not.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   I was kind of stunned when we opened the first box.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   I went, "Wow, that broccoli is the best looking."
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   It literally was fresher than any broccoli I've ever had before.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   It was incredible.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   I couldn't be happier with imperfect foods.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Sure, when you go to the grocery store, you can get a pomegranate at the size of your
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   head.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   Yeah, but some of the imperfect foods pomegranates are smaller.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   They're like baseball size instead of grapefruit size.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   They taste better that way.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   That's perfect.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   I don't have a problem.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   Okay, but they call them imperfect.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   I'm going to let them call them imperfect.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   You can get everything.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   It saves you a trip to the grocery store basically.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   By the way, I know sometimes when you get these deliveries you go, "What about the packaging?"
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Say goodbye to packaging guilt.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.240]   Imperfect foods is the only national grocery delivery company that makes it easy to return
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:25.680]   your packaging after every order.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.240]   We used to order from the local grocery store.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.160]   Everything would come in a plastic bag.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.160]   Everything.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.280]   It's like 40 plastic bags.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.000]   That didn't make me feel good at all.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   Imperfect foods doesn't put in plastic bags.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   No, they put, it's a nice box which you can again return after every order.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.320]   It's just nice.
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.040]   It's great.
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:50.320]   Right now, imperfect foods is offering our listeners 20% off your first four orders.

[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.240]   They do a great job.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:22.200]   One of the questions I like to answer completely nobody ever asks, but I like to answer is
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:24.120]   Linux really better.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.360]   Let's go to the terminal to find out.
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.360]   Keep scrolling.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.480]   Oh, here we go.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.520]   This is for you, Ant Pruitt.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:38.120]   Oh, I got to fix this.
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.280]   I apologize.
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:41.000]   I'm having the Linux problem.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   Linux.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   Oh, my audio.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   I can fix it.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.120]   I'll be fine if I take a moment.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.120]   I got to go to terminal.
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.520]   I'm sure Ant will forgive that.
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:50.520]   Yes.
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.520]   He's got to go to terminal.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.520]   What was that?
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.520]   Linux at noon?
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.520]   What was that?
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:55.520]   I got to terminal.
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.000]   I don't wait it.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   To be fair.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.800]   He knows what he's doing, Ant.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:02.280]   And that's how Linux at lunch.
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.280]   At lunch.
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:08.200]   I decided for no good reason to blow out my Linux install.
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:13.720]   And in about half an hour installed and completely new Linux on here.
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:18.840]   And I was concerned because one of the things we've done before is set the default rate
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:23.000]   and pulse audio to 48,048.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   48K.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   48K.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.760]   And I was a little concerned, but then I played a YouTube video for John and it was
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:30.760]   fine.
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.560]   So, I don't know.
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.840]   We're just going to have to go with the TikTok musical every time for the testing.
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.880]   Apparently, TikTok's what it says.
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:38.880]   It's a TikTok.
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:39.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.960]   Now I have to remember where it is.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:47.600]   I think it's in /bin.
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.240]   It's close.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:51.360]   Here it is.
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:58.240]   It's in /etc/etc/bin/ there we go.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:03.320]   And then inside the /etc/pulse I need.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.320]   What was this?
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:06.320]   No, this is easy.
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.320]   All I do is right click.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.320]   All I do is right click.
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:14.760]   And then nano/demon-conf.conf.
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:20.240]   Oh, I have to pseudo.
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.240]   Wait a minute.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.240]   You haven't had the right hand in.
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:26.000]   No, I don't have to pseudo that.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   pseudo first.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   Okay.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   Control A. pseudo.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   Okay.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.480]   And then here's my password.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.560]   That's being patient.
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:39.960]   That was very easy.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.240]   We're going to go down here in the demon.
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:46.560]   We're going to go down here and find the default bit right here.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:49.200]   You see the alternate sample rate.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:53.120]   The default sample rate is 44.1, but I don't want that.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:56.960]   I want the default sample rate to be 48.
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:57.960]   48k.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:58.960]   Okay.
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:39:59.960]   You remember, right?
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.800]   See, you know this.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:02.800]   You know this.
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.640]   You know it's easy.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:17.000]   And the thing is, if you expect the operating system to do all of that, you never really
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.920]   understand how computers work.
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.360]   I'm just saying save that.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:24.360]   Okay.
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:27.920]   Now I have to restart pulse.
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.120]   M
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.440]   pseudo pulse.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.640]   Can't remember how to do that.
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.640]   Stop.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.240]   Let's see if that works.
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.280]   Now, pulse audio.
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.280]   What is it?
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.280]   Is it pulse audio?
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.280]   I don't know.
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.280]   Oh yeah.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.440]   I should have written a said alias to fix that.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.440]   That's exactly right.
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:47.640]   I don't remember the name of the demon shoot.
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.840]   Oh, well, never mind.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:53.640]   Can we all get a look at Mr. Jarvis's face during this right now?
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:58.600]   You can't do this on a Chromebook.
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:40:59.600]   You're not selling it.
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:00.600]   I got to tell you.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:03.600]   I wanted to use signal on my.
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.720]   Chromebook and to do that, I have to have a Linux.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:06.720]   And of course, what happens?
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:11.160]   I go in and I can't do it from my.
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.520]   What are they called this week workplace account?
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:16.360]   Oh, that stupid workplace account.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.360]   Yep.
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:25.040]   Um, how do I restart the server is what I need to do?
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.040]   Let's see.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:30.960]   I've got the demon con.
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:56.040]   See, I can count on, I can count on Keith 512 pseudo pulse audio.
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.000]   That's what it was.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   Audio.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.760]   Dash dash kill.
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.760]   And then no demon process.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:04.760]   That's okay.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:05.760]   I'm going to start it.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:06.760]   So good.
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:07.760]   So you're starting it.
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:09.760]   You had to put your time.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.760]   Oh, I shouldn't have run it as root.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:11.760]   That's my problem.
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:12.760]   There you go right there.
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:13.760]   Oh boy.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:14.760]   Okay.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:15.760]   Let's do a kill again.
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.680]   Oh, I have to do probably pseudo kill.
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:22.440]   Now it'll say, oh, I know that one.
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.680]   Now I have to not pseudo pulse audio.
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.720]   This is the best week ever.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:37.840]   And now let's go back to Bridgerton already progress for helping you out there.
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:38.840]   Holy cow.
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.360]   Of course I closed that tab.
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.360]   Wait a minute.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.360]   Let's go back.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:43.360]   Here we go.
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.360]   Here we go.
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.360]   One more time.
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:47.360]   Let's see if it fixed it.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:50.160]   No, it didn't fix it.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:52.160]   No, it didn't fix it.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:56.720]   No, I probably should.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:57.880]   I probably should reboot.
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.880]   I just might have to reboot.
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:02.200]   Shut up.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:08.800]   So, Jeff, actually I might as well start with this.
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:13.400]   Send along this tweet about TikTok and how easy it is.
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:17.760]   We were talking over the weekend about why the young's love TikTok.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:22.720]   And what I didn't know is that a lot of what people do in TikTok is all done in camera.
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:27.280]   But my son who does a great TikTok channel, he does cooking on TikTok.
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:28.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.680]   In fact, I'll show you the link.
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:34.120]   It's sodium underscore deficiency.
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:35.480]   I have no idea.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.480]   Interesting.
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.320]   What the youth these days.
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:42.800]   And it's hard to find him because he doesn't have his picture on it.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.480]   Yeah, look, it's so hard to find.
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:45.880]   I got a 404 women.
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:48.240]   Let me type it right.
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:52.120]   He has a picture of somebody else.
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:54.280]   He has a picture.
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:57.240]   So he does all these food things on TikTok.
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:00.480]   And I'm like, why don't you ever cook these for me?
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:02.560]   I'm like, oh my God.
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.160]   This isn't me.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:06.160]   I had no idea.
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:07.160]   He learned everything he learned.
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:09.000]   He learned on YouTube so that there he is.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   So then I asked him.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   Go ahead, Hank.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   Go ahead, Hank.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   You go, Hank.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.480]   So then I asked him.
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:15.480]   So how do you edit?
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:18.520]   He says, well, I edited in Premiere because he's like learned how to edit right in the
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:19.520]   old days.
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:20.520]   But look at this.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.840]   This is a Tiktoker.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.080]   I don't know what I don't know what her name is.
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:28.800]   So even there, Eden Harves, H-A-R-V-Z.
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:32.840]   But she's going to show us how they edit in camera.
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:34.480]   You can do all this stuff in TikTok.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.480]   And if you've ever seen TikTok.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.480]   It's a new one.
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:39.960]   My trick also is to hold down the red button and let go when you want to stop filming.
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:41.720]   That is the best way to get it slick.
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:42.720]   OK, let's go.
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.960]   So we call that we call that edit in camera, right?
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:45.960]   Where you're.
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:49.680]   Yes, there are some things you can do in camera for us to transition.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.080]   But watch this.
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:52.080]   This blew me away.
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:55.680]   Now you tell me if you could do this in your camera.
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.040]   So she's playing music.
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:04.800]   And here's one thing that's really cool is TikTok pauses the music so you can--
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:09.000]   You're matching the music as you do it when you don't record.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.640]   So that makes it a lot easier to do that.
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.920]   Yes, TikTok magic.
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:17.320]   What she's doing with a hand, watch this.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.360]   So she's just moving the camera around.
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:21.960]   She's doing no face wipe and stuff like that.
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:28.000]   But somehow TikTok is-- I guess they're putting in transitions or something.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   I don't know.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   You'll see.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.160]   Watch the final version because I don't understand how you get from what she's--
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:35.160]   It's my adhesive.
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:37.640]   It sounds like TikTok magic.
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:39.720]   It sounds like something you're doing in the camera.
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:43.280]   Now watch.
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:46.720]   So she's showing it that as she made it, say how she's doing a wipe with her hand.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:49.360]   And TikTok is somehow-- Maybe that is just--
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:50.600]   That's just TikTok.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:51.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:54.640]   It's like she takes her head off.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:55.640]   That's amazing.
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:57.160]   Isn't that beautiful work?
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:59.120]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.120]   That's good.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.120]   That's just TikTok magic there.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.400]   Because you can do in-camera transitions.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:07.480]   So a lot of cinematographers do it pretty commonly.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:13.240]   But they also do that with the idea knowing that it's going to go into Premiere or Resolve.
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:17.160]   And they're able to sync those cuts up to where it looks the way it did.
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:21.760]   Right there, TikTok is just using AI and saying, hey, this is looking like a good cut
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:22.760]   point in young--
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.600]   But I think she kind of did it, though.
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:26.800]   She might have done it all in camera.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:27.800]   I don't know.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:31.040]   You did it, I think, just by hurting it off, then she's turning off at exactly the moment
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:32.040]   when her--
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:33.040]   Right.
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:34.040]   Right.
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:37.000]   She gives it the exact point that it needs to transition.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   I think the app is smart enough to know this is a cut point.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.920]   I think Instagram is trying to get along that same path with Reels.
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:48.120]   I haven't quite figured it out yet, but I have been trying recently.
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.880]   Neil, give her a plug.
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:50.880]   What's her account?
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.120]   Oh, I have to look it up again.
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:55.080]   It was E-D-E-D-E.
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:57.320]   It looked great.
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:58.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:05.960]   Well, and this is, by the way, I mean, TikTok, I have to say, a lot of it's just dumb.
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:08.440]   Women showing off their bodies and things.
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:10.440]   But there is some stuff that's really amazing.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:14.320]   E-D-E-N-H-A-R-V-Z.
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:16.760]   Eden Harves.
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:17.760]   Here's another one.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.000]   Taylor, as long as we're doing TikToks.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.520]   Taylor Lawrence tweeted this out.
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:25.160]   She says, "Queen grandma of edits."
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:26.160]   Wow.
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.160]   This is good.
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:28.320]   Watch this one.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:31.440]   This will make you realize it's not just for the kids.
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:32.440]   Yeah.
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:34.440]   That's beautiful.
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:39.320]   Now, clearly, she's using an editor to do this.
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:41.320]   This is not as beautiful.
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:45.560]   But this is where TikTok really is kind of amazing.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:46.960]   I see this in fact a lot.
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:47.960]   That's rotoscope thing.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:51.680]   Well, Pink does it on the phone.
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:52.680]   I don't know.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:54.080]   I mean, obviously, she's not handling the phone.
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:55.080]   Look at that.
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:56.080]   Queen grandma.
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:57.680]   That was impressive, wasn't it?
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:47:59.680]   That's very impressive.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.080]   You can spend the whole next hour just watching TikToks versus what people do.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.080]   No, we cannot.
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:04.080]   Okay.
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:06.720]   I don't want to admit this.
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:08.600]   I don't want to admit this.
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:13.400]   But if you scroll enough on TikTok, they actually put a slide up with the guy saying,
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:16.040]   "Okay, you've been enough time."
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.040]   Oh, really?
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:18.040]   Yes.
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:19.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:20.040]   I'll do that.
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:21.040]   I'll do that.
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:22.040]   I'm going to TikTok.
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:23.040]   Take a break.
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:24.040]   Oh, nice.
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.840]   That's really embarrassing when you get to that.
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:28.600]   Because that means you've spent a lot of time scrolling through with the news.
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:32.040]   I think with a Netflix, like, "Are you still watching this?"
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.040]   You feel there?
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:34.040]   You can possibly.
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:38.240]   Do you know that you should not be watching nine consecutive hours of television?
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:42.040]   Don't you think you need some sunshine right now, dude?
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:43.040]   So tempting.
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:44.040]   So tempting.
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.040]   I've been watching.
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:51.920]   I was never in a car racing, but I saw some TikToks of pit crews in Formula One.
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:55.680]   And these guys, in one minute, say change all the time.
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:56.680]   I'm watching this.
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:57.680]   I said, "That can't be real."
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:59.040]   So there's a really good series.
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.880]   It's in this third season now on TikTok on Formula One racing.
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:02.880]   Drive to survive.
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.400]   I can't stop now.
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.400]   I love it.
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:06.880]   That looked.
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:08.800]   I was just talking about this yesterday.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:09.800]   No.
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:18.920]   It's that docuseries, the camera work, the lighting, the editing, the sound design.
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:21.520]   It is worth watching it just for that.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.040]   Forget the stories behind it.
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:26.000]   But that whole series is like watching a trailer.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.520]   If you turn on movie trailer, it's got the same type.
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:33.000]   Oh, gosh, but that series is I love it.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.880]   Oh, I'm glad to know.
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:38.040]   Now I told Lisa we have to go to Monaco next year.
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.040]   Oh, take me.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:40.040]   I like that.
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:45.280]   There's actually a text story there, y'all.
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:46.280]   What is this sound?
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.480]   Is this me?
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:49.480]   It must be me.
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:50.480]   Yes, you sir.
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:51.480]   It's me.
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:52.480]   No, I was playing Caspy.
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:54.680]   What a favorite one.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:56.800]   There's this woman boring, you can't.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.800]   What is...
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:58.800]   What's going on?
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:01.200]   It's Jeff doing his own show now.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.200]   Have you seen...
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.600]   I guess he had stopped ticking.
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:05.880]   You know, that is addictive, you see.
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:07.880]   And it's designed for this.
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:08.880]   Ooh.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:11.320]   What are you doing, Jeff?
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:15.720]   Jeff, eyes ahead, please.
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:16.720]   Uh oh.
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:19.160]   I'm so glad you were doing this.
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:20.960]   You hear me.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:25.320]   What do you do with your kids, with your students?
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:26.320]   You must...
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:27.320]   I mean, you're doing Zoom, right?
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:28.320]   It's graduate school.
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:29.320]   I don't know.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:30.560]   It's assumed that they're paying attention.
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:34.920]   And plus Leo, I just kind of buy my presents to man their attention.
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:35.920]   Oh good.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:37.920]   Apparently I don't.
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:39.480]   There's that.
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:44.560]   There's one young woman on TikTok I've got to find her and said she looks like she's
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:46.200]   about 21.
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:51.600]   She has a voice as if it comes out of the 1940s.
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:53.080]   Is she from Israel?
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:55.160]   Nope, nope, nope.
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:56.960]   She's just unbelievable.
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:57.960]   I'm just a long-term...
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:58.960]   I'm just a long-term...
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:04.680]   I'm actually glad that the Trump administration didn't dismantle TikTok.
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:06.720]   I mean, maybe they're spying on us.
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:07.720]   I don't know.
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:08.960]   So who cares?
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:11.880]   It feels like there's such creativity going on.
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:12.880]   It's so vital.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:13.880]   I really think it's great.
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:17.280]   And I'm sure that's the same on Instagram and Snapchat and elsewhere.
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:23.280]   But it's really a very exciting place to be.
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:24.640]   This is not moral panic.
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:27.640]   This is really a scary story from The Wasidot Post.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:31.800]   She never returned her VHS copy of Sabrina, the teenage witch.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:33.800]   The DA's office.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.040]   This happened to me.
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:41.480]   20 years later, she faces a felony charge.
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:45.040]   She was trying to change the name on her Texas driver's license.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:52.120]   When they ran a background check, all they're seeing is these two words, felony embezzlement.
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:52:01.360]   So Blockbuster back in 1999 or 2000 sent a ton of people to collections for tapes that
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:05.760]   they either did or did not take out that were never returned.
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:06.920]   This happened to you?
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:13.160]   But this happened to me when I was in this habit, I did not get charged with a felony.
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:16.160]   But I did get sent to collections, which for me was a huge change.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:17.160]   Oh, that's terrible.
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:19.160]   No, that's almost worse than a new one.
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:20.160]   Because Blockbuster...
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:21.160]   Yeah, Blockbuster...
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:24.480]   No, you don't get out of.
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:26.920]   They had some sort of database error.
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:31.920]   And what happened is people who took out movies like Right After You on the Card or
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:35.280]   something got attributed to your card.
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:40.560]   So they had me taking out some video I never did.
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:43.960]   So this woman, and there's a bunch of people in the comments talking about it, but it's
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:49.240]   from the same era when Blockbuster got super aggressive and had this whole database issue.
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:50.240]   They were jerks.
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:53.000]   In fact, this woman didn't take that out.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.800]   She said, but she was living with a guy who had kids.
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:00.200]   And she thinking he went and got it and didn't take it back.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:08.960]   What's even funnier is the cast of Sabrina got into the act, including Melissa Joan Hart.
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:11.960]   Melissa Joan Hart?
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:12.960]   Yes.
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:16.720]   Who did the shruggy emoji?
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:20.200]   Okay.
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:21.200]   It's terrible.
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.560]   No, this is what this was really from.
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:24.560]   Thank you, Blockbuster.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:25.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:32.480]   I remember once flying out of the country and I remembered, "Oh hell, I didn't return a
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:34.120]   video."
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:36.280]   And I thought I was going to come back bankrupt.
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:37.760]   Because you just...
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:40.360]   Yeah, the fees just matter to people.
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:43.560]   You know, Compagnetris works both ways, buddy boy.
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:44.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:45.560]   Mm-hmm.
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:49.440]   What a ridiculous industry that was.
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:54.880]   Everybody is flying to join Google's flock, says the Verge.
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:58.280]   Firefox has already said, "We're not going to do it.
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:53:59.800]   Apple Safari won't do it.
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:04.760]   Mozilla, Vivaldi, Brave, all out."
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:06.840]   In this article by Dieter Boney says, "Edge."
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:17.200]   But I have to say, when they asked Microsoft about Edge, their response was very equivocal.
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:22.280]   In fact, to the point where I feel like Microsoft was hedging their bets and said, "Yeah, we're
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:23.280]   going to wait and see.
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:26.040]   We might well use flock."
[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:32.480]   Just as a point of information, Steve Gibson did about half an hour on flock yesterday on
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:37.320]   security now, which I encourage people to listen to it's at the end of the show.
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:43.200]   He says it's a good idea and it works as advertised that it is privacy protecting.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:46.760]   And it's very cleverly implemented to do that.
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:53.200]   I pointed out, of course, Google has to make advertising work.
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:58.160]   So Google is for itself and many, many others.
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:03.960]   So Google's got to do the best it can to reassure people on privacy, but still they have to
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:05.280]   give something to advertisers.
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:08.720]   That's what I was just talking about.
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:12.280]   What Google did point out is that there are a number of categories that they don't sell
[00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:20.520]   ads against, including things like your mental state, your previous incarceration, whether
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.840]   you're pregnant, any health conditions.
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:26.720]   They don't sell ads against those in flock will not add those features to any of its
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:28.080]   cohorts.
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:30.680]   So that might have been a little bit reassuring.
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:35.440]   Pregnancy is interesting because that's highly lucrative.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:39.560]   If you look at what they won't sell, I mean liquor, right?
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:45.480]   The stuff that Google won't do ads for is actually a list of stuff that people buy ads
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:46.720]   for.
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:52.480]   So I think this is why I feel like Google might be a little bit sincere in that they're
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:54.480]   doing need to reinvent advertising.
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:56.920]   We need to get past what it was.
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:56:02.040]   And if we're going to shoot down everything that comes up just because it came from Google.
[00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:06.320]   No, they're not shooting it down because it came from Google originally.
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:13.400]   And EFF shot it down originally because they want to stop the web being built on an ad
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:15.040]   supported model.
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:19.880]   That's their ideas that your data should not be your payment for serving the web.
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:21.360]   We should come up with something better.
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:24.520]   And it might be something like, I mean, what we're doing.
[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:25.520]   Well, okay.
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:28.360]   So we had a world where everything's behind a paywall.
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:33.600]   I wrote a tweet about this last week that my dystopia is that everything goes behind
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:38.720]   a paywall at major media and that everybody has a sub stack.
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:42.280]   And the only thing that's free is disinformation with crappy.
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:45.040]   I think that's a little crazy.
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:48.960]   I think what's going to, I mean, like I tweeted just the other day, I realized I subscribed
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:51.320]   to 11 publications, which is insane.
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:53.160]   I spend about $1,000 a year.
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:54.160]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:55.160]   Very thank you.
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:56.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:57.160]   But yeah, thank you.
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:58.160]   No, I know.
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:56:59.160]   I mean, it's my job.
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:01.440]   I mean, I do it because I run into paywalls all the time.
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:07.280]   But it is frustrating also to try to keep like the link to people to content.
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:08.760]   Yeah, I pay for more stuff.
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:13.200]   I know they won't be able to read Bloomberg any money, except that I have to use Bloomberg's
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:14.840]   materials on our shows.
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:16.640]   I give I give Bloomberg.
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:19.840]   It's 35 bucks a month and they have that gosh darn Bloomberg terminal.
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:23.880]   They make a lot of money on Reuters is going to charge that much, which is ridiculous.
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:25.880]   Sorry, Reuters.
[00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:28.080]   I like Reuters, but so go ahead.
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:32.640]   But I think what's going to happen is we're going to reach a point where people start hitting
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:36.280]   all these paywalls and they experience the pain of that.
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:40.720]   And we're going to come up with new models because they're going to be forced.
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:45.440]   Remember, I mean, we always this is what competition does.
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:50.360]   You get this like pain point and then people will come out with like aggregators that are
[00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:54.560]   like of some sort and we'll get to that point.
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:57.000]   It's constantly evolving and that's good.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.240]   That's what the web is.
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:02.560]   But that's exactly why we never want to get rid of the free tier because I don't want
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:06.240]   to put everything I don't why I didn't want to do a paywall per se.
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:09.160]   Now maybe that's crazy because this is this is patronage.
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:10.160]   This is support.
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:11.160]   This is help.
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:13.160]   Fans.
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:15.520]   But I notice people will be involved financial times, for instance, you can't read their
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:18.000]   content, unless you pay Wall Street Journal.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.320]   You can read some limited content, but not all of it.
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:26.520]   Unless you pay new, you know, pay walls are are definitely a thing.
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:31.720]   Is that because this idea of of freemium doesn't work?
[00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:35.000]   No, because it's a winner to call market.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.800]   One of my numbers below, which I will now sacrifice for the good of the show.
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:39.800]   Thank you, sir.
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:46.600]   Is a view of all of the news sites that have over a hundred thousand subscribers.
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:51.720]   There's 28 of them adding up to 23 million worldwide the English speaking world.
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:54.200]   That's a fraction though of the total.
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:55.200]   It's nothing.
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:59:02.880]   And the US 63% of all subs go to three column three publications.
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:03.880]   You know what they are.
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:04.880]   New York Times Wall Street Journal.
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:05.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:07.880]   Nice.
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:08.880]   So it's a winner.
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:09.880]   Take all model.
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:10.880]   What was the third one?
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:11.880]   Wall Street Journal.
[00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:12.880]   The other times in Washington Post.
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:13.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:14.880]   I have so do I.
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:15.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:17.880]   Of course.
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:18.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:19.880]   So do I.
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:20.880]   I don't subscribe to any of those.
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:21.880]   You're the common man.
[00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:22.880]   You're the real man.
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:30.000]   I totally get having these paywalls up because ideally they're going to have legit content
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.920]   out there and legit information.
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:36.040]   But there's a lot of times that I've been able to click on some of these stories and
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:41.160]   get a partial view of whatever they're showing before hitting the paywall.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:43.200]   And I'm like, this is bad.
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:45.680]   And it just doesn't warrant.
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:46.680]   And I'll bring up this.
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:48.160]   There is a hazard.
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:51.560]   Knox Harrington and our IRC chat brings us up.
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:57.840]   If all the good content sites are paywalled, what will be left for normal, unpaying people
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:01.480]   to pay for breed is link, bait and crap.
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:02.480]   Exactly.
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:06.600]   But I'm seeing I'm seeing link bait from some of these reputable sources too.
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:07.600]   Oh yeah.
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:11.760]   And that's why I'm like, why are you bother?
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:12.760]   It's not all crap.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:14.040]   I mean, mine's free.
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.040]   It's more trade though.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:19.760]   I get a lot of people who are cranky that my stuff is too technical for them.
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:20.960]   Well, too bad.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:22.960]   I mean, that's what you do.
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:26.120]   But this is what today is spent.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.120]   People are just cranky.
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.680]   I got to say, people are cranky about anything.
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:29.680]   They'll complain about anything.
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:33.080]   If you're not technical, you'd get just as many people saying, you need to be more
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:34.080]   technical.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.080]   Yes.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:40.280]   I get each week, I get someone telling me I'm too technical and I get someone saying,
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.240]   thank you for explaining things so clearly.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:45.520]   So I take it all with a few campaigns.
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:50.920]   But I will say there will always be, I do think there's always room.
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:54.400]   I'll call it a trade like publication.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:01:04.760]   Because my advertisers are happy to reach the people who are legitimately focused on
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:05.760]   my area.
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:08.520]   And I think there's areas where that model will work.
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:11.000]   I think there's a narrower that breaks down.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.960]   The narrower your niche and you have a very narrow niche, the easier it is to do that.
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:22.320]   I think if you're general, it's harder, right?
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.480]   Because you have a natural audience.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:27.640]   Well, you have a natural audience.
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:29.080]   It's just they're not lucrative.
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:30.720]   They're just like the advantage.
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:31.720]   It's everybody.
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:32.720]   Yeah.
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.880]   Well, consider what is considered a frequent user of the New York Times.
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:40.520]   They had to lower it from 20 pages a month to 10 pages a month to five or three.
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:41.520]   Wow.
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:46.720]   That means that means people who are paid, they can't get them to convert.
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:51.280]   If they only come three to five times a month, three to five articles a month.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:52.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.680]   I'm reading.
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:54.680]   I'm stunned.
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:55.680]   There's all I can do.
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:57.680]   I happen to have in my hand.
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.080]   What is this?
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.080]   Professor.
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.080]   Senator McCarthy.
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.080]   Excellent paper.
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:03.080]   Yes.
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:10.080]   Three great researchers Duncan Watts, David Rothschild and Marcus Mobius just published.
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.240]   And it's about fake news.
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:19.120]   They found that from 2017, there were 5,000 English language publications, academic papers
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:21.200]   about fake news.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:24.920]   So what they're saying is, I think it's maybe a little overblown and what the research we
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:25.920]   need.
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.480]   But here's some data in this.
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:31.520]   News consumption is a small fraction of overall media consumption.
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:39.600]   14% of overall media consumption is dedicated to news, right?
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:40.760]   14%.
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:47.160]   Some 1% of regular news consumption and less than 1/10 of 1% of overall media consumption
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:49.520]   can be considered fake.
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:55.040]   Three and four Americans spend less than 30 seconds a day reading news online while almost
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.960]   half consume no online news whatsoever.
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:01.160]   So we're weird on this.
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.160]   We are really.
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.160]   Yeah, we are.
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:04.160]   Oh, okay.
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.160]   We're having fun.
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:07.120]   It is the best of this week in Google.
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:08.400]   I think every week is the best.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.880]   I love working with Stacey and Aunt and Jeff.
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:14.320]   And we have so much fun together.
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:15.320]   It's just a great show.
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:17.480]   And I'm so glad you listen or watch.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.640]   And thank you for joining us for this holiday.
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:23.000]   I hope you're having a good holiday.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.480]   Happy New Year.
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:32.080]   We'll all be back with the show live, doing new stuff this Wednesday, January 5th.
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.280]   So don't worry.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.280]   We're not gone for good.
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:37.040]   We just thought we'd give everybody a little time off.
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:43.360]   And a special thanks, by the way, to our producers, especially Jason Howell and our editors who
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:45.120]   put this all together.
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:47.440]   And thanks to everybody who suggested the best of clips.
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:48.800]   We really appreciate it.
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:49.800]   Helps.
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:50.800]   Let's take a look, Bic.
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:52.280]   Break will come back with a lot more.
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:55.240]   Our show today brought to you by Wealthfront.
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:57.640]   You know, I'm a big fan of Wealthfront.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:02.480]   Not a big fan of the diamond hands, the rocket ship to the moon, the stonk memes.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.040]   Yeah, that's fun.
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.040]   Okay.
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:08.080]   So what was going to Las Vegas and throwing your money away on the craps table?
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.240]   It's fun.
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:12.600]   It is not a way to build wealth.
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.800]   I know I sound like a cranky old man.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.760]   But this is what I tell my kids.
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:22.320]   It's what I wish somebody had told me when I was a young guy.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:27.720]   It's fun, but day traders, for the most part, don't beat the market.
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:30.560]   What you really want to do is get a Wealthfront investment account.
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:35.960]   You know, save, if you want, save a little bit to take and gamble away on stonks.
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:38.240]   The odds are not in your favor if you're doing it alone.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:41.200]   Wealthfront is a great company to team up with.
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:45.680]   Whether you're a beginner or you've been investing like I have for years, Wealthfront
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:46.680]   makes it easy.
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:48.560]   They do it right.
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:51.280]   And they have the right tools for every portfolio, every need.
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:55.320]   The first thing that happens when you go to Wealthfront is you answer a couple of questions.
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:56.320]   What's your time frame?
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:57.320]   What are you saving for?
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:59.080]   How risk averse are you?
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:00.520]   Things like that.
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:06.680]   And then Wealthfront will create a portfolio just for you, just for you, of globally diversified
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:14.600]   low-cost index funds, personalized for you, and your goals, your needs, your desires.
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.440]   You can also build your own portfolio if you want.
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:18.360]   They have funds, some really interesting.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:21.920]   There's a clean energy fund, a crypto trust, tech investments.
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:25.640]   A lot of us think, you know, tech's going to do pretty well in the future.
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:30.240]   I don't know, not making a recommendation.
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.480]   Hundreds of other investment choices.
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:37.360]   One I really like, their socially responsible portfolio, a mix of funds built around human
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:41.480]   rights and climate change and sustainability, diversity, you'll feel good.
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:42.680]   You're doing the right thing.
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:47.520]   Wealthfront does things that make it easy to build your wealth.
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:49.620]   No manual trades.
[01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:51.520]   You don't have to look at the newspaper.
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.520]   Does anybody look at the newspaper?
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:55.600]   You don't have to look at your phone to see the stock ticker.
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:58.440]   You don't have to pick stocks.
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:01.960]   They handle all the investing based on your preferences, so you don't have to think about
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:02.960]   it.
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:06.160]   But they also do things that you probably wouldn't think to do.
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:12.000]   Things I know you need to do, like tax loss harvesting, which lowers your tax bill.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.320]   In fact, in many cases, most cases I would say that your fees, which are very low to
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:21.320]   begin with, will actually be covered by the tax loss harvesting they do.
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:25.360]   They also, I think this is really important, rebalance your portfolio because sometimes
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:26.600]   the stocks are doing really well.
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:31.040]   You get over invested in stocks, so they rebalance it.
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:32.680]   You're supposed to do that at least quarterly.
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:33.680]   They do it automatically.
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:36.720]   You don't even have to think about it.
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:40.280]   In fact, it's one of those things you set and forget.
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:43.400]   You're just building your wealth automatically behind the scenes.
[01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.440]   It feels good.
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:49.520]   Wealthfront's trusted with over $27 billion in assets.
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:53.440]   They're helping nearly half a million people build their wealth.
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:56.640]   To get you in the door, they're offering, I think it's a great offer.
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:00.920]   Your first $5,000 managed free forever.
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.480]   Just go to wealthfront.com/twig.
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:06.400]   Please do that though, so that they know you saw it on a twig.
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.400]   Wealthfront.com/twig.
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.520]   $500 opens the account.
[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:11.720]   Grow your wealth the easy way.
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:13.480]   Let wealthfront do the work for you.
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:15.760]   Takes all the anxiety out of it.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:16.840]   Some would say all the fun.
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:19.960]   I don't think fun.
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:24.760]   In long-term portfolio building really should go together.
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:28.800]   You can still have your fun, but let Wealthfront work on building the wealth.
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:29.800]   Start building your wealth.
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.640]   Get your first $5,000 managed for free for life.

[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:37.760]   Wealth.
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.520]   That's a good word.
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:44.360]   Front fr-o-n-t.com/twig.
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.880]   Get started today.
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:47.520]   Wealthfront.com/twig.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:50.880]   Thank you, Wealthfront.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:56.760]   One of the things that's constantly plaguing this week in Google is YouTube's automatic
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:08:00.320]   content ID system.
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.240]   It's just nuts.
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:03.960]   Watch.
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:05.800]   Are you a creator, by the way?
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:06.800]   You're a creator.
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:07.800]   I'm a creator.
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.280]   We're all creators.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:10.280]   So it's a good time.
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:11.280]   Send us children.
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:12.280]   Our creators.
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:13.280]   Finally, media recognized it.
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:14.280]   They thought they were the only creators.
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:15.280]   We're all creators.
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:17.520]   You know who else was a creator?
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:18.520]   Beethoven.
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:25.080]   That's a lead into your story, Stacy.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:26.080]   Go ahead.
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.720]   I was like, what is happening here?
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:36.760]   So this story is, this is both a, people suck and a content moderation is hard story.
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:39.760]   And also that YouTube needs better practices story.
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:41.760]   So this is from Corey Doctorow.
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:44.080]   He, let me get the name of the lady, right?
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:45.080]   Sorry.
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:46.680]   Let me open this up again.
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:47.680]   Marina.
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:48.680]   Marina.
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:49.680]   I was a piano teacher.
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:50.680]   We were going to do this.
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:52.600]   Who publishes free lessons.
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:53.960]   I love Corey.
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:57.040]   And I love his blog, pluralistic.net.
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:04.000]   She creates free piano lessons on her piano keys YouTube channel, celebrated her fifth
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:10.080]   anniversary Corey writes by announcing she was quitting YouTube because her meager wages
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:15.200]   were being stolen by fraudsters.
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:20.800]   She posted a video with a little bit of a moonlight sonata, which you might remember.
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:27.040]   Beethoven published, no, actually, Beethoven did not publish this in 1801.
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:33.920]   Beethoven wrote it in, I don't know what, 1762, but it was published in 1801.
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:35.160]   It's in public domain.
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:38.320]   In other words, the copyright belongs to Marina.
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:40.120]   She performed it.
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:44.680]   Nevertheless, you play or something.
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:47.280]   You're going to get that's for at least that's for at least not the moonlights.
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:48.680]   I can't hum the moonlights.
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:54.600]   I'm sorry, but it triggered and I might have just triggered it to YouTube's automated right
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:56.120]   now, but then we're going to get taken down.
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:59.240]   The moonlight is very slow.
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:02.560]   It triggered YouTube's automated copyright filter.
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:07.960]   I'm amazed you recognize for your lease though and you named that tune four notes.
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:13.440]   In the 90s, I had a phone that played it.
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:19.760]   A corporate entity identified only by an alphabet soup of initialisms and cryptic LLC
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:28.920]   names had claimed moonlight sonata as their own, calling it WICCA moonlight.
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:34.640]   The Content ID flag marina's track is an unauthorized performance of WICCA moonlight.
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:36.960]   She appealed the judgment.
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:38.080]   The problem is you appeal.
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:40.240]   We've had this happen to us.
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:47.040]   Then they send a message to the copyright owners saying, "Do you agree that no infringement
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.040]   took place?"
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:54.760]   But of course they said, "No, they infringed it so she can now let this shadowy company
[01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:58.880]   monetize her video," which steals all of the revenue from her.
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.000]   She can take her video down.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.960]   We are faced with this, by the way, frequently.
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:04.560]   I have no idea this was happening.
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:05.560]   This is so inferior.
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:07.560]   It happens all the time.
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:10.000]   This is exactly what it was.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.680]   I thought the problem was just that it took your stuff down and you couldn't make money.
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:17.720]   I didn't realize there was a group of organizations who...
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:18.720]   Yes.
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:23.480]   If you want to fight this and we've done this, you can fight it.
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:28.360]   You have to provide them with your full name and address.
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:31.360]   Then they go and they...
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.360]   You go back and forth.
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:37.120]   Ultimately it'll end in court, but even prior to that.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.120]   We've had people...
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.880]   I don't even want to go into it.
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:40.880]   We've had people make...
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:45.440]   I mean, the funniest things ever in their claims against us.
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:48.440]   We had pictures of the NASA video.
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:53.720]   We had the NASA launch taken down by National Geographic who claimed, "Oh no, we own the
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:54.720]   NASA video."
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:57.920]   Of course, that was an error, they said.
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:00.800]   Anyway, this is Content ID.
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:02.280]   Corey hates Content ID.
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:06.240]   I hate Content ID.
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:07.680]   It just doesn't work very well.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:13.760]   Here is, and I love this, Corey published this from the EFF, "Navigating YouTube's Content
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:20.080]   ID," a little flowchart to help you understand why...
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.080]   And blame Hollywood.
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.920]   Yeah, I blame Hollywood, folks.
[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:25.320]   Yeah, I blame Hollywood, but also blame.
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:28.640]   I blame the tech companies who thought we could solve this algorithmically.
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.400]   Exactly, I agree.
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.800]   And the algorithm is the problem.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:33.960]   It's easily game.
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:34.960]   Scale.
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:35.960]   Yeah.
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:36.960]   Bad guys.
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:37.960]   Yeah.
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:41.200]   And I guess if you create something like YouTube where you get 100 million hours of content
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:44.160]   every day, how else are you going to do it?
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:45.160]   I understand.
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:47.480]   Well, and you've got to be...
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:51.120]   If you're going to be a platform, one of the costs of being a platform is recognizing
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:55.160]   that people are going to game it and you have to respond in a way that benefits the
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.160]   core users.
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.040]   Google does that already for search.
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.360]   They're like, "Oh, shoot.
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:01.960]   Too many people are using weird SEO optimizations.
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:03.560]   Now we're going to change things."
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:07.760]   But what they're not doing is they'll do it for their core businesses, but then they
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:11.360]   put out these creator platforms and they're not doing it for those businesses.
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:13.320]   And that's just not me.
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:16.240]   It's a big chilling effect on everything we do.
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:18.960]   I try to tell our staff, "Don't worry about it.
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:19.960]   Don't worry about it."
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:21.840]   But it really does create a chilling effect.
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:25.120]   We have to constantly say, "Oh, we better not do that because they'll take us out."
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:26.120]   It's down.
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:29.840]   Corey also points out that it's really an uneven process.
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:38.520]   For instance, an Instagram takedown takes a few seconds to file, but 28 months to appeal.
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:41.800]   We've had that where they'll take down a video and maybe we can get it back in two
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:46.520]   weeks, but by then nobody's going to watch the two-week-old news show.
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.920]   So it's really a problem.
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:56.480]   There's a Warner-Chappelle, Warner music, demonetized videos that include the numbers
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:01.600]   36 and 50.
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:02.600]   Why?
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:06.920]   They should have bad effects for doing bad things.
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:09.880]   And they should be penalized for overzealous.
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:15.120]   There's a Twitch streamer and Munition, good name.
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:20.680]   Her videos were demonetized over the use of the numbers 36 and 50.
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:26.680]   To protect copyright holders, you can copyright the number apparently.
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:35.760]   The media company Fullscreen was simply, the claim was simply over the number 36.
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:38.960]   You can appeal and maybe she's probably back.
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:43.160]   Fullscreen is a social contact company for talent and brands.
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:48.960]   They're owned by Otter Media, a subsidiary of Warner Media.
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:50.960]   They claim the number 36.
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:56.920]   I don't understand how you can copyright a number.
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:00.280]   Well, they also copyrighted 50.
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:09.080]   And while the claims are active before the appeal is accepted, they take all monetization.
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:10.960]   And you can also lose your account.
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:14.840]   But the long shot is you can get a strike and lose your account completely.
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:18.400]   When they're knocked down, they should have to give back 10 times monetization.
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:19.400]   They should be some sort of...
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:22.440]   Yeah, like treble damages for being bad.
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:25.560]   They call it slap in the lawsuit world.
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:26.560]   Yes.
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.360]   There should be some sort of slap.
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:31.320]   These are also the customers of the big companies.
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:34.080]   And they are the ones who have the lobbyists and the lawyers.
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:35.080]   So they would, you know what?
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:40.320]   They'd go running into Capitol Hill and we'd have soap of people fight again.
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:41.320]   It's very...
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.320]   So, Papeepa, what?
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:44.400]   Oh, it's pretty easy.
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:47.200]   So, Papeepa, we don't want to go with soap of people.
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:51.560]   We don't want to soap of people again there.
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:52.960]   That's a good guess.
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:53.960]   We fight them.
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:16:00.040]   But the risk to us is that we would get a strike and too many strikes, we would lose
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:02.280]   our channels and that would be a big deal.
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:04.160]   I hate, I freaking hate you too.
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:06.560]   I understand the value of it.
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:11.000]   It's very impressive that anybody can create video, but it is also...
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.400]   It's kind of a mess.
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:16.560]   And I don't like it affecting what we do as our content.
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:20.280]   I mean, I can't even hum fear, at least, without fearing that they're going to take it down.
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:23.520]   Now, I've got to worry about 36.
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:27.000]   And, Jeff, no numbers with 36 or 50.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000]   I'm just telling you.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000]   Okay, all right.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.000]   I've got it.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.200]   Don't want to take that chance.
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:36.080]   No line numbers, 36 or 50.
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.080]   Let's start our picks of the week.
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:40.560]   Now, Kevin, you came here a short notice in the middle of the show.
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:42.600]   So, oh, you do have a pick.
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:43.840]   You're amazing.
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:45.680]   What is your pick?
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:49.240]   My pick is the map of the internet.
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:52.040]   So you remember the XK did this a long time ago?
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:54.840]   Someone's made a current map of the internet.
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:57.400]   If there's a link to the top right, it lets you...
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.520]   Wow, look at that.
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:05.240]   So it's this huge, huge map with different loud masses with...
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:08.600]   It looks like a real map, but it's websites.
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:12.720]   And they're scaled to approximate number of users, I think.
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:13.720]   So you can see...
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:14.720]   There's browsers.
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:17.480]   You might want to put it in there if you look really carefully.
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:18.480]   You think it's in there?
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:19.760]   Oh, it should be.
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:20.760]   I would hope so.
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:22.600]   You're on the internet.
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:23.680]   Oh, wow.
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:24.680]   This is...
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:25.680]   Is this...
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:26.680]   This is from Halcyonmaps.com.
[01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:28.400]   Actually, I'm going to...
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:33.200]   This is one of those places where I'm going to spend more time browsing their catalog because
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:35.200]   I love maps.
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:39.080]   Look at the bottom where Antarctica would be the dark web.
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.080]   Wikipedia is like Greenland.
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:44.920]   So I think basically they wouldn't need to buy this and put it on your wall, which would
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:45.920]   be fun.
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:46.920]   I may not end up doing that.
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:47.920]   Here's the Qzone.
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:52.920]   You know, really what you need is some of the things that actually changes over time.
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:58.000]   So you need a display that links to software that's continuously updating this.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.000]   Yes.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.000]   Yes.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   Wow.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.320]   So I want the version of this in SVG, so I actually searched the text in it rather
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:05.320]   than actually...
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:06.520]   Oh, when that'd be nice.
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:07.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:11.240]   So we're a touch screen you can zoom in.
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:16.440]   Here's Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, V contact.
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:19.280]   The Russian version thereof.
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:21.080]   Duck, duck, go.
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:23.320]   Zoom is a pretty big island out of the ocean.
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:27.440]   Zoom island is a big old one, but not as big as you know who.
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.720]   The island of Google.
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:30.720]   It's actually...
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:31.720]   That's a continent.
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:32.720]   Google stand.
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:33.720]   Yeah.
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:35.640]   That's really fun.
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:38.040]   Error correcting plateau.
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:39.520]   Google contacts.
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:40.520]   Android TV.
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:41.520]   Google has a lot of...
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:42.520]   A lot of...
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:43.840]   Somebody put a lot of effort in this.
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:44.840]   There's TikTok.
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:45.840]   Yeah.
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:46.840]   This is...
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:47.840]   This is a major effort.
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:48.840]   It's a beautiful...
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:49.840]   French.
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:50.840]   Yeah.
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:51.840]   I think I will get a bit closer for the wall.
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:52.840]   That's pretty cool.
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:56.040]   And it all looks like one of those old, old timey maps of the new world.
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:19:00.600]   And then here's a list of major websites blocked in China, very handy.
[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:04.080]   Pop website languages, internet users, percent of population.
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:06.120]   It is now greater than 90%.
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:07.760]   Oh no, this is...
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:08.760]   I see here.
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:09.760]   This is based...
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:11.640]   This is a smaller map.
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:13.480]   And Canada is the only one...
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:15.560]   Canada and the UK are greater than 90%.
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:19.160]   We're actually only, I don't know, down in the lower numbers.
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:21.760]   No, Canada looks like it's at 70 to 80%.
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:22.760]   Again, colors...
[01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:26.240]   Oh, it's kind of a darker blue.
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:27.240]   Who's 90% then?
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:29.080]   Who's the darkest blue of all?
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:31.080]   Well, I think that's up there.
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:32.080]   Norway.
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:33.080]   Norway, yeah.
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:34.080]   Finland.
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:35.080]   All right.
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:37.680]   Largest companies by revenue highest selling video games.
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:41.560]   Tetris number one, Minecraft number two, Grand Theft Auto 5.
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:42.560]   Number three.
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:44.800]   Oh, this is the same chart only now.
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:47.040]   So it was 2006 versus two.
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:48.040]   Okay.
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:49.040]   Yes.
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:50.040]   That makes sense.
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:51.040]   It's changed.
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:54.680]   Created by Martin Vargic of Halcyonmaps.com.
[01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:56.320]   Good pick of the week.
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:58.920]   I love this.
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:06.480]   I love the colophon, which features 4chan Google, Susan Wojcicki, Pierre Omidar.
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:08.880]   That's great.
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:15.640]   Last time we talked to you, Joan, we were talking about Russian influence on the elections and
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:16.640]   disinformation.
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.760]   That hasn't gone away.
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:23.440]   Apparently yesterday, President Putin said, "Oh, we're not taking...
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:24.600]   We're not taking you.
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.600]   You're hacking us."
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.600]   Okay, sure.
[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:30.480]   You're hacking us.
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:32.400]   How this works.
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:36.240]   That is one of the tools of the big lie.
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:41.120]   It's funny because it happens over and over again, and yet nobody seems to notice, is just
[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:45.280]   accusing the person, "Uh-oh, what happened?"
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:46.280]   I didn't do it.
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:47.440]   I swear I didn't do it.
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:48.440]   We went blind.
[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:49.440]   There we go.
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:50.440]   I didn't do it.
[01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:51.440]   I didn't do it.
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:52.440]   You're back.
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:57.360]   You're a proponent of doing the thing you're doing.
[01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:01.800]   It's an amazing rhetorical trick because it gets them to get all twisted and nuts defending
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:02.800]   themselves.
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:07.160]   It's a combination of projection and what aboutism and the same thing.
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:08.160]   Yeah.
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:09.680]   Projection is a big one.
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:12.960]   Well, everybody, we're hacking you, so you must be hacking us.
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:21.040]   I mean, we're not just talking about your garden variety, trolls and botnets online.
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:29.840]   Hacking the power grid here, hacking infrastructure, hacking critical infrastructure.
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:31.240]   I mean, yeah.
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:32.480]   It's a little bit different.
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:42.320]   The stakes are obviously enormous, but at the same time, Putin's always going to pretend
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:48.880]   he doesn't know what's happening, but he himself is very fascinated by technology and knows
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:50.760]   a lot.
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:53.000]   We should always be wary.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:56.640]   He also had an interesting justification for poisoning the Volney.
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:59.000]   I mean, it's just fascinating to watch this guy.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:06.640]   I hate to say it, but it brought back a little like this is where we were for the last four
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:10.640]   years, like with a guy who just says anything he wants.
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:14.080]   Well, but a guy who's really effed smart.
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:15.520]   Well, maybe that's the difference.
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:21.720]   I was in the room with him once in Davos, Joe now goes there instead of me.
[01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:22.720]   I haven't been.
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:23.720]   I have.
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:25.440]   I heard the hotels rent too high.
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:27.440]   The rent too high.
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:28.440]   Do it.
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:34.120]   At the end of the day, you can keep your world power if I, you know, if I save a few thousand
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:35.120]   bucks.
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:45.360]   So Putin saw a male journalist wearing a, what do you call that greenish ring from like Arizona?
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:46.360]   Jade?
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:48.320]   No, not not Jade.
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:49.320]   The turquoise.
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:50.320]   Turquoise.
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:51.320]   Thank you turquoise.
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:54.520]   So we're in a big turquoise ring and he focused on it.
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:59.440]   He said, do men wear those and he wouldn't let go.
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:01.680]   He kept going back on it again.
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:04.440]   And the guy's wife had given it to him.
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:07.680]   And we all try to get the guy to give Putin, make him to put it on.
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:13.840]   But he just, he just, he finds an odd little thing about somebody and he just focuses in
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:15.840]   and he's scary.
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:17.880]   Some people call that trolling though.
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:18.880]   Yeah.
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:21.800]   Oh, well he, yeah, his whole nation trolls us.
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:24.560]   That was my point, sir.
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:25.560]   Yeah.
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:31.120]   Putin's response to ABC's questioning him about Navalny was, will Black Lives Matter?
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:34.640]   It's like a boy.
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:36.800]   Oh, good.
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:38.600]   Yeah.
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:43.640]   It's just, anyway, it's not, it's not really on our, our beat.
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:48.080]   But I, but I think it's great to have Joan on because what is on our beat is the use
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:56.200]   of technology, particularly the internet these days to spread lies, misinformation, to
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:58.720]   mobilize, to radicalize.
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:01.080]   There's all sorts of malign uses.
[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:06.200]   Now Jeff is the big defender of big tech and I don't, well, I don't disagree with him.
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:07.200]   Big tech.
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:08.200]   We affect Joan.
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:09.200]   I'm defending the internet.
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:10.200]   Yeah.
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:12.440]   But Joan was saying this, you were, you were not here at the moment, but Joan was saying
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:14.560]   this before the show began.
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:20.200]   Where would we have been in the last year and a half without Zoom and tech and all that?
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:21.200]   Amen.
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:24.480]   I wrote a thank you note to the internet on medium two weeks ago and I mean it.
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:27.720]   I think that we would have been worked without it.
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:34.840]   But this is our constant battle on, on this show, but also just in general, there's good
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:37.560]   in tech and there's bad in tech.
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:44.040]   You wrote a piece Joan for Harvard magazine saying disinformation ain't going away.
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:46.400]   You know, can it be stopped?
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:50.000]   Oh, that was, that was a piece that I was a profiled in and.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.000]   Oh, okay.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000]   Yeah.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.920]   There's a couple of other researchers in there.
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:58.640]   That headline on that piece.
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:01.600]   Can disinformation be stopped?
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:03.800]   What's your answer to that Joan?
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:08.480]   Well, it has with everything, it depends.
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:14.880]   One of the things that I think the internet has been fantastic at is helping us root information
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:17.360]   around the planet, lowering the cost of it.
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:25.960]   I was just thinking about high fidelity video and how different it is to be isolated but
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:30.000]   not necessarily alone in the same way.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.520]   I'm wearing my phone, phone losers of America t-shirt here today because I do, you know,
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:40.280]   I'd still like romanticize the phone and voice and you know, just the way in which people
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:43.240]   come to hear and learn from one another.
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:49.080]   But there is something different about video and when it comes to disinformation, I think
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:52.320]   we're dealing with again, a distribution issue.
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:54.120]   We're dealing with a content issue.
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:26:03.080]   We're dealing with people who are motivated either through money or clout to push disinformation
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:04.080]   around.
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:08.080]   Obviously, it's politically rewarding to be able to do that.
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:13.920]   And so I wish I could say in this moment that disinformation can be stopped.
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:21.920]   I think one thing we have to focus on is figuring out what should these distribution channels
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:27.680]   look like and how should they be run and who should oversee them.
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:29.040]   And we got to go from there.
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:34.640]   We need serious standards and protocols to get at what I've been calling a public interest
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:38.280]   internet or an internet that serves the broadest public good.
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:39.720]   Actually, the fact-
[01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:44.360]   I don't mean to sound so naive, but I don't think disinformation will ever be stopped
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:49.120]   as long as there's some form of profit involved, whether it's money or this political power
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:50.120]   or-
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:51.120]   Or power or all-
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:55.760]   Well, and as Jeff has pointed out, it predates the internet by a long shot.
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:57.920]   So it's witchcraft, it's print.
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:26:58.920]   Yeah.
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:02.840]   But maybe it is a little bit more- I mean, look, we've always had, I'm sure, in the pre-print
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:08.320]   there were middle ages, there were conspiracy theories that made the rest just very, very
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:09.320]   slowly.
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:11.520]   You know, right.
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:18.360]   But as soon as there were newspapers, you know, there's the press wars of the 1820s and
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:19.360]   the United States-
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:25.360]   They were to balance printed ballots and people going through and that was the source of a
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:27.440]   lot of the witchcraft conspiracy theories.
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:30.960]   But there is a cynicism that's a little different.
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:36.320]   In fact, it's interesting you invoked the phone losers of America, John, because I think
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:37.320]   there's-
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:46.480]   They're harmless, but they also deal in a form of disinformation and there's a certain
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:54.480]   amount of almost cynicism, like a mocking, like, oh, we can fool these people because
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:56.040]   they're stupid, I guess.
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:58.160]   I think it's not stupid.
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:27:59.920]   I think it's trusting, right?
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:01.840]   Which is even worse.
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:04.080]   You're mocking people because they're trusting.
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:05.080]   That's terrible.
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:12.560]   And I mean, but that's what's so interesting here is we have to change how information is
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:19.080]   shared and what kind of labels are put on and how it arrives at our door and what we
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:21.720]   call news and what we don't call news.
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:28.120]   I've been a big pusher of trying to get us to think about, well, we have distribution
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:29.120]   pathways.
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:35.520]   Social media really favors things that are popular and novel.
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:41.560]   And so what if we were to also make sure that social media served things that are timely,
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:43.560]   accurate, local knowledge?
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.000]   But nobody wants that.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000]   Right?
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.000]   I mean, that's-
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.560]   No, well, I mean, we don't have to want things to use them.
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:50.560]   Everybody wants to serve them.
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:52.360]   Nobody wants the vegetables.
[01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:53.360]   Nobody wants water.
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:55.360]   I mean, like, it's nice.
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:57.360]   It's good to have.
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:58.600]   It's necessary.
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:05.440]   But like, if you have a choice between water and wine or water in a martini or water in,
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:08.440]   you know, an ice cold seltzer, like I have here.
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:10.560]   Which is what John's drinking, yes.
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:12.200]   You know, that's that.
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:18.440]   But part of it is really trying to figure out what, in what proportions do we need this?
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:23.680]   You know, and I think too, you know, so like, if you think about broad stakes of different
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:28.320]   conspiracy theories, like probably the most broad stakes that most people are familiar
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:33.280]   with is, you know, this notion of Holocaust denialism.
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:40.160]   And, you know, a couple years ago, Zuckerberg came out and said that, well, he's not going
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:45.040]   to remove Holocaust denial on his platform because people have the right to be wrong
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.800]   about things.
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:53.480]   And later, as we realize how big, you know, anti-Semitic movements get organized and how
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:59.240]   big they become when they are allowed to exchange information, unfettered and reach
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:06.560]   audiences of people that do not necessarily understand the stakes of what they're reading.
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:12.120]   And it's, you know, just kind of laced in with, you know, missives from your aunt and
[01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:17.720]   your, you know, your cousin's graduation pictures and your friends, your best friends
[01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:23.120]   cat and Holocaust denialism is just right there in the same mix.
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:24.120]   It's different.
[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:31.080]   And so we do need to think about ranking, sorting, labeling, you know, I think we need
[01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:33.520]   more librarians at the helm of the end.
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:34.520]   Hey, men to that.
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:35.520]   I like that.
[01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:37.760]   So Joe, I don't think it's insurmountable.
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:41.360]   I just think that there's a, there's different ways of thinking about what the solution might
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:42.360]   be.
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:43.360]   It's a big hill to climb.
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:44.360]   Yeah.
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:48.920]   All right, Matt, now you're back in the hot seat because the New York Times says Sundar
[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:51.520]   Pichai sucks.
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:31:00.520]   Uh, can a nice guy be an effective leader is the question the Times asks.
[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:09.400]   Lysuki Waka Biyashi, talking to restive Google executives, all anonymous, of course, who
[01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:15.120]   say that Sundar takes too long to make a decision.
[01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:16.120]   We did that.
[01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:18.040]   We have seen some blog posts.
[01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:24.360]   The guy who founded Way is no embarredine when he left, wrote a blog post kind of excoriating
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:29.160]   the Google culture saying it's it had turned into a big slow moving company.
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:33.880]   Do you stay in touch with people at Google, Matt, or have you?
[01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:34.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:37.200]   Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:42.240]   And it's interesting because even, you know, in the later days when I was at Google, you
[01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:48.240]   could definitely feel like getting a change launched was more difficult, of course, than
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:53.600]   the early days, but also just like, okay, how does it affect, you know, you know, international
[01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:58.480]   markets, you know, the search quality and other languages, that sort of stuff.
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:01.440]   And some people are like, oh, you have to get all of these approvals.
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:07.040]   But also, you know, it's a natural thing that when you are a really big company with a really
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:10.520]   big footprint and impact, you're going to have more scrutiny.
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:14.360]   And that's, you know, it's hard to try to figure out how can you move quickly while still
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:15.360]   being big.
[01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:19.880]   And I don't think anybody's found the perfect solution to that at all.
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:25.040]   Every time I wrangled or interacted with Sundar, he was always doing a really good job.
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:31.320]   I've only talked to him when he was running the Chrome OS division, but I was very impressed
[01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:36.320]   by his genial and nature, his intelligence, his candor.
[01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:41.240]   I thought he was a really great guy, but that does not necessarily make a great CEO.
[01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:45.560]   In fact, it might be maybe the contrary abilities.
[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:49.920]   I have to say, the Times buries about eight paragraphs in the Google executives complaining
[01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:54.440]   about Mr. Pichai's leadership acknowledge that and say he is a thoughtful and caring
[01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:55.440]   leader.
[01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:59.320]   They say Google is more disciplined and organized these days, a bigger and more professionally
[01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:02.880]   run company than one Mr. Pichai inherited six years ago.
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:05.320]   Is he going to say that all that whole pipe in?
[01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:09.560]   Well, I was just going to say what they're doing is building a story based on an archeotype,
[01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:10.560]   right?
[01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:14.880]   And so you've got the Zuckerberg archetype, which is I don't care about other people.
[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:17.080]   I never apologize and never about think about things.
[01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:18.080]   I'm just in it for.
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:20.520]   I don't know what he's in it for.
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:24.520]   Anyway, the money, the data, the whatever.
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:28.800]   And then you've got this sort of thing, which is, oh, he's too slow moving, you know, and
[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:32.480]   very thoughtful and blah, blah, blah, Google's separate problems in a slow moving.
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:33.640]   And it is.
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:35.040]   It is a much bigger company.
[01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:38.240]   It's trying to do a lot more things.
[01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:42.280]   But there's two things happening here.
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:46.640]   One is conflating the person at the top with the fate of the company.
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:49.640]   And I know that leadership matters.
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:54.960]   I mean, you look at Intel and you can just watch how leadership has just sucked a company
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:56.960]   just down the toilet.
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:06.160]   But I also know that there are many people under him and Google is a company that from
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:10.520]   the outside really looks pretty disorganized just in general.
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:18.400]   So I don't know if I feel like the executives there complaining about Pichai really means
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:19.400]   much.
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:23.520]   And I think the New York Times is kind of making a story to fit a mold that it needs.
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:27.600]   Jeff kind of was a little pissed off actually.
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:28.600]   As I remember.
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:29.600]   Surprise.
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:31.360]   Well, no, journalistic, journalistic.
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:34.920]   I thought I just came here at Kafka and I from Rico just went back and forth with each
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:35.920]   other on Twitter.
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:38.760]   Like, well, I don't know if I could do well in your journalism class.
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:40.240]   I said, well, maybe not.
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:42.880]   I think this is based on anonymous reporting.
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:44.840]   You can write this story about any boss out there.
[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:45.840]   Well, some people like them.
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:46.840]   Some people don't.
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:47.840]   They don't like him.
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:50.600]   I don't like the boss there is.
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:55.960]   And in my tweet, you can, I said, I said, can you roll a swirl up?
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:56.960]   Yes.
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:00.640]   The more I think about this New York Times, one man trend story about Cinder Pichai, the
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:03.880]   more ridiculous it is Jeff Jarvis wrote.
[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:06.960]   It could be written about any boss in any organization.
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:12.840]   Some agree, some disagree, some like, some don't like go up to the prior tweet and the
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:15.440]   initial tweet is go ahead.
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:20.200]   Media move faster, break things is Silicon Valley evil Google.
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:22.240]   Our CEO is thoughtful and patient.
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:26.440]   New York Times, let's do a trend story about Google cracking because it's not moving faster
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:27.440]   breaking things.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:30.400]   There is a little contradiction there.
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:32.920]   Mike Masnick replied to you.
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:36.800]   He said, I mean, how much do you want to bet that if Google had acquired Shopify, we'd
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:42.120]   be seeing New York Times story about how weak antitrust is that it was allowed to happen.
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:49.080]   So that's another point is that the Times has a little bit of a dog in this hunt.
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:52.400]   But we have said on this show, Mike Elgin said at first we said it several times as
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:57.800]   Cinder Pichai may not be the right man for the job.
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:00.080]   Google is making a lot of money.
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:02.640]   They've doubled their staff.
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:06.520]   They tripled their revenues since he took over.
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:10.360]   But it's making money the way it's always made money in search and advertising.
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:17.080]   Well, Google is clearly trying other things to make money.
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:25.240]   I don't think anyone in the world is wandering around going, not aware that search one day
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:26.880]   is going to erode.
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:31.400]   But I think they're struggling with how to build up that much money again.
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:33.720]   And part of that's just because they got in early.
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:36.200]   I mean, it's like you got in early on the web.
[01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:40.280]   That gives you untold advantages.
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:43.920]   And actually that's why the FTC is in the Congress are looking at antitrust things now, is the
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:49.920]   companies that got in early in these kind of newly forming networks are raking in the
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:50.920]   dough.
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:55.640]   Well, if they did it well, there's also, I mean, of course, Al Jazeera and Yahoo are untouchable.
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:56.640]   Yes.
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:00.840]   You know, so people to its credit didn't really well.
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:01.840]   Yes.
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:04.600]   Same as Amazon, same as Facebook.
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:08.040]   People's a little of an outlier there.
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:15.360]   It's interesting to me that I feel like Larry Page, Sergey, they hired a lot of really great
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:17.400]   slash smart people in the early days.
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:22.160]   And then sometimes if Larry or Sergey or even Eric were like, we're going to go down this
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:29.000]   route, they had enough people who were like, maybe, and it wasn't mutiny, but it was like,
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:32.640]   we'll just have our backup plan in our pocket where if this thing doesn't work out, we're
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:34.080]   ready for the next thing.
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:36.720]   You had a really high caliber of people.
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:41.120]   And I think they've been able to maintain that much better than a lot of big companies that
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:42.120]   I know of.
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:48.480]   The one thing I would just add is Google is it's kind of entering, well, the whole tech
[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:50.760]   industry is entering the lawyer season.
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:55.800]   Like, you know, the ability to talk well in front of Congress makes a difference and will
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:38:00.400]   for the next few years at least just because of the spotlight that's coming on big tech
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:01.600]   in general.
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:06.800]   And if you compare and contrast or think about Sundar testifying to Congress versus Larry
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:09.640]   Page, Larry is brilliant.
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:10.640]   He's fantastic.
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:15.560]   He has all kinds of amazing ideas, but he wouldn't be my first book pick to go sit down
[01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:19.760]   in front of the Federal Trade Commission or Congress.
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:23.000]   And it feels like Sundar is pretty well suited for that.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:29.200]   Certainly there's areas where you might say, okay, well, where's the maniacal vision or
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:30.200]   something like that?
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:34.880]   But Sundar does a good job of listening to the feedback that he's hearing from what I
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:35.880]   understand.
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:39.920]   You know, I felt kind of guilty raising this whole issue about Senator Pichai and I like
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:43.320]   Sundar a lot and I like Google a lot.
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:46.120]   And I think this is a question that's yes, yet to be answered.
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:47.120]   I do.
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:51.800]   And I'm sure it is a question we will be discussing further in 2022 on this week in Google.
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:54.560]   Hope you're enjoying our best of.
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:56.560]   There's lots more to come.
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:01.320]   Jeff Jarvis will never let me live this down.
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:02.520]   I, I'm sorry.
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:04.920]   I like Sudoku problems.
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:08.920]   Jeff thinks I'm nerdy, but I had some recommendations.
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:11.160]   I'm sorry.
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:12.320]   I like them.
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:14.680]   I just reloaded my YouTube page right now.
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:20.440]   And the first things that pop up, um, it's a Photoshop tutorial in KBHD.
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:22.640]   They know you so well.
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:26.240]   I'm DeSciks comedy because I watch a lot of stand up comedians.
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:29.120]   And here's a heads off photography video.
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:31.480]   Here's Alex Lindsey.
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:33.360]   Here's a Clemson replay.
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:35.400]   It, it gets me.
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:36.400]   All right.
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:38.080]   That's a, that's a good exercise.
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:41.120]   Let me look at what YouTube recommends for me.
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:43.080]   Twit.
[01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:46.360]   The Sudoku for people who don't like Sudoku.
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:48.920]   Mac break weekly boy, you are boring.
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:52.360]   Another Sudoku video.
[01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:54.360]   What are you?
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:56.360]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:40:00.360]   How do you possibly make a video out of Sudoku?
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:03.520]   Well, Jeff, it's fascinating.
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:07.560]   Actually this channel, people watching, they can play video games with boy.
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:12.280]   This is so far beyond cracking the cricket has up to nine.
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:15.280]   Twelve training Sudoku champ.
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:18.640]   And he makes, he makes Sudoku's.
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:20.200]   It's just, it's fascinating.
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:23.120]   Wednesday, it's a good, good report.
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:24.600]   It's really, really good.
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:25.600]   I like it.
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:28.160]   Oh, we'll you, we don't have any YouTube.
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:29.160]   Oh, no.
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:30.160]   That's great.
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:34.480]   I don't have a life, but that's too pretty fun.
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:35.480]   That's still pretty fun.
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:42.040]   Here's a, for some reason, a Nintendo switch game Zelda Skyward Sword HD.
[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:47.760]   Chess, Office Hours, Renee Richie's Apple ecosystem.
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:49.600]   How Amy Webb beat her insomnia.
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:50.600]   There you go.
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:52.520]   Oh, here's some more Sudoku.
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:55.760]   How does set of classics Sudoku?
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:56.760]   Wow.
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:40:58.760]   It's so tight.
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:02.400]   Oh, look, there's a lot of Sudoku yesterday.
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:07.080]   I like to watch TikTok to videos on YouTube.
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:11.680]   Sometimes somebody is really going to win in a surprising way.
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:14.080]   You know, none of this is objectionable actually.
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:15.480]   I think YouTube has done an excellent job.
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:16.480]   It's just really boring.
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:21.560]   No, it's just, it's just, you start watching those, they'll stay.
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:23.400]   Oh, it's all right.
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:27.360]   So if I, if I watch one, oh yeah, go away, wait, let's watch a Sudoku video and see what
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:28.360]   it recommends next.
[01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:31.120]   No, no, it's a long, they're long videos as you might imagine.
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:32.880]   Well, no, you'll see on the right hand.
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:33.880]   What do we recommend?
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:34.880]   Here, let's see the calculus.
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:36.120]   This is only 49 minutes.
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:37.120]   It's pretty quick.
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:38.120]   The calculus.
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:39.120]   I'm gonna write him to the page.
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:43.000]   So then you'll have what's next.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.920]   Where would I see that over here?
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:46.720]   Yeah, boy, let's usually go.
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:47.720]   I don't know why don't you see that.
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:48.720]   I always see that.
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:50.240]   Maybe it's too big.
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:53.240]   Maybe you may, if I make a little smaller, I'll see more.
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:57.440]   Oh, I mean, am I in theater mode?
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:41:58.440]   Theater mode?
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:41:59.440]   Yeah.
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:00.440]   How do I get out of theater mode?
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:02.800]   I've heard a bunch of video to tell you how to do video.
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:05.920]   I need a video on how to get out of theater mode.
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:08.360]   I'll cover to the bottom right of the video.
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:10.360]   The button at the bottom of the video.
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:11.360]   There you go.
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:15.760]   Man, my mini player theater mode, full screen.
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:16.760]   That's theater mode.
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:17.760]   Wow.
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:20.880]   I don't get any recommendations.
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:23.240]   Because I'm happy watching this video.
[01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:24.640]   They know.
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:25.640]   About Sedoku.
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:27.680]   You're a model good eye.
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:28.680]   Actually, this is...
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:29.920]   I'm not kidding.
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:32.560]   This is my recommendation for the week.
[01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:36.320]   The cracking the cryptic channel.
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:37.920]   And I'm not alone.
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:39.760]   372,000 people agree.
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:40.760]   That's awesome.
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:42.920]   It's the best place for Sedoku videos.
[01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:43.920]   Oh, geez.
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:44.920]   [laughter]
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:47.680]   It's very soothing.
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:51.960]   If you didn't want to be alone in your house, you could have a thing in the background.
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:56.680]   I don't think we were getting Sedoku shaming here.
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:42:59.800]   I want to audit of your suitcase to Hawaii.
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:02.200]   How about your Sedoku?
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:03.200]   I don't need a book.
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:05.320]   I've got the crafting the cricket.
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:11.360]   I mean, the cracking the cryptic app, which has some excellent Sedoku.
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:14.720]   I wrote a Sedoku solving program, you know.
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:15.720]   Oh, boy.
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:16.720]   Tell us more.
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:19.720]   What is your local DU?
[01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:23.120]   What scripting language did you use?
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:25.840]   I wrote it in racket.
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:27.480]   It's not a scripting language.
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:35.680]   But it's a backdoor crazy that was the book with Shabib Nunch.
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:36.680]   There's nothing wrong.
[01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:37.680]   Sedoku is mathematics.
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:38.680]   It's good.
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:39.680]   It's good for your brain.
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:40.680]   It's good for you.
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:41.680]   Cool.
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:42.680]   Yeah, it's like you're just not good at it.
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:44.680]   No, it's fun.
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:54.360]   What the hell was that?
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:56.360]   What was that?
[01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:57.360]   Is he going to be a waffle?
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:43:59.240]   Is your stomach talking to you?
[01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:01.480]   No, it's a dog.
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:02.480]   It's not me.
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:04.480]   It's kind of like a sleep.
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:05.480]   Oh, he's dreaming.
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:06.480]   Oh, he's snoring.
[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:07.480]   He's dreaming.
[01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:10.480]   He's chasing something in his dreams.
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:14.560]   If you had a little camera, I'd have you move it so we could see, but you can't.
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:15.920]   That's so cute.
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:16.920]   He hasn't.
[01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:18.280]   You didn't remove his vocal cords or anything.
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:19.800]   He can bark normally, right?
[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:20.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:22.360]   He can definitely bark normally.
[01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:23.560]   But he's just in his dreams.
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:25.720]   He barks like a dream.
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:27.760]   Now he sounds like a small dog when he's not.
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:33.400]   I do have a close up picture provided by Matthew in our Discord chat.
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:34.400]   Yeah.
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:35.400]   Yeah.
[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:37.400]   Yeah.
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:40.960]   Add about another 90 pounds to that dog.
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:43.800]   And you have Kylo.
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:45.320]   I feel so.
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:48.080]   He's dreaming of biting Rand Paul, says C.I.
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:49.080]   One of the chaperone.
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:51.000]   He got him worked up.
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:54.280]   That's why I sound like.
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:58.680]   So I'm glad you're back because we can now do the official introduction in three part
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:00.080]   harmony for Mr.
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:01.240]   Justice Harmony is thinking of my name.
[01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:02.920]   Justice Harmony for Jeff Jarvis.
[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:08.160]   He is ladies and gentlemen, the Leonard Taill Professor for journalistic innovation at the
[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:09.160]   Granny.
[01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:10.160]   Granny.
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:11.160]   Granny.
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:12.160]   Granny.
[01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:13.160]   You are.
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:14.160]   Whoa.
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:15.160]   Graduates.
[01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:17.800]   School of Journalism at City University.
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:18.800]   Oh.
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:19.800]   Look who's appeared.
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:21.800]   Stacey, look at that.
[01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:23.800]   He's like beating the guy.
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:24.800]   He's like beating you.
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:27.040]   She didn't know this.
[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:28.440]   It's like beating you.
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:30.440]   What is happening?
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:31.440]   We've summoned you.
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:39.320]   We've summoned Craig Newmark to join us.
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:41.600]   That was a little weird, wasn't it?
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:42.600]   Wow.
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:44.600]   Excellent placement.
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:46.840]   Hi, Craig in the sky.
[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:47.840]   Hi, Craig.
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:48.840]   That's good stuff.
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:51.160]   It's like the great and powerful Oz.
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:52.160]   Holy.
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:55.320]   What's in discord while you're saying it?
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:56.320]   Poof.
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:46:00.120]   This is my new idea of surveillance.
[01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:02.120]   I love it.
[01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:04.120]   It's Craig Newmark.
[01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:05.120]   I don't have an eye.
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:06.120]   The whole camera's up.
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:07.120]   I in the sky.
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:08.120]   At least he's up front about it.
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:09.960]   I love it.
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:15.800]   Let's actually widen the shot and bring Craig down from his perch in the pigeon cam.
[01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:19.320]   This just wasn't a brilliant job.
[01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:22.120]   You have named that position.
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:24.120]   It's the pigeon.
[01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:26.560]   The pigeon cam.
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:33.280]   Craig is of course the Craig of Craigslist, but lately has been a great philanthropist.
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:37.120]   And among other philanthropies, the Graduate School of Journalism at the City University
[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:38.120]   of New York.
[01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:39.120]   That's why we sing your precious.
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:40.760]   You want Graduate School of Journalism.
[01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:41.760]   We sing it every week.
[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:42.760]   Every week.
[01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:43.760]   Hi, Craig.
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:47.160]   Hey, it's my pleasure to be here.
[01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:51.440]   I really do listen to the show fairly religiously.
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:55.480]   I am very much looking forward to the moral panic.
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:58.480]   There you go.
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:01.360]   Oh, there it is.
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:03.160]   And it's put up moral panic.
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:05.160]   I triggered it.
[01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:09.360]   Craig, it's funny because we...
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:10.360]   It's not water.
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:12.600]   We invoke you all the time.
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:13.600]   What was it?
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:14.600]   Not water.
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:16.960]   It may not be water.
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:19.360]   Oh, Inquirer and Mayans got a no.
[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:22.080]   So after 5 p.m. and you're New York, right?
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:23.840]   Yeah, it's okay.
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:25.320]   Pigeon milk.
[01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:30.320]   I am in New York now in pretty much our new home.
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:33.880]   New York as it turns out is much better for my health.
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:34.880]   Really?
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:35.880]   It's...
[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:36.880]   The bagels.
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:43.960]   Well, mostly I eat less badly.
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:49.120]   In San Francisco, I would tend to fill up a refrigerator for the day, but I have little
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:50.120]   discipline.
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:52.280]   I practice the seafood diet.
[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:55.680]   And that's not good to lose weight.
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:48:02.840]   In New York, I get a little food, but if I want more food, I have to decide if it's
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:08.240]   worth putting it on pants.
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:12.360]   So you're on the no pants diet is actually the idea.
[01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:17.000]   Whatever substitute for self discipline works, I'll do.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.840]   I can't go out because I don't have any pants.
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:21.320]   No pants diet.
[01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:22.320]   So you're in...
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:23.320]   Are you in Manhattan?
[01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:26.880]   Yes, we're pretty much in the village.
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:27.880]   Oh, nice.
[01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:32.240]   Even in the window, you see a little bit of a bird feeder.
[01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:37.360]   Pigeons happen sporadically trying to get into it and fighting among themselves.
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:39.040]   I saw them earlier, actually.
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:40.760]   Now, want to see some pigeon action?
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:41.760]   Yeah.
[01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:43.760]   Are there any other birds in New York?
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:48.880]   I mean, I live there, but I never saw anything else.
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:50.720]   The dust.
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:58.560]   There are doves and we have the occasional sparrow, cardinal, tufted tip mouse and a
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:00.480]   few others like that.
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:04.080]   Craig, are you a bird watcher?
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:05.480]   Pretty half-assed.
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:07.320]   We put out food and water.
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:11.200]   If the birds decide to visit us, that's good.
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:13.520]   San Francisco, a lot more variety.
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:16.640]   We've seen a lot of the wild parrots.
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:17.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:18.640]   That's cool.
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:19.640]   Nice.
[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:20.640]   Craig's a bird lover.
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:21.640]   Bird lover.
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:22.640]   Yes.
[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:27.560]   We should note that Craig, today, just before, announced, hold on, where is it here, Craig?
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:29.160]   The whole news philanthropy.
[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:32.000]   Pigeon philanthropy.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.000]   Yeah.
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.000]   What is that?
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:35.000]   What is that?
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.000]   What is that?
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:41.160]   So Craig gave a grant to...
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:43.840]   Paloma C is on his hand, Craig.
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:44.840]   Yeah.
[01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:46.680]   Una Paloma Blanca.
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:49.040]   Paloma's a dove, yeah?
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:52.880]   You continue pigeon and dove rescue work for pigeon rescue.org.
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:53.880]   Aww.
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:54.880]   Wow.
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:55.880]   Yeah.
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:59.440]   I figure there are successor species.
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:01.960]   I should suck up to them.
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:05.320]   Do you also invest in robots?
[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:07.960]   I know.
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:09.280]   I hedge my bets.
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:12.280]   I also have welcome dara, machine overlords.
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:13.280]   Nice.
[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:14.280]   Nice.
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:16.000]   So that's really...
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.200]   This is kind of what you do now day in day out.
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:23.320]   You don't run daily, the daily operation at Craig's Lister do you?
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:27.800]   Well, I gave that job up in the year 2000.
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:28.800]   Wow.
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:35.760]   Because people help me understand that as a manager, I suck.
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:44.840]   I've retired a few years ago, particularly considering that I'm just short of 70 now.
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:45.840]   What?
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:46.840]   You don't look at mine.
[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:47.840]   You don't look that old.
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:48.840]   You're not the dude.
[01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:50.440]   I'm not blowing smoke.
[01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:51.840]   I would never have thought that.
[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:54.040]   No, you're not that close, Craig.
[01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:55.040]   I'm not gonna work.
[01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:59.440]   I'll be 69 soon, but I need to desensitize my seat.
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:01.680]   Yeah, you're getting used to it is what you're doing.
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:02.680]   Yeah.
[01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:03.680]   I know.
[01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:04.680]   One year old and I know.
[01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:09.400]   I'm 74 and I do the same thing with 65.
[01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:10.400]   Yeah.
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:12.600]   I've been preparing myself for that for years.
[01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:13.600]   It's not easy.
[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:14.600]   It's unbelievable.
[01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:20.800]   Make sure you sign up for the appropriate parts of Medicare.
[01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:21.800]   I did.
[01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:22.800]   I did.
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:23.800]   Very good.
[01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:24.800]   Because there's a penalty if you don't.
[01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:28.520]   I was telling the crew I did that yesterday, which is...
[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:29.520]   Wow.
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:30.520]   Yeah.
[01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:35.960]   So you're full-time in philanthropy then, basically.
[01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:37.680]   Yeah.
[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:44.280]   And you have done a lot of things, but it seems somewhat of a focus in journalism.
[01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:50.320]   Well, right now from my point of view, and my background is computer science is somewhat
[01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:51.320]   abstract.
[01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:55.480]   I'm looking at information warfare in different forms.
[01:51:55.480 --> 01:52:02.760]   The big priorities these days are helping with cybersecurity, fighting disinformation,
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:09.880]   or as the cool kids call it, influence operations, and also countering harassment, first focusing
[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:14.320]   on the worst of it, which is directed against women journalists.
[01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:20.720]   There's other areas, including helping vets, women in tech, and as you've seen, pigeon
[01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:21.720]   rescue.
[01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:22.720]   Wow.
[01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:25.280]   By the way, here is the site, Pylomacy.
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:30.160]   It's pigeon diplomacy@pigeonrescue.org.
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:34.280]   While you're at it, you will Craig Newmark and Pigeons, and there are some great pictures.
[01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:35.280]   You'll see.
[01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:38.400]   Craig has upposts and personal with pigeons.
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:41.120]   I don't know if I would do that.
[01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:42.120]   Yeah.
[01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:46.480]   I mean, some people think of them as flying rats, but I guess Craig, you're an open-minded
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:47.480]   fellow.
[01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:51.520]   Well, those were stunt pigeons.
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:53.440]   Generally good.
[01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:54.920]   Good.
[01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:58.440]   As it turns out, pigeon pants is a thing.
[01:52:58.440 --> 01:53:00.360]   They're diapers.
[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:08.840]   And you want the pigeon to be wearing the diaper before it flies onto your shoulder to cool
[01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:09.840]   lovingly.
[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:12.200]   I'm wearing that part of it.
[01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:15.400]   I'm 100% yeah.
[01:53:15.400 --> 01:53:17.200]   Note to self.
[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:21.240]   I'm just glad you explained that the diapers were for the pigeons.
[01:53:21.240 --> 01:53:24.320]   I was unclear at the beginning and now I understand.
[01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:26.120]   Oh, would you get to a certain age?
[01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:27.120]   A little bit better.
[01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:28.120]   A little bit better.
[01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:29.560]   What are you talking about?
[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:32.560]   I'd rather call them pigeon pants than depends.
[01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:34.200]   I like this.
[01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:37.760]   We know how much Ant-Pro loves TikTok musicals, and I'm sure that's why.
[01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:40.120]   Put this on your job for him.
[01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:41.120]   You kidding me?
[01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:42.120]   No.
[01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:47.960]   So, when I say I could be brown, I could be blue, I could be violet sky, I could be hurtful,
[01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:51.320]   I could be purple, I could be anything you like.
[01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:52.320]   What comes to mind?
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:53.320]   Nothing.
[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:55.720]   Where's it of eyes?
[01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:56.720]   Nothing.
[01:53:56.720 --> 01:53:57.720]   It's the grace.
[01:53:57.720 --> 01:53:58.720]   I know whites.
[01:53:58.720 --> 01:53:59.720]   I could be blue, I could be violet.
[01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:00.720]   Is it grace Kelly?
[01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:02.760]   Yeah, I could be.
[01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:03.760]   Is this from a movie?
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:04.760]   A grace Kelly movie?
[01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:05.760]   I don't know where it's from.
[01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:07.560]   I just know it's all over Twitter.
[01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:09.800]   Is it the end-hole or something other?
[01:54:09.800 --> 01:54:10.800]   It sounds like yeah.
[01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:11.800]   People do.
[01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:13.200]   They record.
[01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:17.440]   One person can record all the parts or two people can record all the parts.
[01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:20.800]   And so, it's quite popular.
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:24.400]   You can go down below the one you're going to show and show why it's popular.
[01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:25.400]   I'll show you.
[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:26.400]   I'll show the girls.
[01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:27.400]   Collaborative.
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:28.400]   This is the key.
[01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:29.480]   Yeah, here's some girls.
[01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:31.880]   This is called the grace Kelly singing challenge.
[01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:37.360]   I could be blue, I could be violet sky, I could be hurtful, I could be purple, I could
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:38.920]   be anything you like.
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:43.920]   I could be brown, I could be blue, I could be violet sky, I could be hurtful, I could
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:45.720]   be purple, I could be anything you like.
[01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:46.720]   It's like a round.
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:49.400]   I could be brown, I could be blue, I could be violet sky.
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:51.600]   But it can just be one person singing.
[01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:52.600]   I like it though.
[01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:53.600]   I like it though.
[01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:56.000]   They have this in a DAGUM mobile app.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:57.000]   It's cool.
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:58.000]   I know.
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:54:59.000]   Isn't that great?
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:00.000]   I have to say I'm a TikTok fan.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:05.000]   My son now has 200,000 plus followers and millions of views on every video.
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:06.760]   So I'm a believer.
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:07.760]   So anyway, the reason-
[01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:08.760]   I was sucker for these.
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:10.440]   They're all pretty to listen to.
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:11.440]   I love them.
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:12.680]   I love this one.
[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:16.040]   So apparently I didn't know this, but Ryan Reynolds, who is a first.
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:17.280]   Oh yeah, this happened yesterday.
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:18.760]   The owner of Mitten Mobile.
[01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:20.880]   Don't give away the surprise.
[01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:27.320]   And Will Ferrell are working together in a movie called A Christmas Carol.
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:30.360]   And Ryan Reynolds decided, you know, as long as he's got nothing to do, because this
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:35.040]   is the problem, frankly, being on a movie set, you got a lot of free time in between
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:36.040]   takes.
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:37.760]   So he thought he'd try it himself.
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:38.760]   Let's-
[01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:43.280]   I could be brown, I could be blue, I could be violet sky, I could be hurtful, I could be
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:45.640]   purple, I could be anything you like.
[01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:50.640]   I could be brown, I could be blue, I could be violet sky, I could be hurtful, I could
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:51.640]   be purple.
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:52.640]   You layer it on.
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:53.640]   No, I ran.
[01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:54.640]   Like an editor.
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:57.640]   I could be blue, I could be violet sky, I could be hurtful.
[01:55:57.640 --> 01:55:58.640]   He's pretty good.
[01:55:58.640 --> 01:55:59.640]   He's a good singer.
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:05.640]   I could be brown, I could be blue, I could be violet sky, I could be hurtful, I could
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:07.640]   be purple, I could be anything you like.
[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:09.640]   I could be brown, I could be blue.
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:12.640]   And Will Ferrell walks in and does the hide part for me.
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:15.640]   I could be purple, I could be anything you like.
[01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:19.640]   I could be brown, I could be blue, I could be violet sky, I could be hurtful.
[01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:21.640]   That's pretty damn good.
[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:23.360]   That's really freaking good.
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:24.360]   I hope this-
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:25.360]   That's great.
[01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:26.360]   This girl is a musical.
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:27.360]   That's really freaking good.
[01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:29.640]   Apparently, this is a musical, so I guess they can both sing.
[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:31.640]   Oh, I'm just gonna start liking musicals.
[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:32.640]   That would be no.
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:33.640]   No.
[01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:34.640]   Negative sir.
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:35.640]   No.
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:38.240]   That was good though.
[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:42.560]   I give credit where credit is due that to be able to do this inside of a mobile app is
[01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:44.560]   we're gonna make him a Tiktok or sooner or later.
[01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:51.880]   That's why Tiktok is so amazing because it enables that kind of collaboration and remixing
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:56.560]   and it's a new level of content creation.
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:03.600]   So wait, I've got a better for you and I will say, no, well, I was gonna say because
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:08.880]   I thought of Ant this week actually, I realized I finally learned how to do makeup.
[01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:12.000]   And everyone was like, oh, just watch a YouTube tutorial.
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:16.320]   I was just gonna say, Stacy, you look really good today.
[01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:17.720]   Oh, thank you.
[01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:21.160]   I don't have contour, but I finally learned how to do contour.
[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:23.560]   I was just gonna say, I didn't wanna say anything.
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:24.560]   Little late.
[01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:28.840]   No, I noticed right away, I wanted to be, you know, because I know people, you don't
[01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:34.360]   say, nobody likes it personal, but given that you've raised this point, whatever you're
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:35.760]   doing, it's working.
[01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:38.680]   Well, I had an event earlier, so that's-
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:39.680]   Oh, okay.
[01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:46.400]   But YouTube gave people infinite time so their makeup tutorials were killer.
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:49.240]   I was like, I do not watch someone for 10 minutes.
[01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:53.040]   But for like a minute, people can get everything I need.
[01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:54.040]   That's what's good about TikTok.
[01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:55.040]   Yeah.
[01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:56.040]   Yeah, I'm like, screw YouTube.
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:57:57.040]   TikTok's where it's at.
[01:57:57.040 --> 01:58:00.120]   Well, and as we mentioned last week, TikTok has more viewing now.
[01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:05.280]   More view, people spend more time watching TikToks than they do YouTube videos, and that's
[01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:06.280]   probably why.
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:07.920]   Sure, detention span.
[01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:12.000]   I talked to my son a lot about this because he's really become the TikTok master.
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:17.840]   He's now my teacher on TikTok, quarter of a million followers and growing fast.
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:23.160]   You can go up to three minutes, but he's found that it's better if they're shorter.
[01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:28.320]   So by the way, today he posted a video today, 4.6 million views so far.
[01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:31.360]   This one, this one we showed, I thought we showed this one last week.
[01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:33.040]   I would like to eat that.
[01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:38.320]   He's one of the things he does is he's big on side effects.
[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:39.720]   The sound effects.
[01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:40.720]   Natural sound.
[01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:43.160]   Holy FASMR, whatever you want to call it.
[01:58:43.160 --> 01:58:44.160]   He's the master.
[01:58:44.160 --> 01:58:48.520]   The other thing he does, and I talked about this, is it's not clear when it's looping.
[01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:53.400]   So people watch it over and over and over again because they've not sure he got to the end.
[01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:55.040]   He's like a high quality gift.
[01:58:55.040 --> 01:58:57.000]   He does that very consciously.
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.120]   How long does it take you to edit?
[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:00.600]   Half a day.
[01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:04.120]   So here's his most recent.
[01:59:04.120 --> 01:59:06.120]   This is a duck sandwich.
[01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:09.320]   It's pretty good.
[01:59:09.320 --> 01:59:10.800]   Nice choice of music for this one.
[01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:11.920]   I know, I told him that.
[01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:14.920]   I said he gets paid off.
[01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:17.280]   I did what the onions.
[01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:20.320]   Although I've heard it, I think a couple times on some of my videos, so maybe it's
[01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:21.320]   too tricky to read me on the end.
[01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:25.400]   I asked him how he figured out what music places does this spotify a lot and try to
[01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:28.120]   find something that works with the thing.
[01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:30.320]   Plus it's the real sound too.
[01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:33.400]   The real sound is what's key.
[01:59:33.400 --> 01:59:39.120]   So yeah, eight million views, seven and a half million views, three and a half.
[01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:42.360]   So I was asking you before and we got interrupted ourselves.
[01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:45.280]   How do you turn that into a living?
[01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:47.280]   I keep asking that.
[01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:48.280]   I saw that.
[01:59:48.280 --> 01:59:55.120]   Try not to be that dead because you know, when I was a, well, when his mom and I got
[01:59:55.120 --> 01:59:58.640]   married, his mom's brother said, "Don't marry a DJ, those guys."
[01:59:58.640 --> 02:00:03.520]   They're not going anywhere.
[02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:06.280]   Just a subtle nudge.
[02:00:06.280 --> 02:00:07.280]   But that's true.
[02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:08.800]   And I realized it was doing the same thing with him.
[02:00:08.800 --> 02:00:10.280]   Oh, come on.
[02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:11.760]   That's not real media.
[02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:12.760]   But it is real media.
[02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:14.480]   This is modern media.
[02:00:14.480 --> 02:00:16.680]   He could get invited to the Met Gala next year.
[02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:18.440]   I wouldn't be sure if I did.
[02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:19.440]   At all.
[02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:24.720]   And I hope he wears that sweatshirt and sunglasses and the cheesy porn stash, which all of which
[02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:26.920]   we try to discourage him from wearing.
[02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:31.240]   My mom, 88 year old mom says, "Don't wear a hat, Henry.
[02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:33.040]   You're so cute.
[02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:35.080]   Why are you wearing a hat?"
[02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:38.280]   But I just tell her, "Mom, it's a different generation."
[02:00:38.280 --> 02:00:39.280]   You know?
[02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:40.280]   Yes.
[02:00:40.280 --> 02:00:41.280]   Yeah.
[02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:42.680]   But I'm, you know, we worked out this morning together.
[02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:43.840]   I'm always querying him.
[02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:45.160]   You know, what's, so what are you learning?
[02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:50.640]   And he's really paying close attention to the feedback that he gets, both from comments
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:56.320]   but also views, and is tuning it slowly closer and closer to, and you can see it makes a
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:57.320]   difference.
[02:00:57.320 --> 02:00:58.320]   Yes.
[02:00:58.320 --> 02:00:59.320]   It really does make...
[02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:01.320]   What kind of metrics do they give them besides just views?
[02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:02.320]   I'll ask him.
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:03.320]   I don't know.
[02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:04.880]   Oh, so you asked how do you make money?
[02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:07.480]   So there's a couple ways to make money.
[02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:09.600]   TikTok ads are not interstitial.
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:11.400]   They're not in your video, right?
[02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:15.600]   So unlike YouTube, you don't have pre-roll, post-roll, mid-roll.
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:17.440]   So there's nothing a tie to your video.
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:20.200]   So you don't get any of that ad revenue.
[02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:21.200]   You know, it's like Instagram.
[02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:23.280]   It's every few videos.
[02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:24.280]   There's an ad.
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:28.680]   Now, I see a lot more big brands on TikTok, so I obviously TikTok is doing suddenly very,
[02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:31.080]   very, very well.
[02:01:31.080 --> 02:01:35.840]   But they do have a hundred million-dollar creators fund, so that gets parceled out.
[02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:39.440]   But you know, he's got four million views, maybe 600 bucks.
[02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:42.120]   So it's not a big one.
[02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:43.120]   So what most...
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:44.360]   That's not like YouTube money.
[02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:48.880]   No, yeah, but what TikTok does, because they know they're not sharing revenue with you,
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:50.680]   they allow you to have ads.
[02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:52.920]   So you can sell your own ads in there.
[02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:59.720]   And the CPMs are something like five bucks, which if you have 7 million views is $7,000.
[02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:00.720]   Nice.
[02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:01.720]   Or is that right?
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:04.200]   No, it's $30,000.
[02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:06.960]   I don't know.
[02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:08.200]   Five dollars per thousand.
[02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:09.200]   Chat room!
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:10.880]   Seven million is $7,000.
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:12.560]   $35,000.
[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:13.560]   That's a lot of money.
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:14.560]   Is that right?
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:15.800]   Could that be right?
[02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:17.200]   $35,000.
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:19.400]   So let's go and save us, please.
[02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:20.400]   It's a lot of money.
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:21.400]   They see it.
[02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:22.400]   Can you do it?
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:23.400]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:27.360]   I was signing up for the Pixel Super Fans Club, because I'm like, we're going to talk
[02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:28.840]   about Google eventually.
[02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:29.840]   Hold on.
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:32.120]   I'm sorry, math.
[02:02:32.120 --> 02:02:38.360]   So Scooter actually saying that the US TikTok creator fund is actually now, they plan to
[02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:44.360]   spend 200 million over the next 12 months, August to August 2020 to 2021.
[02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:47.520]   And we'll be upwards of a billion in the next three years.
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:50.440]   And more than double that globally, they have to, because otherwise creators, that's
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:51.720]   what killed Vine.
[02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:55.280]   You got to share that money back or creators go, yeah, we'll go somewhere else.
[02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:58.520]   And he told me YouTube shorts is doing this too.
[02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:03.040]   So, nevertheless, is he cross posting it to anywhere other than that?
[02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:04.520]   Yeah, he puts it on Instagram as well.
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:06.200]   And I told him, do YouTube shorts?
[02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:07.200]   Why not?
[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:08.200]   What's wrong?
[02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:09.200]   Why not?
[02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:10.200]   Why not?
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:11.520]   No, I don't know if he's going to, why not?
[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:14.680]   But he, the next step for him would be going out and selling ads.
[02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:15.680]   Wow.
[02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:21.560]   Or signing a deal with like having a knife company or a chopping block company or
[02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:22.560]   pan company.
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:25.200]   He's going to be Sir LaTabla.
[02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:26.200]   Exactly.
[02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:27.360]   And he just goes into cooking.
[02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:28.360]   Exactly.
[02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:34.720]   He, he's going to be a guest poster on the, um, taste made, uh, Instagram this week.
[02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:35.720]   All right.
[02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:36.720]   Taste made's big.
[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:37.720]   That's a big instinct.
[02:03:37.720 --> 02:03:38.720]   Yeah.
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:39.720]   That's branding there.
[02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:40.720]   Yeah.
[02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:42.360]   So I think, I, you know, next year we'll see what we, what I've been saying about my
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:43.360]   son.
[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:44.360]   Yeah.
[02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:45.640]   Don't be a TikTok star.
[02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:46.720]   They don't make any money.
[02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:48.200]   I might be wrong.
[02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:50.240]   I think, I think it's, it's not influencers.
[02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:51.520]   He's a content creator.
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:57.480]   And actually my feeling is even if he doesn't make money on TikTok, he's the skills he's
[02:03:57.480 --> 02:04:01.640]   getting are useful and we'll get him, you know, plenty of things.
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:07.800]   I can say about TikTok is the way it puts constraints on the content creator.
[02:04:07.800 --> 02:04:09.280]   Um, it's good.
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:10.280]   Okay.
[02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:15.680]   I need to create content that is 60 seconds long that is going to make people want to
[02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:20.280]   stop to click on it first of all and then make them want to watch it all the way through
[02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:24.320]   for 60 seconds and then make them want to say, Hey, did you see this?
[02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:25.920]   Let me show this to you.
[02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:29.800]   That's this pretty damn challenging and not everybody can do that.
[02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:30.800]   Yeah.
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:32.360]   It's I am big pen temperature.
[02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:33.360]   It is.
[02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:34.360]   Yeah.
[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:35.360]   Yeah.
[02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:37.200]   It is the business of poetry and art that constraints me here.
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:38.200]   Yeah.
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:39.200]   Yeah.
[02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:40.200]   So true.
[02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:43.520]   And it also means this is, this is true of YouTube and Twitter and everything else.
[02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:47.280]   If you're going to be a content creator, you have to work your ass off.
[02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:48.880]   You have to post every day.
[02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:50.800]   You cannot stop.
[02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:52.360]   It's a content machine.
[02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:53.360]   Go ahead.
[02:04:53.360 --> 02:04:54.360]   I'm sorry, Stacy.
[02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:58.400]   No, I was just going to say, Jeff, how does this relate back to Gutenberg?
[02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:00.400]   Wait a minute.
[02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:01.400]   Give me time.
[02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:02.400]   Give me time.
[02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:03.400]   You asked.
[02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:10.040]   I'm actually to one.
[02:05:10.040 --> 02:05:14.960]   Shakespeare found that verse sold better than Rose.
[02:05:14.960 --> 02:05:15.960]   Interesting.
[02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:22.080]   So Shakespeare was the first major, the first playwright who ended a major playwright who
[02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:25.440]   ended up with a real market in printed plays.
[02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:33.640]   So around the same time that Montaigne invented the essay and Cervantes, the modern novel,
[02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:39.680]   and a guy named Johann Corollus, the newspaper, all around 1600, Shakespeare proved the market
[02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:42.320]   for printed plays since you asked.
[02:05:42.320 --> 02:05:45.760]   If you don't mind, I'd like to take us back to the 21st century.
[02:05:45.760 --> 02:05:46.760]   Yes.
[02:05:46.760 --> 02:05:48.760]   I'm just teasing.
[02:05:48.760 --> 02:05:51.720]   I could go on.
[02:05:51.720 --> 02:05:54.160]   I love Shakespeare.
[02:05:54.160 --> 02:06:03.880]   Today, Amazon announced in limited edition $229.99 Echo Studio featuring Billy Eilish's
[02:06:03.880 --> 02:06:05.720]   cover art for happier than ever.
[02:06:05.720 --> 02:06:06.720]   Oh, gosh.
[02:06:06.720 --> 02:06:07.720]   Cheers.
[02:06:07.720 --> 02:06:12.720]   Who the hell wants that?
[02:06:12.720 --> 02:06:13.720]   All right.
[02:06:13.720 --> 02:06:14.720]   You want to see it?
[02:06:14.720 --> 02:06:21.360]   What it looks like you can have an emo teenager, mooning away on your Echo device.
[02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:25.440]   I guess if you're a late fan of Billy Eilish.
[02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:27.600]   It just seems so niche.
[02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:30.040]   I guess it's just a cover print job.
[02:06:30.040 --> 02:06:31.040]   It is.
[02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:32.040]   I don't understand.
[02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:37.680]   I'm curious about the economics of this and why Amazon's doing something like this on
[02:06:37.680 --> 02:06:39.880]   hardware.
[02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:41.840]   Because like...
[02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:44.080]   Well, did they have like a children's Echo?
[02:06:44.080 --> 02:06:45.080]   Remember they had...
[02:06:45.080 --> 02:06:46.080]   They have a children's Echo.
[02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:52.840]   They actually did a line of Echo like smaller $99 speakers that were like the Diane von
[02:06:52.840 --> 02:06:58.640]   Fustberg and two other designers that you could buy with their imagery on their Echoes.
[02:06:58.640 --> 02:06:59.640]   It's only expensive.
[02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:02.640]   Is $230 the normal price for an Echo Studio?
[02:07:02.640 --> 02:07:03.640]   No.
[02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:04.640]   Yes.
[02:07:04.640 --> 02:07:05.640]   That's...
[02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:06.640]   30 bucks more.
[02:07:06.640 --> 02:07:07.640]   They...
[02:07:07.640 --> 02:07:09.480]   This is $30 more, says that line.
[02:07:09.480 --> 02:07:10.800]   Just for Billy Eilish.
[02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:14.360]   You know, I would buy it for the catch factor, frankly.
[02:07:14.360 --> 02:07:18.640]   People I know would come and say, "Why do you have some woman's face on your side?"
[02:07:18.640 --> 02:07:19.640]   Who knows?
[02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:26.760]   Maybe Shutterfly will start to allow us to print out our own photos on an Echo show or
[02:07:26.760 --> 02:07:27.760]   Echo Studio.
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:28.760]   Yeah.
[02:07:28.760 --> 02:07:32.760]   It's clearly for the massive Billy Eilish fan.
[02:07:32.760 --> 02:07:35.200]   There are a lot of Billy Eilish fans out there.
[02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:36.200]   There are.
[02:07:36.200 --> 02:07:37.200]   Definitely they are.
[02:07:37.200 --> 02:07:38.200]   Oh, wait a minute.
[02:07:38.200 --> 02:07:39.200]   Sure.
[02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:40.200]   That's $30.
[02:07:40.200 --> 02:07:41.200]   This is $230.
[02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:42.360]   So yeah, you're right.
[02:07:42.360 --> 02:07:43.360]   30 bucks more.
[02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:44.360]   30 bucks more.
[02:07:44.360 --> 02:07:45.360]   Okay.
[02:07:45.360 --> 02:07:47.600]   It also comes with what?
[02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:49.160]   Four months of Amazon music?
[02:07:49.160 --> 02:07:51.440]   Which does not seem like a smoke and deal to me.
[02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:53.880]   It should come with...
[02:07:53.880 --> 02:07:55.720]   Lots of Billy Eilish music.
[02:07:55.720 --> 02:07:56.720]   It does come with...
[02:07:56.720 --> 02:07:57.720]   No, six...
[02:07:57.720 --> 02:07:58.920]   You get six months of Amazon music unlimited.
[02:07:58.920 --> 02:08:00.840]   Oh, six months.
[02:08:00.840 --> 02:08:04.120]   And you can listen to Happier Than Ever in Spatial Audio.
[02:08:04.120 --> 02:08:07.980]   It's the only thing you can listen to on this device.
[02:08:07.980 --> 02:08:10.980]   And over and over again.
[02:08:10.980 --> 02:08:16.040]   Because you're a big enough fan to have Billy Eilish on your device itself.
[02:08:16.040 --> 02:08:18.520]   So they figure that's probably what you want.
[02:08:18.520 --> 02:08:25.580]   Here's what it would look like on your Billy Eilish desk with your Billy Eilish poster
[02:08:25.580 --> 02:08:27.580]   and your Billy Eilish wallpaper.
[02:08:27.580 --> 02:08:28.580]   It's really funny.
[02:08:28.580 --> 02:08:30.580]   It's a puzzling device.
[02:08:30.580 --> 02:08:32.380]   That's where I put it up.
[02:08:32.380 --> 02:08:33.380]   Because I'm like...
[02:08:33.380 --> 02:08:34.380]   Who is this?
[02:08:34.380 --> 02:08:37.100]   How expensive is it to make?
[02:08:37.100 --> 02:08:38.100]   What is the...
[02:08:38.100 --> 02:08:39.100]   What was the conversation?
[02:08:39.100 --> 02:08:44.500]   If even like, Alexa could be Billy Eilish's voice, that would be cool.
[02:08:44.500 --> 02:08:45.500]   But no, they would have thought that.
[02:08:45.500 --> 02:08:47.620]   Yeah, like that makes sense though, because that's a digital product.
[02:08:47.620 --> 02:08:51.140]   But this is a physical product that's going to sit there forever.
[02:08:51.140 --> 02:08:52.140]   I just...
[02:08:52.140 --> 02:08:53.140]   I thought it was...
[02:08:53.140 --> 02:08:54.140]   I was flummoxed.
[02:08:54.140 --> 02:08:55.140]   Flummox, I tell you.
[02:08:55.140 --> 02:08:56.140]   Speaking of Amazon devices.
[02:08:56.140 --> 02:08:57.140]   Flummoxed.
[02:08:57.140 --> 02:09:00.300]   You probably don't want Alexa whispering to you as the thing.
[02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:02.620]   So you probably don't want Billy Eilish's voice.
[02:09:02.620 --> 02:09:04.620]   She talks about this.
[02:09:04.620 --> 02:09:05.620]   She's very...
[02:09:05.620 --> 02:09:06.620]   She does lots of whispering.
[02:09:06.620 --> 02:09:07.620]   She's not whispering.
[02:09:07.620 --> 02:09:08.620]   Whisper singing.
[02:09:08.620 --> 02:09:09.560]   She says some more.
[02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:15.360]   Also joining us, Jeff Jarvis, who...
[02:09:15.360 --> 02:09:17.900]   We have to do the full introduction here and I've got it.
[02:09:17.900 --> 02:09:18.900]   It's a mouthful.
[02:09:18.900 --> 02:09:20.140]   It's become tradition, you know.
[02:09:20.140 --> 02:09:21.140]   Take a deep breath.
[02:09:21.140 --> 02:09:22.140]   Take a deep breath.
[02:09:22.140 --> 02:09:23.140]   It's a little special today.
[02:09:23.140 --> 02:09:27.300]   The Leonard Tao Professor for journalistic innovation at the...
[02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:41.940]   Oh, right, that's that stage.
[02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:42.940]   Oh, right, that's that stage.

[02:10:15.580 --> 02:10:16.580]   Great, great.
[02:10:16.580 --> 02:10:17.580]   Great, great.
[02:10:17.580 --> 02:10:18.580]   Great, great.

[02:10:22.580 --> 02:10:23.580]   Let us give, let us give credit.
[02:10:23.580 --> 02:10:24.580]   Do we have the credit ready for who to do that?
