[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.960]   cover the latest from the Google verse, which is Google, Facebook, Twitter and anything else we
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:22.720]   want to talk about, including Trader Joe's frozen foods on the line. By the way, the pasta, the reason
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:30.080]   it was out this week, my wife found out, is the pasta actually comes from Italy. They imported
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.200]   from Italy. And so we're waiting. When you go to this story, even when you buy dry pasta,
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.520]   you don't buy American dry pasta. You buy the Italian dry pasta. Well, no, I mean, the whole
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.720]   thing is made in Italy. The whole thing. Italy, it's authentic. Yeah. So you see, hence the Italian.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.680]   You make fun of me. Former TV critic knows his continuity of paper.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.400]   Now TV dinner critic. TV dinner critic, Jeff Jarvis is a Leonard Ta professor for journalistic
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.520]   innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.840]   I wasn't trying to get the first intro. You got it. It's okay.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.760]   Stacy, you're interested. That Stacy Higginbotham.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.080]   She is, of course, the host of Stacy on IoT.com and the IoT podcast with Kevin Tofel.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.280]   Subscribe to her fine newsletter. It's free. There's no reason not to Stacy on IoT.com.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.200]   And there's a little negative. There's no reason not to. There's every reason to.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.160]   But there is no, there is no cost. So that's the reason you might not.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.880]   You know what, y'all? If you like IoT, please sign up for the newsletter.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.920]   If it's not your jam, that's okay. And you know, that's my philosophy always, right?
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.360]   I don't want to make anybody do anything. And you know who stayed quiet during this whole time?
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.640]   She's smart. Smart. And Pruitt. And Pruitt's here. Hands up, talk for you, hands on.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.080]   I don't know about smart, but I am quiet. You have borrowed John Oliver's glowing white chamber
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.200]   for your shot today. It's good. I like it. Just a slight change.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:15.200]   Yeah. He always refers to that on his show last week tonight. So Stacy, I just wanted to say,
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.440]   my tone of voice has been pretty good. What is it today? Yeah? Are you friendly? Are you positive?
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.560]   Yeah, it's really wild. If you turn it on. Well, you've been locked into a studio all by yourself.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:33.040]   So well, I'm talking to people. For instance, for Windows Weekly, it said,
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.120]   "You sounded mostly focused, but so so common skeptical." That's exactly right.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:48.320]   That's exactly right. Here's my data. This is the Amazon Halo Band. And even though it kills
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.200]   the battery, I turn it on. This is pretty, could you have an over the shoulder shot? John, we still do,
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.800]   right? So that's the little gray. You can't see that very well. Only 1% negative,
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.000]   2% extra. That's because you're a radio guy, so you make even insults.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.320]   Yeah, I think it probably doesn't work.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.720]   Around $850 this morning. It doesn't work for you, because you're always sounding happy.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.560]   Even the real delight. I'm surprised how accurate this is. I was sad at $850 this morning. I had two
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.000]   phrases that sounded sad and restrained. Was that after your Pilates? You know what?
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.480]   It was during my Pilates. How did you know that's very good, sad and restrained, mostly going,
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:37.520]   "Oh!" That's over. I found myself surprised because I think of myself as a genuinely pretty
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:44.880]   positive person. I was either neutral to negative most of the time. I remember you were saying that,
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.880]   but I'm mostly neutral too. This weekend is cool because we can do it live too as I'm talking.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.120]   Right now I sound interested, knowledgeable and focused.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.720]   Yeah, when I was showing off my hands exactly how I sound.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.480]   And then if I go like this and prove it, I sound amused, happy and friendly.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:11.120]   So I can't lose. So angry. It's not any Leo. I'm so sad. I'm really, I'm so terrible right now.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.720]   It just says you're a bad actor. Yes, that's right. You suck at acting.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.960]   Isn't that funny that it can, it does it. Oh, now I'm curious, interested in skeptical again.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:29.680]   Isn't it funny? Isn't it interesting? I think this is actually surprisingly accurate, at least for me.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:39.120]   Because it's very positive. I had an invite out for that thing and requested it, but they
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.640]   have an email. I mean, like the email juke. Yeah, me too. Well, they didn't email me. It was
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.480]   when Stacy was talking about it last week. I went to the site and I said, "Oh, yeah, you have four
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:53.120]   days, buy it. $69 bucks. You get six weeks, six months of free service. I don't pay for it after that."
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.600]   But it's interesting. And then of course, it's a fitness band. Yeah, you, I know you wanted to do
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.720]   it for hands-on wellness. I guess you could, you could borrow mine. You want to borrow mine?
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.800]   Sure. All right. All right. I think it's kind of interesting.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.360]   Are you going to use Ants photo? Have you taken the photo yet? And are you going to use Ants photo
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.240]   for your body fat percentage? Oh, I forgot about that. She's on to me.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.320]   You figured out my plan. I would use Ants photo. My body fat percentage too. I'd be like,
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:30.640]   "My body fat percentage is pretty high." Believe it or not, even though it's not, it is. It's like,
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:36.960]   I want to say I'm right at 30% or so. Something like here. I'm at 30%. You can get 30%.
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:44.400]   I don't know what mine is, Leo. I don't want to know. I don't want to know. I have it.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.200]   Like you, Stacey, I'm reluctant because you have to pose in front of the camera.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.000]   But I'm going to do it. I just, I just started wearing it this morning because I had a church.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.720]   Oh, I was like, "Do you have to have a couple stiff drinks before you do it?"
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.440]   Yeah. I know how ugly I am. I don't, it's not going to disappoint me in any way.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:07.520]   He has spent his career with his life as an open book. So I'm spending my career on camera,
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.920]   not naked, but I, you know, he might have... Yeah. Thank God. You're no Jeffrey too.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.160]   I was like, I am an open book, but I was still very confident.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.760]   Yeah, I know. No, I understand. I really do. It's funny because I thought,
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.720]   "Oh, how hard can that be?" And then I started looking at it. I was like,
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.680]   "Because you're taking a picture and it's going to Amazon or not."
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:34.560]   Well, no, no, no. They said you don't, they offer you the choice. Do you want to back up this in
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.640]   the cloud and you can say, "No, keep it on the device." And then they're like,
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.720]   "If something happens to your device, you'll lose this information." You're like, "Exactly."
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.520]   Precisely the point. Exactly what we want.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.720]   Anyway, I think it's interesting. You know, I think a lot of people look at it and say,
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.120]   "Oh, it's just Amazon wants a microphone on you all the time." I don't think that's the case.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:03.360]   No, no, Amazon. So the microphone data from the proton, that actually deletes itself after 24 hours.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.600]   And then none of that data actually goes to Amazon. So none of your utterances that it's
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.600]   picking up on and none of that analysis goes to Amazon according to Amazon.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.360]   I think it's really, I think that's the only reason I got it because I have,
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.960]   look, I have three fitness devices on. I may have a watch.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.520]   And look how fit you are. Yeah, look how much look how it works.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.760]   Look what kind of, and then I have the Aura ring. So I'm going to have plenty of, you know,
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:32.480]   stuff, but, and I have a sleep tracker in my bed so I know my sleep, so I don't really need it.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.240]   But except that one unique thing it does is that tone of voice analysis,
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.800]   which actually I find kind of fascinating using for a few hours.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:46.560]   Well, so I have a friend, my best friend is a therapist and she, we went on a hike the other
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:51.680]   day and she was really intrigued by it. She's, she, because she actually uses little pulse
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.240]   oximeters to measure people's heart rates for part of, do I have couples therapy?
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:56.960]   Oh, interesting.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:02.000]   To like track when people get into kind of, it's not, I'm going to just call it flight or
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.920]   flight response. Right. Like when they get to a point where she knows they can't hear each other,
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:13.280]   then she like has them measure that and calms them down a little bit. And I don't know,
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.960]   she thought this was really interesting. So.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:23.600]   Yeah, I'm fascinated by it. Because I'm fascinated by me and anything that's more me.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.720]   I'm all in. I'm all about that.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:34.240]   I'm fascinated by data about me. Yeah. You know, yeah, and me. You're fascinating about me too.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:43.120]   No, it's, it is. It's a little bit. Here, I'll use a big word, solipsistic, but.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.520]   But that's me.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:53.840]   The former CEO of Google, remember a guy named Eric Schmidt?
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.840]   He's a client to become a citizen of Cyprus.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.440]   And they're delighted to have a course. They are.
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:07.200]   Recode says, in effect, he's buying a passport. He can use the enter the rest.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.480]   Did you find any reference to how much it costs? I couldn't find a reference to that.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.960]   And the story is. If you have to ask, it's too much.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.040]   You can't afford it.
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:20.400]   Let's, let's look into it. Maybe I should just apply.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.280]   Yeah, I wouldn't mind having you. There are about a half dozen programs all around the world,
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:31.040]   where foreigners can effectively purchase citizen rights by skirting residency requirements
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:36.000]   by giving them some money or we call it. Right. And in fact,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.280]   I got it here in the host. You invest 2.0 million euro in property.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.120]   So if you bought a house for a two million house,
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.280]   I was like, first of all, on the water, he's not going to live in any less than two million
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:55.280]   dollars. Right. It's nothing to him. It might be cheaper to go to Saint Kitts or Nevis in the
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:00.160]   Caribbean. I think it's Ann Nevis, not Ornevus. It's an Ann. Not an Or.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:06.640]   The Cyprus program has brought in $8 billion
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:13.200]   since its 2013 bankruptcy. It's been very, and they're 4,000 recipients,
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.320]   mostly Russian in Russian oligarchs.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.280]   Oh, they drive up property values. Might fit those oligarchs.
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:26.960]   The idea, though, really is that you're now, you have an EU passport.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.400]   So I was actually thinking about doing the same thing maybe in Portugal,
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:36.080]   because it would be nice. You don't have to stay wherever you bought that citizenship.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:43.200]   You can move around. I actually, I rounded down. You need to make a two million euro
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:48.640]   investment in real estate plus a hundred thousand euro donation to the government
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.640]   research development fund, plus a hundred thousand dollars to the land development organization.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:13:00.560]   After five years, you can reduce your investment. You can downsize to 500,000 euro.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.840]   But you're saying your property?
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:08.640]   Well, but you still have to have something, you buy a smaller condo.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:18.160]   They've actually the end game is though. The end game is to have a passport that allows you
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:23.360]   access to Europe. So by the way, it wasn't just him. He got it for his wife and his daughter.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:30.720]   That's pricey. So well, come on. He's a billionaire. He's not that pricey.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:36.880]   And so, yeah, I mean, I think there's a couple of reasons you might get it.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.080]   It's interesting that this article appears right after the election.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:45.920]   Yeah. But I wouldn't be surprised if some people weren't saying, well, let's see what happens in
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:51.040]   the election. And I might be moving out of town, which I think is reprehensible.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.680]   What I've heard more so is, at least from the tech side of things, is
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:00.000]   after the election or even before the election is most of tech is just trying to get out of
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.560]   freaking Silicon Valley because of the way California is about taxation.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:11.600]   But this doesn't affect him because he's no longer his own business in California. He's just a rich
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:16.560]   guy. Right. That sounds like a war. What's the big deal with this? You know, but remember Larry
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:24.080]   Page wanted his own island at the end of a keynote? He said, you know, it wouldn't be great if we
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.880]   just had an island with no regulation. That's what we want, the Google island. And that's honestly,
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:35.360]   I don't know a lot of very, very rich people, but I would guess that's kind of like in the back of
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:39.920]   their heads. They may not say it out loud or even think it, but the back of their heads, I just want
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:44.800]   to go somewhere where I could be me. Right. But who's going to work on that island? How are you
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:50.160]   going to treat those people? Of course. I mean, right. It's no, it's a non-starter. I mean, it's
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:58.720]   crazy. But the rich as F. Scott first Gerald once said are not like you and me. No. Clearly not.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:06.160]   Clearly not. So La Vida Golden Visas, I just put the link in the rundown right underneath the story.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:12.160]   Basically packages the deal. Here's the apartment you can buy. Oh, with your visa.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:17.360]   So they're going to skim a little off of that too. Golden Visas.com/cypress.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:24.960]   So God, I have to accept so many things. So look, Cyprus is pretty. It's on the Mediterranean.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:30.880]   I think it is. Yeah. It's EU, English is widely spoken. Self of Turkey. I believe what it said.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:39.680]   It's Cyprus offers the quickest, most assured route to citizenship. Are they war oftentimes?
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:43.600]   Yeah, you know. Well, but you're not there. Isn't it? Okay.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:49.520]   Montenegro's nice. Look, Montenegro's so much less expensive from 350,000 euros.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.600]   That's pretty good. Germany's 360 Portugal. That is your residency. That doesn't get
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:00.080]   you passed. Oh, yeah, you got to get a lot more to get into Portugal. Ireland's a million full
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:08.640]   family residency. No requirement to reside. Minimum stay one day. So this is, this is really,
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:12.240]   you know, it's interesting. Wait a minute, you could do it in the US.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:19.040]   You just have to. It's like an Ireland one million. That's now that's a deal. It's more than the US.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:25.200]   The US is only 900,000 plus an EB five approved investment. And you get your green card.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:34.320]   See, where all these people sit on the border trying to get in just get a $900,000 in your EB
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:39.520]   five and you're set square and away. Granada's cheap. Let's go to Grenada. See, look at that.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.120]   Isn't that pretty? It's in the.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.360]   I don't think it goes to Spain. No, I think it's in.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:52.000]   Look Caribbean, you get visa V. Yeah, I think it's in the Caribbean. Visa free travel to the UK,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:59.280]   the Schengen countries and China. And it's cheap. I think Ireland is the best deal.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:04.480]   I can't believe this business. Golden visas.com. Isn't this amazing? Why do you think Ireland's
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.680]   such a good deal? It's the most expensive, a million euros. No, because what I just like.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:12.640]   I don't like to live in Ireland. He thinks everybody in Ireland talks like this. That's why.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.040]   Oh, hello, Jeff Jarvis. Welcome to our country.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:21.600]   Top of the morning to you. They're not all leprechauns, Jeff. I just got to tell you.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:28.080]   This is an ideal program for high knit worth families seeking residency in Europe.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:34.560]   It'll be particularly attractive to businessmen, entrepreneurs and journalism professors.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:41.120]   Oh, what they're selling is the universities that you get at your kids in a good, good club.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.600]   They see that they should see.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.400]   Laurie, what's your name? Should have just done this instead of spending all that money at USC.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:56.160]   Just get a Irish visa. Irish visa? That feels like slang for something.
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:05.440]   Don't do not look that up. Unurban dictionary. Oh, he got an Irish visa.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:14.240]   Not to mention the Dutch turnaround. Nope, not good. Not good. Google is these are the three
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:21.360]   Google stories. I'm a doable Google is moving to bring high speed network to Africa via experimental
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:31.520]   light beams. Is it just fiber? I mean, fiber optics is experimental light beams.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:37.200]   So it's invisible light beams through the air. The high speed data transition through invisible
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:42.800]   light beams between Tara, it's Project Tara. Tara terminals mounted on high up on existing
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:49.600]   towers or rooftops. Whoa, wait a minute, Stacy. Each link between terminals can transmit 20
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:56.720]   gigabits per second over a distance of 20 kilometers. Wow, without any repeaters. Sorry about my dog.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.880]   That's he's excited. Never. There's no apologies for zoo or dogs.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:06.960]   They've tried already. Trial this in India and Mexico. Now they're looking at
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.480]   beginning in Kenya and then a pan African rollout.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:17.600]   So my eighth grade science project was to try to figure out how to transmit data with light
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:23.840]   through like the air. And I couldn't of course figure it out because I was an eighth grade.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:31.120]   And then I was like, well, how's it with light with light all around?
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:37.520]   What's the science of lasers? But is it lasers? It's invisible light, they say.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.280]   Well, you could have lasers in invisible space. Okay, so all light is a wave, right?
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:47.840]   And that's a great start. That's a great Stacy class start.
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:52.880]   Jeff is a wave and a particle.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:20:01.920]   Okay, yes. But you can use it just I mean you can transmit data over that just like you transfer
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.280]   it over and there's invisible light. There's you know, there's.
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.400]   Explain it to eight's grade Jeff. Would you Stacy?
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.680]   I'm sure. Well, I don't know what's what's what's spectrum.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:17.120]   It's a great and they get that's that's the question.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.360]   Can I be a fifth grader in this conversation?
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.760]   So I won two science fairs in the really.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:28.080]   Fifth and sixth grade that we went to a new school and they said you won science fairs.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:33.040]   This is a perfect class for you was the whole term what adjust science one project.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.080]   I picked a project that I couldn't do anything with stupid.
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:42.480]   That's because it's a project. Dude, you could have just like flashed Morse code.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.560]   I know they have the money.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:45.600]   No, I knew it was in the 40s.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:51.040]   Through to be like working a room with light on. It was dark.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:51.840]   Yeah, but.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:58.240]   I want I really want to understand what they're doing here and this article is not helping me.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:05.600]   The point is because they don't have to dig cables. So in effect, you're using these beams
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:10.480]   instead of cables to connect and it is a line of sight. What is the band?
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.240]   What is absolutely like?
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.480]   The microwave. It may be just microwave.
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:21.680]   Because as you know, Jeff, light is a wave in the particles.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:27.280]   We see I'm thinking like, okay, if it's like already power.
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.400]   All of it like the more wavelength lights or lights we can see they're different colors,
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.560]   right? You know that like red is on one wavelength and blue is on another, right?
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.480]   So that's how we see.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.240]   Why did you say that? So all white is wave is why they call them a wave.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:42.880]   Like is that true?
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.920]   Because I was thinking about them.
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.200]   Oh, that's true.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.560]   Will there be on the final?
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.080]   Okay, I can.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:55.280]   But you can use the you can send data over those and you can what's it called modulate.
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.360]   Yeah, just like a fiber optic cable would do.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.640]   Yeah, but you don't need the cable around it.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.880]   But I don't know. I don't know anything about like the ups and downs of
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:09.040]   because I don't know where they are in terms of invisible light.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:15.120]   So they are from the X project X page like fiber, but without the cables.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:20.720]   Tara uses light to transmit information at super high speeds through the air is a very narrow,
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.960]   invisible, invisible.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.400]   Okay.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.280]   So we don't have a remote.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.040]   So big huge clicker, right?
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.200]   Yeah, it's just outside.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.640]   You did it for eighth grade Jeff.
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.520]   Thank you.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:36.400]   Yes.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.400]   Okay.
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:43.360]   It doesn't give a lot of details about the spectrum or the frequency or any of that.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.720]   But yeah, it's going to be outside of the visible spectrum.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.800]   And it's going to modulate it just like.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:49.360]   Well, how much does it cost?
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:53.360]   Because when you're shooting something like that, that could be pretty energy intensive.
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.400]   Oh, right.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.360]   Interesting.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.480]   Well, but that's a beauty of lasers because they're so coherent.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.320]   Doesn't have to be a huge amount of.
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.040]   You're not trying to burn holes in the other guy.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.120]   You're setting light.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.240]   How bad do you want this data?
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.760]   Anybody want to join the conversation?
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.360]   Well, if it's lasers, I mean, so when you have microwave,
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:19.040]   the frequency, like things will attenuate it, but like a bird flying through is not going to
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.400]   totally disrupt your signal.
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:20.640]   Right.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.880]   But like if you're using something like a laser,
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.720]   but rain, no, it wouldn't kill anything, but rain, it's not going to be high energy,
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.000]   but rain and, you know, fog and stuff might impact it.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.840]   I mean, anything that could break the beam of light might impact it.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:35.520]   Well, I was thinking not even that in anything as simple as like a leaf falling,
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:39.760]   I think it could break that right as opposed to there's a slightly wider dispersion rate,
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:45.120]   but like with packets, but you know, it'll know the packets lost and it'll figure it out, right?
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.440]   If it's using TCP, it will.
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.000]   Did you arrive?
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.320]   No, no, send it again.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.840]   I bet you they're doing something like that.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.160]   Sure.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:57.120]   Well, that was a fascinating question.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.200]   That was our Google. That was an entirety of Google.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.360]   And now Stacey's thinking, good, the show is over.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.040]   We've finished all of our Google stories.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.640]   I can go have another brownie.
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.600]   I'm going to story that's half Facebook, half Google.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.520]   Go on.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.480]   Do you do Google?
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.120]   Okay.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:15.920]   Facebook and Google have extended their bans on political ads indefinitely.
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.160]   Jeff has something to say about this.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:22.160]   Google plans to review the situation weekly.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.680]   Facebook doesn't say what kind of end date it would be.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:32.400]   I suspect this has something to do with the fact that the result of the election is disputed by
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.120]   the Republicans.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:41.600]   And there's a lot of, obviously, misinformation spreading on social media about this.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.040]   I don't know if they're blocking that though.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:49.360]   But there is a huge problem, which is the next story, which is that we have a
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.880]   giantically important runoff race in Georgia.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.360]   That's right.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.200]   And that's a new annual.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.440]   I asked someone at Twitter, they said, "No, we're not going to be race specific.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.160]   It's a global ban on them."
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.440]   And so I think this is a real problem.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.760]   This is this file that's under, be careful what you wish for.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.240]   Twitter has all these, Facebook has all these awful political ads.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.200]   They should get rid of it.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:11.600]   Well, how?
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.480]   So that's interesting question.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:16.880]   Now you have campaigns that can't afford to advertise as clearly to groups.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.520]   And we're dependent upon TV again.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.320]   Congratulations.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.440]   But no one watches TV.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.960]   That's the problem.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.160]   That's the problem.
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.080]   So a huge amount of money is going to go in TV.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.600]   Well, but two people watch.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:33.520]   So maybe ads aren't the best way to try to win an election.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.080]   Is that possible?
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.680]   It's the one way you could control, though.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.440]   And you've got very little time to do it.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:42.080]   Well, you should do, I mean, look how successful the president's rallies were.
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.400]   That was a very good way to killing people.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:44.880]   Yes.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.240]   Well, they're not dead yet.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.240]   They live long enough.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:53.920]   But I mean, I think we can, OK, COVID aside,
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:59.840]   that certainly galvanized his base and got a lot of votes and got out the vote.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.720]   So there's rallies for that.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.160]   There's other ways to do it.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.120]   Maybe maybe do.
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.320]   You can't do door to door.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.440]   That's how you'd normally do it.
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.640]   So this was the new door to door.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.040]   And now they're.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.080]   That's a good point.
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.640]   That's a good point without door to door canvassing,
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.560]   which by the way, the Trump Organization did do
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.000]   Biden did not do it.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.840]   And you can still still have, I mean, people have shown up at my door.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.280]   They they're wearing a mask.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.160]   They're far apart.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.280]   They stand out there and they shout at you about their candidate.
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.960]   But you're trying to get to the whole state in a very short amount of time.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.720]   This is how long elections should last.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.920]   But it's going to be a six week election from now.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:40.560]   And or six or seven, whatever it is, but it's short.
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:45.600]   And you're going to reach a lot of people and you want to reach them with a targeted message,
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.880]   which is not not awful.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.960]   You can reach young people with a different message than old people.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.520]   That's okay.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.160]   And social media, let you do that.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.520]   And now you now it's cut off.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:58.000]   And so there'll be more need for big money going into big old media.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.800]   And Kelly Loeffler has self funding.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.000]   She's got plenty of money.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.360]   And Reverend Warnock, her opponent is really a grassroots campaign.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.800]   So it probably would disadvantage him more than it would Loeffler, right?
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:11.520]   Exactly.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.960]   That's what's interesting about this.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:13.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:14.560]   Yeah.
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:18.960]   Yeah.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:19.760]   That's really, yeah.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.120]   That's a very good point.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:25.440]   So what is their rationale for continuing the ban on political ads?
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.320]   Well, worth the trouble.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.880]   Life's been better without it.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.160]   I mean, if I were, I get it.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.920]   If I were, then I'd say good.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.280]   Let's keep this going.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.960]   We got crap.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:38.400]   If we didn't factor every political ad, we don't make any money on it.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.680]   Really, it's hardly a lot of thought about it.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:44.480]   It's actually my fault because you asked me, if I were at a dinner party with Mark Zuckerberg,
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.440]   what would I ask him to do?
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.480]   And I said, ban political ads.
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.520]   And obviously he must have enjoyed the meal because he listened.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.080]   So it's my fault.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:52.960]   Take brownies, Joe.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.120]   That's where the brownies went.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:59.440]   So an interesting statistic from Facebook.
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:05.600]   Maybe a little self-serving, but according to Facebook's own posts,
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.560]   what do people actually see on Facebook in the US?
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:13.280]   Only about 6% of it is political content.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.880]   Most of it is just the other stuff.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.640]   Really?
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:19.680]   Cats.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.960]   Cats.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.880]   Does that ring true?
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.240]   I mean, it is Facebook's own--
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:24.720]   Yeah, it does.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.720]   Because people don't really care about politics as much as we think they do.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.920]   This is about what they share.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.920]   This is what they choose to do.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:35.680]   The problem here is Facebook owns the company called CrowdTangle,
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.840]   which the New York Times uses to say,
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.200]   what's the most popular thing on Facebook?
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.960]   Well, the most popular thing on Facebook,
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.360]   as we discussed before, is still small.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.960]   Because nobody sees the same Facebook.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.400]   It's not mass media.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.680]   So mass media looks at it and says,
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.240]   CrowdTangle says, this is the most important story on Facebook.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.040]   And that most important story is nothing.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:56.240]   So what this says is, look at it in the context of the whole.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:56.720]   Right?
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.680]   News as a whole is 4% of content on Facebook.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.240]   Right?
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.160]   Politics as a whole is 6%.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.840]   And I'm sure there's a lot of overlap in those two.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.200]   And then I grab the sort of Facebook.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.160]   Well, it's interesting.
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:06.240]   Of Facebook.
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.600]   Because with Facebook's own numbers,
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:12.640]   the top US pages by engagement are all political.
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.240]   Except for CrowdTangle numbers.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.520]   Except for Jesus daily.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.600]   That's CrowdTangle.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.920]   But then if you actually look at pages by all posts on--
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.440]   Then it's the dono, Rick Lax, Steve Harvey, really?
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.880]   AARP.
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.480]   Why is Steve Harvey?
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:33.680]   30% of US weekly active people were reached by the Steve Harvey page.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.960]   Isn't he the host of "The Handly Food?"
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.760]   But he's a former comedian, but he has--
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:40.480]   He's funny.
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.480]   "Sindicated Radio Show" and all this stuff.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.200]   Oh, he's a radio show.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:43.520]   Okay.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.400]   Who's Rick Lax?
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.920]   I don't know who Rick Lax is.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.880]   He's equally big.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.360]   The dono's number one.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.040]   Well, as it should be.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.000]   Cute animals, man.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:53.760]   Not the dono bird.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.280]   So no, no, no.
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.200]   That's the dono site, which is nothing but cute animals.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.000]   Dono site.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.800]   Oh.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:29:59.120]   Okay.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.560]   Don't you watch the doodle, Leo?
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.640]   Rick Lax is a magician.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.920]   He's a magician, okay.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.680]   See, this isn't so bad, folks.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:10.080]   So the doodle, Rick Lax, and Steve Harvey and AARP are roughly tied.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:15.520]   Then Justin Flom, the president, Tasty, which is recipes.
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.640]   He's not a magician.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.920]   He calls himself a deception expert.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.760]   Oh, he bunks, magicians.
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.640]   No, no, he's a magician.
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.240]   Like, what is it?
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.120]   He's deceiving you.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.920]   Who just died a week ago?
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.800]   Who debunked magicians?
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.400]   Randy, the amazing Randy.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:34.960]   I love Randy.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:35.520]   He's a man.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.400]   Oh, Leo, seriously, do you not watch the doodle?
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.760]   No, at least it is.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.720]   Every once in a while, Lisa will lean over, saying,
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.240]   "I know you hate these, but look."
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.200]   And then I have to watch some cute video.
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.480]   Oh, they're really cute.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.280]   Never heard of it.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.080]   But you haven't?
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:52.880]   Well, we got to show you.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:53.360]   We got to show.
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:53.920]   We got to show.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.280]   We're going to change his life here.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:55.920]   We're going to be with you.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:56.720]   We're going to show you.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.840]   You can follow him on Twitter.
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.760]   You can follow him on Instagram.
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.040]   It's the dodo.com.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:01.760]   That's such a big one.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.280]   Here's the daily dodo.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:08.000]   Dog fakes a limp every time he sees the stairs.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.280]   Okay.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:13.600]   I'm sure I've seen some stuff like this pop up in my stream somewhere,
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.200]   but I don't actively follow this.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.760]   Do I see Pino, the pup who is a maze master?
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:18.400]   Yeah.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.280]   Sure you do.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.440]   He's a corgi.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:22.320]   He's a corgi.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.120]   He's going to go.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.880]   Look at him go through the
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:28.640]   Gatorade bottles without knocking a single one over.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:31.760]   If he could play for Clemson, you'd be all over him, man.
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.280]   Oh, look at that.
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:33.680]   Look at that.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.040]   Look at that.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:35.920]   Hey, there's nothing here.
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:36.240]   Hey.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.560]   This is great to do with your dog.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.960]   If you have Gatorade bottles in spare time, they love your--
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:41.600]   Why?
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.000]   Really?
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:42.560]   They love it?
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:45.280]   It's a mental-- it's challenging for them.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.080]   It's fun.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.080]   And you're in-- to teach them to do this,
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.120]   you're engaging with them, and then they're not laying around board.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:51.840]   Well, that's true.
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.000]   My best friend likes the rascal.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.600]   I'm so excited that I can't go home.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.600]   My dog likes to find and wrestle.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.200]   Do you have to do the funny voices?
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:31:59.680]   Oh, look.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.440]   There's a big donut at the middle of that one.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.800]   We do not, Nary.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.640]   How's it going?
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.640]   Oh, you killed him.
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.760]   He doesn't know what to do.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:08.720]   Oh, no.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.080]   Because corgis can't back up.
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.880]   It's not a well-known fact, but they don't know how to back up.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.120]   They've just got a wide-turning radius.
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.880]   That's what's--
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:19.280]   See, isn't light enough?
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:23.040]   That's what's amazing is that the corgi doesn't just walk through the bottle.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.800]   Like, he takes it so seriously.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.400]   That's because he gets a reward when he does it right.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:28.720]   Oh, right.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:33.360]   He almost loves how much training did this involve?
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.960]   It depends on the dog.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.080]   Corgi's a really smart.
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.880]   Like, I mean, I wouldn't think a whole lot,
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:39.760]   because this is not--
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.960]   This is not something they wouldn't do.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.960]   Like, when I did agility training with my dog,
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:50.560]   who was not a corgi, but similar hurting dog, they love it.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.840]   Yeah.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:52.720]   They really--
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.080]   I mean, you're not hurting them.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.120]   They're just like--
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:59.040]   You can have the baby elephant that can't figure out his own trunk,
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:04.320]   the dog that smashes snowmen, the tortoise that can't stop eating shoes.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.120]   No.
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.920]   Or--
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.440]   I'm shaking the baby elephant.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.400]   You got to get baby elephants.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.200]   Don't go with me.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.040]   That, that, that, that, that, that, that, that.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:16.480]   That, that, that, I'll turn off the silly music.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:20.640]   He just doesn't understand that that's his nose hanging in front of him.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.800]   I'm starting to feel sorry for him.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.240]   I think this is elephant abuse.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.400]   That's poor elephant.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.160]   Male abuse.
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.200]   So sweet elephant.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.720]   It seems like he's doing perfectly well figuring on his nose.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.120]   He does.
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.240]   I don't know what's brought on his--
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.120]   Oh, watch out.
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:35.760]   Stand back.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:36.960]   Here comes mom's leg.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:37.520]   Oh boy.
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:39.280]   That was clickbait.
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.240]   Yeah, that was clickbait.
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.680]   They're, they, they deceived us.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.400]   That's not what, that's not what--
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:43.840]   Screw you, the dodo.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:44.240]   Screw you.
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:44.800]   Screw you.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.240]   You know the dog, the dog with the snowman.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.520]   Yeah, sorry.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.320]   Our show today.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.280]   Dogs are always the same.
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.080]   Mr. Jarvis.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:51.120]   Yeah.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:55.120]   You just went through and showed at all of these other top pages
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:58.640]   or what's showing up inside of Facebook and pretty much said that
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.360]   no one really cares about the political ads and political--
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:03.840]   Or a smaller number than we fear, that's all.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:09.440]   Okay, so with that said, why does it matter if the political ads are taken away?
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.040]   Because nobody's watching them anyway, right?
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:16.880]   Well, the difference here since you asked is that that's content versus advertising.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:19.360]   Advertising gets shown to you because you paid K.
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:20.560]   Okay.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:26.880]   So you could, it gives you, it gives the, the speaker, in this case, the advertiser, much more control.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:31.440]   And that's what, you know, this is the problem with Facebook because they'll say,
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:34.480]   publisher will say, oh, people don't look at my stuff.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.240]   And Facebook has two answers for that.
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:39.280]   One is, we'll make it more engaging and people will share it or pay us--
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.560]   Make it an ad.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:42.000]   Okay.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:42.560]   Exactly.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:47.280]   So that's the difference is that is that you can, you can then reach the people you know you want to reach
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:47.840]   by pain.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.840]   And the thing isn't, it's so--
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:51.760]   Much cheaper than any other medium.
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.360]   And more efficient.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:54.480]   So you can have a limited amount of money.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.760]   And more efficient.
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.000]   It's very effective because you can really target.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.280]   Yeah.
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.520]   Is that an answer?
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.200]   That is an answer.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:09.600]   I was curious because I personally don't see anything wrong with political ads went away,
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.320]   but then again, I'm a different breed of person.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.480]   There's a lot of crap I don't care about, you know?
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.520]   But that's exactly why Facebook and Google are in no rush.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.960]   They know people don't want to see them.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:19.840]   Yeah.
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:24.240]   And they know it's a hassle because people, you know, complain and then you're blocking some and
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.760]   you know, that's becomes it just, just like Jeff said, it's like, I--
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:31.520]   So they're-- and they don't make that much money from political ads.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.280]   It's funny because radio and TV do.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.320]   They really--
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.440]   Oh, this is their season.
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:35.680]   Yeah.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.160]   Oh, you said your mother, right?
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:43.520]   Yeah, my mom said that there was some paying like 80 grand for 30 second spots.
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:43.760]   Right.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.240]   Political.
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:46.800]   But on radio or TV?
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:47.520]   On television.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.600]   They buy-- they have to buy it by the rack rate.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.440]   They can't get discounts because that would be biased.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:55.520]   So it's-- but I don't think it's that much money for Facebook.
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:59.040]   It's-- they'll fill those avails, no problem.
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.480]   So it's not a loss of revenue.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.640]   It's a loss of a pain in the butt.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.520]   And it's-- and you have happier customers.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:10.800]   The only-- the only people who suffer here is the American democracy.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.880]   Ooh.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.080]   Oh, so--
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:14.080]   [laughter]
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:14.560]   Wow.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.320]   Check your wives.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.520]   I'm sure that hurts that one.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.800]   Check your wives being now.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:21.360]   I think that Halo is going to go, wow.
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:23.760]   You are deep, Leo.
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.240]   You are--
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.040]   Aerudite.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:25.840]   Aerudite.
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.080]   Let's take a break.
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:32.000]   This has become, you know, like almost a comedy show.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.520]   We've completely changed the tenor of this show over the last six months.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.800]   Hasn't it?
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:39.360]   It's more like, you know--
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.480]   It's a small group here.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.520]   Let's watch some elephants.
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:42.560]   I'm falling apart.
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:43.840]   Yeah, maybe that's it.
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:44.960]   We need it.
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:45.520]   We need it.
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:50.000]   If we had a Taco Bell ad, I would do one, but I don't have a Taco Bell ad,
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.760]   but, you know, if you're welcome to think about--
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.800]   Oh, Jeff will provide one for us.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.680]   Yeah, I know.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.160]   We have a Chipotle story coming up.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.360]   Oh, see?
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.920]   Never could get them to advertise.
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.600]   Oh, jerk's.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:04.320]   Yeah, I don't like.
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:08.880]   Our show today brought to you by NetSuite.
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:12.720]   NetSuite is for small to medium businesses
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:16.480]   that are struggling to understand what's going on, because
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:21.600]   it's the cognitive burden of trying to look at spreadsheets and QuickBooks
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:25.120]   and production reports and all of this stuff all spread across your
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:27.040]   screen or on your table.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.720]   What you need is NetSuite.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:31.520]   NetSuite gives you visibility and control over everything,
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:36.160]   your financials, HR, inventory, e-commerce and more.

[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.640]   I know it sounds too good to be true, but trust me,
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:46.880]   it isn't, and you need it and imagine what your life would be like.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.840]   If you could understand better what's going on in your business
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:54.640]   and make decisions not based on guesses, but based on data right in front of you.
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:57.280]   Using QuickBooks and spreadsheets that just slowing you down,
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.680]   if you're tired of working on multiple platforms
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:01.680]   and you're ready to take your business to the next level,
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.760]   now is a great time to upgrade to NetSuite.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:08.000]   You know, you really need a solution that's constantly evolving to meet your needs,
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.400]   and as you grow, you want this to grow with you.

[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.960]   with an agile business platform that can evolve as your needs change.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:27.840]   Close with confidence.
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:29.680]   It accelerates the financial close.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:31.600]   It maintains compliance with accounting standards.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.000]   Your reporting is accurate.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.240]   After all, in finance reporting,
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.320]   everything is accuracy is everything.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.680]   You know, that's the most important,
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:42.880]   but you can also drill down into underlying details,
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.360]   so you understand what's causing this number to be this way,
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.960]   what's impacting your business.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.480]   And this is in real time.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.680]   Real time metrics.
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.280]   You got role-based dashboards.
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.920]   You'll never again be in the dark about what's going on,
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.040]   where your money's going.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.040]   I think this is amazing.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:00.560]   You could see what users are saying about it, like Commvault.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:03.760]   Commvault turned to NetSuite's cloud solution
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.640]   as a platform that could dramatically reduce complexity,
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.800]   provide the kind of agility they needed.
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.320]   They use the Sweet Cloud development platform,
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.400]   which lets them support unique processes
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.960]   and integrate with third-party cloud applications.
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:20.080]   And of course, the apps from the many NetSuite partners
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:21.760]   round out the company's updated environment.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:22.880]   They love it.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.000]   SolarWinds.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.040]   Here's the quote, "We needed more than just a good accounting solution.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.800]   We had to responsibly manage growth,
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.920]   and NetSuite provided the business application infrastructure
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.000]   to do exactly that."
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.760]   Stop paying for multiple systems.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.360]   All you need is NetSuite.
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.200]   NetSuite delivers what the others can't.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:44.880]   That's why 22,000 businesses run on NetSuite.
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.720]   Let NetSuite show you how they can benefit you

[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:04.400]   Thank you, that's sweet for supporting this week in Google.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.400]   Thank you.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:06.960]   Thank you.
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.320]   You want to see my new toy?
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:08.560]   Yeah.
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:09.520]   Yeah.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.680]   Did you hear about the remarkable two?
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.280]   Oh, you got yours?
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:14.080]   I'm waiting for mine.
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:14.720]   I ordered it.
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.200]   This is the remarkable.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.280]   It's incredibly thin.
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.600]   It's like it's ink.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.560]   And so when you write on it with a thing.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.600]   You have to use their thing.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:28.720]   You have to use their stylus.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:29.680]   You have to use their thing.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:30.560]   Okay.
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:35.200]   But it feels very paper-ish.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.280]   It's very good.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.000]   That's the good news.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.040]   What's the bad news?
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:42.960]   Because the bad news is,
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.120]   well, it's expensive as heck.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.320]   This is $399.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:53.680]   I got it because my intention was to read and mark up PDFs.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:54.640]   That's what they talk about.
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:57.040]   Like lawyers would use this to mark up plenies.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:57.600]   Right.
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.560]   I have academic papers that I read as research, right?
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.600]   So I, and this was one,
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:06.080]   this was a pre-purchase thing, right?
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:08.080]   I'm not quite, wasn't, was a Kickstarter,
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:08.640]   it was like that.
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:12.960]   So I ordered it like nine months ago before the pandemic.
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.120]   So I was traveling that.
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.320]   I wonder where my is.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.840]   Taking a whole pile of papers in the code.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:19.120]   I'll just sink them in here.
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:19.760]   You don't need that.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:20.320]   I'll do it.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:20.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:25.760]   The, the app is really awkward.
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.120]   Basically can only go one way.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.800]   If I want to send a document back to myself,
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.920]   I have to do it via email.
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:30.960]   It doesn't sink with
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:35.440]   Google Docs or Dropbox or any of that stuff.
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.200]   It, um,
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:42.000]   it just is, is, is difficult.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.200]   And I, I, on Chromebook,
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.000]   it doesn't work with the app.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.520]   So I had to put it in the Android app.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:48.240]   And that's, you know, of course not designed for it.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.600]   And I've got to go through three steps
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:50.800]   to get anything into this,
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.320]   to then take it out.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.680]   And then I would mark things up.
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.840]   And then I would send the PDF back by email.
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:56.880]   So I could print it out.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.480]   And the marks would come up half an inch away
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.120]   from where I made them,
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:41:59.920]   which is a little difficult.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:01.040]   You try to do circle words.
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:03.360]   So I love this.
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.160]   It's beautiful.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.880]   They have a wonderful return policy.
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.480]   So sadly, it's going back.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.840]   So the thing I would say to you is if,
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:12.480]   if what you want to do is take notes
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.000]   and draw and all that,
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.280]   it's gorgeous.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.920]   If you want to deal with PDFs and stuff,
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.920]   it's going to take another couple generations of software
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:20.560]   before it's ready.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:21.600]   And it's expensive.
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:24.800]   So sadly, I'm going to wave goodbye to the remarkable.
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.800]   I'll be curious to hear what you think.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:27.120]   Yeah.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:28.080]   But I, well,
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:30.320]   and I could cancel it if I could figure out how.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.640]   Oh, see, see, they make an easy,
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.600]   that's one thing about them.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:34.080]   They're good.
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:34.800]   You can cancel.
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:38.960]   I don't, I don't, I don't even have a receipt or anything.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:39.920]   I don't know.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.280]   I know I got charged.
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.240]   Oh, you got email.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:42.800]   You got email.
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:43.920]   I got to find the email somewhere.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:44.720]   Yeah, they were good at that.
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:45.520]   They were very good at that.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:45.920]   OK.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:48.080]   So I just thought I'd show it off.
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:49.280]   For some people, it'd be perfect.
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:49.920]   They're expensive.
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.440]   For some people, like me.
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.760]   I was going to use it as a replacement for the Kindle.
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:58.960]   And then I could use it and mark up stuff as I'm reading it and stuff.
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.160]   Yeah, it's a BE pubs.
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:01.840]   I have a lot of BE pubs.
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:04.400]   Lot of the other thing I wanted it for was to be able to mark up.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:05.440]   Books.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:05.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.280]   EPUBs are hard to find and get.
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:12.240]   Because I'll tell you a lot of programming books
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:15.760]   come in EPUB format.
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.800]   Or they're in Moby that you can convert to EPUB.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.120]   Pretty much that, or Corey Doctorow.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:21.920]   Yeah.
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:25.600]   So I was hoping that because one of one use would be like,
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.560]   I've got a programming book here and I've got my computer here
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:29.920]   and I'm reading it and I could mark it.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:34.240]   And that would be kind of, so maybe I won't give up.
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:34.720]   You'll see.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:35.440]   Maybe you'll love it.
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:35.840]   I don't know.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:36.800]   You get 30 days to return.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.000]   I don't want to knock the guys.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.120]   It's a good policy.
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:40.080]   It's beautifully done.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:42.320]   They kept me informed the whole time when I was going to get it.
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.880]   I got it when they said with a little COVID delay,
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:45.760]   but they were honest about that.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.840]   So it's beautifully designed.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:48.480]   Great hardware.
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.200]   What's interesting is this Eink.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.640]   Remember when Eink came out?
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:56.960]   Everybody was saying, oh, there's going to be so many good uses for this and so forth and so on.
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:02.880]   And I don't know if the Eink technology has an advanced as fast as some thought.
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:03.680]   Or what?
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:09.200]   I mean, for instance, the Kindle still isn't quite black text on white paper,
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.000]   quality.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.400]   It's a little soft contrast, even the latest ones.
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.880]   They've gotten faster and the resolution's gotten higher.
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:19.360]   But it feels like Eink.
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:22.960]   Remember there were Eink phones?
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:23.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:28.320]   There were a couple of years ago, China, C.E.S. Asia.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:31.600]   I think it was I-Fly tech or something like that.
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:32.640]   I've been trying to look it up.
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:36.560]   But they talked about similar tech like what you're working with right now.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:42.400]   And I remember the feel of it felt great from a tactile standpoint.
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:47.440]   But at the same time, you're looking at it and it's a little fuzzy here and there.
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.440]   It just didn't seem like it would pan out.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.960]   It's possible that it's not...
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:58.560]   It's just not a technology that people want, I guess.
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:44:59.760]   That has to be-
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.560]   Either I get a beautiful screen with all these colors or I get paper.
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:05.040]   I like beautiful screen with colors.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:08.640]   I don't even use my Kindle that often.
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.160]   Really?
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:14.240]   I love my Kindle computer to be reading on an iPad or my phone.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:18.080]   I'd give books back to the library if I can't read it on the Kindle.
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:20.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you missed opening it and the overdrive app."
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.000]   I'm like, "Oh, don't want to read it."
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:28.960]   I mean, it's not that I don't use Kindle stuff, but I do it most often on computer or a phone or a tablet.
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:32.080]   Very little on the actual Kindle device.
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:40.000]   I like listening to audiobooks while they're being read on the Kindle or going back and forth.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:40.720]   That's very good.
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:54.800]   There are books that are in the
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.720]   books. It is. That's what I also want to say.
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.000]   I think I get a beautiful hardware.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.720]   If I were a note taker, I could read my handwriting.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:07.120]   I was organized and did those. It'd be gorgeous.
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.600]   Yeah. There's this aspirational thing I have.
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.760]   I find myself doing this all the time.
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:16.240]   Either I will write a journal and three weeks later I stop.
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:18.800]   Or I will take more notes as I read.
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:22.560]   I have this aspirational thing because everybody's like, "Oh, it's so great of you.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:24.880]   You do your zettled costume as you're reading.
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:27.920]   Then your ideas will..."
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:29.680]   And it's always too much trouble.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:33.360]   I just want to just listen to a book and go to bed.
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:39.200]   I guess maybe ambition has died in this old frame.
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:41.040]   Is that possible, Jeff?
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:44.080]   They just lose your ambition as you get older.
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:48.160]   I'm not going to ask any of Stacey because they're very young.
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:50.720]   Well, no, that's very common.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:53.040]   I'm even less ambitious than I used to be when I was...
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:53.840]   I mean, you just don't...
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:55.280]   You're done with your life.
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:56.880]   You're not fighting for your offspring.
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.640]   You're not fighting for the chance to have offspring.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:46:59.440]   You're just like...
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:02.000]   There are some things that just don't deserve your energy anymore.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.120]   Yeah, I've reproduced.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:07.200]   So, I'm just going to eat a lot of pachioi pepa and go to bed.
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.280]   Really, what are you even still doing here?
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:09.760]   What am I...
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.440]   Yeah, what's the point?
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:13.520]   I don't see doing nothing that would drive me.
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:14.240]   My father...
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:17.040]   That's what's great about podcasting.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.600]   It's as close to doing nothing as you can get.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:22.320]   Yeah, that's what I try to tell people.
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:23.440]   Speak for yourself.
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.840]   You can man-
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:26.400]   You can man-
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:27.680]   You can get the sweat doing this.
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:28.560]   Doing nothing.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:29.840]   Man.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:37.200]   So, the Amazon is in trouble now with the EU.
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.000]   So, see, I...
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:38.640]   This is...
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.640]   Did you see TikTok?
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:43.040]   It was a story about TikTok in the news today saying...
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.320]   Hello?
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.120]   Hello?
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:47.920]   And he is...
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:48.880]   What's going on?
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:50.080]   That was the...
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:52.640]   Tomorrow, you're supposed to put us out of business.
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:54.320]   Hello?
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:56.080]   TikTok.
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:57.120]   Are we still doing that?
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:01.280]   TikTok says the Trump administration has forgotten about trying to ban it.
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:03.760]   And they want to know, "What's going on?"
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:06.240]   What's the latest?
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:09.760]   And they haven't heard in more than a month from Cepheus,
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.760]   the committee for Foreign Investment in the United States,
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.560]   which is the enforcement arm.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.600]   They set a deadline of tomorrow, November 12th,
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:22.880]   for TikTok to divest itself of any tangible or intangible assets or property
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:24.640]   wherever located used to enable and support
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:27.600]   by dances operation of the TikTok application in the United States.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:32.400]   They did get a preliminary injunction, Judge Beatle Stone,
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.640]   and then nothing.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:38.720]   In the nearly two months, TikTok says in a statement,
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:42.640]   "Since the president gave his preliminary approval to our proposal
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:48.160]   to sell to Walmart and Oracle, we've offered detailed solutions
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:52.320]   to finalize that agreement, but never received no substantive feedback
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:54.720]   on our extensive data privacy and security framework."
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:55.760]   Nothing.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:58.720]   The imminent deadline tomorrow without an extension in hand,
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:01.200]   we have no choice but to file a petition in court.
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:04.080]   We have 1500 employees in the US.
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:06.480]   What's going on?
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:08.080]   I'll tell you what's going on.
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:08.960]   The election's over.
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:10.800]   Done.
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:13.680]   We're done.
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:13.760]   You were a toy.
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:15.920]   You were a pawn in a bigger game.
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:21.040]   So I can understand why they might be a little perturbed.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:24.960]   They spent millions of dollars on ads to convince the American people
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.520]   that they were a benign, fun social network,
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:28.720]   and people were making money on it.
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:29.440]   They went to court.
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:30.240]   They did all this stuff.
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.360]   Crickets.
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.920]   Crickets.
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.680]   I wonder what the walkaways are.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:39.920]   So let's just say that they managed to get court delays until January 20th.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.760]   Biden says, "You have never mind.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:47.040]   I wonder, is Oracle going to be owed anything for not getting it?
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.240]   It's "Hunk of TikTok"?
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:53.040]   Was there even an agreement with Oracle?
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:55.200]   Did we ever see an agreement or was it just like,
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.000]   "Oh, yeah, we'll do it."
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.440]   It's true other than a promise.
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:00.640]   Yeah, we'll host it in your cloud.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:00.960]   Sure.
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:05.840]   It's so funny.
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:07.680]   It's so weird.
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:10.400]   It's like hanging out with a crazy person.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:12.080]   They're like, "You would better do this by then."
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:15.360]   And you're like, "Okay, should I?"
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:18.480]   And then you get close to the date and they're just wandered around
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:19.360]   still doing something else.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:22.400]   And you're like, "So about that thing that you told me?"
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.400]   Actually, if I were TikTok, I'd just shut up, right?
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:25.600]   I'm just going to say something.
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:26.480]   Yeah, but what if then,
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:31.040]   just the more ways in a week comes down and finds them or something?
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:34.000]   There's two ways to go about it.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.920]   They could just shut up and be quiet,
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:38.960]   or they can just continue to attack them and say,
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:41.280]   "Hey, look, we put our necks out there.
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:45.600]   You're putting all of this ridiculous information out there about us.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:46.960]   We got business to run.
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.320]   So what's the call ready?"
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:51.920]   And just keep attacking the administration publicly.
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:54.960]   And maybe you'll get that hit dog to bark.
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:57.840]   Or I can see the phone call.
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:02.800]   Ms. Cooper, could you lay off Trump for about six weeks?
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:03.840]   Go ahead and zoom out Twitter.
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:04.800]   We don't care.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.640]   But just on TikTok,
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.800]   can you nod to the Trump jokes, please?
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:14.080]   Has comedian Sarah Cooper, who famous now for lip-syncing the president?
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.720]   Has she done anything lately?
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:17.680]   Or is she just quiet?
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:18.400]   That's a good question.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:19.200]   She has nothing to work with.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:20.160]   He's not been out there.
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:20.560]   That's right.
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:21.600]   That's a good point.
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:23.680]   It's just tweets.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:27.440]   Plus, she's trying to break away from this.
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.080]   She's trying to get...
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:28.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:29.600]   She made her fame.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:31.440]   She doesn't want to be fun, me, that.
[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:32.640]   That would be the worst.
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:36.320]   Wasn't she doing something with Netflix?
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:37.040]   I might imagine.
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.560]   Yeah, she's got a special.
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:41.280]   But that's her larger comedy.
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:46.800]   And she also had a book that she wrote like a while back.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:47.760]   Oh, okay.
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.440]   How to impress people in meetings?
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:52.000]   Oh, was that a for Google experience?
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:52.960]   It was.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:54.080]   Oh, cool.
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.520]   Cool.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:59.760]   So, the EU, however, is not resting.
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:01.120]   In fact,
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:01.680]   it's not resting.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:04.320]   Now they're going after Amazon.
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:07.600]   Any trust suit against Amazon.
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:11.200]   And there are two different issues
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:13.200]   that the EU is looking into.
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.440]   Oh, sorry.
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:17.440]   Let me stop the audio on that.
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:25.680]   They opened an investigation to partly because of this dual role
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:28.000]   Amazon has as a marketplace and a seller.
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:32.720]   They wonder if data from the sellers is being unfairly used by Amazon
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:35.840]   to create and sell its own products.
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:38.560]   Actually, that investigation began last July.
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:42.560]   And this is the culmination of that.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:46.880]   The investigation from Amazon does feed non-public seller data,
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:48.800]   the number of products ordered in the seller's revenue
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:52.000]   into its own retail algorithms to help it decide
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.200]   which new products to launch and the price of each new offer.
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.720]   That's according to Marta Vestay here.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.960]   I guess that's illegal in the EU.
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:52:59.920]   Is it illegal here?
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:02.880]   Because certainly grocery stores and other grocery stores
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:04.080]   and department stores and everybody else.
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:04.720]   You do that all the time.
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:05.120]   Exactly that.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:09.360]   And then the fact that the governments is always good on this.
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:12.240]   But we wouldn't have generic products on grocery store shelves
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:12.800]   if they didn't.
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:14.080]   Right?
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:14.320]   Right.
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:16.560]   And the reason they decide to make it is they know what sells.
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:19.600]   They have inside knowledge about what sells.
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:21.600]   And so they decide, well, let's make our own.
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:24.080]   And the other thing is still there,
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:26.240]   just all like Amazon is no different.
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:30.160]   From what Macy's does with his house brand or Krovers does it.
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:33.120]   What's interesting with grocery stores is they actually go to,
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:36.480]   there are plenty of companies that make the store brands
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:41.040]   and also the packaged, like the CPG brands.
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:41.600]   They do both.
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:42.000]   Right.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:42.400]   Right.
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:47.920]   So that's a little different in that it's just a marketplace.
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:52.240]   So if it's promoting its own stuff over somebody else's stuff,
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:56.160]   there's no benefit to the people who have the somebody else's stuff.
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:59.600]   So the results of this investigation began last July
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:02.320]   are that Amazon has breached EU antitrust rules.
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:04.320]   But before penalties are imposed,
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:06.560]   the EU says the investigation must be completed.
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:08.960]   The probe could, according to CNN business,
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:13.520]   drag on for years and expose Amazon to potential fines of up to 10%
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:16.560]   of its annual global sales.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:17.760]   Whoa.
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:22.160]   That would be a penalty of about 37 billion dollars.
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:29.360]   Now the second investigation, whether Amazon artificially favor its its own retail offers,
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:36.320]   when you see the Amazon recommendation boxes, the buy box,
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:42.640]   does Amazon favor its own stuff or not?
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:45.360]   Our concern says Marta Vex-Tiger,
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:48.400]   our concern is that Amazon may artificially push retailers
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:53.440]   to use its own related services, which locks them deeper into Amazon's ecosystem.
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:56.800]   These are all, I guess, classic antitrust issues.
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:03.920]   I would like to see the actual data on this, because that's just like someone whining,
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:07.760]   one person whining about their product not being pushed up.
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:10.800]   I'm pretty sure it's more than one person.
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:14.160]   I'm pretty sure it's more than 100 vendors or something.
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:16.400]   It's got to be a big enough to do.
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:16.960]   That's why you investigate.
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:18.080]   And I guess it's pulled up.
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:18.880]   I'd like to see you.
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:19.840]   You could investigate it, right?
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:20.640]   You could figure it out.
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:20.720]   You could figure it out.
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:26.000]   Because if you look at your own Amazon page and all of the recommendations that pop up,
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:30.960]   it may be 50/50 split on Amazon, basic stuff versus some other OEM.
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:32.160]   At least it is for me.
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:33.840]   But I'd like to see the other issue.
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:34.320]   The other issue, Ian.
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:42.320]   So Ben Evans had a good piece that he wrote that's right below that in the rundown,
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:45.920]   where he also depends on if you're going to try to argue this kind of market manipulation,
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.280]   you've got to define what a market is.
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:50.880]   And does Amazon really have a monopoly?
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:57.920]   And so the argument here is that if you look at retail, Amazon has somewhere between 5% of retail.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:01.040]   And which Amazon is quick to tell.
[00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:06.080]   What Amazon is quick to tell you that?
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:07.360]   Yes, exactly.
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:12.800]   If you look at them in books, they have half of books.
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:14.240]   Well, over half of US book sales.
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:16.880]   And three quarters of e-book sales.
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:17.120]   Right?
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:21.760]   1% of grocery sales, even Walmart has 20%.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:25.440]   So you can't complain about them buying whole foods.
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:28.240]   So in this case, you're right, Anthony.
[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:32.880]   And the question is, well, within their marketplace, what other opportunities do
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:34.000]   sellers have?
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:38.720]   And the thing I think that Amazon will argue is we could take off all those third party sellers.
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:41.520]   And they'd be far worse off.
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:42.640]   True.
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:46.000]   And so would the consumer be far worse off?
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.160]   Because we compete with each other on price,
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:51.040]   and we give consumers choices, and that's there.
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:54.720]   And we give these sellers a marketplace they wouldn't otherwise have.
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:55.760]   So fine.
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:57.680]   We'll take it down.
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:00.720]   Actually, it won't say that, it's a huge part of the business.
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:06.240]   But at some point, it becomes a whole different world now.
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:12.080]   So because it's co-opetition, it's complicated.
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:17.760]   Have you all been here in the sentiment of, especially nowadays with the pandemic?
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:22.560]   Where you should stop ordering from Amazon and support the local businesses?
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:22.960]   I'm going to--
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:26.880]   Oh, my child is-- her gift list is at a local bookstore.
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:29.360]   And it is--
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:37.440]   My parents love to give her books, and they do not have a lot of money.
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:44.000]   And a lot of the books are $26, but they're $18 at Amazon.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.400]   And I can't dictate to someone.
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:49.760]   I'm not going to tell my parents, don't buy them on Amazon,
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:53.840]   because my daughter thinks it's unethical because she is $14.
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:56.000]   That's my mom.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.880]   I apologize if you're a very privileged price.
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:57:59.360]   Right.
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:03.760]   I mean, I'm fine saying, all right, I see what you're doing here.
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:07.360]   I will support this, and I will tell you that we can buy fewer books.
[00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:07.840]   And I say that.
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:12.560]   I'm like, hey, if we have this budget, are you willing to give up a full book?
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:15.360]   Because that's what this will cost you.
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:16.400]   And she's like, yes.
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:20.640]   But I still am like, I'm going to tell my parents this, and they're going to be like,
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:23.040]   yeah, they're not going to be cool.
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:25.920]   So why is a local bookstore more expensive?
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:28.720]   Well, they don't have the economies of scale.
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:31.520]   They don't have the ability to bludgeon the publishers.
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:34.480]   But they also don't have rent.
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:37.280]   I mean, Amazon does have rent, but yeah, I understand.
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:40.880]   So that would argue that Amazon really does have, in some respect,
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:46.720]   a lock on the market that's not necessarily right.
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:48.080]   Okay.
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:49.520]   So let's take books out of the.
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:50.400]   Let's take books out.
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:56.000]   I'll give you a concrete example from a friend of mine who made a product.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.760]   He probably got it.
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:02.080]   You know, he got somebody to design it, got it made in China and started
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:03.120]   selling it on Amazon.
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:08.480]   You know, because it's really a great way to sell stuff is a third market.
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:09.440]   That's what I was going to do.
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:10.480]   They do the fulfillment and everything.
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:16.400]   But all of a sudden his product is being sold by Amazon directly.
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:19.360]   His product is being sold by Amazon directly.
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:22.400]   Apparently they're buying it and selling it at a higher cost.
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:25.680]   And then the prices go all over the place because it's algorithmic.
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:27.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:34.400]   He's, I don't know if you, I didn't hear the final result of this.
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:37.360]   But it damaged his business for sure.
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:40.400]   Amazon in effect just muscled him.
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:43.200]   They bought his product from him.
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:43.440]   Right.
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:49.120]   And charged more, but then his sales disappeared somehow because maybe the recommendation.
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:49.600]   I don't know.
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:51.360]   But they bought his product from him though.
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:51.920]   I'm trying to get.
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:57.360]   Well, yeah, I guess, but they're buying at a lower price than I don't know exactly.
[00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:59.040]   Maybe listen, but this is where price fixing comes in.
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.680]   This is the Zabars case with Quiz-in-Art.
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:06.640]   Zabars tried to have set prices and went to court.
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:09.120]   Zabars, the magnificent deli in New York.
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:14.160]   This case was doing discounting and Zabar and Quiz-in-Art tried to pull the product
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:16.880]   from Zabars and Quiz-in-Art lost.
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.000]   Yeah, interesting.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:18.800]   Or it said you can't.
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:20.000]   Because Apple does that.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.600]   Apple has very tight control of the channel.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.880]   They do not let people undercut the retail price.
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:27.040]   So maybe that court decision.
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.160]   I don't know how they got away with it.
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:28.800]   Yeah, sure.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:29.840]   It wasn't.
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:33.840]   And I can't remember the exact details.
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:38.480]   And I may be telling this wrong, but it was clear that Amazon was manipulating the price
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:42.080]   and doing something that ultimately hurt him.
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:42.400]   You're right.
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.440]   They're buying it from him.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:46.560]   Maybe it ended up being they made a clone of it.
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.240]   I suspect that.
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:48.480]   Well, that'll be different.
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:48.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:49.680]   That's not cool.
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.880]   Yeah, that's not cool.
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:53.440]   I'll ask him about the details on this.
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.520]   I just remember he's very bitter about it.
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:57.440]   She cuddly company.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:57.760]   Right.
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:00.800]   The way they pay their employees, the way they treat folks.
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.560]   There's issues on the other hand.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:07.040]   It gives everybody, especially in the pandemic,
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:11.040]   it gives everybody this incredible range of choice and at good prices.
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:14.320]   And it does provide a marketplace for retailers.
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:17.600]   They could do a nicer job of it.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.040]   And that's probably what's going to get them in trouble.
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.120]   I guess that's the real question.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:24.800]   Is this just a temporary period while
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:27.760]   we reorganize all around online?
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:30.160]   Or is this really a predatory situation?
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:37.280]   From the point of view of consumers being able to buy that your daughter's book list
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:41.760]   at a significant discount on Amazon, it's a lot easier for them.
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:43.680]   There's a lot to be said.
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:47.520]   That's a huge customer convenience that Amazon's giving her, your parents.
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:50.080]   So that's not a bad thing.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:53.680]   And the publishers are getting as much, I get presumed, getting a cut that they're
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:55.760]   going to live with.
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:56.480]   That's the thing.
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.520]   The only people lose on this is the local bookstore
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.200]   who's charging significantly.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.280]   We'll re-enter rent and stuff like that.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.960]   Those people are losing out.
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.400]   Well, they'll be gone.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:10.880]   I think a lot of people don't understand that Amazon is a spot for small businesses
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.480]   to share their goods as well.
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:16.240]   Yes, Amazon will have some sort of cut out of it or whatever.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:20.720]   But people just seem to poo-poo the fact that you shouldn't buy from Amazon
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:26.080]   because they're just destroying the local businesses when they never even think about the fact
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:30.480]   that that same local business may have an Amazon store that you can buy from.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:30.960]   Right.
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:35.680]   Well, in a way, that's what I'm saying is, is this just the market rearranging itself?
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:44.160]   Because somebody like Ant could sell books out of his house and not have to have a bookstore
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:44.880]   and do well.
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:47.600]   Maybe that's not a bad thing.
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.160]   Then there's this societal thing.
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:53.680]   I understand your daughter's concerned Stacy because she wants to have a place
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:55.280]   she can go in town that's a bookstore.
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.080]   Maybe not.
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:59.200]   That's so much.
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.200]   Hi, she's B-Day.
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.600]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.080]   You can say it.
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.040]   Well, that's a teenager.
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.040]   It's a teenager being virtuous.
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:10.320]   It's just really hard to live with because you can't say, "Don't be virtuous, kid."
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.640]   No, I'd be proud of her.
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:13.520]   I think that's great.
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:14.480]   I think that's really great.
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:14.960]   I mean, yes.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:18.240]   The alternative is way worse if she's like,
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:21.920]   dump and crude in the backyard and like screw the dolphins or whatever.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.120]   Yeah, you just be glad.
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.440]   Yeah, on the other hand, what do you think?
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.920]   Do you think Jeff Bezos was like that when he was 16?
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.280]   Oh, probably.
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:31.680]   Lord, no.
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:32.480]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:34.000]   I'm going to take over the world.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.480]   His father was a circus act.
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:40.080]   Like a performer?
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:42.480]   Yeah, I think he was famous for his Unicycle Act.
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:46.640]   Okay, I was like calling someone a circus act feels kind of insulting.
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:49.760]   No, he literally was.
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:51.200]   It's not an insult.
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:55.200]   I read this in that book, that wonderful...
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.720]   Sorry.
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:00.880]   That wonderful book about Amazon.
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.720]   And I, boy, I forget the name.
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.000]   His parents divorced.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.120]   His mother married.
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.920]   So he was born, Jeffrey Preston, Jorgensen.
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:08.320]   Right.
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:09.840]   His parents divorced.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:11.680]   His father was a bike shop owner.
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:12.000]   Oh.
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:14.000]   Oh, maybe I misremet.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.440]   And then he married Miguel, Mike Bail, way off.
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:18.880]   No, no, I swear to God.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:21.680]   It was in the Everything Store.
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:22.960]   I'm like an engineer for Exxon.
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.920]   You know, Leo, you can't believe what you hear on podcast.
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:27.440]   It was in the end, too.
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:28.480]   I swear to God.
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.720]   I swear to God, it was in the USA.
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.640]   You can't believe what you read in the book.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:34.560]   Before he had a bicycle store.
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:36.240]   Maybe.
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:39.840]   You know, we're going to have to get Brad Stone on,
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:41.360]   and he's going to have to explain it.
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:42.240]   I'll find the book.
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:44.720]   It's in the Everything Store, which by the way, a great book.
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.400]   Even though now it's a few years old,
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:51.200]   and at the time it really annoyed Jeff Bezos, even more so,
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:57.040]   Mackenzie Bezos, who wrote a horrific, scathing review on the Amazon site
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.400]   of the book, The Everything Store.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:01.840]   But it was a really good inside look at Amazon and how it worked.
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:06.240]   And despite all the criticism from the Bezos family, as far as I know, it was accurate.
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:09.920]   So I think his first father-
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:10.560]   Donald's.
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:14.000]   As a line cook and the breakfast shift.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.200]   Who did Jeff?
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:16.240]   Jeff said so did I.
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:17.600]   Well, no, I had the closing shift.
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:20.080]   I had Puponderosa steakhouse myself.
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:23.680]   If you like your steak, give you a hot potato break.
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:25.920]   Get your steak at the Ponderosa steakhouse.
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:30.640]   So his birth father, Ted Jorgensen, had a bike shop.
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:32.080]   Like what my day job?
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:33.520]   I swear to God.
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:35.520]   I swear to God.
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:41.040]   I read in that book that he was a circus performer originally.
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:44.640]   Maybe he went from, you can't be a unicyclist forever.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:48.800]   Maybe he went from being a unicyclist to owning a bike shop.
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:49.680]   That would make sense.
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.920]   Sort of.
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:06:01.040]   I mean, right now I can see this little motion graphic above your head trying to connect the dots.
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.000]   I am trying.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.480]   And they're just going in circles to.
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:06.720]   Not good.
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:10.240]   Let's see.
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:10.640]   He was.
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:11.040]   Okay.
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:13.120]   He was father as a child.
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:16.160]   Was long to a unicycle troop.
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:16.480]   Yes.
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:17.520]   Jorgensen did.
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:17.920]   Okay.
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:18.240]   Okay.
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:22.240]   And worked in a retail store making a dollar 25 an hour and didn't have much money.
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:25.360]   Jeff Bezos biological father with a star.
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:26.160]   But this is putting the book.
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:27.840]   A star of a unicyclist.
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:31.360]   And he didn't even know that his son was Jeff Bezos.
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.280]   So wait, what?
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:38.720]   Bezos's birth father was a big name on the unicycling circuit.
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:39.120]   Okay.
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:42.080]   It says it right here in the Daily Mail.
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:43.200]   So you know it's true.
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:46.640]   This is from Brad Stone's book too.
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:46.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:48.320]   All right.
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:50.560]   His grandparents belong to the caravan club.
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:50.960]   Look.
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:52.320]   Airstream trailer owners.
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:55.360]   Here's a picture of him on his unicycle.
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:56.960]   I rest my case.
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:58.240]   Okay.
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:58.640]   Oh.
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:01.440]   There are pictures.
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:03.760]   I don't know.
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:04.800]   That looks like a
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:04.800]   Stacy.
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:05.280]   I don't know.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:05.680]   The book.
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:09.360]   Do you know bookfinder.com?
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:11.040]   That's an awesome site.
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.880]   It is the best.
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:16.160]   Because I need to buy a lot of old books about books and stuff.
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:17.200]   The way things are out of print.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:21.680]   I wouldn't do this to occur an author, but it's every it's a book.
[01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:22.400]   It's everything.
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:26.400]   And bookfinder is spectacular at looking for old books.
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:27.120]   I'm going to get dizzy.
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:32.080]   Look, I have actually used it because yeah, if you want out of print books or yeah, it's.
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:37.200]   Or but the other point is Stacy, it also has new books on there from local stores here and there.
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:42.240]   So you can buy local still buy at a local store somewhere and support them.
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:43.440]   Okay.
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:46.320]   That's the other book trick I've gotten lately, which I didn't know.
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:50.240]   There are books that came out in the UK that were coming out here for six months and I needed them.
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:57.840]   You can order directly from Blackwell's Blackwell's dot code at UK, which is a good chain in the UK.
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:04.000]   And they ship without at good prices in the US without shipping.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.240]   So they're competitive Amazon.
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:08.640]   Okay, I like it.
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:15.920]   So all right, we got more including the change log coming up, but first a word from our sponsor.
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:20.080]   I'll show they brought to you by bandwidth, not the megabits per second you get from
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:23.760]   Internet service provider bandwidth is a C like what's a C like Stacy?
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:30.480]   competitive local exchange. Thank you. So when you're in a when you're in a see she's good.
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:31.920]   I test later.
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.840]   Is is bandwidth a wave?
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:37.520]   It's a particle, I believe.
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:38.240]   It's capacity.
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:41.440]   So so you have your eye.
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:42.240]   How many are your wave?
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:45.840]   You have your eye like which is your incumbent carrier, which is like 80,
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:50.480]   whoever your phone company is, but you can also have competitive local carriers.
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:53.920]   C Lex, that's what bandwidth is there an actual carrier.
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:57.840]   And a name you may not have heard of, but you heard of have you ever heard of perhaps,
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:01.680]   I don't know, Google voice because Google voice uses bandwidth.
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:06.000]   Somebody has to provide that connection to the phone system.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.760]   That's what bandwidth does.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:13.760]   They have been injecting the power of software into left knee for years delivering cloud ready,
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:19.280]   voice calling, text messaging, and 911 built for the enterprise.
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:22.640]   They have worked with some of the biggest brands in the world to disrupt industries,

[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:30.240]   For more than 10 years, Google's relied on bandwidth for many of their communications needs.
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:37.040]   Google meet, Google homes, Google voice, even in the Google plex, those phones,
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.480]   some of them are connected to bandwidth.
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:44.000]   bandwidth's APIs are behind the scenes of Google products, ensuring quality communication.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000]   It's not just Google Microsoft.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.360]   Zoom relies on bandwidth whenever if you ever done a zoom meeting from a phone bandwidth.
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:55.840]   That's how they bring their most important customer experiences to life from sending SMS
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:00.640]   notifications at just the right time to making sure contact center calls sound crystal clear to
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:07.760]   ensuring reliable and secure 911 routing bandwidth has its own tier one carrier network.
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:13.760]   That backs their API platform, allowing for a no middleman pricing structure.
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:18.320]   You're buying the bandwidth from bandwidth as well as using their API.

[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.640]   Google.
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:36.960]   It's Bob.
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.080]   Who is the CEO?
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:40.880]   He used to be like David.
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.000]   Is it David Morkin?
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.200]   I can't remember his name.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:48.240]   I had the very early days of covering
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:51.280]   Telcos.
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:52.720]   He and I used to talk about it.
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:53.200]   David Morkin.
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:53.600]   It's very smart.
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:55.040]   It is David Morkin.
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:55.520]   David Morkin.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:55.840]   Still?
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:56.320]   Okay.
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:57.440]   Yeah, he's a good dude.
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:58.000]   Okay, sorry.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.040]   That's all.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.520]   He was at Republic Wireless for a while.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:05.520]   Republic Wireless was actually spun out of bandwidth.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:07.040]   Like, I remember covering that.
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:07.760]   Oh, okay.
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:08.080]   Really?
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:08.720]   Oh, wow.
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:09.200]   Yeah.
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:12.560]   Yeah, it's funny because, you know, I started talking about these guys.
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:13.760]   I said, "Well, I never heard of you.
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:14.240]   What do you do?"
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.360]   And they started telling me, and it's like,
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:19.040]   "Oh, I guess I've been using you for years."
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:21.760]   When Grand Central started,
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:24.320]   they used bandwidth to make Grand Central work.
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:26.400]   And then when Google bought Grand Central,
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.240]   bandwidth just went along for the ride.
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:30.560]   And then Google slowly expanded it to meet and everything else.
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:34.480]   And yeah, it was kind of like an eye-opener.
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:36.400]   This is one of the things I love about this industry.
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:38.160]   There are these people, these companies.
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:43.040]   They're selling the shovels and the picks.
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.680]   You know about the gold miners.
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:48.240]   You don't know about the guys who sold the picks.
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.160]   But it's the guys selling the shovels and the picks.
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:51.360]   They keep the whole thing going.
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:52.080]   Yep.
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.640]   You know, and that's a perfect example.
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:57.440]   Jeff, you ready to sing a song with me?
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.280]   Surely, oh.
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:00.960]   They were singing.
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:01.680]   Me, me, me, me.
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:04.640]   Bye, bye, Mr. Adjutpai.
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:08.480]   He's going away, and I won't say goodbye.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:14.320]   Adjutpai will soon lose his job.
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:17.520]   He'll take his giant oversized Reese's Pieces coffee mug.
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:23.680]   And be going probably back to industry where he came from, right?
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:25.760]   Lawyer for Verizon.
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:26.320]   I never left.
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:27.840]   Sorry for, yeah, never really left.
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:31.920]   Nice piece of advice about this.
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:34.000]   Now this won't happen until January 20th,
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.320]   but almost certainly the party in control of the presidency.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:37.520]   We talked about this last week.
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:42.240]   Gets a 3-2 majority over the FCC and the chairman's spot.
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:46.320]   So with a Biden win, the FCC majority will become Democratic in January.
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:51.360]   And Pi will no longer be the chairman and experts say he's likely to leave entirely.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:51.760]   Buh-bye.
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.200]   Buh-bye.
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:53.520]   Buh-bye.
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:53.920]   Buh-bye.
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:58.800]   Has not been great for net neutrality.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.880]   Not been great for Section 230.
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.320]   I'm not dreading.
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:04.160]   Well, neither is Biden good with 230.
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:07.120]   I'm dreading some of Biden's views on technology.
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.080]   You're right.
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:08.560]   You're right.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:10.240]   We're just going to have to-
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:14.480]   Take in who is Biden surrounding himself with, too, to help him out on his nerves.
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:14.640]   Bingo.
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:16.240]   Yep.
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:16.800]   Bingo.
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.720]   He hasn't called Jeff yet.
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:22.400]   Well, I mean, I think his legitimate concern for instance,
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:25.440]   that Elizabeth Warren might get a seat at the table in commerce or something.
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:27.680]   I doubt he'd take her out of the Senate.
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.520]   Massachusetts has a Republican governor.
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:34.800]   Yeah, so that probably, but still she's certainly advising.
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:39.520]   And we know she was very aggressively advocating for the breakup of Big Tech.
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:44.560]   I wonder though, if the FCC will bring back net neutrality, for instance.
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.600]   They could-
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:48.560]   I think your retirement should be as the chair of the FCC.
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:49.520]   I think that's a nice thing.
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:50.160]   I would do it.
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:51.440]   No, I would do it.
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:54.000]   I would hire you to tell me what to do.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.360]   You are more qualified, but you're too young.
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:57.760]   I am competing with Leo for, I think.
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:00.400]   I've actually advised to talk to you.
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:01.440]   All right, you can have it.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.720]   I talk to FCC commissioners all the time.
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:05.360]   All the time.
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:06.320]   Not all the time.
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:06.880]   I spent-
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:07.840]   I usually talk to the Republican.
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:11.200]   I spent one day with Michael Powell.
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:13.200]   Oh.
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:13.680]   That was fun.
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:15.600]   Original net neutrality dude, actually.
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:16.720]   Yeah, that was funny.
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:18.320]   And his blackberry.
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:20.800]   He spent a lot of time on his blackberry while we're walking around.
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:21.440]   But that was fun.
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:22.800]   But that was 2004.
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:23.680]   That was ages ago.
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:30.400]   You know, after the FCC released their original net neutrality documents,
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:36.320]   it was Christmas, like Christmas Eve, or maybe it was the day after Christmas.
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:36.320]   Hey.
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:36.960]   Hey.
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:38.320]   Oh, it was the 23rd.
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:43.840]   I'm at my family's house in Houston, and I get a phone call and I'm like, oh, God.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:47.840]   You know, and I had seen that they were out and I was like, I hate you.
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:49.040]   I hate you FCC.
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:52.880]   And they were like, please hold for Tom Wheeler.
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:55.200]   And I was like, what is happening?
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:55.440]   Wow.
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:56.960]   Tom Wheeler called you?
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:57.600]   Wow.
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:57.840]   Yes.
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:58.880]   Wow.
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:03.360]   To talk about the USCC rules, because when I was at Giga, I was like the most psychotic,
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:08.240]   most psychotic broadband reporter in the face of the planet.
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:09.680]   Don't doubt.
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:11.120]   You were.
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:13.520]   That's why I asked you what I like, man.
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:16.480]   But sadly, I hadn't read the whole thing.
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:19.360]   So I was like, I was just pissed that I was like sitting here going, God.
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:23.040]   Well, Tom Wheeler.
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:24.640]   I did not study for the exam.
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:25.120]   Tom Wheeler.
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:26.640]   It's a really interesting sample.
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:27.920]   Yeah, he ended up being very good.
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:33.680]   We were always kind of surprised by that, but he did a good job.
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:36.560]   But I was really proud as not the right word.
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:42.000]   Part of the problem with the FCC chairman is they often come from industry as both Wheeler
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:42.720]   and Pi did.
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:46.160]   And so you go, well, how can I trust this guy?
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:48.560]   You worked for Verizon or Comcast to.
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:49.760]   They also have the knowledge.
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:50.800]   Well, they do have the knowledge.
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:55.840]   But Stacy has never worked for any telecom.
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:56.800]   She has the knowledge.
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:58.400]   But my husband and my father will have.
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:16:59.040]   That's perfect.
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:16:59.440]   That's fine.
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:00.400]   You can arms length them.
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:04.000]   And let each stay away.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.040]   Step arm your husband.
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:07.120]   Stay away from me.
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:10.080]   And then somebody in the chat room said, and they're absolutely right.
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:11.680]   Stacy is less emotional than Leo.
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:12.720]   So she gets the job.
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:14.880]   So there.
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:17.120]   So I'm good friends with Susan Ness.
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:19.600]   I was an FCC commissioner.
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:24.160]   And I'm delighted that my FCC flight occurred after she left the commission.
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:25.840]   She'd have had to recuse herself.
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:29.280]   There are some good people.
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:31.520]   Jessica Rosenworcel is a very good commissioner.
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:33.840]   I have found her in some locations.
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:34.080]   I don't remember anybody.
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:34.640]   Before Wheeler.
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:34.960]   Yeah.
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:39.760]   So there are good people on this commission.
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:43.280]   But it seems like the chairman has a lot of carries a lot of weight.
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:45.280]   Really sits the agenda to a large degree.
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:47.440]   You got to get a message.
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:49.120]   Well, wait, that's not true.
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:50.720]   They do have to.
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:53.680]   They have politic amongst themselves.
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:59.280]   So that is, I mean, up until the Trump administration.
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:04.640]   And I know, you know, we had pie and I can't remember not car car.
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:07.600]   God, it was the other guy.
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:10.640]   Maybe I shouldn't be the FCC chair.
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:11.600]   I know I remember.
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:12.880]   Well, that is one of the rules.
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.480]   You have to name all 52.
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:15.520]   You have to know all five.
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:16.160]   Yeah.
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:18.800]   All five current commissioners.
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:18.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:20.240]   Well, that's true.
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:21.360]   You probably do have to open that.
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:22.720]   Yeah.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:30.640]   Anyway, but they actually do understand the rules for the most part and try.
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:36.080]   I do actually believe that they took their jobs very seriously.
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:39.840]   Pie was a little bit of a wild card.
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:45.040]   He used to leak stories very negatively to the really conservative press.
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:51.280]   He was a little bit more partisan, which is weird for an agency that had been very
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:56.160]   imparted itself on being technically and data driven.
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:56.960]   They love those words.
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:58.560]   But anyway.
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:04.400]   So I don't think the new president will announce his chairman of his FCC.
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:09.760]   But apparently he's expected to announce shortly after Thanksgiving in just a couple
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:11.840]   of weeks, many of his cabinet nominations.
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:17.760]   And there's some thinking according to CNN that he will announce his chief of staff
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:18.720]   as early as tomorrow.
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:20.240]   Yep.
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.120]   With his wrong claim.
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:23.040]   As the wrong claim is former chief of staff.
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:26.800]   As vice president, I think.
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:30.800]   Stacey, I put the other FCC chair into the Twitch chat.
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:33.840]   Oh, where's the Twitch?
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:34.800]   It stays.
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:36.000]   He's like, where is the trip?
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.280]   You could just say the name.
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:40.080]   I don't know which one she's asking about.
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:40.400]   Okay.
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:41.600]   Did you put the whole list in there?
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:47.280]   Tom Wheeler, minion Clyburn.
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:48.240]   Minion Clyburn.
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:48.880]   Gennie Kowski.
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:49.680]   Yep.
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:50.480]   Cops.
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:52.000]   Oh, Gennie Kowski was great.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:52.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:55.200]   Oh, no, it was Gennie Kowski, not Wheeler that called me.
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:55.440]   Sorry.
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:56.080]   Gennie Kowski.
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:56.640]   I talk.
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:57.360]   He was cool.
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:57.760]   I talk.
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.520]   We had him on Twitter.
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:00.640]   Yeah, I talked to Davos.
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:01.200]   Yeah.
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:01.760]   He was cool.
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:03.600]   But I did talk to Wheeler, just not at that.
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:09.120]   That's the wrong commissioner with Esther Starks is who I was thinking of, I believe.
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:10.880]   Starks?
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:17.040]   I have told the story of my FCC for years.
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:17.680]   Oh, no, it was car.
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:19.040]   No, what was your FCC?
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:20.720]   The final story?
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:21.600]   What was that all about?
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:22.480]   I don't think so.
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:31.920]   So at the time it was the FCC's largest fine for indecency to a Fox show married to America
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:34.480]   for suggestive use of whipped cream.
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:36.400]   Oh my God.
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:40.640]   And the FCC said there were 159 complaints.
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:43.760]   He comes so far from there.
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:51.520]   With cream, I know.
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:52.320]   Oh my God.
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:57.600]   So I filed the FOIA and they, I called and I asked them, they said they had 159 complaints
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:00.080]   from all Americans, which I thought was ridiculously small.
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:00.160]   Yeah.
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:02.240]   Then they admitted that there were CCs in there.
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:03.520]   So it was actually like 89.
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:07.440]   Then they admitted that there were 23 unique letters.
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:12.160]   And then I looked at all the letters and all but two of them were the exact same letter
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:14.320]   sent by the parents television council.
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:18.160]   So only three people in all of America had bothered to complain about this show that was
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:21.280]   the worst thing that had ever been on television at the FCC.
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:22.320]   Wow.
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:24.160]   And since then.
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:24.720]   That's that tracks.
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:26.320]   And believe me.
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:26.560]   Yeah.
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:31.920]   Because of that, they now put all complaints up online.
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:33.120]   Yeah.
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:34.640]   Oh, you're the reason they do that.
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:34.960]   Thanks, jazz.
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:35.360]   I'm the reason.
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:36.720]   I love reading those complaints.
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:37.920]   Yeah.
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:43.040]   I also, my other proud moment in life in Washington, DC.
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:45.600]   I'm just bragging here where I love to do that.
[01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:49.600]   Was where I got to testify before the FCC and say Baba Bui.
[01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:51.360]   You did.
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:52.320]   You said Baba Bui.
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:53.120]   I did.
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:54.160]   It's kind of the FCC.
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:55.120]   Oh, you just did that.
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:56.400]   So Howard would like you.
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:58.800]   Well, and they used it as a bumper on Howard.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:21:59.600]   Oh, I bet they did.
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:00.400]   Yeah.
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:04.400]   What was the reaction of the FCC when you said that?
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:05.200]   Oh, nothing.
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:05.840]   They didn't know it.
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:06.880]   Did they know what you did?
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:07.440]   Just said.
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:10.320]   They reward this jerk was going to do something as a Howard Stern fan.
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:10.800]   Fine.
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:11.680]   Oh, they knew it.
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:11.920]   Okay.
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:12.880]   Yeah.
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:13.040]   Yeah.
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:15.920]   Don't you dare say Baba Bui on this show.
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:20.480]   I don't understand what this is or why it matters.
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:21.040]   It doesn't.
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.960]   What is this Baba Bui of what you speak?
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:27.920]   That's the nickname for Gary Dellebonti, the executive producer of the Howard Stern show.
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:31.680]   And people, it's a joke because he did something stupid in the game.
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:34.000]   The nickname I'll spare you the story.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:40.960]   So now when people want to disturb shows, they say they help Baba Bui.
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:45.040]   And now on golf tournaments, when somebody shot a good shot,
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:49.200]   somebody in the crowd could certainly be sure to yell Baba Bui.
[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:51.600]   And then they play it on the show.
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:51.920]   Yeah.
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:52.960]   It dissolves the,
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:57.200]   somebody once called my radio show and did that.
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:02.480]   But the most famous one, which really I think is the one that will go down in history,
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:08.560]   was during the O.J. Simpson slow speed chase in the, he's in the white Bronco
[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:11.600]   and everybody's watching on TV in the helicopters and stuff.
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:13.280]   I have a recording of it.
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:14.000]   I won't play it though.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.200]   But, and somebody calls, I think it was Tom Brokaw.
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.920]   It calls NBC.
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:24.400]   Well, it was one of his standard fake phone callers.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:25.360]   I can't remember his names.
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:28.800]   There he calls in and says, I see O.J.
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:31.680]   Oh, I know it was Peter Jennings.
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:32.480]   He's going to end.
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:34.480]   You're on the Euro City.
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:37.120]   I'm sitting in my car and I see O.J.
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:40.080]   and he is unhappy and goes on for one.
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:47.840]   And Peter Jennings is, this is on ABC on live TV going, oh, and very seriously.
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:54.320]   And then, and the guy at the end says, and Baba Bui to you all.
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:24:01.280]   And then Peter Jennings is baffled as one would be and goes, okay.
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:04.480]   And he goes, and then Al Michaels breaks in.
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:12.080]   Al Michaels says, Peter, Peter, that is the catch word of well-known radio personality,
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:12.960]   Howard Stern.
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:14.080]   It was a prank call.
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:16.400]   I have the recording.
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:17.600]   I'll play it for you someday.
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:18.880]   It is hilarious.
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:19.760]   It's hysterical.
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:22.160]   So that's really the most famous use of Baba Bui to it.
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:22.640]   Yes it is.
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:28.080]   And when somebody once did call the radio show, and I don't know what they thought,
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:29.200]   like I would be all upset.
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:30.000]   Yeah.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.920]   I was like, oh, that's nice.
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:32.480]   Good for you.
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:32.960]   Bye bye.
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:34.480]   I was like, what?
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:35.040]   So what?
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:37.840]   Mm.
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:40.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:44.000]   Hit the back button five times for where we were.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:44.480]   Where were we?
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:47.440]   FTC, not FCC FTC.
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:48.400]   On to five.
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:51.600]   Has now settled with Zoom.
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:52.640]   Actually, it's vice versa.
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:53.760]   Zoom settled with the FTC.
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:25:01.040]   The FTC was mad as many of us had been, because for years, Zoom had claimed end-to-end encryption
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:02.240]   of all calls.
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:04.000]   I didn't know Zoom was years old.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:04.960]   I know.
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:10.960]   Even as early as when the pandemic started, Zoom said video calls,
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:12.400]   particularly by end-to-end encryption.
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:14.000]   It was not Zoom had the keys.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.160]   That is not the definition of end-to-end encryption.
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:18.320]   It's the definition of the government.
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:19.200]   You wouldn't want to be like.
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:20.880]   I'm just talking about that to be.
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:23.840]   Yeah, the government wants the keys, but in this case,
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:30.560]   the FTC said Zoom maintained the cryptographic keys that allow Zoom to access the content of
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:34.080]   customer meetings and secured it Zoom meetings,
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:37.200]   apart with a lower level of encryption than promised.
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:40.800]   As Zoom said, "Yep, you got us."
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:47.280]   That was when they started, apparently, started their 90-day turnaround to encrypt everything.
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:50.160]   They paid some fee.
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:50.880]   I can't remember.
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:55.120]   It was at $15 million, something like that as a penalty.
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:58.000]   But as a settlement.
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:02.800]   But the funny part is now that COVID is over,
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:05.680]   because the election is over and we Democrats can pull back on our hoax,
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:08.400]   we were kidding all along.
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:10.960]   Okay, you dead people.
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:11.600]   Come on.
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:14.560]   I shouldn't.
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:15.360]   That's bad taste.
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:20.000]   But apparently, the news that Pfizer might have a vaccine,
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.240]   and by the way, this was a Pfizer press release,
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:26.000]   that Pfizer might have a vaccine that's 90% effective.
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:29.440]   Since Zoom shares down 14%.
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:35.120]   Netflix shares down 3.5 to 5.4%.
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:46.560]   All of the stay-at-home stocks tumbled because of the good news that there might be a vaccine.
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:49.040]   That's just silly.
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:51.840]   That's so the market just being like, "Ooh!"
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:55.120]   Swirl.
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:56.800]   Yeah, basically.
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:59.040]   The market, they came back up as the day went down.
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:26:59.760]   Did they come back?
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:00.240]   Oh, okay.
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:01.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:02.240]   Well, they went down a little bit.
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:02.960]   Amazon too.
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:07.280]   But hey, folks, we got at least a year and a half,
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:08.480]   if not two years ahead of us.
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:11.280]   B, that's a real habit of change.
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:12.160]   Oh, thank goodness.
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:15.520]   So there's the vaccine won't save us for a while, right?
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:18.080]   So Netflix stock, Zoom stock, we're fine.
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:25.200]   Teladoc, we're going to buy something by -80 degrees, set a rate freezer stock.
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:26.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:34.080]   Yeah, it requires storage at 80 below, which is going to be challenging.
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:37.680]   But so do all of those recombinant DNA.
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:39.680]   They're the RNA vaccines.
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:44.400]   So they require at least dry ice refrigeration.
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:46.080]   That's going to make it a challenge.
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:50.560]   But I just realized maybe they're going to use the same containers that bring
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:52.080]   my Caccio and Pepe from Italy.
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:52.720]   They will.
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:53.360]   Frozen.
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:53.760]   Frozen.
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:54.320]   Oh, no.
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:55.120]   W vaccine.
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:57.840]   There's a Caccio and Pepe shortage coming to save lives.
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:01.120]   So sell your trader your two stock.
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:03.200]   Quick.
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:03.520]   Quick.
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:14.080]   Tim Berners-Lee's in-rupt startup has released its first product, a privacy platform
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:16.800]   for enterprises called Solid.
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:24.800]   We had Bruce Schnire who's working on this on a show last month.
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.800]   Really intriguing.
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:27.520]   The whole idea.
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:28.960]   Remember we were talking about that blob?
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:31.280]   Stasis blob.
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:35.440]   The idea that your information should be stored in a blob that you control.
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:37.040]   It's kind of what this is all about.
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:43.280]   The Solid privacy platform allows large organizations and governments to build
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:47.920]   applications that put users in control of their data.
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:50.560]   Tim Berners-Lee, of course, invented the worldwide web.
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:57.760]   And ever since he's been paying penance, he said, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey."
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:58.000]   No.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.720]   Great guy.
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:01.280]   Wonderful.
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:02.080]   Amazing fellow.
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:05.440]   But he has always believed the web should be free and open.
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:12.320]   But he's been a little disturbed lately that these companies are making money using our data.
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:16.800]   So he created in-rupt INR-U-P-T three years ago.
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:23.440]   And now with Solid, they have an open source project that...
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:26.560]   What does it do?
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:27.840]   Can you explain this, boss?
[01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:28.320]   No.
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:30.320]   It's a server that you...
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:34.640]   It's like a server that an enterprise can set up and you put people's data onto it
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:37.200]   and you can't access it and they can, I think.
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:37.440]   Yes.
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:39.760]   Very much like the blobs, although they call them pods.
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:39.760]   Oh.
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:42.160]   They call them personal online...
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:42.760]   ...
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:44.160]   ... data stores or pods.
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:49.200]   The enterprise version consists of the solid server which manages the pods.
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:57.040]   Developers can build applications using an SDK that let you access these blobs, these data blobs.
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:58.800]   And then you can...
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:00.640]   But you maintain control of it.
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:02.000]   It's an interesting mechanism.
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:02.400]   We'll see.
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:08.560]   There are certainly some organizations, for instance, the National Health Service in the UK
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:11.120]   is building an application for patients.
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:15.360]   Who can use Solid to control their health data.
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:17.200]   So they're...
[01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:19.200]   So then the patient gives permission to the doctor to have...
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:19.760]   Yes.
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:20.800]   That's good.
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:21.280]   That's good.
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:22.080]   And you build here...
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:25.840]   ... and you build the app to talk to it correct.
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:29.200]   Yes. To request that information and wait for permission.
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:31.440]   So this is the quote from "Inrupt."
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:35.040]   "Patients will be able to permit doctors, family, or at-home caregivers
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:38.240]   to read certain data from their solid pods
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:42.480]   and add caretaking notes or observations that doctors can then read."
[01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:47.040]   So it's a central store with your personal stuff, but you control it.
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:51.600]   You keep control over it, which is, I think, a good idea.
[01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:52.720]   So basically...
[01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:59.600]   Every time I speak to Germans, you have a big database that you manually take care of.
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:00.000]   No.
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:00.960]   Different tables and...
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:02.560]   No, you don't have to take care of it.
[01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:02.880]   No.
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:03.120]   Okay.
[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:04.960]   It's like, because that does not sound fun.
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:05.360]   No.
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:05.680]   Yeah.
[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:09.440]   I was like, who is going to control this data?
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:13.280]   He keeps saying that people have control over this information.
[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:16.000]   Who exactly is it?
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.040]   Joe Schmoe.
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:20.400]   So I'm going to guess here, but this is an open source project.
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:22.800]   So I'm the National Health Service.
[01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:24.080]   I'm building a health app.
[01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:25.840]   It's in my interest.
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:28.080]   I want to protect patients' privacy.
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:30.720]   So I use the solid database within it,
[01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:32.560]   and this pods concept within it.
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:39.600]   Patients' when patient information is stored, it's not stored in a SQL server database or an
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:41.360]   Amazon bucket or anything.
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:45.680]   It's stored inside a pod, which is designed to be tightly controlled and secure.
[01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:48.640]   And the pod has interactive...
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:49.760]   Has an API or something like that.
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:51.280]   Permissions framework.
[01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:52.720]   Permissions framework.
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:57.040]   So that the physician puts stuff in there, the caretaker puts stuff in there.
[01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:58.160]   Everybody puts stuff in there.
[01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:02.080]   And then as the user, as the owner of the patient data,
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:06.720]   they will request of me permission to access that data.
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:08.960]   So I don't control it in my pockets.
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:12.720]   That was actually Stacy's original blob idea.
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:18.640]   And this is probably, I would guess, one of the issues is you've got to tell providers,
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:22.160]   you need to use this solid interface in your code.
[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:23.600]   You know, when developers run it...
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:24.960]   No, the reason is people will...
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:29.520]   The enterprises will use it and will run it and keep the data...
[01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:31.600]   Because they don't want to deal with storing your data.
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:34.320]   They want to outsource that to this company, basically.
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:35.360]   I don't think it works.
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:35.760]   I don't...
[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:36.880]   Well, then that's unclear.
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:38.480]   So I don't know.
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:43.760]   It may be like I have SQLite built into my app or my SQL built in my app.
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:46.640]   Instead of that, I have solid built into my app.
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:49.520]   And that's the data store with all of these controls.
[01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:50.800]   It's not clear to me...
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:52.720]   It's not past privacy as a service.
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:56.480]   It's not clear to me that there's a third party storing it.
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:57.840]   Okay.
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:00.160]   I thought the in-rupt people were going to store it.
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:01.920]   Yeah, I don't think so. It's an open source.
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:03.200]   Oh, okay.
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:04.800]   So no one's doing that.
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:06.320]   Because I don't think a lot of...
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:10.800]   The NHS would totally build and maintain the server
[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:13.920]   for customers using their stuff.
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:15.600]   But then what you have is useless,
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:16.880]   because it's your data in...
[01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:19.600]   Your data may be stored...
[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:21.040]   But it's all sorts of places.
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:21.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:22.000]   Everywhere.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000]   Yeah, you want that centralized thing.
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:24.320]   Yeah.
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:25.360]   It's blobs.
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:27.840]   Some blobs.
[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:28.880]   I'm not clear, actually.
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:29.920]   That's a really...
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:32.320]   And the article I'm reading on TechCrunch
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:33.280]   does not make that clear.
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:34.400]   No, because it's open source,
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:35.680]   I would imagine I could come along.
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:37.120]   I'm Pfizer, and I can come along and say,
[01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:38.160]   "I want to buy your health data."
[01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:38.880]   And here's the price.
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:40.560]   And I can say, "Yeah, good Pfizer.
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:41.760]   Here, take it. Here's the...
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:42.560]   Baby, right?"
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:44.640]   Yeah. So I don't know.
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:47.120]   And then the other issue is...
[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:47.520]   So all right.
[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:48.800]   So then I say to somebody,
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:49.440]   "You can have the data.
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:51.440]   Do they have the data in perpetuity?
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:53.120]   They have the data for a use.
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:55.440]   But how do you enforce whether they...
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:56.880]   You know, Cambridge Analytica,
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:57.440]   whether they...
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:33:58.240]   Mm.
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:00.480]   Uh, use that once or...
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:03.520]   Now have other uses of it.
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:05.200]   Okay. So...
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:09.280]   You're sort of right, uh, Stacey.
[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:10.960]   Though I'm looking at...
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:13.120]   on the solidproject.org site,
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:14.560]   get a pod in a web ID.
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:17.360]   You will pick a pod provider
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:21.040]   that will be hosting your pod.
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:22.720]   As of now, there's only two places
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:24.240]   interrupt in the solid community.
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:25.440]   Um...
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:27.040]   So...
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:27.440]   But the...
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:29.120]   I guess the theory would be you would...
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:30.640]   There would be a variety of providers.
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:32.800]   Or you can self-host.
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:35.280]   They say the way to get the most control of your data
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:36.560]   is to self-host your pod.
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:38.480]   So you're right on this one, Ant.
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:40.560]   Self-hosting means your data is physically stored
[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:41.200]   in a hard drive.
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:43.760]   You hold it home and manage by software
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:44.960]   you run on your own machine.
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:46.240]   Mm.
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:48.640]   I doubt that will be the predominant way of doing it.
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:51.600]   But somebody who's sophisticated enough to do that.
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:53.520]   I have a Synology NAS.
[01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:55.520]   I was going to say, it's like Synology.
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:57.440]   Or like, what is the...
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:57.840]   It's the...
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:59.840]   Yeah.
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:01.360]   Media server that everyone loves.
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:01.760]   Plex.
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:02.240]   Plex.
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:03.120]   Plex, thank you.
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:04.800]   So Plex runs on my Synology.
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:08.480]   There might also be a solid object that runs on my Synology
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:09.520]   where all my data is.
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:15.120]   And then maybe I have a key that when I sign up with a health plan,
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:16.800]   I say, "Here's the solid key.
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:19.040]   Please store all my data there."
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:22.080]   I think that's an interesting thing.
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:24.240]   So you'd either go to a provider that does this.
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:28.000]   A third party, trusted third party, or you could do it yourself.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.640]   So it's in a way, you know, it's like last pass.
[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:31.840]   It's like a password manager.
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:36.640]   Many password managers allow you to either use them to store your password.
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:37.280]   Oh, right.
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:38.400]   Or you store it yourself.
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:40.640]   I think that's a very...
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:41.120]   I...
[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:41.520]   You know what?
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:42.480]   It's Tim Berners-Lee.
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:45.120]   I'm not going to bet against it.
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:46.080]   It's great.
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:50.400]   Full disclosure is that I'm an advisor and a shareholder
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:53.120]   and a company that he's also an advisor and shareholder.
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:57.680]   So you know, my, I haven't seen it in ages, but...
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:35:58.240]   Yeah.
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:35:59.840]   The company?
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:02.720]   Yeah, they're still going.
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:03.120]   They're right.
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:06.480]   Oh, I thought you said you hadn't seen it in ages.
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:07.040]   Like the company has...
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:07.920]   Oh, I have an idea.
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:08.800]   Do with them in ages.
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:10.400]   Is the name TikTok?
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:12.080]   Okay.
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:14.640]   So it's Google.
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:15.040]   Google.
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:16.480]   So there are...
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:17.520]   And there are also...
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:18.480]   There's a...
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:20.080]   On the A Solid Project website,
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:22.720]   there is a showcase of solid apps.
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:26.560]   For instance, NotePod, a simple note taking out the store's notes
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:27.920]   in your solid pod.
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:30.000]   I like this idea.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.960]   It's essentially that blob you were talking about, Stacey.
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:35.920]   It's a secure enclave that you control,
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:38.240]   that you put the things you want to keep private.
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:40.640]   You either host it yourself or use the third party.
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:41.680]   And you have...
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:46.400]   There are ways you can give people access to different parts of it.
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:47.600]   This is a great idea.
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:50.000]   So the company that I've evolved in...
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.760]   I just couldn't remember the name for a second.
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:52.720]   Infinite Analytics.
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:37:01.280]   This company provides marketers with data to help them understand
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:04.560]   how to make more effective commerce recommendations.
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:06.880]   But Tim...
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:09.360]   Sir Tim came in and he asked me to be involved
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.840]   because they thought there was a media opportunity here.
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:13.040]   And the media company were...
[01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:15.680]   People were too stupid to understand the opportunity.
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:17.120]   So I became pretty useless to them.
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:20.720]   But he talked early on years ago
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:24.400]   about how you could have a trusted third party in media
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:29.360]   that would have data about the consumer's use of this media and that media.
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:31.120]   And the consumer could have some say,
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:36.000]   "Okay, yes, you can tell them all that I like playing horseshoes."
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.880]   So give me lots of horseshoes, sports data,
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:42.240]   and the consumer would then be in control of that
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:43.440]   and the same with marketers.
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:46.080]   So he's been trying to build this personal data vault
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:50.240]   where you have a market control over it for a long time.
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:51.840]   Interesting, you start with health
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:53.760]   because there really isn't a market there
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:55.760]   but there's a huge control issue there.
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:57.520]   So if you can solve it for health,
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:37:59.920]   you can probably solve it for a lot of area.
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:01.760]   Well, here they've solved it for chess.
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:03.440]   This is called solid chess.
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:04.480]   No.
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:07.600]   It's a decentralized chess game.
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:08.160]   It's a circuit about horseshoes.
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:11.040]   No central servers required to run or set up a game.
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:13.040]   So you invite somebody, you play somebody,
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:15.360]   and the data is stored in your pod.
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:17.280]   So crypto...
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:18.480]   Why do you need private chess?
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:19.520]   Well, you don't.
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:21.280]   It's a point of proof of concept.
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:23.280]   But you're storing it.
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:23.840]   You're hosting it.
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:25.200]   It's very interesting.
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:27.680]   In crypto, you could use crypto to protect it.
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:30.080]   You would use your public private key crypto
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:32.320]   to keep others out of it.
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:34.800]   I think this is very interesting.
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:36.480]   Now that I kind of understand it a little bit better,
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:37.680]   I think it seems workable.
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:39.600]   Very interesting.
[01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:42.320]   I have what may be a controversial view about crypto.
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:43.680]   What's that?
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:46.080]   It's adherence tend to be jerks.
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:47.840]   I'm an adherent.
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:53.280]   I'm an adherent, but not for currencies.
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:57.600]   I'm really excited about it for large-scale authentication
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:38:59.040]   of automated devices.
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:02.720]   I'm excited too, but it's like admiring a BMW
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:04.640]   and realizing you don't like all the drivers,
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:05.600]   because the way they drive.
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:07.440]   I have a BMW.
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:08.480]   Oh, come on.
[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:09.120]   You do?
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:10.320]   And she's a crypto engineer.
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:13.120]   But you had two strikes and you're out, Stacy.
[01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:16.000]   I have my husband.
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.400]   We buy all of our cars used in the BMW.
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:23.360]   I think it's a five series, five, three.
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:23.840]   Beautiful cars.
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:24.240]   All right.
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:24.960]   It's blue.
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:25.440]   It's cute.
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:26.240]   It's happy.
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:27.440]   That's okay.
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:30.160]   Let me take a break.
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:31.680]   And then we've got a reguy.
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:32.640]   No, wait a minute.
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:33.440]   I should do the change.
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:34.480]   I should do the change like.
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:35.440]   I should do the change like.
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:36.480]   You ready to do the change like?
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:37.760]   Play the game.
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:38.240]   Sure.
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:38.480]   Yeah.
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:39.520]   This is closer to the end.
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:40.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:41.440]   Now it has the time.
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:42.800]   Gold change log.
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:45.280]   It's change like time.
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:51.760]   You probably saw some buzz and noise on the net about
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:55.680]   Google Photos Storage Policy changing.
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:58.320]   I only have two years left.
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:39:59.280]   Oh, no.
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:01.440]   Starting in June 2021.
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:07.040]   Any new photos and videos you upload will count towards your storage,
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:10.240]   the storage, either the free 15 gigs that comes with your
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:14.000]   Google account or any additional storage you purchased as a Google One member.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:14.640]   I think I have one.
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:17.520]   Tell me my G Suite.
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:19.360]   I can use one if you can.
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:19.360]   Yeah.
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:19.760]   Please.
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:20.400]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:21.840]   No, I don't know.
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:22.560]   Different.
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:24.400]   You get a terabyte with G Suite.
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:29.520]   Your Google account storage is shared across a Gmail, Google Drive, and Photos.
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:37.440]   If you have online existing high quality photos and videos,
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:40.080]   people who bought Pixel phones, for instance, until recently.
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:42.480]   So they convinced you it was one of the benefits of buying the phone
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:43.520]   with the store your photos.
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:43.760]   Yeah.
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:49.040]   You, I have a lot of original quality photos.
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:56.320]   Any photos you've uploaded before June will not count towards your 15 gigs of free storage.
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:58.960]   So those are free and exempt from the storage limit.
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:02.720]   Apparently forever, you can verify your backup quality
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:05.680]   anytime in the Photos app by going to the backup and sync in settings.
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:10.480]   After you backup your photos, if it is an original quality, these changes do not,
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:16.240]   or if you have, these changes do not affect you because you've always,
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:19.200]   this has always been the status for original photos, right?
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:23.680]   Pixel One through five won't affect you.
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:26.000]   Nothing you need to do today.
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:31.440]   It's just that Google Photos, which used to have unlimited free storage, right?
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:34.160]   No longer has unlimited free storage.
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:38.800]   It is a sensible people knew that was coming, eventually, right?
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:40.960]   I don't know.
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:45.680]   But yeah, that's Google actually promised for, I mean, way back, I mean,
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:48.880]   I remember when Gmail launched, they were like free forever.
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:50.960]   La, la, la, and we're like, wow, great.
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:51.680]   We'll use it.
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:52.400]   Right.
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:53.360]   Yeah.
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:54.400]   I mean, that was the come on.
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:58.240]   And a lot of us have, I have 60,000 photos on Google Photos.
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:01.440]   So it's not for anymore.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.240]   Amazon still offers free unlimited original storage if you're a prime member.
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:11.920]   There are a lot of photo printing sites like a Shutterfly
[01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:14.960]   that I think you have unlimited storage there, right?
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:16.560]   And because they want you to print.
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:21.040]   And also Flickr has an unlimited pro plan to play for that.
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:22.560]   And you're paying, right.
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:23.760]   But that's not expensive.
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:26.880]   It's not, it's, I can't remember.
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:29.520]   I buy it three years at a time because I like Flickr, bro.
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:36.880]   Yeah. So yeah, I mean, this is, I guess, upsetting to people who have been putting
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:38.400]   everything on Google Photos.
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:40.160]   I think, you know, you said something interesting.
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:42.480]   I guess you really could have seen this coming because
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:47.600]   remember Google had Google 411 where, you know, you would call and you would,
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:49.280]   it was their information number.
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:51.600]   And I thought there's a great free service is good.
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:53.680]   It was, they killed it because we got enough data.
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:54.000]   Thank you.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:54.880]   Yep.
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:56.720]   And I think that's probably what's happened with photos.
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:58.240]   It's got enough data away.
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:42:58.640]   Yeah.
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:00.640]   Well, yet, Leo, yeah.
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:05.760]   There's another story somewhere in there that says Google now wants you to label your photos
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:07.600]   to help their learning sets.
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:09.360]   So that would tell me they don't have enough data.
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:10.960]   They realize their data is not good enough.
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:13.920]   That's bad because I'm, you know, it's free.
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:15.200]   I guess it's not unreasonable.
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:16.880]   Huh.
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:21.840]   Google, a new optional fetal, fetal, fetal.
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:25.200]   A new talk at long.
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:28.240]   I wonder what the halo thinks of that.
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:31.200]   A new optional feature in Google photos and Android
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:34.720]   says, hey, tag this.
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:35.920]   What is that image?
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:37.840]   Oh, gosh.
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:39.280]   That seems like a lot of work.
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:40.800]   It doesn't.
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:45.440]   And that was the whole point again of Google photos was that it knows it's a pug.
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:46.560]   Wow.
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:47.200]   Right.
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:50.640]   Tap on the search button in the apps menu.
[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:51.120]   Scroll down.
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:53.920]   You'll see an option to help improve Google photos.
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:57.520]   When you click on it, you'll be presented with four tasks.
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:03.280]   To describe your printing preferences, your preferred collages to identify which photos
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:08.880]   belong to which holiday events and to identify the contents of photos.
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:09.200]   Do you get?
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:11.040]   You'll be doing work for your Google paper.
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:12.000]   Do you get rewarded?
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:12.160]   Yeah.
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:16.720]   That's the thing they're doing to work, but they're not going to turn down any additional help.
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:18.320]   So right.
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:19.760]   That's all they're doing.
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:23.360]   I'm sure they're still working hard at all of the tagging and
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:27.280]   being able to figure out the facial recognition stuff and animal recognition.
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:28.320]   It's done pretty well with that.
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:29.600]   Downhill with that help, right?
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:30.480]   It's done very well.
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:30.640]   Right.
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:32.000]   I think the identification is good.
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:36.960]   Although, you know, the Google captures by the by the you know where they say,
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:38.320]   where are the traffic lights?
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:40.160]   So, no, I'm so.
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:41.760]   So where's the crosswalk?
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:44.640]   It's in the zone for everything that I do nowadays.
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:48.080]   And don't you know when you're doing that, you're just training Google for
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:51.520]   itself driving vehicle and you know, efforts, right?
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:54.080]   We're just giving them that because we have to.
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:57.120]   Bucks a hell out of me, but annoying.
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:02.320]   I feel like it's it's okay because what you get is worth it.
[01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:06.800]   I mean, like the knowledge you get is pretty cool, but that's just me.
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:07.920]   Yeah.
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:12.320]   Yeah, but every single time I click on.
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:14.240]   I guess I don't get a lot of captions.
[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:15.120]   Maybe that's what.
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:16.480]   Oh, I get a ton of them.
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:19.600]   You just you don't go to new places, I guess, or something.
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:21.360]   Yeah, I change.
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:22.080]   No change.
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:30.240]   Google's been working on adding pay features in its Google photos again for Google One
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:30.480]   members.
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:33.040]   They're just trying to make Google One more and more valuable.
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:41.920]   XTA developers spotted this in an APK tear down in version 4.45 in version 5.18.
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:45.760]   There's more evidence.
[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:51.360]   New prompts that will alert the user of the premium editing features and urge them to get
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:53.680]   a Google One membership.
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:58.320]   Not sure what features, maybe ColourPop is one that's locked behind the paywall.
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:10.160]   One one comment or suggested pre-processing suggestions like saying this is dog food.
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:12.880]   No, that can't be what it is.
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:14.000]   They're dog fooding it.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:14.640]   That's probably.
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:16.880]   Oh, here it is.
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:21.280]   Dynamic. I want all my pictures to look like dog food.
[01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:22.400]   Can you do that for me, Google?
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:25.760]   Dynamic HDR or vivid.
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:27.200]   These are all filters, I guess.
[01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:32.800]   Maybe new filters like afterglow, airy, ember, luminous, radiant, and stormy
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:34.800]   will be behind a paywall.
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:36.880]   I smell a CFO.
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:40.560]   Yeah, you think it's all Ruth Porat's fault?
[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:41.360]   I think so.
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:42.640]   Like this follows things.
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:43.680]   What's this making for us?
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:44.640]   I don't know. There's no ads on it.
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:45.360]   What the hell?
[01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:45.760]   Yeah.
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:48.320]   Hey, you probably smelled the shareholders too.
[01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:49.280]   Right.
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:51.360]   Ruth's just doing the bidding of the shareholders.
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:52.880]   Well, I am.
[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:53.840]   Why don't I'm not happy?
[01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:55.520]   She's the chief financial officer.
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:58.800]   You're a shareholder in Google?
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:46:59.920]   Oh, I think we've talked about this before.
[01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:00.960]   I've just said this before.
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:04.960]   I've just had a small stake in Google that is worth not knowing.
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:08.640]   I feel like every show you should introduce him like that personally.
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:09.760]   And Google's shareholder.
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:14.000]   TV guide critic and Google shareholders sound so grand.
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:18.960]   Now, OK, Stacy, let me ask the journalism professor and the journalism.
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:20.640]   Practitioner.
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:21.360]   Practitioner.
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:26.480]   So my retirement funds are invested in
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:31.280]   It's different if it's an ETF because you don't control those things.
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:32.640]   Yeah, it's mutual funds.
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:36.000]   So for instance, one of the major technology fund,
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.760]   which is hundreds of technology stocks.
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:40.800]   Google and Microsoft and Apple are in there.
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:44.080]   But I don't control what percentage of it or anything.
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:46.080]   I buy the fund, right?
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:46.560]   Yep.
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:46.880]   Right.
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:47.600]   So that's OK.
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:49.280]   I don't have to disclose because I couldn't.
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:50.080]   Funds are fine.
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:54.320]   So I mean, every publication, and I've worked for many,
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:56.240]   and they have been all above board.
[01:47:56.240 --> 01:47:59.920]   You can do ETFs.
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:02.880]   You could do mutual funds as long as you're not picking and benefiting
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:04.960]   from individual stock decisions.
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:05.440]   Yeah.
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:09.680]   The other option is to create a blind kind of trust situation.
[01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:13.600]   So for a while, my husband did it all.
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:17.440]   And I just had no idea what was in our stock portfolio.
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:17.680]   Yeah.
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:22.000]   For instance, I think Lisa, I don't want to know what they are,
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:26.320]   but Lisa has individual stocks and my wife.
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:29.600]   But I'm not trying to influence her portfolio,
[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:32.400]   and I don't know what her portfolio contains particularly.
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:36.560]   But I would say if you own individual stocks,
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:39.200]   you need to disclose that.
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:42.160]   Or is it on the website as part of your disclosure, Jeff?
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:42.720]   But I would--
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:43.360]   I have it on my--
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:43.760]   I would err.
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:45.440]   He said it in every once in a while.
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:46.080]   He said it.
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:46.480]   I say it.
[01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:49.200]   But I feel like every time you should say it because--
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:50.720]   Well, it's really-- this week in Google.
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:51.760]   Well, I know.
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:52.080]   I know.
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:56.000]   But it's more relevant when we talk about Facebook issues,
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.920]   and I raise money for the school from Facebook.
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:48:59.200]   It's pretty good about disclosing, man.
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:48:59.680]   I don't know.
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:00.880]   I've disclosed Google before.
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:04.320]   It's not like millions of dollars, right?
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:06.480]   Is it?
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:07.120]   Well--
[01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:07.840]   Oh, wow.
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:08.480]   Never mind.
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:10.560]   I think you should disclose it every time from now on.
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:11.200]   Good, but it were.
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:12.400]   And you should buy me a boat.
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:16.960]   A little tiny boat for your bathtub.
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:17.760]   Yeah, I don't--
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:20.160]   for that reason, I've never bought individual stocks.
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:22.000]   But that also, because I feel like I don't know
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:22.800]   what the hell I'm doing.
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:25.440]   And if I buy an individual stock, I'm going to be burned anyway.
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:25.680]   Yeah.
[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:26.240]   I mean, I had--
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:28.320]   I had before I joined the show.
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:28.720]   Right.
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:29.360]   No, no, you did.
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:33.920]   And you know, there are some sad stories associated with this.
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:35.040]   We had a guy--
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:38.080]   wonderful guy, Scott Born, who was a regular on Mac Break Weekly.
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:41.760]   And I said, he had a fairly hefty holding in Apple.
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:44.960]   And he says, I told him he had a selling.
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:46.960]   He did.
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:48.400]   And he never will let me forget it,
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:50.880]   because it's gone up like 800 times since.
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:51.920]   Oh, no.
[01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:52.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:52.800]   Oh, no.
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:53.280]   Oh, no.
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:53.760]   I've had to--
[01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:54.320]   I mean--
[01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:56.080]   That's the bird photographer.
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:56.400]   The bird?
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:57.680]   Yeah, Scott's great.
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:00.640]   And Scott is an unabashed Apple fan.
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:02.160]   So regardless, I don't--
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:06.800]   I don't-- you know, nobody expects him to say bad things about Apple anyway.
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:10.240]   So anyway, I guess I feel like--
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:10.640]   Wait, wait.
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:14.240]   I'm not happy, Ant, if rooted this.
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:15.680]   So there.
[01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:18.000]   I'm going to this photo thing, because I think this is penny pinching.
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:19.840]   Google should not be a penny pinching company.
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:22.000]   Did you know--
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:22.480]   So he's going to--
[01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:27.200]   Scott Born recently tweeted within the last half hour.
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:31.040]   For those asking, yes, I'm tempted by the new Apple Max.
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:33.120]   But for once in my life,
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:34.320]   I'm going to be smart.
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:35.600]   I'm not going to be a--
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:36.640]   That's a surprise.
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:37.680]   --new, unproven--
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:41.120]   I remember waiting on a street corner outside the Apple Store.
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:42.640]   San Francisco was Scott,
[01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:47.520]   because he had a tower taller than him of new Macintosh computers.
[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:48.000]   Yeah.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.240]   And I was kind of like saying, all right, I'll protect you.
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:51.200]   I'll protect you.
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:52.960]   That was the day they were released.
[01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:56.560]   So this is definitely showing some unusual--
[01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:58.080]   Restraint?
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:00.720]   Restraint on the part of Mr. Born.
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:04.000]   I have, on the other hand, before the announcement was over,
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.320]   had purchased a MacBook Pro 13.
[01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:07.120]   Yeah.
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:08.240]   I know this is an Apple.
[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:09.360]   I know we're in the change log.
[01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:10.400]   But what's your quick review?
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:11.840]   Was I had no chance to watch the coverage?
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:12.960]   Well, I don't have it yet.
[01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:13.920]   But I'll let you know.
[01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:14.960]   Oh, but I mean, no.
[01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:15.520]   Of what they did.
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:17.120]   Are you happy about the--
[01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:17.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:18.160]   --the chip about the design?
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:18.960]   Huge.
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:19.440]   Huge.
[01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:20.240]   Huge.
[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:23.040]   Potentially, this could be a revolution in desktop computing.
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:28.880]   It's the first time in a long time we've had one company make the entire stack,
[01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:33.120]   the software, the hardware, the chips, everything.
[01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:33.920]   And it was a lot of--
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:33.920]   And it was a lot of--
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:34.640]   --and the pricing.
[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:36.320]   Well, yeah.
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:38.880]   They'd actually dropped the price of some of the products.
[01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:40.960]   All the products stayed at the same price.
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:43.760]   But potentially, with an increased--
[01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:46.400]   significantly increased battery life and performance.
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:48.000]   So-- but it remains to be seen.
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.040]   That's Apple saying it.
[01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:49.920]   We'll see.
[01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:52.800]   And the first reviews will come out probably next week,
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:54.240]   round about this time.
[01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:57.520]   And the first hardware will arrive a week from Friday.
[01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:00.000]   How is a desktop revolution?
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:00.480]   What is--
[01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:00.800]   What is--
[01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:01.280]   Just--
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:02.640]   Well, partly because of that.
[01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:03.920]   Apple's making their own--
[01:52:03.920 --> 01:52:06.880]   they're saying goodbye to Intel and making their own processors.
[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:10.000]   And there is an absolute synergy, I think,
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.960]   to one company making the entire hardware stack,
[01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:14.320]   hardware and software stack.
[01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:15.520]   Because everything could be tuned.
[01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:16.720]   Do you know what big CERN needs?
[01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:19.440]   You know what the applications running on your system need.
[01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:20.960]   You know what they do not need.
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:24.800]   Instead of buying off the shelf processors from another company
[01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:26.880]   that's making a generalized chip,
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:30.400]   you're buying-- you're designing, building, and making chips
[01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:34.320]   that are specifically for your particular use case
[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:36.880]   that I think has a lot of potential.
[01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:38.000]   They're also--
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:42.560]   This is-- this hardware platform is very forward looking.
[01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:45.760]   They're doing things Intel does not--
[01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:49.600]   apparently cannot do including a five nanometer process,
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:51.360]   unified memory architecture.
[01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:55.120]   They're-- they have one system on a chip
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:59.040]   that has everything, including the DRAM is on that one chip,
[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:03.600]   which means that the DRAM is faster than any
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:04.960]   outboard commercial RAM.
[01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:09.200]   Even their integrated video can't be looked at the same.
[01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:09.840]   Right.
[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:11.920]   Yeah, well, we talked about that because people are saying,
[01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:13.840]   well, what about-- I want an Nvidia card.
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:16.960]   Well, we have to see, but it's potentially faster
[01:53:16.960 --> 01:53:19.120]   than what Nvidia could do, even though it's shared memory.
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:21.520]   Well, it's just-- you can't compare the two
[01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:22.880]   because it's such a different architecture.
[01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:23.280]   Got it.
[01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:23.760]   Thank you.
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:24.800]   There's a lot of potential.
[01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:26.560]   It's going to be very interesting.
[01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:29.040]   I would not-- if you don't have a dog in this,
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:30.720]   I wouldn't-- I like even Scott Born.
[01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:32.480]   I wouldn't run out and get the first one.
[01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:34.640]   I would wait and see what--
[01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:35.520]   because there are going to be issues.
[01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:37.600]   There are going to be compatibility issues
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:38.480]   because it's not Intel.
[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:41.280]   And all the software up to now has been written for Intel.
[01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:43.440]   So there may be issues there, although Apple's very good
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:43.600]   at that.
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:46.160]   They have a lot of experience with that kind of transition.
[01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:48.400]   This is their third time changing chip platforms.
[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:51.520]   But also, there'll be issues that--
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:53.440]   we don't know what the performance will look like
[01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:56.880]   or if there'll be showstoppers or if it'll get hot or we don't
[01:53:56.880 --> 01:53:59.200]   know any of that stuff and we won't until we get in our hands.
[01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:01.040]   So there are unknowns.
[01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:04.960]   However, on the face of it, it looks very, very positive.
[01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:06.480]   Sorry, Stacey.
[01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:07.360]   I just liked them in the show.
[01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:08.000]   But I--
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.120]   I think Stacey's interested.
[01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:09.760]   No, no, that wasn't good.
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:10.400]   She's all in it.
[01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:11.200]   She's good.
[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:12.160]   Yeah, it was all about it.
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:12.720]   It was all about it.
[01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:13.760]   It's like the chips.
[01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:14.400]   It's chips.
[01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:15.120]   I'm here for that.
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:15.440]   Yeah.
[01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:16.400]   You're having a chip.
[01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:16.800]   Yeah.
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:19.600]   I would-- if you're interested-- because the problem is--
[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:22.480]   and this is Apple, they don't give you--
[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:24.480]   they never even mentioned clock speeds at all.
[01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:25.680]   No, they did.
[01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:26.560]   Zero.
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:31.120]   So they did a lot of graphs with literally no numbers on the axes.
[01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:32.800]   So you don't know what am I looking at here?
[01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:37.040]   But there was a very good piece in an on-tech,
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:41.600]   kind of an unusual piece in an on-tech because based on very little information,
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:46.640]   they were able to do a lot of sleuthing, including they took a soap screen of the chip
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:50.080]   and were able to figure out what all the pieces were.
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:50.640]   Wow.
[01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:51.200]   Wow.
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:53.280]   One of the things that's going to be very interesting--
[01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:54.960]   Stacy, I'd be curious what you think about this.
[01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:56.640]   We were talking about this on Windows Weekly.
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:54:59.360]   There's a 16-core neural engine on this chip.
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:02.800]   So you've got eight GPU cores.
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:09.440]   You've got four high-performance CPUs, four high-efficiency CPUs for a total of eight.
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:14.880]   But in addition to all of that, notice the RAM is right here on the chip.
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:22.240]   In addition to that, you have a 16-core neural engine, a machine learning engine built in.
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:26.000]   This is the kind of thing you get on phones, but Apple's putting in desktops.
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:27.520]   I wonder who that's for.
[01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:29.840]   That's what the emotions are at.
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:32.400]   Yeah, you can--
[01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:33.360]   You probably would--
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:33.760]   Graphics.
[01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:37.520]   Yeah, I was like, there's tons of stuff that you're going to want to do locally on your
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:41.840]   AI stuff that you want to do locally on your computer.
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:47.760]   And it could be, yeah, I don't know.
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:48.240]   Could you--
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:52.320]   The fact that Apple would devote such a significant portion of--
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:55.040]   I mean, they had a lot of transistors.
[01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:55.760]   I think it's--
[01:55:55.760 --> 01:55:56.160]   What was it?
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:56:00.960]   16 billion or 18 billion transistors on this thing, which is mind-boggling.
[01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:06.080]   And this is different from the bionic processor on the phones.
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:09.120]   Maybe they just stuck it in there just to see what people would do with it.
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:13.840]   Oh, oh, what about these things running VR?
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:16.320]   Or like a headset?
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:17.520]   Well, what's also interesting--
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:19.440]   So this is an interesting point too.
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:24.000]   These chips, they're dubbed M1, are distinct from the iPhone chips.
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:28.160]   We thought maybe they'll take the iPhone A14 and the new A14 iPad chip
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:29.920]   and do something similar.
[01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:32.480]   It's clearly based on that platform, but it's different.
[01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:35.680]   And so it's not that they said, well, we got these chips,
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:37.040]   we're just going to put it in the desktop.
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:40.960]   They've definitely done other things that are specific to desktop.
[01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:45.760]   So they have the capability of saying, and we're going to do one for VR,
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:46.400]   and we're going to do--
[01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:50.000]   But they're not designing a general chip.
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:56.000]   That's the whole point, is these chips are tuned to the use case very precisely.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:00.240]   So I don't think they put in a 16-core neural engine unless they see a use case
[01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:02.160]   in desktop computing.
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:02.960]   And it's not--
[01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:07.280]   I mean, if you're not a researcher, if you're using Microsoft Office and Chrome,
[01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:09.760]   do you need neural engine in there?
[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:10.400]   I don't know.
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:11.120]   Well, maybe you do.
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:11.600]   I don't know.
[01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:13.200]   Not yet.
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:13.680]   Not yet.
[01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:15.840]   So maybe they're thinking of something.
[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:18.480]   Well, yeah, because how long do you keep a map?
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:19.280]   Or how long--
[01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:21.520]   Let's say probably average of three to four years?
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:23.040]   Yeah, three to four years, yeah.
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:24.960]   So, yeah.
[01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:29.920]   I would say three to four years, we could be looking at needing some sort of--
[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:35.360]   I'm so now sucked into the IoT world.
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:38.000]   I'm like, of course, you need edge processing or edge.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.200]   But yeah, I don't know.
[01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:49.280]   So, Ann, does this wet your whistle in terms of graphics and photos and stuff like that?
[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:52.960]   Do you see possibilities for all of this?
[01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:54.640]   In a word?
[01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:54.880]   Yeah.
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:55.440]   Yes.
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:56.560]   Oh, really?
[01:57:56.560 --> 01:57:57.520]   Because you're a Windows guy.
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:57:59.440]   That's why I'm asking it.
[01:57:59.440 --> 01:57:59.680]   Yeah.
[01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:03.840]   It was exciting for me, first off, because of the pricing.
[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:07.360]   I've always been interested in the Mac operating system,
[01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:10.080]   but I could never justify the cost.
[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:16.000]   If I had three grand to spin, I can get X amount of hardware specs with that
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:21.280]   three grand on the Windows side versus something a lot less on the Mac side.
[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:24.400]   So, I've always sort of stuck around on the Windows side of things.
[01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:27.840]   But they've obviously changed that.
[01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:35.680]   And then they've already gotten Adobe linked in with this and got support for Lightroom and Photoshop
[01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:36.960]   right already out the box.
[01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:38.000]   So, yeah.
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.080]   Sign you up.
[01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:45.520]   So, the author of this in Antec article, Andre from Asano, who spends a lot of time
[01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:46.560]   with processors.
[01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:48.640]   He's kind of a processor nerd.
[01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:51.600]   Has this to say at the end.
[01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:58.160]   Apple is absolutely leading the pack in terms of performance and power efficiency.
[01:58:58.160 --> 01:59:02.800]   Based on testing the chips in the phone and the tablet,
[01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:07.120]   the design was more than able to compete and beat integrated graphics designs.
[01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:10.960]   Apple claims the M1 to be the fastest CPU in the world,
[01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:15.760]   given our data on the A14 and the iPhone beating all of Intel's designs
[01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:18.720]   and just falling short of AMD's newest Zen 3 chips,
[01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:23.760]   a higher-clock firestorm, that's the performance chip above 3 GHz,
[01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:30.560]   the 50% larger L2 cache, and an unleashed TDP total power consumption.
[01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:34.800]   We can certainly believe Apple and the M1 to be able to achieve that claim,
[01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:36.240]   the fastest CPU in the world.
[01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:40.960]   This moment is brewing for years now and the new Apple Silicon is both shocking,
[01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:43.760]   but also very much expected in the coming weeks.
[01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:47.040]   We'll be trying to get our hands on the new hardware and verify Apple's claim.
[01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:52.160]   Intel has stagnated itself out of the market and has lost a major customer today.
[01:59:52.160 --> 01:59:54.800]   AMD has shown lots of progress lately.
[01:59:54.800 --> 01:59:59.440]   However, it'll be incredibly hard to catch up to Apple's power efficiency.
[02:00:00.240 --> 02:00:05.520]   That's because X86 is inherently much less efficient.
[02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:08.080]   If Apple's performance trajectory continues at this pace,
[02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:11.920]   the X86 performance crown might never be regained.
[02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:20.240]   I've been calling for the end of, well, not the end of, but what is it when you stop being
[02:00:20.240 --> 02:00:21.760]   the supremacy?
[02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:26.800]   So the relegation of X86 to where it belongs, because now...
[02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:27.600]   Oh, my gosh, it's terrible.
[02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:30.480]   Well, it's just not efficient.
[02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:34.720]   And where everything needs to be battery powered forever, why would you...
[02:00:34.720 --> 02:00:44.160]   And we have so much capability, so much capability to design custom processors
[02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:46.720]   and chip designers.
[02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:49.200]   Everybody's doing it.
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:50.960]   I think it makes sense that they're doing it.
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:53.520]   I don't know what else to say about this.
[02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:56.240]   There are some other interesting things.
[02:00:56.240 --> 02:01:04.640]   For instance, it's a highly parallel chip, a huge increase over what Intel and AMD are doing in parallelism.
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:09.600]   So that's also very interesting.
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:15.520]   The size of the pipelines here is remarkable.
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:22.640]   So that's the point is they're doing things that make it very difficult to do.
[02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:24.080]   Oh, well, that's a 3 GHz chip.
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:25.200]   That's a 3 GHz.
[02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:27.600]   It has nothing to do with clock speed.
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:31.840]   And I think that they'll be the same complaint about RAM, because they're all maxed out right now.
[02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:33.120]   It's 16 gigs of RAM.
[02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:35.920]   But I don't know if you can judge it because...
[02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:37.120]   It could even matter, right?
[02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:39.040]   Yeah, how they're using RAM is different.
[02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:40.720]   iPhones have never had much RAM.
[02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:47.200]   So I think we just have to wait until they come out and say, well, let's open some programs.
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:48.240]   Let's do some head-heads.
[02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:48.720]   Oh, yes.
[02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:54.800]   I'll also say that regarding the Adobe part of it, what they were showing
[02:01:54.800 --> 02:02:00.000]   was Adobe Lightroom, not Lightroom Classic, and people that used Adobe Suite know that
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.080]   Lightroom Classic is a beast.
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:08.000]   A big part is trying to have resources to run it.
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.520]   I'm still waiting to see what's going to happen with that.
[02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:15.680]   And from the AMD side of things, I'm an AMD fan.
[02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:18.960]   I've never really bought into it until side of things.
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:24.480]   And AMD has been rather exciting for content creators and how they work with
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:30.320]   the likes of Lightroom and Premiere Pro, where you don't necessarily have to offload into GPU
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:31.120]   acceleration.
[02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:34.480]   The chips are handling quite a bit of the task already.
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:40.800]   But I think Stacy's point is really well taken, which is that X86 should have ended up life
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:42.400]   end of life a decade ago.
[02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:42.640]   Yeah.
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:45.360]   And thought it was going to and then it failed.
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:45.600]   Yeah, it has.
[02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:46.400]   It hasn't, right?
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:51.840]   And so I think that it's high time to see if we can replace X86 with something better.
[02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:52.880]   Well, and they tried.
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:55.440]   I mean, remember, do you remember Lirope?
[02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:55.760]   Yeah.
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:02:58.480]   I mean, they, that was 2008.
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:01.200]   No, I Tatum was actually that was AMD.
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:02.800]   Wasn't that no, that was Intel.
[02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:03.920]   That was Intel.
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:04.160]   Yeah.
[02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:07.920]   And the problem was it was so damn hot that it couldn't work.
[02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:09.280]   Yeah.
[02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:11.600]   So what was she?
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:17.680]   I bought the fast theoretically, I think the fastest one, the MacBook Pro 16,
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:18.880]   a 13 rather.
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:20.640]   So we'll see.
[02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:23.280]   I will do it theoretically.
[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:24.080]   The fastest one.
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:25.440]   Yeah, it's unknown.
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:27.120]   And you know, this is the M1.
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:31.280]   You know, there'll be many, many, many generations after this.
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:33.680]   So it's going to be fair.
[02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:36.400]   I think it's, I think it's high time we got rid of X86.
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:38.560]   Only Apple could do this.
[02:03:38.560 --> 02:03:40.960]   Microsoft can't leave X86 behind.
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:45.360]   So it's going to be until our AMD on Windows for a long time.
[02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:49.040]   They, there are attempts have just been horribly slow.
[02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:52.080]   So don't call it a wind tell monopoly for nothing.
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:52.880]   Yeah, right.
[02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:53.360]   Right.
[02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:56.240]   By the way, YouTube is down for everybody right now.
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:04:01.360]   I just, oh, yeah, I don't know what's going on, but I just have been in free.
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:02.240]   Horace right again.
[02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:02.640]   And we watch tonight.
[02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:05.840]   Oh, I don't know.
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:06.320]   Is it back?
[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:06.960]   No, is it back?
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:07.520]   No, it's back.
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:08.560]   Is it?
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:09.440]   I can watch.
[02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:09.840]   Let me see.
[02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:12.480]   I'm watching Olive and Mabel.
[02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:13.920]   Are you able to watch some?
[02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:14.480]   Let me see.
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:14.960]   I don't know.
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:17.520]   No.
[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:20.320]   Oh, I can't see.
[02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:21.120]   Olive and Mabel.
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:24.240]   Well, how about YouTube.com/twit?
[02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:26.960]   I think, yeah.
[02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:29.840]   So, so the YouTube site is working.
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:31.280]   The video streaming is down.
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:35.440]   So that means that's a different part of the overall.
[02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:37.280]   See our live stream.
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:39.520]   Yeah.
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:42.960]   Same problem with YouTube music.
[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:43.600]   No, hold on.
[02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:44.160]   If it's done.
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:49.040]   So what's the, is there, there must be a Google status page.
[02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:49.520]   Let me see.
[02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:54.320]   Is that part of the change log if YouTube is down?
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:59.280]   That's part of the change log.
[02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:04.880]   Yeah, look, I see a bunch of red exclamation marks next to Google Compute Engine.
[02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:07.440]   Oh, even music.
[02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:09.440]   And music is down too.
[02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:12.400]   Music rests on the YouTube.
[02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:15.040]   So service disruption coming from the Compute Engine.
[02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:17.440]   So that would mean much more than YouTube.
[02:05:17.440 --> 02:05:23.440]   That would mean anybody running on Google Compute might be having problems.
[02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:23.920]   I don't know.
[02:05:23.920 --> 02:05:25.600]   Snapchat.
[02:05:25.600 --> 02:05:26.640]   See if Snapchat's up.
[02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:28.800]   It's like a small, no, that's not it.
[02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:29.360]   This isn't--
[02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:30.720]   They're a GCP customer.
[02:05:30.720 --> 02:05:31.680]   This is not related to--
[02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:35.680]   That's just that and that looks like it's fixed too, by the way.
[02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:39.120]   So yeah, Google's not reporting a status problem right now.
[02:05:39.120 --> 02:05:42.480]   It's available that there was a problem with Compute.
[02:05:42.480 --> 02:05:44.320]   All right.
[02:05:44.320 --> 02:05:45.520]   Keep an eye on it.
[02:05:45.520 --> 02:05:47.440]   Is it an overall in a disruption?
[02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:48.320]   We stole the change log.
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:49.840]   Well, that was the change.
[02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:56.080]   Google's going to factor page speed and experience into search results starting in May.
[02:05:56.080 --> 02:05:58.960]   So you better get your page loaded fast.
[02:05:58.960 --> 02:06:00.720]   And the experience part is interesting too.
[02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:01.840]   How do they measure that?
[02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:03.280]   They'll load their there.
[02:06:03.280 --> 02:06:04.000]   It's in the story.
[02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:04.320]   Yeah.
[02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:04.800]   It's criteria.
[02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:10.640]   So core web vitals loading, interactivity, visual stability.
[02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:15.040]   Will it be mobile friendly, safe, browsing friendly, HTTPS?
[02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:17.280]   That's something Google's been--
[02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:19.280]   No intrusive insurstitials.
[02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:21.120]   I can finally get that thing off my page.
[02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:22.320]   Dropping stasis that?
[02:06:22.320 --> 02:06:25.040]   Is that an intrusive insurstitial when you drop that?
[02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:25.680]   I think so.
[02:06:25.680 --> 02:06:29.280]   I tell my husband, he's like, it works.
[02:06:29.280 --> 02:06:30.320]   I'm like, ah.
[02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:33.520]   Towing everybody does it, Stacey.
[02:06:33.520 --> 02:06:36.000]   It's not your husband's all that long line.
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:37.360]   It's less intrusive than others.
[02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:39.360]   It's intrusive, but less so than others.
[02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:41.280]   I don't have any annoying ads though.
[02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:42.880]   I just have tiny banners on the side.
[02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:44.560]   So if you can sit through that interstitial,
[02:06:44.560 --> 02:06:46.480]   nothing else is going to do anything.
[02:06:46.480 --> 02:06:47.440]   You know the problem with it is?
[02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:48.320]   You think you're fine.
[02:06:48.320 --> 02:06:49.920]   You think you're home free then suddenly.
[02:06:49.920 --> 02:06:51.360]   Oh, oops.
[02:06:51.360 --> 02:06:52.400]   I know.
[02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:53.200]   Oh, sorry.
[02:06:53.200 --> 02:06:55.280]   So Jody just started.
[02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:55.920]   Oh good.
[02:06:55.920 --> 02:06:56.800]   So it's back.
[02:06:56.800 --> 02:06:57.440]   No, it's not.
[02:06:57.440 --> 02:07:00.320]   I'm still spinning on their live stream.
[02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:03.680]   I started listening to that.
[02:07:03.680 --> 02:07:04.240]   It's good.
[02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:04.960]   Isn't it good?
[02:07:04.960 --> 02:07:05.200]   Yeah.
[02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:06.960]   It's pretty old stuff.
[02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:08.880]   Like a very old stuff.
[02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:09.520]   Yeah.
[02:07:09.520 --> 02:07:10.320]   It's your play.
[02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:11.280]   Stop, Jody.
[02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:12.160]   I love you, but stop.
[02:07:12.160 --> 02:07:13.600]   Sorry.
[02:07:13.600 --> 02:07:17.840]   Yeah, it's very folky at the beginning.
[02:07:17.840 --> 02:07:18.080]   Yeah.
[02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:21.920]   Let's see what else is going on in the world of Google.
[02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:24.720]   Google hides free movies.
[02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:28.960]   There's 40 classic movies hidden in maps,
[02:07:28.960 --> 02:07:31.040]   but sorry you have to be in the UK.
[02:07:31.040 --> 02:07:33.440]   It's a virtual scavenger hunt.
[02:07:33.440 --> 02:07:35.680]   I'm guessing nobody's using maps these days.
[02:07:35.680 --> 02:07:37.200]   Is nobody's going anywhere?
[02:07:37.200 --> 02:07:41.120]   It's part of their Google Pixel Presents Mobile Cinema Campaign
[02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:44.560]   along in collaboration with the British Film Institute,
[02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:46.960]   Skyfall, Shawn of the Dead,
[02:07:46.960 --> 02:07:50.880]   the Phantom Thread, good movie, Wallace and Gromit,
[02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:52.400]   Curse of the Wear Rabbit.
[02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:54.000]   That is a good movie too.
[02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:57.760]   Wednesday day of Gromit,
[02:07:57.760 --> 02:08:02.320]   fans will be able to search a map of the UK to find key locations
[02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:06.800]   after following clues with the films then being made available to watch from anywhere.
[02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:07.520]   That's pretty cool.
[02:08:07.520 --> 02:08:09.520]   Wait a minute.
[02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:12.000]   Hold your horses.
[02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:16.080]   Participants will have to ensure that mobile device
[02:08:16.080 --> 02:08:18.160]   connects to a 5G network.
[02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:20.400]   Oh, holy shooing hands.
[02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:21.760]   I put this in your hall next to that.
[02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:23.360]   God, for reasons everywhere.
[02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:24.080]   Oh, it's exactly.
[02:08:24.080 --> 02:08:24.640]   Bullocks.
[02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:26.240]   Bullocks.
[02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:28.240]   Well played, Mr. Ant.
[02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:28.720]   Well played.
[02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:34.320]   YouTube premium members are being offered.
[02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:35.120]   I'm excited.
[02:08:36.080 --> 02:08:37.120]   I haven't seen that.
[02:08:37.120 --> 02:08:39.600]   The premier edition of the Stadia package.
[02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:40.160]   Of Stadia?
[02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:42.160]   Yeah, I've not seen that yet.
[02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:43.600]   And I'm a YouTube premium member,
[02:08:43.600 --> 02:08:47.600]   but I've not seen any notification about Stadia, not that I'll play on.
[02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:49.760]   Well, here's a link to see if you're eligible.
[02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:54.640]   Simply click this link and yes, I am.
[02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:56.080]   Free Stadia controller free.
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:08:59.200]   This is funny because I signed up for this and then I canceled before I got it
[02:08:59.200 --> 02:09:00.720]   because I thought, I'm not going to use that.
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:03.120]   It's a $99 value.
[02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:07.120]   Yours for free if you are a YouTube premium member.
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:10.000]   I can get my Stadia gift right now.
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:13.760]   So let me click this.
[02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:15.040]   There's a link in the article.
[02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:15.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:16.960]   Clicking that now.
[02:09:16.960 --> 02:09:17.520]   Yeah.
[02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:18.960]   Yes, get your gift.
[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:22.240]   But I thought I was supposed to get some sort of email notification.
[02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:23.200]   I hadn't seen a thing.
[02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:26.640]   But I'll take my free gift now.
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:30.160]   Okay, apparently now I have to choose a Stadia avatar.
[02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:32.160]   These are hideous.
[02:09:32.240 --> 02:09:33.200]   Yes.
[02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:35.280]   Which one should I choose kids?
[02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:38.240]   Cupcake?
[02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:40.000]   Be cupcake?
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:41.040]   Or what?
[02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:42.480]   I kind of like the dinosaur.
[02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:44.480]   Because I am.
[02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:46.960]   Another dinosaur.
[02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:47.200]   Yeah.
[02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:49.520]   All right.
[02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:50.480]   Now I next.
[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:53.520]   Your Stadia name is public.
[02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:55.280]   I'm going to say chief,
[02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:55.600]   twit.
[02:09:55.600 --> 02:09:57.760]   Don't use your real name.
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:00.080]   Oh, okay.
[02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:03.120]   That's how I will appear to other players.
[02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:05.680]   Chief Twit the dinosaur.
[02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:07.360]   So you also have to buy a Stadia Pro.
[02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:08.480]   No, no.
[02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:10.640]   Oh, you do this.
[02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:13.200]   One, claim your free Stadia Premier Edition.
[02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:14.720]   Two, sign up for Stadia Pro.
[02:10:14.720 --> 02:10:16.080]   Oh, son of a gun.
[02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:18.400]   Three, get your redemption email.
[02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:20.240]   Four, redeem in Google store for free.
[02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:22.560]   Oh, what the hell with you studio Google?
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:23.920]   How much is, how much is it?
[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:24.720]   Ten bucks a month?
[02:10:24.720 --> 02:10:25.840]   I don't know.
[02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:26.480]   I don't play.
[02:10:26.480 --> 02:10:27.760]   I'm not paying for games.
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:28.560]   Nope, me neither.
[02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:31.680]   I've got Animal Crossing New Horizons.
[02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:33.040]   That's all I need.
[02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:38.320]   Google has added status updates to the Pixel's personal safety.
[02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:38.800]   Ten bucks.
[02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:40.400]   Yeah, ten bucks a month.
[02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:42.080]   So it was nice.
[02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:44.720]   They were going to give me a free joystick, a free copilot.
[02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:45.520]   So what's ultra?
[02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:48.400]   Just to give me a little.
[02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:49.600]   All that lollipop out of your mouth.
[02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:50.160]   I can.
[02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:51.040]   Yeah, you brat.
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:53.360]   Google.
[02:10:53.360 --> 02:10:58.080]   So this personal safety app,
[02:10:58.080 --> 02:10:58.960]   which do you use it?
[02:10:58.960 --> 02:10:59.680]   Does anybody use it?
[02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:00.160]   It's nice.
[02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:07.520]   You can now send out a status page in which you would say,
[02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:09.120]   "I'm doing okay."
[02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:14.240]   That would be, I guess, for if there's a disaster in your neighborhood or something.
[02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:15.600]   Yep.
[02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:17.360]   I thought they killed that.
[02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:21.440]   They just killed the thing where Facebook did it.
[02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:21.760]   Yeah.
[02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:23.760]   I like that, frankly.
[02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:27.120]   Google also had a thing where you could find your long lost friends.
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:29.520]   In the storm, but they took that.
[02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:32.080]   They did stop that?
[02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:33.280]   I think so.
[02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:33.920]   I can't remember.
[02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:35.920]   It was funny that all that stuff used to be.
[02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:37.920]   That all that stuff used to be.
[02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:38.800]   Everybody used to do that.
[02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:41.680]   We're all in it together and now it's the hell with them.
[02:11:41.680 --> 02:11:47.280]   Google Maps is getting a "Tripps" tab that shows your...
[02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:49.200]   Oh, this is sad.
[02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:51.120]   This is, this is, this is cruel.
[02:11:51.120 --> 02:11:55.040]   Your last vacations before COVID-19.
[02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:56.000]   Isn't that cruel?
[02:11:57.440 --> 02:11:59.040]   I, yes.
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:01.200]   I think it's kind of nice that they, like,
[02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:03.040]   whenever I get my little thing that's like,
[02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:04.960]   "Hey, here's where you've been this month."
[02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:07.920]   It lets you know it's like, by the way,
[02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:09.440]   you probably haven't been in a lot of places
[02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:10.720]   because you're in a lockdown area.
[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:11.200]   Yeah.
[02:12:11.200 --> 02:12:12.160]   I think, thank you.
[02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:14.160]   Remember when you used to go places?
[02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:18.560]   Is there anywhere in the US that is not lockdown right now?
[02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:21.680]   Well, Google serves the rest of the world, so.
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:22.960]   Yeah.
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:25.520]   But most places, I would imagine.
[02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:28.480]   There are plenty of places that do not have the,
[02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:31.280]   we're, we're special in a way that we're not.
[02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:33.200]   To Atlanta, Texas, Florida.
[02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:34.240]   Oh, yeah.
[02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:36.560]   Yeah.
[02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:39.440]   We're very purple right now.
[02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:40.640]   Yep.
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:41.360]   Unfortunately.
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:43.120]   Unfortunately, here in Sonoma County.
[02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:47.920]   Um, I think, unless somebody has something else,
[02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:50.240]   that's the Google change law.
[02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:58.160]   I did want to mention to Mr. Jarvis, though, about maps,
[02:12:58.160 --> 02:13:00.400]   how he says, "Is anybody even using maps?"
[02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:03.360]   I think, I still use maps for a couple things,
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:06.560]   for just keeping track of the hard heads,
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:09.040]   if they say, "Hey, we need to go so and so,
[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:11.680]   so on, tell them I turned the maps on so I can see you."
[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:15.200]   And then also, depending on what I'm watching on television,
[02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:18.160]   I'll open up maps just to look at it as a reference
[02:13:18.160 --> 02:13:20.000]   for what I'm watching on television.
[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:23.520]   It just, your voice thing is making you sound curious now.
[02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:25.040]   That's good.
[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:26.160]   That's good curiosity.
[02:13:26.160 --> 02:13:27.440]   I am curious, Ant.
[02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:31.520]   Um, that's a reference, but they're too young.
[02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:32.560]   They're way too young.
[02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:33.280]   Yeah.
[02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:36.320]   The, but it occurs to me.
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:39.120]   So, yeah, I used to always just, I'm not going to turn on,
[02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:42.000]   ways in the car.
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000]   And now, in the rare moments when I go somewhere,
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.560]   I don't bother.
[02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:47.360]   I know where I'm going.
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:47.760]   I don't bother.
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:49.680]   I only go three places.
[02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:50.320]   Exactly.
[02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:54.160]   Um, we had an advertiser about a decade ago.
[02:13:54.160 --> 02:13:55.680]   I was a big fan of it.
[02:13:55.680 --> 02:13:58.160]   Everybody was really into the sling box.
[02:13:58.160 --> 02:13:58.880]   You remember that?
[02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:03.280]   I remember listening to TI, one of their chip engineers
[02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:05.920]   explained the new chip inside the sling box.
[02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:07.520]   Low at God.
[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:10.320]   It was like, what, 12 or 13 years ago now?
[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:10.480]   Yeah.
[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:11.840]   Yeah, I was really sad.
[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:12.720]   Actually, I wasn't sad.
[02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:13.440]   This makes sense.
[02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:17.440]   Monday, they stopped selling it a long time ago, I think.
[02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:19.440]   But Monday, Disha, and asked,
[02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:23.200]   they're going to turn off the sling box servers.
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.880]   So they'll continue to operate for a couple more years.
[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:29.440]   But after that, the hardware won't work.
[02:14:29.440 --> 02:14:31.760]   It needs, I didn't really realize this.
[02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:33.920]   Because it feels like you're just connecting to your
[02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:36.640]   home entertainment system from the road.
[02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:38.320]   That's what people used it for.
[02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:41.760]   But I guess for Nat traversal, you have to go through their servers.
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:46.320]   And they didn't want to keep running those servers.
[02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:47.600]   The sling player doesn't work.
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:48.480]   It's 32 bits.
[02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:50.720]   So it doesn't work on modern Mac OS.
[02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:56.480]   Disha said, we had to make room for new, innovative products.
[02:14:56.480 --> 02:15:00.160]   So we continue to serve our customers in the best possible way.
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:02.400]   I'm not mad about this.
[02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:03.760]   No, it happens.
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:04.240]   I mean, it'll be honest.
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:04.720]   I'm like--
[02:15:04.720 --> 02:15:05.840]   But it had a long run.
[02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:08.080]   And they stopped selling the hardware years ago.
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:09.440]   Yeah, so that's why.
[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:11.920]   Yeah, it's people have had, I think, had a good run with it.
[02:15:11.920 --> 02:15:14.480]   And by now, there's other ways to do it.
[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:15.040]   I would say--
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:16.400]   There's a lot more options for it.
[02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:17.680]   Yeah, so let me think about that.
[02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:19.840]   Plex would be the best replacement, right?
[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:20.880]   Mm-hmm.
[02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:22.320]   I would say.
[02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:23.680]   Run a Plex server in your house.
[02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:28.000]   Yeah, this is not really the sling TV, by the way,
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.560]   which is probably another very good option.
[02:15:30.560 --> 02:15:32.720]   Subscribe to YouTube TV or sling TV.
[02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:35.200]   And you get your locals, you get a DVR.
[02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:36.800]   Yeah, what do you need this for anymore?
[02:15:36.800 --> 02:15:38.160]   Yeah, the idea is--
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:38.880]   Well, this isn't--
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:40.480]   Yeah, this is for someone who bought it,
[02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:42.640]   you know, and is still running it because it worked.
[02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:43.120]   Right.
[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:45.120]   There are plenty of people out there in the world
[02:15:45.120 --> 02:15:46.400]   who are not like us who are like,
[02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:49.360]   I don't want to think about this gadget ever again.
[02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:49.840]   It works.
[02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:50.880]   Yeah.
[02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:54.000]   Well, you're going to be thinking about it again in two years
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:55.120]   when it stops working.
[02:15:55.120 --> 02:15:56.480]   Yeah.
[02:15:56.480 --> 02:15:59.440]   So this, I think, is a trend we're going to see a lot more of.
[02:15:59.440 --> 02:16:04.640]   The estimate is about 60%, thanks to quarantine,
[02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:08.720]   about 60% of small businesses will fold in the year 2020,
[02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:10.080]   a huge number.
[02:16:10.080 --> 02:16:11.760]   A lot of them restaurants.
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:16.080]   And because the only way most people are eating out these days
[02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:18.640]   is take out or delivery,
[02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:22.880]   Chipotle's opening, it's digital only restaurant,
[02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:25.520]   doesn't have a dining room,
[02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:27.280]   doesn't have that line for ordering,
[02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:31.520]   it's just for takeout and delivery.
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:32.800]   Why do you manage it?
[02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:34.560]   It's a ghost kitchen, isn't it?
[02:16:34.560 --> 02:16:35.520]   It's a ghost kitchen.
[02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:36.000]   It is.
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:36.480]   Okay.
[02:16:36.480 --> 02:16:37.040]   Yeah.
[02:16:37.040 --> 02:16:37.840]   Like all those--
[02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:40.000]   There are a lot of ghost kitchens popping up now,
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.800]   a lot of restaurants turning into ghost kitchens
[02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:46.160]   and a lot of new people starting ghost kitchens
[02:16:46.160 --> 02:16:51.120]   for DoorDash and Grubhub and all the other delivery services.
[02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:51.840]   But it might have been--
[02:16:51.840 --> 02:16:53.600]   This is finally not going to be a restaurant.
[02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:54.080]   It might have been one.
[02:16:54.080 --> 02:16:55.280]   You finally got DoorDash.
[02:16:55.280 --> 02:16:57.200]   Have you been using it?
[02:16:57.200 --> 02:17:00.560]   Not yet, because we literally just got it last week
[02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:02.880]   and I haven't ordered takeout yet since then.
[02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:04.000]   Your daughter's going to tell you that
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:05.680]   that's mean to the restaurant, you shouldn't use it.
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:06.160]   It's actually--
[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:08.160]   My brother actually does DoorDash.
[02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:10.320]   In COVID, it does not mean to the restaurant.
[02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:11.680]   Oh, right.
[02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:12.640]   This is the only--
[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:14.560]   This is the only revenue they have.
[02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:15.040]   Yeah.
[02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:15.520]   Yeah.
[02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:16.240]   Well, you're--
[02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:18.960]   Well, if you can order in takeout, go pick it up.
[02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:19.680]   Yes, but there's like places--
[02:17:19.680 --> 02:17:20.960]   That's better for restaurants.
[02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:21.920]   Yeah.
[02:17:21.920 --> 02:17:22.400]   Well--
[02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:22.400]   Well--
[02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:23.920]   Well, they get more money if you don't use--
[02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:24.880]   Oh, yeah.
[02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:25.440]   Oh, yeah.
[02:17:25.440 --> 02:17:26.400]   They pay for Grubhub.
[02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:26.880]   Yeah.
[02:17:26.880 --> 02:17:27.680]   They pay for Grubhub.
[02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:28.160]   They pay for Grubhub.
[02:17:28.160 --> 02:17:28.160]   Oh.
[02:17:28.160 --> 02:17:30.480]   Oh, yeah.
[02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:31.040]   Okay.
[02:17:31.040 --> 02:17:34.560]   So my vision that's totally was that you would drive along and say,
[02:17:34.560 --> 02:17:36.640]   "I'll take a burrito and then you'd drive to the next stop."
[02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:39.040]   And you say, "Uh, chicken, then you'd drive to the next stop."
[02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:41.360]   And you say, "What on the veggies?"
[02:17:41.360 --> 02:17:42.640]   Then you'd drive to the next stop and say,
[02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:43.520]   "Yes, what please?"
[02:17:43.520 --> 02:17:45.440]   Then you'd drive along.
[02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:46.640]   That's why I thought I was going to--
[02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:50.000]   You know, someday we're going to have that vaccine.
[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:51.840]   We're going to be able to go to Chipotle's again.
[02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:53.680]   Life will be good.
[02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:56.320]   Yeah, I'm sad with the Chipotle app.
[02:17:56.320 --> 02:17:57.280]   I tried to order from it.
[02:17:57.280 --> 02:17:58.560]   And my favorite burrito,
[02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:01.440]   I can't eat the veggies because I'm allergic to bell peppers.
[02:18:01.440 --> 02:18:03.840]   But now they're veggie with guacamole.
[02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:06.640]   You have to get the veggies to get the guacamole
[02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:08.400]   and not pay $2.25 extra.
[02:18:08.400 --> 02:18:09.040]   So I'm sad.
[02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:11.680]   I know this is just--
[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:13.520]   You said a terrible thing.
[02:18:13.520 --> 02:18:16.080]   I want to go buy a chocolate.
[02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:17.680]   It is a first world problem?
[02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:19.520]   Not even a first world problem.
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:23.120]   It's like, it's a first word, Karen problem.
[02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:24.240]   It is like--
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:25.440]   It is like--
[02:18:25.440 --> 02:18:27.440]   Ooh, it was sweet.
[02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:28.640]   We called it a Karen.
[02:18:28.640 --> 02:18:34.400]   Don't you hate it when you have to pay extra for the avocado
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:38.400]   because it comes with the peppers and you can't eat peppers.
[02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:39.920]   Don't you hate it when that happens?
[02:18:40.480 --> 02:18:41.840]   I hate it when that happens.
[02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:42.560]   I'm sad.
[02:18:42.560 --> 02:18:43.280]   I didn't--
[02:18:43.280 --> 02:18:44.480]   Yeah, I'm sad.
[02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:45.440]   No, I'm teasing you.
[02:18:45.440 --> 02:18:46.160]   Have you yelled at anybody?
[02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:47.440]   I'm teasing you.
[02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:47.440]   I'm teasing you.
[02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:49.840]   You said you mean to the people who make my burritos?
[02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:50.880]   No, of course.
[02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:52.640]   It's wrong.
[02:18:52.640 --> 02:18:54.320]   And we should all petition--
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:56.320]   Let's boycott Chipotle.
[02:18:56.320 --> 02:18:58.240]   Every podcast they advertise on,
[02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:00.560]   I want you to stop listening to them now.
[02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:01.920]   Should they advertise on any?
[02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:02.560]   Oh, I don't know.
[02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:04.640]   They don't advertise on ours.
[02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:05.840]   That's all I care about.
[02:19:05.840 --> 02:19:07.280]   You're rolling up on this thing.
[02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:09.840]   I'm sorry, Stacey.
[02:19:09.840 --> 02:19:11.760]   I'm not-- you're not a first world Karen.
[02:19:11.760 --> 02:19:14.800]   You're a wonderful person, I apologize.
[02:19:14.800 --> 02:19:17.120]   I was just noting that that bothered me.
[02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:17.680]   You could say--
[02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:18.160]   It's sad.
[02:19:18.160 --> 02:19:19.200]   You could say something like,
[02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:21.040]   "Okay, Joe Rogan."
[02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:21.920]   You could say that.
[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:22.720]   Go ahead.
[02:19:22.720 --> 02:19:24.080]   No, I would never invoke--
[02:19:24.080 --> 02:19:25.520]   I would never invoke Joe Rogan.
[02:19:25.520 --> 02:19:25.920]   Jesus.
[02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:27.200]   So--
[02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:30.560]   Spoilers, according to the American Medical Association--
[02:19:30.560 --> 02:19:32.080]   Men Medical Association--
[02:19:32.080 --> 02:19:34.560]   No, it's not the AMA.
[02:19:34.560 --> 02:19:36.880]   It's not the American Medical Association.
[02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:39.760]   It's the American Marketing Association
[02:19:39.760 --> 02:19:41.280]   not affiliated with the AMA.
[02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:46.240]   Spoilers do not harm box office revenue.
[02:19:46.240 --> 02:19:50.000]   This is actually research published in the Journal of Marketing
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000]   that esteemed academic journal
[02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:55.920]   researchers from Western University and the University of Houston
[02:19:55.920 --> 02:20:01.200]   examined whether spoiler movie reviews harm the box office.
[02:20:01.200 --> 02:20:05.520]   Do spoilers really spoil using topic modeling
[02:20:05.520 --> 02:20:07.760]   to measure the effect of spoiler reviews
[02:20:07.760 --> 02:20:09.760]   on box office revenue?
[02:20:09.760 --> 02:20:13.280]   They collected daily box office revenues
[02:20:13.280 --> 02:20:16.240]   for movies between 2013 and 2017.
[02:20:16.240 --> 02:20:19.680]   Then they were then matched with their respective reviews
[02:20:19.680 --> 02:20:21.120]   connected from the IMDB.
[02:20:21.120 --> 02:20:26.560]   They measured the spoiler intensity,
[02:20:26.560 --> 02:20:29.200]   the degree of plot uncertainty,
[02:20:29.200 --> 02:20:33.920]   the amount it was resolved by reading spoilers and movie reviews.
[02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:37.200]   The study results indicate spoiler intensity
[02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:41.120]   has a positive and significant relationship with box office
[02:20:41.120 --> 02:20:42.400]   office revenue.
[02:20:42.400 --> 02:20:43.200]   It enhances them.
[02:20:43.200 --> 02:20:45.120]   I can't believe that was--
[02:20:45.120 --> 02:20:46.400]   A study?
[02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:47.600]   Yeah.
[02:20:47.600 --> 02:20:48.400]   I mean, people--
[02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:53.680]   We're in a society of people don't want to miss out on anything.
[02:20:53.680 --> 02:20:56.320]   So if a movie is being talked about so much
[02:20:56.320 --> 02:20:58.320]   where even spoilers get leaked,
[02:20:58.320 --> 02:20:59.520]   it seems like society is like,
[02:20:59.520 --> 02:21:00.720]   "I got to see it anyway.
[02:21:00.720 --> 02:21:01.520]   I still got to see it."
[02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:03.040]   Because so and so was talking about it.
[02:21:03.040 --> 02:21:06.000]   You know, so why would the revenues change?
[02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:07.760]   And well, and here's another theory too.
[02:21:07.760 --> 02:21:10.160]   Do you want to know how it turns out so you can talk about it
[02:21:10.160 --> 02:21:11.520]   even before you've seen it?
[02:21:11.520 --> 02:21:14.480]   Oh, I don't even want to talk about it too.
[02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:16.800]   Is it a cheater that is spoiler-piece?
[02:21:16.800 --> 02:21:19.680]   I do that with horror movies.
[02:21:19.680 --> 02:21:21.120]   So like when I was watching,
[02:21:21.120 --> 02:21:22.480]   especially like TV shows,
[02:21:22.480 --> 02:21:24.800]   when things get a little too intense,
[02:21:24.800 --> 02:21:27.040]   I'm like, "I got to understand what's about to happen."
[02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:31.840]   I do it as like a stress valve or a pressure valve kind of release.
[02:21:31.840 --> 02:21:33.920]   Here's a question from Emory and our chat room.
[02:21:33.920 --> 02:21:34.640]   I think it's good.
[02:21:35.280 --> 02:21:36.960]   Why do they call it a box office?
[02:21:36.960 --> 02:21:38.160]   Do they sell boxes?
[02:21:38.160 --> 02:21:42.240]   Jeff, you're a TV critic.
[02:21:42.240 --> 02:21:45.280]   That's a really good, I never thought about that.
[02:21:45.280 --> 02:21:45.920]   What is box?
[02:21:45.920 --> 02:21:46.880]   Because the office,
[02:21:46.880 --> 02:21:50.080]   you bought it from a thing that looks like a box.
[02:21:50.080 --> 02:21:50.240]   Yeah.
[02:21:50.240 --> 02:21:53.200]   The term box office originated in the Elizabethan area
[02:21:53.200 --> 02:21:56.480]   when affluent people would sit in private boxes to watch theater.
[02:21:56.480 --> 02:21:57.680]   Oh, oh, you got me.
[02:21:57.680 --> 02:22:00.080]   To get spare boxes for something that's in an office called a box office.
[02:22:00.080 --> 02:22:02.000]   Just like Leo made up about the unicycle.
[02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:02.880]   I made that up, yeah.
[02:22:05.040 --> 02:22:07.920]   Yeah, you didn't mention Elizabethan boxes.
[02:22:07.920 --> 02:22:08.560]   Oh, I did it.
[02:22:08.560 --> 02:22:09.200]   Well, theater.
[02:22:09.200 --> 02:22:11.520]   By the way, that was a Google snippet.
[02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:15.920]   And I did not click through to ensure this information comes through.
[02:22:15.920 --> 02:22:18.640]   It's a really good piece of information though.
[02:22:18.640 --> 02:22:19.600]   Because it's all you needed.
[02:22:19.600 --> 02:22:20.560]   It's fine.
[02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:24.880]   The uncertainty reduction mechanism suggests a spoiler-friendly
[02:22:24.880 --> 02:22:30.320]   platform review platform can help consumers make appropriate purchase decisions.
[02:22:30.320 --> 02:22:34.960]   We recommend that review platforms keep the warning labels on spoiler reviews,
[02:22:34.960 --> 02:22:41.200]   because of the benefit of allowing consumers to self-select into the exposure to spoilers.
[02:22:41.200 --> 02:22:41.520]   Yeah.
[02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:43.440]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[02:22:43.440 --> 02:22:43.760]   I'm just...
[02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:45.360]   Don't surprise people with a spoiler.
[02:22:45.360 --> 02:22:48.000]   It's the same issue as snippets.
[02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:55.360]   A short snippet, which of course publishers want to say you've sold their soul for using,
[02:22:55.360 --> 02:22:58.880]   is actually not as good a promotional item as a longer snippet.
[02:22:58.880 --> 02:23:03.920]   And even a whole story can be a better promotion.
[02:23:03.920 --> 02:23:05.600]   Our final story of the day.
[02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:06.720]   I'm going to make it a good one.
[02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:11.600]   The Pope Francis,
[02:23:11.600 --> 02:23:13.120]   Papa,
[02:23:13.120 --> 02:23:19.680]   urges followers to pray that AI and robots always serve mankind.
[02:23:19.680 --> 02:23:22.240]   Let's just pray for that, shall we?
[02:23:22.240 --> 02:23:23.680]   I see a movie coming up.
[02:23:23.680 --> 02:23:25.680]   To serve mankind.
[02:23:25.680 --> 02:23:27.360]   It's a cookbook.
[02:23:27.360 --> 02:23:28.720]   I'm sorry.
[02:23:28.720 --> 02:23:31.840]   Do you think Padre was involved in this one?
[02:23:32.640 --> 02:23:33.600]   I think he might have been.
[02:23:33.600 --> 02:23:34.160]   Oh, baby.
[02:23:34.160 --> 02:23:35.280]   He was the advisor.
[02:23:35.280 --> 02:23:35.760]   Maybe.
[02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:41.680]   It's one of the Pope's monthly prayer intentions regular missives shared on YouTube.
[02:23:41.680 --> 02:23:44.000]   Well, now we know Father Roberts involved.
[02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:49.680]   To help Catholics deepen their daily prayer by focusing on particular topics or events.
[02:23:49.680 --> 02:23:54.400]   In August, the Pope urged a prayer for the maritime world.
[02:23:54.400 --> 02:23:58.160]   In April, freedom for addiction.
[02:23:58.160 --> 02:23:59.760]   Probably from addiction.
[02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:01.360]   Oh, yes.
[02:24:02.560 --> 02:24:05.840]   And in November, it's AI and robots.
[02:24:05.840 --> 02:24:11.120]   The Pope said AI was at the heart of the epoch.
[02:24:11.120 --> 02:24:12.480]   Epical chain, is it epoch.
[02:24:12.480 --> 02:24:16.080]   Epical, apocopole, apocopole, apocopole, apocopole.
[02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:17.120]   Apocopole, tell me.
[02:24:17.120 --> 02:24:17.520]   Apocopole.
[02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:19.920]   Have the apocopole change.
[02:24:19.920 --> 02:24:24.480]   We are experiencing and that robots had the power to change the world for the better.
[02:24:24.480 --> 02:24:29.600]   But this would only be the case if these forces were harnessed correctly.
[02:24:30.720 --> 02:24:38.240]   Indeed, if technological progress increases inequalities, it is not a true progress.
[02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:44.560]   Future events should be oriented toward respecting the dignity.
[02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:45.840]   Accent is this.
[02:24:45.840 --> 02:24:48.400]   Yeah, I'm like, what is happening here?
[02:24:48.400 --> 02:24:51.680]   I can't even get to the con of the person.
[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:57.520]   Well, just remember Pope Francis is not Italian.
[02:24:57.520 --> 02:24:58.480]   No, he's Argentine.
[02:24:58.480 --> 02:25:01.280]   He's from Argentina, but he has to speak Italian.
[02:25:01.280 --> 02:25:06.800]   So that is the accent of an native Argentinian speaking Italian in Rome.
[02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:08.800]   Oh, prove it today.
[02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:09.360]   In English.
[02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:09.840]   Yeah.
[02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:13.600]   Like, um, it's not.
[02:25:13.600 --> 02:25:16.080]   I just want to say it's exactly what he sounds like.
[02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:18.480]   Okay, maybe not.
[02:25:18.480 --> 02:25:25.360]   Let us suppose, and then I'm going to get your picks and number and all that stuff,
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:26.240]   if I might.
[02:25:27.280 --> 02:25:28.080]   Our show today.
[02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:28.320]   Yay.
[02:25:28.320 --> 02:25:30.400]   Yes, it's time.
[02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:30.880]   It's soon.
[02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:32.240]   It's going to be Chipotle.
[02:25:32.240 --> 02:25:38.640]   Our show today brought to you by Zip Recruiter hiring so hard, but you know what?
[02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:42.960]   If you are one of the companies hiring right now, bless you.
[02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:46.720]   There are people out there dying to get a job with you.
[02:25:46.720 --> 02:25:50.960]   In fact, the perfect person is waiting to hear from you.
[02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:52.080]   So how do you get to them?
[02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:53.360]   You use Zip Recruiter.
[02:25:54.080 --> 02:25:59.120]   That's the best way to reach out and find exactly the right person for your job opening.
[02:25:59.120 --> 02:26:01.920]   I'll tell you all the good reasons you want to use Zip Recruiter.
[02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:03.520]   First of all, when you post on Zip Recruiter,
[02:26:03.520 --> 02:26:07.920]   you're posting to more than a hundred job sites.
[02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:10.400]   So you're casting a broad net.
[02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:13.760]   You're getting out there to everybody.
[02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:18.800]   Furthermore, Zip Recruiter's technology actually helps you find people with the right
[02:26:18.800 --> 02:26:20.320]   experience for your job.
[02:26:20.320 --> 02:26:23.840]   They'll go through those and then find people that are qualified and actively
[02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:26.800]   invite them to apply, which makes a big difference.
[02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:32.880]   Four out of five employers who post on Zip Recruiter get a quality candidate with the first day.
[02:26:32.880 --> 02:26:35.040]   We would get them within the first hour.
[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:40.320]   In fact, it was always a thrill and a wonder because we'd post and when you post it for a job,
[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:42.640]   you really want, you hope I'm going to find the right person.
[02:26:42.640 --> 02:26:44.560]   I really want to fill this position.
[02:26:44.560 --> 02:26:47.440]   I hope it's not going to be a long time and a lot of work.
[02:26:47.440 --> 02:26:51.520]   And then that first good applicant flows in in the first hour or two.
[02:26:51.520 --> 02:26:53.120]   You go, "Wow, this is great."
[02:26:53.840 --> 02:26:55.600]   It really is a great feeling.
[02:26:55.600 --> 02:26:59.280]   And the other thing I love about Zip Recruiter, it doesn't go into your phone.
[02:26:59.280 --> 02:26:59.920]   They don't call you.
[02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:02.960]   You don't go to your inbox and your email.
[02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:06.160]   All the applicants go into the Zip Recruiter interface.
[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:09.840]   Their resumes are automatically reformatted so you can easily scan them.
[02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:13.680]   You can create screening questions, true, false, multiple choice essays.
[02:27:13.680 --> 02:27:15.520]   So you eliminate people without any work.
[02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:18.320]   You eliminate people who aren't right for the job right away.
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:22.400]   And then the interface makes it very easy to scan over everybody left.
[02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:26.080]   Rank them, rate them, and hire the right person fast.
[02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:28.080]   Makes such a difference.
[02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:30.000]   It makes such a difference.
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:34.880]   As your business changes, as the world changes, if you're hiring, I want you to do it right.
[02:27:34.880 --> 02:27:38.480]   I want you to find that right person because they can't wait to hear from you.
[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:40.720]   They're just waiting for that call.

[02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:22.640]   I got this Halo band now.
[02:28:22.640 --> 02:28:25.200]   Stacy's thing is next.
[02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:28.160]   You know how Stacy pops in every now and then with the cocktail recommendation?
[02:28:28.160 --> 02:28:28.720]   Yes.
[02:28:28.720 --> 02:28:32.240]   This is a non-alcoholic cocktail type thing.
[02:28:32.240 --> 02:28:34.640]   So this is a non-alcoholic apertivo.
[02:28:34.640 --> 02:28:38.560]   I've been trying to drink less and this is like super fancy.
[02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:41.520]   I'm doing an unboxing here for you, but it is called
[02:28:41.520 --> 02:28:43.360]   Kia.
[02:28:43.360 --> 02:28:43.680]   Kia.
[02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:48.400]   And this is super bitter.
[02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:50.240]   It's super bitter.
[02:28:50.240 --> 02:28:51.920]   Why would you want to drink that Stacy?
[02:28:51.920 --> 02:28:52.720]   You can bought them.
[02:28:52.720 --> 02:28:56.640]   I love bitter flavors in my cocktails.
[02:28:56.640 --> 02:29:01.040]   So I'm going to tell you this is a mix of lots and lots of herbs.
[02:29:01.840 --> 02:29:04.560]   I'm going to tell you what some of them are in case you know how they taste.
[02:29:04.560 --> 02:29:08.400]   Genshin root, that is the super bitter ankle.
[02:29:08.400 --> 02:29:10.560]   There's white grape.
[02:29:10.560 --> 02:29:11.760]   There's big in here.
[02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:14.800]   Ginger, orange pill, peel.
[02:29:14.800 --> 02:29:16.160]   I can't say that word.
[02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:17.760]   Yuzu, so fresh.
[02:29:17.760 --> 02:29:19.600]   Lemon balm, elderflower and rosemary.
[02:29:19.600 --> 02:29:20.240]   Oh, it sounds good.
[02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:23.360]   So this is a really complex.
[02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:24.480]   This is not it.
[02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:27.520]   This is but this is the one I'm going to share after you do that.
[02:29:27.520 --> 02:29:28.400]   So go ahead.
[02:29:28.400 --> 02:29:30.720]   GHIA, like Carmen Gia.
[02:29:31.680 --> 02:29:34.880]   I was like like Anker Gia, my daughter's stepfather.
[02:29:34.880 --> 02:29:38.240]   All right, not step, not stepfather, godfather.
[02:29:38.240 --> 02:29:42.240]   Carmen Gia was the Volkswagen everybody in my generation.
[02:29:42.240 --> 02:29:43.120]   Oh, yeah.
[02:29:43.120 --> 02:29:44.320]   Oh, I wanted it so bad.
[02:29:44.320 --> 02:29:45.440]   Oh, yes, beautiful.
[02:29:45.440 --> 02:29:51.920]   So this is really delicious and it is I mix it with tonic.
[02:29:51.920 --> 02:29:55.200]   They have a bunch of little cocktaily mocktails you can make,
[02:29:55.200 --> 02:29:59.520]   but it's it actually is one of the few like I have tried like fake jins.
[02:29:59.520 --> 02:30:01.760]   I've tried a couple fake whiskeys.
[02:30:01.760 --> 02:30:03.440]   I've even tried a fake tequila.
[02:30:03.440 --> 02:30:09.360]   This is actually one of the few that really give me the sense that I've had a really complex
[02:30:09.360 --> 02:30:09.680]   cocktail.
[02:30:09.680 --> 02:30:13.920]   You know what really if you just put a little vodka in it really.
[02:30:13.920 --> 02:30:21.280]   Yeah, if you mix this, I mean, it's kind of like an amaro or something like that or
[02:30:21.280 --> 02:30:23.360]   actually more like a, what is it?
[02:30:23.360 --> 02:30:23.920]   It's a herbal.
[02:30:23.920 --> 02:30:24.320]   And a nagroni.
[02:30:24.320 --> 02:30:24.960]   Yeah, nagroni.
[02:30:24.960 --> 02:30:28.800]   So if you don't like nagronis, you're not going to like this.
[02:30:28.800 --> 02:30:33.040]   Yeah, but if you kind of groove on that super complicated, there's, I mean,
[02:30:33.040 --> 02:30:35.200]   there's sweetness here, but the bitters are real strong.
[02:30:35.200 --> 02:30:37.120]   The bitter taste is strong.
[02:30:37.120 --> 02:30:41.200]   Thirty three dollars for the bottle, but you probably it's probably highly concentrated, right?
[02:30:41.200 --> 02:30:48.000]   No, that well, you I mix mine like two ounces of this and two and a half or three ounces of tonic.
[02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:49.120]   So you don't eat much.
[02:30:49.120 --> 02:30:52.640]   Yeah, it only keeps though for like three weeks in the fridge.
[02:30:52.640 --> 02:30:54.320]   There's about 12 servings in here.
[02:30:54.320 --> 02:30:55.440]   But then it's kombucha.
[02:30:55.440 --> 02:30:58.000]   And then it's kombucha.
[02:30:58.000 --> 02:30:59.440]   Yeah.
[02:30:59.440 --> 02:31:06.320]   But yeah, I for the holidays, especially if I don't know, I can't drink every night anymore.
[02:31:06.320 --> 02:31:08.080]   This whoop band yells at me when I drink.
[02:31:08.080 --> 02:31:08.640]   I know.
[02:31:08.640 --> 02:31:09.120]   I know.
[02:31:09.120 --> 02:31:09.920]   I know.
[02:31:09.920 --> 02:31:16.400]   So anyway, throwing that out there for y'all is definitely one of the better non-alcoholics.
[02:31:16.400 --> 02:31:21.520]   And I've tried seed lip and all these others, but this is probably my favorite I've tried so far.
[02:31:21.520 --> 02:31:22.960]   Yeah.
[02:31:22.960 --> 02:31:27.200]   And you can find it on, I think they're local to our area.
[02:31:27.200 --> 02:31:30.800]   Drink Gia D-R-I-N-K G-H-I-A dot com.
[02:31:30.800 --> 02:31:37.600]   Doesn't say where they're from, but I noticed that the phone number is text them is our area code.
[02:31:37.600 --> 02:31:40.400]   So I actually think they're from Brooklyn, but Brooklyn?
[02:31:40.400 --> 02:31:42.240]   It does feel like a Brooklyn thing, doesn't it?
[02:31:42.240 --> 02:31:43.040]   Doesn't it feel like a phone?
[02:31:43.040 --> 02:31:44.240]   Maybe they have local phone.
[02:31:44.240 --> 02:31:46.960]   Maybe they know where I am and they just have local area codes.
[02:31:46.960 --> 02:31:50.400]   They also have this whole thing where they are.
[02:31:50.400 --> 02:31:54.720]   They have they talk about the herbs promoting relaxation.
[02:31:54.720 --> 02:31:55.760]   I don't know about that, but.
[02:31:56.640 --> 02:31:58.320]   It does.
[02:31:58.320 --> 02:32:00.240]   It's a good.
[02:32:00.240 --> 02:32:04.720]   It's funny that you should bring this up because during the election and post-election,
[02:32:04.720 --> 02:32:06.240]   I've been drinking heavily.
[02:32:06.240 --> 02:32:08.880]   But like you, I don't really want to get drunk.
[02:32:08.880 --> 02:32:14.000]   So I've been doing the same thing, which is making adult drinks with herbal concoctions.
[02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:18.720]   And the ones I would love to try both of these to see which one you like better.
[02:32:18.720 --> 02:32:20.240]   This is curious elixirs.
[02:32:20.240 --> 02:32:22.960]   And this was something Mary Jo Foley told me about.
[02:32:22.960 --> 02:32:25.120]   So I have tried the curious elixirs.
[02:32:25.120 --> 02:32:26.160]   Which one did I try?
[02:32:26.160 --> 02:32:26.560]   I have.
[02:32:26.560 --> 02:32:28.080]   They have four different kinds.
[02:32:28.080 --> 02:32:31.920]   So it's not just like yours.
[02:32:31.920 --> 02:32:33.120]   It's herbal, not sweet.
[02:32:33.120 --> 02:32:38.720]   And you could put booze in it, but you don't have to.
[02:32:38.720 --> 02:32:42.880]   I just put a little seltzer in a little parier or something.
[02:32:42.880 --> 02:32:44.000]   And it's really good.
[02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.720]   So I like this idea off to try the gias.
[02:32:46.720 --> 02:32:48.000]   Yeah.
[02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:51.520]   I mean, I think they actually serve it in bars in California,
[02:32:51.520 --> 02:32:54.000]   but I'm not sure if you're going to go to a bar anytime soon.
[02:32:54.800 --> 02:33:00.160]   I joined the Curious Cocktail Club, which gives you a monthly variety pack
[02:33:00.160 --> 02:33:02.720]   of all the different four flavors.
[02:33:02.720 --> 02:33:06.720]   So yeah, it's quite, you know, I have it.
[02:33:06.720 --> 02:33:09.680]   It's funny because at the end of the day, don't you want to,
[02:33:09.680 --> 02:33:12.560]   I mean, I feel like maybe because my parents used to do this, they'd go home,
[02:33:12.560 --> 02:33:15.040]   my dad would get home and they'd have a drink.
[02:33:15.040 --> 02:33:16.480]   But I don't want to have a drink.
[02:33:16.480 --> 02:33:18.000]   So I have one of these and it's very nice.
[02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:18.720]   It feels adult.
[02:33:18.720 --> 02:33:21.760]   Well, it just feels, it's like, yeah.
[02:33:21.760 --> 02:33:22.240]   Yeah.
[02:33:22.240 --> 02:33:22.800]   Yeah.
[02:33:22.800 --> 02:33:26.000]   It's, it's got a little something, a little bit more, a little less
[02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:27.120]   herbal, a little bit more.
[02:33:27.120 --> 02:33:27.840]   Have you ever met?
[02:33:27.840 --> 02:33:28.960]   Improvable.
[02:33:28.960 --> 02:33:30.480]   I don't drink Jonas.
[02:33:30.480 --> 02:33:32.560]   Cause this is really, really right here on my dad.
[02:33:32.560 --> 02:33:33.600]   I'm not judging you.
[02:33:33.600 --> 02:33:34.000]   I'm not judging you.
[02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:34.560]   No, I don't.
[02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:37.920]   I'm going to go have a nice, um, carbonate a minute there.
[02:33:37.920 --> 02:33:41.840]   I have so few brain cells to spare that I just try to stay sober
[02:33:41.840 --> 02:33:43.840]   these days.
[02:33:43.840 --> 02:33:44.640]   I didn't used to.
[02:33:44.640 --> 02:33:46.880]   I'm kind of with you, Stacy.
[02:33:46.880 --> 02:33:49.680]   Cause you don't sleep as well and you wake up, you don't feel as good.
[02:33:49.680 --> 02:33:50.480]   I just, I don't,
[02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:55.360]   I, I need the comfort without the confusion.
[02:33:55.360 --> 02:33:57.440]   That should be their slogan.
[02:33:57.440 --> 02:33:59.920]   I think it's shaken not slurred.
[02:33:59.920 --> 02:34:00.320]   Is there?
[02:34:00.320 --> 02:34:01.520]   Oh, that's even better.
[02:34:01.520 --> 02:34:03.120]   Ah, I love it.
[02:34:03.120 --> 02:34:03.920]   Not slurred.
[02:34:03.920 --> 02:34:04.480]   Not slurred.
[02:34:04.480 --> 02:34:10.080]   So Gia, drink Gia, D-R-I-N-K-G-H-I-A.com.
[02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:11.760]   And I, we have dueling elixirs.
[02:34:11.760 --> 02:34:14.400]   I have curious elixirs.com.
[02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:15.840]   Jeff, do you have a number for us?
[02:34:15.840 --> 02:34:17.120]   Yeah, I do.
[02:34:17.120 --> 02:34:18.240]   It's a digital story.
[02:34:18.240 --> 02:34:21.120]   Cause the New York Times has just passed a milestone.
[02:34:21.120 --> 02:34:24.640]   Where it makes more money from its digital subscribers than its print subscribers.
[02:34:24.640 --> 02:34:24.640]   Right.
[02:34:24.640 --> 02:34:26.160]   A lot more money.
[02:34:26.160 --> 02:34:26.640]   Oh, right.
[02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:30.320]   But the numbers are, well, actually it just kind of passed over a little bit.
[02:34:30.320 --> 02:34:38.160]   So, so, um, online, so there's seven million online subscribers of whom 4.7 million pay for
[02:34:38.160 --> 02:34:40.800]   news, the rest pay for crossword and cooking it.
[02:34:40.800 --> 02:34:41.760]   Oh, that's hysterical.
[02:34:41.760 --> 02:34:42.080]   Yeah.
[02:34:42.080 --> 02:34:42.480]   I do.
[02:34:42.480 --> 02:34:43.520]   I all do all three.
[02:34:43.520 --> 02:34:44.080]   I pay for both.
[02:34:44.080 --> 02:34:44.640]   Yeah, me too.
[02:34:44.640 --> 02:34:46.480]   I don't pay for the crossword.
[02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:47.280]   I don't care for it.
[02:34:47.280 --> 02:34:50.400]   Ah, 831,000 pay for print.
[02:34:51.360 --> 02:34:56.880]   So 831,000 readers provide $145 million.
[02:34:56.880 --> 02:35:00.880]   The 7 million digital subscribers provide $155 million.
[02:35:00.880 --> 02:35:01.600]   10 million more.
[02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:04.800]   So 800,000 versus 7 million.
[02:35:04.800 --> 02:35:05.440]   That's the problem.
[02:35:05.440 --> 02:35:06.800]   That's why I give an up print as hard.
[02:35:06.800 --> 02:35:14.240]   Meanwhile, advertising sales has dropped 30% to 79 million, which used to be the primary revenue
[02:35:14.240 --> 02:35:14.880]   source.
[02:35:14.880 --> 02:35:19.280]   Digital subscription surpassed advertising a couple of years ago.
[02:35:20.080 --> 02:35:22.160]   But even online advertising has fallen.
[02:35:22.160 --> 02:35:27.280]   So, online advertising is now 47.8 of that 79 million.
[02:35:27.280 --> 02:35:31.440]   So, basically, the only thing that's growing here is digital subs.
[02:35:31.440 --> 02:35:32.400]   They're now at 7 million.
[02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:37.440]   They have a goal of 10 million digital subs by 2025 and they could make it.
[02:35:37.440 --> 02:35:39.600]   But it's a very different business.
[02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:41.200]   Bottom line, they're making money.
[02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:43.120]   Bottom line, they're making money.
[02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:43.280]   Yes.
[02:35:43.280 --> 02:35:44.880]   33 million in the quarter.
[02:35:44.880 --> 02:35:45.760]   So that's good.
[02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:46.240]   Yes.
[02:35:46.240 --> 02:35:46.480]   Yeah.
[02:35:46.480 --> 02:35:47.040]   That's good.
[02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:47.280]   Yeah.
[02:35:48.160 --> 02:35:48.800]   Yeah.
[02:35:48.800 --> 02:35:52.400]   Because that's an expensive operation, but digital makes it, I think, maybe a little more.
[02:35:52.400 --> 02:35:56.000]   If you're interested in this stuff, and I know, of course, we can meet one person in the audience,
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:01.600]   but Mark Thompson, who just left as CEO, did a great video presentation for the Bodleian
[02:36:01.600 --> 02:36:05.840]   Libraries at Oxford, 700th anniversary.
[02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:06.800]   They did a celebration.
[02:36:06.800 --> 02:36:10.800]   And if you look that up, you can find a really good talk about change and change management
[02:36:10.800 --> 02:36:11.680]   from Mark Thompson.
[02:36:11.680 --> 02:36:12.160]   Interesting.
[02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:12.880]   Yeah.
[02:36:14.560 --> 02:36:17.440]   The podcasts have contributed to that bottom line, by the way.
[02:36:17.440 --> 02:36:18.720]   Yeah.
[02:36:18.720 --> 02:36:19.200]   Oh, yeah.
[02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:22.880]   And the wire cutter and, you know, they could buy you.
[02:36:22.880 --> 02:36:23.840]   They could buy you.
[02:36:23.840 --> 02:36:24.400]   Yeah.
[02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:26.080]   They bought cereal.
[02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:29.040]   Just cereal, just the podcast alone by itself.
[02:36:29.040 --> 02:36:35.840]   They spent $30 million buying several startups, including cereal productions.
[02:36:35.840 --> 02:36:38.080]   Yeah.
[02:36:38.080 --> 02:36:40.240]   I think their strategy has been quite good.
[02:36:40.240 --> 02:36:43.600]   They've also benefited from Donald Trump.
[02:36:44.240 --> 02:36:45.120]   Oh, which they say.
[02:36:45.120 --> 02:36:45.600]   And they've met.
[02:36:45.600 --> 02:36:50.080]   And so I talked to somebody at another paper where they're worried about what's going to
[02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:50.800]   happen to subs.
[02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:51.120]   Yeah.
[02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:52.400]   A calm,
[02:36:52.400 --> 02:36:55.840]   uncontroversial presidency.
[02:36:55.840 --> 02:37:03.040]   And maybe common, uncontroversial for New York Times readers, it might be very controversial and
[02:37:03.040 --> 02:37:08.480]   upsetting for Trump supporters, but they're not going to subscribe to the New York Times to
[02:37:08.480 --> 02:37:10.720]   follow the foibles of Joe Biden.
[02:37:10.720 --> 02:37:12.080]   They'll find another service for that.
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:14.960]   And prove it.
[02:37:14.960 --> 02:37:17.440]   What do you got for us?
[02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:25.520]   For people out there that I can't afford the likes of Adobe Creative Cloud,
[02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:32.000]   my friend and big fan of this show and Matt Brick Weekly, Mr. Steve Brazel shared.
[02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:40.560]   Isotopes has a deal going on for their audio editing plugins and application,
[02:37:40.560 --> 02:37:46.080]   all right, elements. It's $100 off, so you can get it for, I think, 30 bucks.
[02:37:46.080 --> 02:37:46.400]   What?
[02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:48.400]   Oh, that's a good deal.
[02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:50.880]   I'm well, I've used Isotopes plugins.
[02:37:50.880 --> 02:37:57.120]   Yeah, Isotopes is really, really popular in the audio editing game.
[02:37:57.120 --> 02:37:59.760]   And for people that are trying to get started with,
[02:37:59.760 --> 02:38:03.520]   one, just do their own podcast and process some audio.
[02:38:03.520 --> 02:38:05.440]   There's your in right there for 30 bucks.
[02:38:05.440 --> 02:38:07.600]   You got a nice tool right there waiting for you.
[02:38:08.800 --> 02:38:12.960]   And number two, Isotopes, I'm sorry.
[02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:14.960]   That's my southern draw coming out.
[02:38:14.960 --> 02:38:16.160]   No, no, no, I just spell it.
[02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:18.720]   I always spell all of these because it's not always obvious.
[02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:21.200]   That's spelled I-Z-O-T-O-P-E.
[02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:23.280]   It's kind of a non-standard spelling.
[02:38:23.280 --> 02:38:29.680]   And I love having, I love that they put the spectral display on the main page there,
[02:38:29.680 --> 02:38:33.680]   because when you're processing noise, that's a great tool.
[02:38:33.680 --> 02:38:36.160]   Oh, it makes that noise just stand out.
[02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:38.480]   You can see exactly where it is and clean it up and fix it.
[02:38:38.480 --> 02:38:40.400]   That's, ah, I love a spectral display.
[02:38:40.400 --> 02:38:45.680]   I use it in Adobe Audition, but it's nice to know that a lot of other apps use that too.
[02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:46.160]   Good deal.
[02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:51.760]   And the other one was, I wasn't going to do it later, but I said,
[02:38:51.760 --> 02:38:52.720]   I go ahead and throw it in there.
[02:38:52.720 --> 02:38:55.840]   And this is from my Sunday television watching.
[02:38:55.840 --> 02:38:56.960]   And it wasn't on YouTube.
[02:38:56.960 --> 02:38:58.000]   It wasn't on Netflix.
[02:38:58.000 --> 02:38:59.760]   It was actually on Amazon Prime.
[02:38:59.760 --> 02:39:01.120]   It's called Dream of Italy.
[02:39:01.120 --> 02:39:03.520]   Episode two pops up.
[02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:09.520]   And they started talking about a specific dish made popular in Rome.
[02:39:09.520 --> 02:39:10.320]   Gotcha.
[02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:11.120]   Paper.
[02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:11.680]   Gotcha.
[02:39:11.680 --> 02:39:15.040]   Did you catch the Kachio episode?
[02:39:15.040 --> 02:39:16.480]   It caught the Kachio.
[02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:16.960]   Yes.
[02:39:16.960 --> 02:39:18.000]   I was like, look at this.
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:21.600]   Mr. Jarvis is in a theater with my television watching.
[02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:24.800]   Oh, man, I want to be in it.
[02:39:24.800 --> 02:39:26.080]   It's the most perfect dish.
[02:39:26.080 --> 02:39:27.440]   It's been a pretty good series though.
[02:39:27.440 --> 02:39:31.840]   I think I've watched about five or six of those episodes now.
[02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:32.880]   I think it's fascinating.
[02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:34.320]   Oh, I love Italy.
[02:39:34.320 --> 02:39:35.120]   I love Italy.
[02:39:35.120 --> 02:39:37.200]   That's my dream vacation spot in Italy.
[02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:37.760]   Me too.
[02:39:37.760 --> 02:39:42.240]   Well, I'll go visit Father Robert when things get better.
[02:39:42.240 --> 02:39:42.800]   Yes.
[02:39:42.800 --> 02:39:47.520]   He told us, he said, come see me before I leave Rome forever because,
[02:39:47.520 --> 02:39:49.920]   I don't know, maybe he's planning for that.
[02:39:49.920 --> 02:39:50.560]   I don't know.
[02:39:50.560 --> 02:39:52.640]   But he said, I can get you into the catacombs.
[02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:55.920]   I can get you into parts of the Vatican City that you can't get into.
[02:39:55.920 --> 02:39:57.920]   As a member of the public.
[02:39:57.920 --> 02:39:59.840]   And I think that'd be pretty cool.
[02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:02.560]   We should do a twit trip.
[02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:04.400]   Oh, celebratory twit.
[02:40:04.400 --> 02:40:05.200]   Let's just trip.
[02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:07.760]   Okay, but a little tip, you can't do this when you get to Italy.
[02:40:07.760 --> 02:40:08.640]   Yeah, I was going to say, dude.
[02:40:08.640 --> 02:40:11.600]   It is.
[02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:13.200]   That was not a statement.
[02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:14.320]   That was not a statement.
[02:40:14.320 --> 02:40:16.080]   Italian gesturing there.
[02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:17.200]   Camera was going to be awesome.
[02:40:17.200 --> 02:40:21.680]   Scratching his beard and flipping us off at the same time.
[02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:22.080]   It's cool.
[02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:25.040]   No, I think that would be, wouldn't that be good?
[02:40:25.040 --> 02:40:26.400]   I would love it.
[02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:30.880]   It would have to be in a few years, but a twit trip to Italy.
[02:40:30.880 --> 02:40:33.680]   I thought you were giving up on podcasting in a few years, Leo.
[02:40:33.680 --> 02:40:34.000]   That's.
[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:35.200]   What?
[02:40:35.200 --> 02:40:36.080]   Where'd you hear that?
[02:40:36.080 --> 02:40:40.080]   You're constantly like, I'm too old for this.
[02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:40.640]   I'm done.
[02:40:40.640 --> 02:40:42.640]   This is the end.
[02:40:42.640 --> 02:40:45.920]   According to my halo band, that's not true.
[02:40:45.920 --> 02:40:49.280]   We come at the end of his week, Stacy.
[02:40:49.280 --> 02:40:52.400]   It is a fresh flower by Sunday.
[02:40:52.400 --> 02:40:53.040]   It is official.
[02:40:53.040 --> 02:40:56.000]   Ron Kline is the chief of staff.
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:56.160]   Yes.
[02:40:56.160 --> 02:40:57.920]   The president elect that is now official.
[02:40:57.920 --> 02:40:58.400]   Which is good.
[02:40:58.400 --> 02:40:59.920]   Good choice.
[02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:04.400]   He ran the Ebola response under the Obama White House.
[02:41:04.400 --> 02:41:07.840]   Could you probably be well suited for this one?
[02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:08.320]   No, I don't.
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:11.040]   Oh, Stacy, don't take me seriously.
[02:41:11.040 --> 02:41:11.760]   I go up and down.
[02:41:11.760 --> 02:41:14.160]   Sometimes I really worry about you, man.
[02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:15.120]   I'm just like, I know you do.
[02:41:15.120 --> 02:41:16.320]   You're very kind, but no.
[02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:19.200]   I really love what I'm doing.
[02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:21.680]   And mostly I love it because I get to talk to you guys.
[02:41:21.680 --> 02:41:23.440]   And that's the fun of it.
[02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:27.760]   So if we don't do any more podcasts,
[02:41:27.760 --> 02:41:29.280]   expect me to call you once a week.
[02:41:29.920 --> 02:41:33.200]   You keep you from your dinner and that kind of thing.
[02:41:33.200 --> 02:41:35.120]   It'll be like old times.
[02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:37.520]   Like, call me for Lissy.
[02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:39.760]   How long has this been a three hour show so far?
[02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:40.240]   Shh.
[02:41:40.240 --> 02:41:41.920]   So it has.
[02:41:41.920 --> 02:41:44.560]   I know we had nothing to talk about.
[02:41:44.560 --> 02:41:45.440]   That's the funny thing.
[02:41:45.440 --> 02:41:47.440]   I'm like, how did this happen?
[02:41:47.440 --> 02:41:49.680]   It was going to be a nice short show.
[02:41:49.680 --> 02:41:49.920]   All right.
[02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:50.800]   I'm going to let you go.
[02:41:50.800 --> 02:41:51.680]   Thank you so much.
[02:41:51.680 --> 02:41:56.800]   Stacy Higginbotham, her website, including the Annoying Interstitial
[02:41:56.800 --> 02:41:58.720]   dropdown for the newsletter.
[02:41:58.720 --> 02:42:01.120]   It's gone before you know it.
[02:42:01.120 --> 02:42:02.640]   Stacy and IOT.com.
[02:42:02.640 --> 02:42:04.480]   Actually, that is not annoying.
[02:42:04.480 --> 02:42:06.320]   You should fill it out and sign up.
[02:42:06.320 --> 02:42:06.880]   It's free.
[02:42:06.880 --> 02:42:07.600]   It's awesome.
[02:42:07.600 --> 02:42:08.640]   Great news.
[02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:09.760]   Let me go go making that change.
[02:42:09.760 --> 02:42:12.000]   You got till June.
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:12.400]   Marriage.
[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:12.720]   Okay.
[02:42:12.720 --> 02:42:13.360]   You got a while.
[02:42:13.360 --> 02:42:18.000]   She also does a great podcast with Kevin Tofel called the IOT podcast.
[02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:18.800]   Thank you, Stacy.
[02:42:18.800 --> 02:42:19.600]   Great to have you on.
[02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:21.600]   Jeff Jarvis.
[02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:24.880]   I know he's here somewhere.
[02:42:27.040 --> 02:42:27.680]   Hold on, Jeff.
[02:42:27.680 --> 02:42:28.960]   He's got to get your lore there.
[02:42:28.960 --> 02:42:32.160]   He's the director of the Townlight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism
[02:42:32.160 --> 02:42:34.720]   at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism
[02:42:34.720 --> 02:42:36.400]   at the City University of New York.
[02:42:36.400 --> 02:42:37.120]   You know what, Jeff?
[02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:38.000]   I got the tattoo.
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:42.480]   It's just hard to read it, but once it settles down, I won't have to look for it anymore.
[02:42:42.480 --> 02:42:43.360]   Thank you for being here.
[02:42:43.360 --> 02:42:45.200]   Jarvis.medium.com.
[02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:49.120]   Jeff Jarvis.medium.com is his medium page.
[02:42:49.120 --> 02:42:53.280]   Of course, it's also Buzzmachine.com at Jeff Jarvis on the Twitter.
[02:42:53.280 --> 02:42:54.000]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:42:54.960 --> 02:42:57.360]   Stacy's @Gigastacey on the Twitter, by the way.
[02:42:57.360 --> 02:43:01.040]   And Mr. Ant Pruitt is Ant Pruitt on the Twitter.
[02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:07.440]   He's also on photography and hands on wellness and a beloved figure.
[02:43:07.440 --> 02:43:10.800]   Oh, retouching high key portraits.
[02:43:10.800 --> 02:43:12.720]   That's a good picture.
[02:43:12.720 --> 02:43:14.320]   Oh, I know he's not high.
[02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:15.360]   So you had to do it.
[02:43:15.360 --> 02:43:16.000]   Yeah.
[02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:17.280]   Oh, I'll be watching that one.
[02:43:17.280 --> 02:43:17.920]   That's great.
[02:43:17.920 --> 02:43:20.800]   Thank you so much, everybody, for joining us.
[02:43:20.800 --> 02:43:28.000]   We do this week in whatever the hell we want to talk about this week in Chipotle every Wednesday.
[02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:28.560]   1.30.
[02:43:28.560 --> 02:43:33.280]   Actually, sorry, 2 o'clock Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern time, 2.100 UTC.
[02:43:33.280 --> 02:43:36.640]   If you want to watch us do it live, you can tune in twit.tv/live.
[02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:38.480]   There's audio and video streams there.
[02:43:38.480 --> 02:43:41.360]   Don't know if YouTube's there right now, but everything else is there.
[02:43:41.360 --> 02:43:42.000]   No, but it's not.
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:42.800]   It's even worse.
[02:43:42.800 --> 02:43:43.280]   Wow.
[02:43:43.280 --> 02:43:44.960]   Keep this back for me.
[02:43:44.960 --> 02:43:45.680]   Is it?
[02:43:45.680 --> 02:43:46.560]   Oh, it's back for me.
[02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:47.840]   Hopping down and up and down.
[02:43:47.840 --> 02:43:48.400]   Wow.
[02:43:48.400 --> 02:43:50.160]   It's for their loyal watchers.
[02:43:50.160 --> 02:43:51.600]   It's coming back early.
[02:43:51.600 --> 02:43:52.960]   Oh, they know.
[02:43:52.960 --> 02:43:53.680]   They know.
[02:43:53.680 --> 02:43:55.360]   You're a YouTube star.
[02:43:55.360 --> 02:43:56.160]   That's how they know.
[02:43:56.160 --> 02:43:59.360]   We also have on-demand versions of the show.
[02:43:59.360 --> 02:44:02.960]   Twit.tv/twig is the website.
[02:44:02.960 --> 02:44:07.600]   There is a YouTube channel too with all the previous episodes you can go there.
[02:44:07.600 --> 02:44:14.080]   And don't forget, best thing to do is subscribe to your favorite podcast application.
[02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:15.600]   When you subscribe, you'll get it automatically.
[02:44:15.600 --> 02:44:16.800]   That way you don't have to think about it.
[02:44:16.800 --> 02:44:22.880]   Just have it whenever you're in the mood to listen to a fabulous episode of this week in
[02:44:22.880 --> 02:44:23.120]   Google.
[02:44:23.120 --> 02:44:25.040]   Have a wonderful week, everybody.
[02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:27.120]   We'll see you next time on Twig.
[02:44:27.120 --> 02:44:27.440]   Bye-bye.
[02:44:27.440 --> 02:44:33.680]   I'm Jason Howell, host of Hands on Android, where each week, I take a look at the Android
[02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:38.880]   operating system and really dive deep into what it can do for you and how it can improve
