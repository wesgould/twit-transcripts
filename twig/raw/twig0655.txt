[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.880]   Lots to talk about.
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.160]   The first deep fakes of President Zelensky.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.320]   Will it fool anybody and get ready more to come?
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.560]   Should we stop using Kaspersky antivirus?
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.160]   And TikTok starts getting a White House briefing.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.040]   I think Saturday Night Live did it best.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.320]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.320]   Not Twig.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.560]   Podcasts you love.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.120]   From people you trust.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.320]   This is Twig.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:45.160]   This is Twig.

[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.240]   2022.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.160]   No time for slug collation.

[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.480]   Traditional audio conferencing systems
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.120]   can entail lots of components installation could take days.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.640]   And you might not get the mic coverage you need.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.560]   That's complex-pensive.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.080]   But Nureva audio is easy to install and manage.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.920]   No technicians required.

[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.240]   That's easy-can-nomical.

[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.560]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.000]   Show me the latest news from Google and the Google
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   verse, the Facebook verse, the Twitter verse,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.840]   the Instagram verse.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.400]   Stacey Higginbotham is here from StaceyOnIOT.com.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.280]   Hello, Stacey.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.440]   That is a lovely sweater you're wearing.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.920]   For the radio audience, I just want to describe it.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.800]   It's like a speckled Robin's egg.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.720]   If a Robin's egg were black and white.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.200]   It's Funfetti.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.760]   Funfetti?
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.280]   Is that what they call it?
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.960]   It has a touch on the--
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.000]   Well, this looks like Funfetti cake.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.520]   --of the Norwegian--
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.480]   Yeah, Funfetti cake.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.120]   --to.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.080]   Yeah, it's a fish boat meets Funfetti.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.320]   And that is Jeff Jarvis, Leonard Taap,
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.240]   professor for journalistic innovation at the--
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.280]   Craig Newmark, graduate school of journalism
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.640]   at the City University of New York.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.800]   I'm thinking we really do sound like a morning show, actually.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.960]   At this point.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.120]   We do have the sound effects and everything.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.200]   Own it.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.760]   That's Ant Pruitt.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.360]   I'm Little Leo.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.280]   He's the mighty Ant Pruitt.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.160]   Twitter.tv/HOP.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.920]   That's right.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.920]   Working out his delts a little earlier.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.200]   So stand back.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.600]   They might burst through the screen.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.440]   My delts need a little work.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.600]   I saw you on Twitter saying how hard it was to work the delts.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.720]   Well, the rear delts.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.240]   That's the--
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.000]   The rear delts, the shoulder muscles, right?
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.840]   The deltoids.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.360]   Correct.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.720]   But you have three heads on your shoulders.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.440]   And the rear delt is the hardest one to work out.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.320]   So when they say you have a good head on your shoulders,
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.440]   they're talking about your deltoids.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.920]   Sure.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.920]   Sure.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.000]   The reason we're in a kind of weird mood
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.120]   is for the last half hour.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.600]   We were playing with this Amazon amp
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.640]   we talked about last week.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.720]   Turns out, one of the founders heard us,
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.600]   or more likely, his clip service alerted him.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.800]   No, I'm sure he's a regular loyal listener.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.600]   Matt Sandler.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.880]   Wishing for this week in Amazon.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.240]   Matt Sandler, he said, thanks for the kind words about on amp.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.600]   Love for you to play with the beta.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.880]   So he gave us a code.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.880]   Turns out the codes are easy to come by.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.480]   You have to have an iOS device.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.920]   It's an iPhone thing.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.360]   And I played a song.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.240]   I made some noises.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.760]   One person.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.720]   For a lot of noise.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.440]   A lot of noise you tuned in at the end.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.960]   And then one person was listening, which is--
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.040]   we took a call from John--
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.080]   Here in the live, in studio.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.000]   But it was for a meta.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.080]   It's kind of amazing, really, how technology makes it possible
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.040]   to do something that, you know, earlier time, my time,
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.840]   took a lot of money and a transmitter and a tower
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.160]   and a radio station.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.360]   It's like Howard Stern's screaming about how podcast
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.360]   ridiculous it is before John William made a fortune.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.280]   He's so wrong.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.480]   People kept telling Stern, do a podcast.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.960]   He said, no, they're a joke.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.160]   Kind of like the classical radio guy, right?
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.360]   Oh, I mean, I called into him.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.240]   Or like the old magazine people.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.600]   Yeah, same thing.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.240]   That's true too.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.000]   Same thing.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.560]   But you know, Stern got what they say, $200 million,
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.920]   or $500 million, $500 million to move to satellite from broadcast.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.960]   That works.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.960]   That's fine.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.480]   He's doing all right.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.640]   Rogan only got $200 million.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.960]   Pssst.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.560]   Poor sap.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.280]   Poor sap.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.600]   By the way, what ever happened to Joe Rogan?
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.800]   He's still there.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.800]   This is the funny issue.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.320]   But I was saying, there was no discussion of him now.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.080]   Yeah, well, yeah, it just kind of came and went.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.760]   I'm glad.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.520]   You know what happened?
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.920]   The war in Ukraine happened, really.
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.920]   Well, exactly.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.560]   Real news.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.200]   Real news.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.040]   And then all of the silly news went by the wayside for a while.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.960]   Good.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.680]   Gas prices went over $4.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.680]   By the way, it's over $5 here, right?
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.680]   Yeah.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.520]   It's only $6.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.600]   Yeah, it's like $6.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.120]   Yeah.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.720]   What's California's always been ridiculous?
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.760]   Well, we have--
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.800]   I always tell people that you're paying California prices now.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.880]   I don't know.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.840]   I think this is why.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.560]   Still not paying your--
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.080]   There's a law that gas you buy in California
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.160]   has to be refined in California.
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.600]   So it's more expensive because they have to ship it here crude,
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.680]   and then they refine it.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.680]   So that's kind of ridiculous because it's
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.680]   a pretty cool--
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.160]   It's still less than what they're paying your--
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.160]   Protection laws.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.240]   It's a protection law.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.680]   It was passed by the refineries, I'm sure.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.720]   It's like the chicken tax.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.600]   We're talking about this with Samable Sammett.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.160]   Wait, a minute.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.680]   Chicken tax?
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.480]   Do you know about the chicken tax?
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.120]   All your chicken's up to details, sir.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.840]   There's a 25%-- 25% tariff on light trucks
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.680]   imported into the US.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.360]   Let me tell you how that started.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.760]   Lyndon Johnson imposed the tariff in 1964
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.680]   in retaliation for European tariffs on American chicken imports
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.200]   or exports for us into Europe.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.320]   So they charge 25% on our chickens.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.480]   So we charge 25% on their trucks.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.920]   But in 1964, there weren't a lot of Americans importing
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.400]   light trucks from Europe, right?
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.200]   So the chicken tax has gone long gone.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.640]   In fact, the average US tariff rate on imports is 2%.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.000]   But the chicken tax on light trucks still stands.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.320]   How?
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.160]   Which means it's bizarre.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.080]   And so for this reason, a lot of trucks--
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.680]   it's actually been good for the truck industry
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.000]   in the United States.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.040]   Not so good, maybe, for competition and prices
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.840]   for people buying them.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.800]   The original order was a 25% tariff on potato starch,
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.200]   dextrin, brandy, and light trucks.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.600]   One of these things is not like the other.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.000]   Everything, all the other products, the tariffs are gone,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.400]   except for the light trucks.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.560]   That's why they call it the chicken tax.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.640]   This is, to me, why trade regulation is not often
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.400]   is to benefit somebody.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.680]   Also, I've mentioned this book tons of time,
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.040]   but I love this book about the history of the Great Atlantic
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.960]   and Pacific Tea Company.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.440]   It's the first chain store in America.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.320]   And the regulation that came out raised prices
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:41.320]   to protect mom and pop groceries and hurt consumers
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.480]   and voters.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.400]   Protectionism always does.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.920]   Well, OK, hold up.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.440]   Of corporate entities.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.040]   Well, yeah, maybe.
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.520]   Or you also might have benefits outside of just--
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.000]   I mean, raising prices to consumers
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   is not the only rubric we should look at.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.720]   We should also look at how the workers fared.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.440]   Was it better to work under a mom and pop store?
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.640]   Maybe.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.840]   Was there any stopping progress?
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.160]   No, well--
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.600]   But there is a chance to say, hey, is this progress giving us
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.480]   the benefits we want across the group?
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.200]   I'm not against that.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.000]   Is price the only benefit we want?
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.640]   I'm not against that.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.240]   The problem is these things tend to last outlast their utility.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.320]   And they have also, all sorts of unintended consequences.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.040]   The chicken tax--
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.920]   And the horse or chicken is out of the barn.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:27.800]   But every-- do you--
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.320]   Nothing has unintended consequences as well.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:30.840]   That's true.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.760]   No, you're right.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.680]   You're right.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.200]   I mean, it is Congress's job to try to level the playing field.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.520]   The only problem is all that money on one side of the sea
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.240]   saw really changes the equation.
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:41.760]   Yes.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.260]   Yeah.
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.240]   That is 100% shrink.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.600]   Hey, we knew it was going to happen.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.800]   It has happened about eight hours ago.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:54.800]   A video, a fake video with Ukraine president Zelensky
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.560]   was published asking Ukraine troops to retreat
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.120]   and surrender their weapons.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.040]   But it was a deep fake.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.400]   And an obvious deep fake file.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.000]   I think, fortunately-- in fact, I'll show it to you--
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.960]   fortunately, an obvious deep fake.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.200]   But it's only a matter of time before they're not obvious,
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.200]   right?
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.560]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.960]   No, I don't understand Russian.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.520]   But--
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.600]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.600]   Go ahead.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.080]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.600]   That's not his voice.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.240]   His head is kind of not--
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.240]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.480]   But you're on a battlefield looking at it on a small phone.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.800]   You might want to kind of retreat.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.120]   You might want to stop fighting.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.680]   You can think about these deep fakes
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.880]   because they're generally deep stupidity.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.160]   How long is that going to-- how long do we count on that?
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.040]   Well, but then we have--
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.040]   It's called tech though.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.120]   --systems.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.120]   This happened in text.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.480]   It happened in photos.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.800]   It happens in every medium of communication
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.840]   that comes along.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.680]   And that's why we have things like branded news organizations
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.880]   to tell you what's real and not,
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.520]   and to put the effort into reporting them.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.960]   I'm not terribly concerned.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.880]   Yeah.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.400]   This is-- it's sad that that's out there.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.680]   But I still enjoy the fact that there's tech available
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.120]   that we can utilize this from a creative standpoint.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.160]   You like Adobe's AI, for instance.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.880]   And as well as leaving the Blackmagic Design AI stuff, too.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.560]   It's good for creating decent cool content.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.360]   But yet, it can be put into the wrong hands
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.040]   and put stuff like that out there.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.840]   Here's a really good example of how it's not black and white
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.720]   in any case.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.680]   We've talked a lot about a ClearView AI.
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.840]   They were scraping face recognition
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:40.000]   from public places like Facebook.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   There's all sorts of issues with face recognition anyway,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.320]   especially with people of color.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.720]   But there are some uses for it.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.400]   Ukraine has started to use ClearView AI
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.280]   to identify Russian soldiers.
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.400]   Good or bad?
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.240]   I don't know.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.480]   Seems like it's a lot of that going on.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.200]   One bit of tech or some story that's
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.080]   happening around this war where it's--
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.640]   you want this AI to be for the power of good,
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.880]   but yet at the same time, it's still a bit of a mess.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.200]   Go be both ways.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.600]   Well, it clarifies that tech is a tool, and we can use it
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.000]   for a place.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.800]   And it also offers good examples of how it could
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.840]   be used in a negative way and in a positive way.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.360]   So then you can start thinking about legislation
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.880]   or regulation around it.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.680]   ClearView AI gave Ukraine free access.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.480]   They're using it at checkpoints as people
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.080]   are coming and going to vet people of interest,
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.200]   among other things.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.800]   Yeah, I think this is a good use of it.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.600]   We talked about Taylor Swift using face recognition
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:52.160]   under concerts to keep stalkers, another, a good use.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.600]   But if a questionable use might be retail stores
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.960]   like Home Depot or Target using facial recognition
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.160]   to profile shoplifters, putting into their stores.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.040]   Or, sorry, accused shoplifters.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.760]   Pro-fist, right.
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:13.600]   Not just accused, but tried and guilty shoplifters.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.920]   But they're not just-- they're doing a legend.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.520]   They're not just convicted shoplifters.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.160]   Well, and because of the high false rate of false positives,
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.160]   that's another issue.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.560]   And we've seen now a number of stories
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.400]   in the last couple of weeks of black men who
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.960]   have been held in prison, who have been arrested, who
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.960]   were detained because they incorrectly were matched
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.480]   by--
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.320]   Just like--
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:35.800]   --thought they did.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.080]   --I witnesses.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.240]   I witnesses are terrible.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.840]   I witness them for years and years and years and years.
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.720]   And so the discussion at the level of principle
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.640]   is the degree of confirmation that would be needed
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.640]   for either to be believed.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.320]   Here's a test.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.720]   And I think you raised another important point, too,
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.120]   is what this is all doing.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.520]   A lot of the presumptions about bad use or bad activities
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.560]   of the platforms, a war puts that in a different light.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:04.080]   Sure does.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.000]   So the platform is getting rid of bad content.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.800]   Well, they get rid of RT.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.400]   OK.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.120]   Well, then Russia kills the platform,
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.000]   and people can't get any information.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   That's OK.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:15.680]   Right.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.800]   It creates a new context for the discussion.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.680]   There's a story in our rundown about Slack
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.880]   that it hit close to home because--
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.840]   That troubled me.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.840]   I don't use Google Hangouts or anything anymore,
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.480]   but my family, our chat is Slack.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.080]   Really?
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:34.880]   Yeah.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.440]   Our group chat is Slack.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.480]   You want to follow up with each other?
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.640]   I'm not going to comment on that.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.160]   So what story?
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.920]   One about Slack cutting off access to it.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.120]   Yes.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:45.800]   That one.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.960]   Right.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.560]   Because they're being sanctioned.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.080]   That's affecting--
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.320]   But at the same time, what about the people there in Russia
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.800]   that has nothing to do with that war that may be just
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.320]   like the Pruitt family and use it as group chat?
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.680]   You know, to communicate, to make sure, hey,
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.080]   you got an appointment at four o'clock,
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.840]   make sure you're there on time, stuff like that.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.200]   Or developers trying to stay employed within the economy,
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.760]   or dissidents arranging events.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.200]   Well, the truth is, a lot of these sanctions
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.760]   seem a little misguided.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.760]   Well, people do them for a couple of reasons.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.440]   Sometimes they just do it to look good, right?
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.200]   Virtual signaling.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.040]   Signaling.
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:24.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.400]   So there's certainly that.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.280]   That's why Salesforce is doing it, but they own Slack.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:35.520]   But the other thing I think is even more serious concern
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.040]   is it seems to be you're doing this
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:44.040]   to put pressure on the populace to what overthrow Putin.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:44.760]   They're not.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:45.640]   Are they going to do that?
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:45.720]   They're going to do that.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.960]   Responsibly for the war.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.240]   If you want to punish oligarchs who are benefiting from Putin,
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.800]   that's one thing.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.440]   But if you're a Russian citizen, many of them
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:59.400]   seem to be against the war, they're suffering greatly, as we know.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.640]   And what is the end game of that, that you overthrow,
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.000]   like what you're going to rise up?
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.880]   Is that what we're trying to get done here?
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:06.880]   Putin doesn't care.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:07.440]   I do.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.280]   Doesn't care.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.240]   It sees the yachts.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.120]   Don't take away their productivity software.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:11.640]   There you go.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.160]   Yes.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:12.760]   There you go.
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.520]   There's a slogan.
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.360]   Take the yachts, not my Slack.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.640]   Show title.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.720]   Take my yachts, please.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.240]   Russian saying farewell to Instagram.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.600]   This is another example of that.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.160]   In fact, Instagram is really white.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.160]   That was because--
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.720]   Wasn't that because Russia cut it off?
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.160]   Russia cut it off.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:31.840]   Oh, OK.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.600]   On that side.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.080]   Well, to hell with you, Russia--
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.280]   Farewell posts at midnight on Sunday.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.800]   They gave them time to say goodbye, too, which is fascinating.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:47.280]   48-hour grace period to say goodbye to Instagram.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.720]   The reason Russia's regulator gave
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:54.760]   Ruscom Nansor is that Meta has decided
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:59.440]   to allow posts calling for violence against Russians
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.360]   on Instagram and Facebook.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.000]   And you know what?
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.920]   Honestly, if you take out the invading Ukraine
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.320]   part of this, I kind of--
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.040]   Of course, if we wouldn't want Russians
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:15.280]   to be able to post on a social network
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.280]   advocating for the assassination of--
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.160]   No, we wouldn't.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.120]   Are people?
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.120]   No.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.120]   The company made an exception to its policy
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.480]   against inciting violence so long as the posts represented
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:30.320]   political expression against Russian forces invading Ukraine.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.960]   Oh, calls for violence against ordinary Russian citizens
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.280]   are prohibited.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.080]   So Russia decided to cut off Instagram.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.760]   Yeah, that is a different story because that's
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:40.720]   Russia doing it, right?
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.480]   Mm-hmm.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.480]   I don't know.
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.240]   It's like Charity Bill Gates said,
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.920]   I'm not going to donate any money until I could do it right.
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.840]   I'm not supposed to throw money at things.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.080]   And I think it's the same thing, where
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.560]   it's hard to figure out what the right action is
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.720]   and where the kiss of charity, where the money should go.
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.240]   This is where states and sanctions--
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.840]   And I will come to agreement, I think,
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.080]   is that she says all the time that we need discussion.
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.200]   And I say all the time we need principles.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.760]   And yeah, we need discussion about principles.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.240]   What is it that we think?
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.680]   What's the internet we want?
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.600]   On what principle should it be to be ruled?
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.360]   How free should expression be?
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.280]   How much should we fight for that?
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.760]   Even in such cases as this?
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.120]   And how do we make exceptions?
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.800]   Because that's another-- I mean,
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.640]   it's silly to think--
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.640]   I mean, we might have fabulous moral principles, right?
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.640]   But at the end of the day, we all
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.840]   have to make decisions kind of individually,
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.240]   or even collectively, about what we're
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.640]   going to throw into the bus, as it were.
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.880]   But on what basis?
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:43.520]   What's our goal?
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.720]   And then we just have to commit to it.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.880]   Or change it.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.080]   The thing too, states, you're right,
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.200]   is that you can hit an exception and say, ah, that
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.160]   means the rule the principle was wrong you fought through.
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.920]   And so you can change that.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.520]   But you should live with the principle you then put out
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.520]   there, I think.
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.520]   Here's another complicated--
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.680]   Or you can say, yeah.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.160]   Go ahead.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.000]   Go ahead.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.480]   Here's another complicated one, Kaspersky.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.280]   Antivirus, very widely used.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.880]   It comes out of Russia.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.720]   The German government has said stop using Kaspersky,
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.360]   because we're worried it could be used to attack us.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.880]   As a backdoor, the German Federal Office for Information
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.840]   Security published the wording on Tuesday.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.920]   That's been an issue for a while.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.080]   Well, we remember, in fact, that Kaspersky
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:37.840]   was implicated in the famous leak of NSA tools
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.080]   from the United States.
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.800]   Remember that?
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.480]   I'm trying to-- what was the name of those tools?
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.280]   Let me see if I can find that.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:52.000]   The NSA contractor who brought those tools home
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.880]   had Kaspersky antivirus on his computer.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.960]   One of the ways Kaspersky works is
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.560]   if it senses something that's potentially dangerous, not
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.880]   necessarily something it has signatures for.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.480]   And a lot of antiviruses are doing this now.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.080]   And that's what's called cloud detection.
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.040]   They will take what they think is bad and upload it to the cloud.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.880]   Well, as it turned out, what it got was the NSA tools.
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:19.320]   And they were uploaded to the cloud in Russia.
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:22.000]   And it's always been thought that Kaspersky had connections
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.520]   with the Russian intelligence agents.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:29.040]   And they think that's how the NSA tools
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.280]   were leaked, in fact, to Russia.
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.680]   And that makes sense.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:37.360]   I mean, every government is looking for zero-day attacks.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.520]   Kaspersky, by the way--
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:39.040]   Because Kaspersky, by the way--
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.480]   --is a great way to get to that.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.400]   Kaspersky Lab, this is from the story,
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.880]   which was back four years ago.
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.720]   Kaspersky Lab does not dispute a discovered hacking
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.080]   tools on the computer.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.600]   But they say it's the NSA contractor's fault for bringing it
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.100]   home.
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:00.760]   They were using the company's antivirus software
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.400]   when it detected a piece of malware attributed
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.480]   to the equation group.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.880]   That was the name of it in 2014.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.520]   Sometime after that, the contractor disabled Kaspersky.
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.480]   But they're not sure when.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.960]   Then he turned it on because he downloaded and installed
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:17.960]   some malware.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.800]   This guy should not be a contractor for the NSA.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.520]   He downloaded and installed some malware trying
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.080]   to pirate Microsoft Office.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.480]   Lovely.
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.160]   The malware dropped from the Trojanized key
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.040]   gem was a full-blown backdoor.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.800]   So they say, Kaspersky says it wasn't us,
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.080]   the guy installed a backdoor.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:42.160]   Eugene Kaspersky, who is pretty well liked in the security
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:48.320]   community, has said, we are not part of the Russian government.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.280]   And we think that this announcement from Germany
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:54.800]   was political, not because of any technical, not
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.280]   for any technical basis.
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:57.960]   This is another one.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:58.480]   It's great.
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.480]   But we believe Russia don't mix.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.680]   That's just a practical level.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.600]   Kaspersky, I've met him.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.800]   He was a major fixture at Davos back in the day.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:16.400]   And he was very good at presenting a portrait of himself
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.440]   as someone whose business depended
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:21.120]   upon the credibility of their security.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.960]   But at some point, you lie down with the logs you get up with,
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:25.400]   please.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.200]   Right.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.560]   I would argue that the way all nations deal with cybersecurity,
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:35.160]   we'd have the same issue looking from the outside in at the US.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.400]   A lot of nations have brought in the US.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.480]   That's why Europe--
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.240]   We're fully written ourselves.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:50.840]   I mean, not me, but the US.
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.760]   Kaspersky has been careful not to criticize the Ukraine
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.960]   invasion, too.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:00.760]   He said, tweeted recently, he hoped negotiations would lead
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.800]   to a compromise between Russia and the Ukraine.
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:05.800]   Nice try.
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.160]   That's a fine line to ho.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.520]   They're killing civilians.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.200]   Nice try.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:17.160]   Let's see here.
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.040]   There's a few stories.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.120]   Jason was worried that this was a light news day.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.640]   There's some stories.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.680]   By the way, by the way, I'm sorry.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:27.600]   But he put in the possible title, as Jason does as we go along.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.160]   So take the yachts, not the slacks.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.840]   It sounds like it's take my pants.
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:34.760]   I can't.
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.120]   I like it.
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:37.920]   I like it.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.040]   That may be the title.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.520]   I don't know, unless something better comes along.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.600]   So you saw Saturday Night Live making fun of the fact--
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.560]   This is still is enough.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.080]   Making fun of the fact that the White House invited TikTok
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:59.960]   influencers to a briefing about how they can help with Ukraine.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.480]   Now, if you're looking at this picture
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.800]   and you're not a TikToker, you probably
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.640]   don't know that there is a very famous Asian guy
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.600]   and TikToker who does strange things--
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.560]   OK.
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.600]   --with plungers and--
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.600]   Dad, it splines it.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.100]   Yeah.
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.440]   Because I'm like, why does he have--
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.320]   I'm on TikTok and I had no idea.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:17.760]   I was thinking about--
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.480]   You've not seen him as a real person?
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.920]   He started not on TikTok.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.520]   He started, I think, probably on Instagram or somewhere else.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.720]   But certainly, I've seen a lot of that.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.360]   But on the other hand--
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.680]   TikTok feed, man.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.640]   I think it's probably a good thing for the White House
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.160]   to reach out to social media influencers.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.320]   It's good to explain--
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.560]   I mean, I think it's always good to brief people
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:40.920]   and give them your side as a story
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.800]   and explain what's happening and to provide ways
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:43.960]   to find more information.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.560]   I mean, that is never a bad idea.
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.560]   I understand a lot.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.040]   But they're not upsetting for training professionals.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.480]   Thank you very much.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.680]   Oh, there's a butt.
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.640]   Oh, I was going to say, but you also
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:24:00.280]   have to hope that these creators recognize
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:03.480]   they're being potentially spun, if that makes sense.
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:03.740]   I mean--
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:04.960]   Another way to look at it--
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.520]   a butt to your butt.
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.760]   I'll raise your butt, see your butt, and raise a butt.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.160]   Is that--
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.280]   I should-- sorry, no, that was not too late.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.720]   It's not about--
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:17.440]   your ear, however, I'll see your, however, and match your,
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:22.880]   however, is that it also shows respect to the people.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.520]   I remember when bloggers were allowed
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:28.000]   into the conventions to cover the political conventions.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.160]   That was a big deal to say bloggers can matter.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:32.640]   But you're right.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.080]   It's totally validating.
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.280]   And I think-- I mean, I think ultimately,
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.720]   I didn't make fun of the White House.
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.000]   People were making fun of the White House.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.240]   I was like, why are you making fun?
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.880]   This is a great or step.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.480]   And I don't know who they invited or what they were trying
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:48.840]   to do, but there are legit news platforms on TikTok.
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:51.960]   And they weren't inviting traditional news platforms.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.240]   They invited influencers.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.160]   No, but there's under the desk news,
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.400]   although now they have a deal with the LA Times.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.840]   I remember you mentioning number four under the desk news.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:06.160]   There's a Ukrainian journalist, Jules Zoltsev,
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.680]   who does good morning bad news.
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.840]   He's been doing many brief--
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.920]   he said it was kind of like a briefing for kindergartners,
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.400]   but he's kind of more up on this.
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.880]   The problem is the norms have disappeared.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:21.000]   So I mean, obviously, you brief the newspapers
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.360]   and the news channels.
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.840]   They have their press briefings every day.
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.720]   And they have regular press briefings.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.200]   But what if there's an influencer who
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.880]   has 10 times the audience of CNN?
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:32.400]   Like--
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.520]   You want to make sure that those people aren't saying dumb stuff.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.600]   So this is one of them--
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:39.040]   Ellie, this is from the Washington Post story about this.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.560]   Ellie Ziler, she's 18.
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.720]   She has 10 and 1/2 million followers.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.560]   That's more than CNN, right?
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.600]   That's more than all the news channels combined.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.400]   For Wolf.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:50.920]   And--
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.360]   No!
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.560]   And so, of course, you've got to reach out to--
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.440]   and yes, they're not trained professional journalists,
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.520]   so they could be--
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.520]   For Spun.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.520]   Spun.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.960]   Spun.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.680]   But I don't know.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.800]   You want to give them information.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.800]   I think it would behoove the way I was not to spend them.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:12.160]   Yeah, you want them to have the facts as you see them.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.440]   I mean, that's--
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.920]   I'm just skeptical of this.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.440]   But what if those same influencers take the information
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.560]   that they're given and spin it themselves
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.480]   into some other malarkey because they have that kind of reach?
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.360]   Well, that's--
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.240]   And that's going to continue to make them more viral.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.200]   That's Fox News and the press room.
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.000]   Right, right.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.960]   It's still the same old crap that we're dealing with
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:34.800]   from the smaller--
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:35.800]   And you're all going to use the smaller--
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:36.480]   I'm sorry, I have--
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.840]   Yeah, I mean, this isn't magic.
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:38.280]   It's just--
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.720]   Tell me, we're talking to me when I'm at the computer.
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:44.880]   If you believe in the power of information and transparency,
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.640]   you have to look at this and say, that's a positive move
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.520]   to be like, hey, we're going to tell you what we know
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.240]   and what we're telling professional news people
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.360]   because we know that you have a following.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.800]   If you choose to go this and take this
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.800]   and go do crazy things with it, maybe you
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:00.800]   don't get invited back.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:01.480]   Right.
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.480]   But that's why--
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.480]   It takes the most American thing in the world.
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.200]   The most American thing in the world.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.360]   Well, that's an interesting question.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.960]   I would hope they would do Instagrammers.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.280]   Youtubers might even be--
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:10.480]   Even more interesting.
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.160]   Right, you know, right?
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:12.920]   John and Hank Green.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.800]   It takes all these things.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.720]   They're where the--
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.800]   They're where the youth are.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.680]   They're where the attention is right now.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:18.960]   Also--
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.120]   There's a lot of Ukrainian attention now.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:21.760]   But--
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.080]   And YouTube, I guess you can't necessarily get it
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.000]   everywhere, right?
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.960]   I don't know.
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.120]   Well, and maybe the White House is kind of like, well,
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.120]   actually, that doesn't make sense.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.960]   So I was just saying, maybe they don't want to deal with Google
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.920]   or Meta, but they probably really
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.240]   don't want to deal with China.
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.160]   Chinese, huh?
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.520]   I'm like, oh, do we want to do it with--
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.160]   Yeah.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.160]   Here's-- I mean, can I play-- am I allowed to play a little of this?
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:48.960]   I don't understand.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:49.840]   Why not?
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:50.520]   It's not a song.
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.440]   It's not music.
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:55.920]   Is there something even more powerful we can attack him with?
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.800]   Poems.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.280]   Oh, no, it's that girl.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:04.560]   There's one where they do the TikTok dance with the five
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:08.680]   reasons why you shouldn't go to war with--
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.680]   We got it.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.200]   I know nothing about either.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.160]   He does a great gen sake.
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.200]   She's perfect, everybody.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.240]   For sake.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.080]   He's not a great button.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:19.560]   No, he's not.
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:20.960]   No, yeah.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.600]   By the way, the other SNL--
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.000]   I'm not jumping at it, but just--
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   my favorite SNL was the Amazon Store SNL.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.640]   I guess we could do that one, too.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:32.120]   And actually, that was pretty right on.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:32.560]   Really?
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:36.240]   This might not have been the best cold open I ever saw,
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:41.720]   but they were mocking the grab and go stores that Amazon has.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.080]   Let me go to the-- I'm sure it'll be posted on YouTube.
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:44.640]   It's not a Amazon.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.120]   Can I play this?
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:49.240]   Again, I feel so nervous.
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.920]   It's not music.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:51.640]   Yeah, but you can't--
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.120]   No.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:52.480]   How about this?
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.320]   How about this?
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.720]   Well, cluster them all in the show and everyone sees.
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.960]   The whole thing will get taken down.
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:02.120]   So we'll-- how about this?
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.240]   We're going to play it right now.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.200]   We're going to take that out of the main feed
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.240]   because we're worth nervous.
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.720]   But we will put it and everything we say about it
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.680]   into the club feed.
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.000]   It's the 1985.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.440]   This is--
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:12.920]   Oh, my god.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.720]   This is a parody of the stores Amazon has.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.760]   As you know, where you go in, and you don't have to pay.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.560]   You know what a shop where you can just--
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.960]   Is this a set or is it an actual grab and go store?
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.040]   No, I think that, too.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.760]   Because it really looks like the real thing.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:26.080]   It's--
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.960]   It's a grab and go.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:31.600]   These are all very white people from Seattle, Washington.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.080]   I just want to point out.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.080]   Oh.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.080]   Go down.
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.600]   Leave.
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.400]   Just walk out.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.400]   Yay!
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:46.040]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.080]   He puts a little bit of money on the turn style.
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:52.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:56.040]   Search Amazon, go store Black Man, track!
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.400]   I'm glad you can laugh, Ant.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.840]   I am glad you can laugh.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:01.760]   Holy cow.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.000]   I don't know.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.240]   It's a lot odd, isn't it?
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.520]   Yeah, it's a little too close to home, isn't it?
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:07.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:07.840]   It's close to home.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.160]   Would you--
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.520]   Let's be honest.
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:11.160]   Yeah.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.320]   I'm like, man, would you go in?
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:12.820]   No.
[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:14.320]   I could do it.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.320]   No.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.320]   No.
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:16.520]   No.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.320]   Not happening, sir.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.520]   It's a great idea, but no, no, bro.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.360]   This is an example.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.440]   We live in different worlds.
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:24.920]   Yeah.
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.560]   Are your experiences of world a little different?
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:28.320]   A little different.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.480]   It's a little different.
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.480]   But I am in a very happy world.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.280]   I must say that.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:32.760]   Yeah.
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.000]   We're glad to have you here.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.360]   And you know, you can just take anything you want from the--
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:36.880]   I do.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:37.080]   I do.
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:37.080]   I do.
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:37.080]   I do.
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:37.080]   I do.
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:37.600]   I do.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:37.600]   I do.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:38.100]   I do.
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:38.600]   I do.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.440]   Except for the coffee machine.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:39.440]   I do.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:39.920]   I do.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:40.440]   Coffee machine.
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:40.920]   Coffee machine.
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:41.440]   Coffee machine.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.440]   You're great.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.440]   All right.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.240]   Actually, yeah.
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:44.760]   We can't hear it.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:45.760]   That's been speaking Google.
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:50.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.480]   All right, let's take a little break
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.240]   so we can pay for the coffee machine that Ant is
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.440]   going to be taking home later today.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.240]   With permission.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.040]   With permission.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.800]   All the records on the record.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.560]   There's a lot of cameras in here, too.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.320]   That's a good coffee machine.
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:07.040]   Actually, you can't take it because Micah would kill you
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:07.960]   if you took it.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:08.880]   Micah, let's fight.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.240]   It's you and Micah are the rain.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.360]   We'll use it because you've got to turn it on.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.560]   You've got to wait for it.
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:14.760]   It's a big deal.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.080]   Micah, I was doing the kurig thing.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.560]   And he said, that's not coffee.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.200]   Yeah.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.160]   He and I agree on that.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:21.840]   How much is this machine?
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:22.960]   Let me just ask you this.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.120]   It's about, I think it was like $1,800.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.120]   Oh, OK, nevermind.
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.360]   I was like, get a form for Christmas.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:34.520]   That's more than a thermo name, so my god.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:35.760]   It's so good, though.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:36.280]   Oh.
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.760]   I'm getting you a thermomix.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.680]   I'm getting you a Brevo coffee maker.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.960]   And I'm getting you kachoy pepe.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.320]   Yes.
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:46.840]   I was in there just for $99.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.880]   I was in there this morning with Mr. Burke.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.320]   And I was looking for my phone because I
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.680]   have to stop watching there.
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.360]   And--
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.920]   Oh, did you bring the scale?
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.000]   Was it you brought in the scale?
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.640]   No, Mr. Nielsen brought the scale.
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.000]   But I'm looking for my stopwatch.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.680]   And I'm like, crap, I forgot my phone.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.840]   And then I realized, oh, this machine, it has the time already.
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.320]   Oh, man.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.320]   You know?
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.280]   It's just a--
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:10.200]   So, Anthony, too, is one of you.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.280]   He brought in a scale.
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.840]   So they weigh the coffee.
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:13.680]   Yes.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.240]   18 grams.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:14.240]   Yeah.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.440]   And you weigh your water.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.000]   18 grams.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.040]   Oh, you're getting me.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.480]   18 grams, 30 seconds.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.280]   Oh, geez.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:21.880]   Oh, they even converted symmetric.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.360]   Yes, that's even worse.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:24.680]   Well, that's how you got to do it.
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.040]   A fine grind.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.280]   See, Jimmy Carter got it wrong.
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.680]   If he just had coffee involved, he
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.000]   would be on the metric system.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.920]   But daylight savings time.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.160]   Hey.
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:36.760]   Not yet.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.080]   Are you Marco Rubio fan now, huh?
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.040]   Now how do you feel?
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:40.920]   This has been something--
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:41.440]   Get it done.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.600]   He's wanted to have it done for a long time.
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.400]   Oh, why don't we just keep it a standard time
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.840]   and change the time we do things?
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:47.800]   Wait, stop.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.600]   Wait, where are you going to do an ad this week
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.440]   before we continue on with the show?
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.080]   Yes.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:56.760]   Can I handle last week's false alarms?
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.320]   Thank you.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:01.760]   I'm halfway to my kitchen, and y'all are like, la, la, la,
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.760]   for stories.
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.040]   And so you know, folks, before we got on the show,
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.240]   I tried to get Leo to do a different story.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.000]   And you almost thought we all thought we were on the show.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.200]   So it was the same as last week.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.240]   Are we in the ad?
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.280]   Are we in a show?
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:16.040]   We never did.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.320]   I like to keep you off balance.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.200]   That's why we do this live.
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.960]   Keep it off balance.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.360]   That's OK.
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.880]   We definitely appreciate this.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.120]   Go get a snack.
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.000]   Go get some coffee.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.520]   Go get some katyo pepa, because it's time to talk about IT
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.160]   Pro TV.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:36.000]   You stay right here, because your IT team needs IT Pro TV.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.480]   They need the skills.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.360]   They need the knowledge to keep your business running,
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:43.200]   to keep it successful, to keep it secure.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.240]   That's what IT Pro TV is all about.
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:48.400]   IT Pro TV is the best IT training out there.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.400]   For individuals, we talk about that all the time.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.680]   But I also want to let you know they've got great team training,
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:53.320]   too.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.200]   And your team will love it.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.280]   You know how I know?
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:59.600]   More than 80% of users who start a video on IT Pro TV
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.160]   actually finish it.
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.760]   They watch the whole thing.
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:03.720]   That's because it's fun.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.440]   It's engaging.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.960]   Your team will enjoy learning on the platform.
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:10.120]   You've got to give your team the tools they need
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.800]   to do their job right.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.320]   You owe it to them.
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.160]   And they will appreciate the education
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:16.800]   that they're getting from IT Pro TV.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.720]   Courses are not just entertaining.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:22.520]   They're very informative, very binge-worthy.
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.440]   And they'll get new skills.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.520]   They can get new certs.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.720]   They can recertify.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:31.600]   And because the tech industry is always changing,
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.840]   IT Pro TV is always updating their content.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.280]   They've got seven studios running Monday through Friday
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.360]   all day to create new content.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.720]   Because there's always new software.
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:41.800]   There's always new systems.
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.200]   There's new cyber threats.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.400]   There's new tests, new questions.
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.920]   So you're getting up-to-date content that
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:52.400]   goes from those studios right into the training library
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.440]   in 24 hours.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:57.200]   There's about 5,800 hours worth of training.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.800]   And covering everything, not just technical skills,
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:03.200]   but compliance, soft skills, do business skills.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.960]   You can get all the training, all the certs
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:07.200]   for your team done in one place.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.760]   They've got every vendor, Microsoft IT, Cisco training,
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.360]   Linux training, Apple training, security, cloud.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.840]   They've got it all, and it's all up-to-date.
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:18.840]   Plus, you'll love the dashboard you get with the IT Pro TV
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:19.400]   Business Plan.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.080]   You can track your team's results,
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.480]   manage your seats, assign team members,
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.800]   unassign them when they're done,
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.720]   access monthly usage reports.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.960]   You'll see metrics like logins, viewing time,
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.560]   how many tracks they've completed.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.240]   You'll know everything that's going on.
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.560]   Makes it very easy to manage teams.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.200]   You can even manage subsets of users.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.520]   You can say, you guys are going to work on this.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:39.880]   You guys are going to work on that.
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.680]   Give them customized assignments.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:42.960]   You can monitor their progress.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.520]   You can get a report on how they're using the platform.
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.280]   Make sure it's working for them,
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.240]   that they're using it to its fullest.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:50.760]   You can assign full courses, of course,
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.320]   but also individual episodes within courses.
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.800]   And IT Pro TV's transcripts make it easy to find
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.720]   that part of the course that they need to learn about.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:35:59.920]   And with the advanced reporting,
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.160]   you'll know immediately how well your team is doing,
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.720]   whether they're watching them all,
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:05.400]   whether they're making progress.
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.200]   It's just a great way to train yourself
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.800]   and train your team.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.760]   Individual plans available, but also team plans.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.640]   And we've always talked about 30% off
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.000]   for the individual plans,
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.120]   for the life of your active subscription.
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:18.960]   Well, guess what?
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:23.960]   We've got 30% off too for your IT Pro TV team.
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:24.800]   That's right.
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:29.800]   Mention Twit 30, TWIT 30, to your IT Pro TV account executive.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:34.760]   You'll get 30% off, or maybe even more, on a business plan.
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.480]   For teams from two to a thousand,
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.760]   there are volume discounts too.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.280]   They start as low as five seats.
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:42.920]   Go to ITPro.tv/twit.
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:43.760]   Right now, don't forget,
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:47.480]   TWIT 30, Whisper, your account executive here.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:50.640]   TWIT 30, you'll get 30% off or more on a business plan.
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:54.800]   ITPro.tv/twit.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.600]   You need this, your team needs it.
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:59.720]   And we've known these guys since they started IT Pro TV,
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:00.880]   big fans.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:04.440]   ITPro.tv/twit.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.160]   And they have great T-shirts,
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:10.280]   which you are wearing, it says ITPro.tv and Chill.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.120]   And Chill.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.680]   In the Netflix style.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:13.520]   Oh, did you really?
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:16.800]   I was, I've been confused about this all the show long,
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.560]   and thank you.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.400]   He did not know,
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.200]   we're going to have to put a sponsor hashtag on the stand
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:24.360]   or something, just draw it in and then just mark it.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.200]   Or his face.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.680]   Or his face.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:27.840]   That's actually an interesting question.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.720]   I wonder if the FTC would say something about that,
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.280]   if you, no, thanks.
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.240]   No, we're just to close it right now, yes.
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.160]   It's disclosed.
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:36.520]   That's disclosed, yeah.
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.200]   Look how people have been wearing their swag,
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.920]   even if you don't listen to me see.
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.120]   I know.
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:42.960]   They never--
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:43.880]   I'm wearing Funfetti, swag.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.960]   Funfetti, is that a brand name?
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:50.000]   Do you not know about Funfetti Cake?
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.280]   I, yeah, but I mean, it's like a thing.
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.280]   It's not a brand.
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.000]   No, because pie is greater than cake, but--
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.480]   Oh, it is, Pillsbury Baking.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.320]   You're--
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.160]   Yeah, it is a sweater.
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:00.000]   Oh my God, you're right.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.880]   It looks just like your sweater.
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:02.720]   I had no idea.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.280]   Oh!
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.680]   I didn't know that I could take it out,
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.000]   because she's a trademark.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.840]   I can't believe y'all don't know about Funfetti Cake.
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.520]   But wait a minute, before we have to clarify this,
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.680]   Pillsbury has not given you any money to wear that sweater.
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:15.640]   Am I right?
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:16.680]   No, no.
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:17.680]   In fact, I can just wear it.
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.080]   I could, if you wanted to, Pillsbury, wing, wing, wing.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:21.520]   You're really missing out, Pillsbury.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.320]   Please take it if you offered it.
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.920]   Advertise@twit.tv.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:31.760]   So on Sunday morning, I got up an hour less sleep,
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.720]   because we set the clocks forward.
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:35.080]   Monday, I was groggy.
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:37.920]   In fact, every year, the Monday after the change
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:41.280]   to summertime, which happened early this year in the US,
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.960]   it's going to happen later this month in the rest of the world.
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.560]   There are more heart attacks.
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.120]   There are more auto accidents.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:52.800]   Marco Rubio, the senator from Florida--
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.800]   apparently, this has always been an issue for him.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.520]   He picks the big issues.
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:00.200]   And he got it passed on a voice vote unanimously
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:03.040]   in the Senate to stay on saving time.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.600]   Now, that's a little controversial.
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:06.360]   It is.
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:08.600]   It has to go through the House and, of course,
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.800]   be signed by the president.
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:14.400]   But I think there is broad part, nonpartisan support.
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.880]   For one thing in Congress, it's this.
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:17.320]   Wow.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.560]   Stop changing the clocks.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.360]   Now, the question is--
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.480]   It's been as a start.
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.360]   What should we--
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:22.880]   Which way?
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.560]   Which way should we stop?
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.320]   And Rubio said--
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.080]   I am anti-DST.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.400]   Really?
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:33.000]   Rubio said we would stay on DST in the fall.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:39.040]   Of 2023, November 2023, we would not go back to night dark,
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.920]   scary time.
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.760]   Why do you want to keep DST?
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.840]   And not keep DST.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:48.960]   So my issue is that in the winter, which
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.600]   is already dark and depressing time,
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:55.080]   the sun literally rises at like 8 o'clock here in Seattle,
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.360]   because it's so far north.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.760]   And it sets around 4.20.
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:04.240]   And I get the idea of the extra hour of daylight being
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.640]   at the end of the day, but waking up--
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.640]   sorry, not waking up--
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:09.440]   waking up at my normal time and being
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:12.560]   expected to do things in pitch dark.
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:15.320]   See, I think it comes down to if you're a morning person
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:15.960]   or a night person.
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:16.480]   I really do.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.840]   And I'm a morning person.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:18.880]   And it kills me.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.960]   I'm going to be up for like three hours
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.200]   trying to force my body when it's like--
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.880]   So believe it or not, we tried this in the '70s.
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:29.040]   And here's a picture from The Washington Post.
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.080]   Because of energy.
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:32.600]   Because of the energy crisis of kids
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:33.840]   going to school in the dark.
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.400]   And this is why people hated it.
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.520]   And in fact, it didn't last.
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:39.720]   I remember going to school in the dark.
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.920]   Why do we just change the starting time of school?
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:44.040]   There you go.
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:45.080]   There's a thought.
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.080]   Just moving.
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:46.640]   That's all?
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:47.120]   No.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:47.480]   No.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:52.120]   In 1973, the US decided to stay in daylight saving time
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:54.680]   for two years.
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.960]   By the way, this is a fairly new thing.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.840]   It started in World War II, right?
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.760]   My grandmother, my Republican grandmother--
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:01.840]   1916.
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.760]   --all the time.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.240]   Oh, '16.
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:05.880]   About God's time versus FDR's time.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:06.800]   Oh, wow.
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.320]   Oh, that's actually put it, huh?
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:09.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.120]   FDR's time.
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.480]   It's like the Obamacare of that era.
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:13.680]   Yes, yes, yes.
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:15.760]   You know, now I know why Arubio is against it.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.280]   No more FDR time.
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:21.680]   But there-- I mean, our time zone--
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:24.120]   our time zones are not--
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:28.040]   are they set by national-- no, it's set by longitude.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.040]   Right.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.880]   So something interesting to know,
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:34.040]   because Washington state already passed a law that said,
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.720]   hey, we're going to DST time if it ever federally passed it.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.760]   California's done that too.
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:42.280]   Yeah, so when this law happens, all the state--
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:44.000]   it basically gives states a choice.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.960]   So some states have already passed laws that say that's--
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:46.960]   That's--
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:47.960]   No, it's chaos.
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:48.960]   It's chaos.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:49.960]   But hold on.
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:50.960]   Hold on.
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.360]   Now, Arizona, which we all may be familiar with,
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:57.560]   is on standard time year round, because you didn't have to--
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.720]   you could have-- anybody could do that.
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:01.120]   Just not-- yeah.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:04.520]   So they did that instead, because they were like, all right,
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:05.960]   we don't want to change the class, stand up.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.360]   It doesn't mean Indiana have like slices that go different ways.
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:10.360]   I feel like they--
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:11.520]   Oh, they used to.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:12.560]   I think they changed that.
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:17.240]   But I do remember, because my first wife lived right over the border
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.400]   in Ohio.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.240]   And it was very strange.
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:23.320]   It was very strange that you had these weird time zones going
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:24.440]   over a state border.
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.840]   And it was just very strange.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:29.360]   So this just shows you there is nothing
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.720]   not controversial in the whole world.
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:32.720]   Clearly.
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:35.160]   Because if anything, you would think this--
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:38.440]   I mean, unanimous vote in the Senate that--
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:39.760]   This is what they can do.
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.360]   They can't do anything else that actually matters.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.360]   No.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:45.120]   This is what the American Academy of Sleep Medicine immediately
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:46.960]   issued a statement, cautioning.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:50.680]   Cautioning, then a move to permanent daylight saving time
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:55.600]   overlooks potential health risks associated with that time
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:58.120]   system.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:03.560]   Standard time, they said, for so many scientific and circadian
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:05.520]   rationales--
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.600]   It's a little bit dark when you're trying to get up.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:08.960]   Now we're bringing out the big guns.
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.960]   Circadian rationales and public safety
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:16.320]   reason should really be what permanent time is set to.
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.280]   Because permanent time is based on our time zone.
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:20.960]   So our bodies will--
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.760]   Our bodies adjust already with the time.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:24.200]   Oh, they--
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.800]   Yeah, we get used to it.
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:26.480]   Yes, no.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:30.600]   So living so far up here now, I like in the winter,
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.840]   at like deep as dark as winter, at like 8 o'clock,
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.720]   my butt is out of bed.
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.680]   It's hard to get out of bed, but the best way
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:40.560]   to make it get you feeling like human beings--
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:41.680]   I throw up in the curtains.
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:42.880]   --to go out.
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:47.120]   You can walk out for like five minutes into the daylight.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.600]   And you have to do that.
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:49.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.120]   Otherwise, you're like this.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:51.680]   No, no.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.560]   When I get up, I throw up in the curtains.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:54.040]   And you're right.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.640]   If we're dark out--
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.840]   Oh, I thought you said you throw up in the curtains.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.640]   --tends on hell the night before it went.
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:03.400]   That also sounds unhealthy.
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:06.560]   But I throw up in the curtains--
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.200]   --open.
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:11.120]   --to let the sun shine in like it is in your office right now,
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:11.840]   Jeff.
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:13.000]   And that's a great way to wake up.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:13.500]   And you're right.
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:14.600]   You should probably go outside.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:18.480]   Well, why do we never hear any of these controversial stories
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:21.520]   in the state of Alaska?
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:22.120]   Their time is--
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:22.640]   --sueeple moves.
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.040]   --when it's there.
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.200]   And frankly, Bainbridge Island, too,
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.320]   I have to deal with the fact that they're higher up
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.640]   by the latitude, and they're going to have much sun.
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:31.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:32.280]   That's his life.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.600]   Welcome to Helsinki.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:34.240]   Yeah.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:38.920]   Move to Brazil, if you want to.
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.400]   So where is Seattle--
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:41.160]   I love those maps.
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:42.760]   Well, ironically, it's--
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:46.360]   it's your senator, Patty Murray, who co-sponsored this
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.440]   with Marco Rubio.
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:50.960]   Patty Murray said, the Senate has finally
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:54.440]   delivered on something Americans all over the country want.
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:55.840]   And I will agree with her on this,
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:58.960]   to never have to change their clocks again.
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:44:59.440]   Right.
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.840]   Let's not change them, but what do we leave at?
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:02.360]   Right?
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:04.160]   You know what you could do if you don't
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.520]   want to change your clocks ever again?
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:09.320]   Y'all, just make every clock an internet-connected clock.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.480]   Make it a different time.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.000]   You're going to have to buy magic.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   Yeah, that's already happening.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.120]   Hell no.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:18.640]   It's not the actual physical act of changing the clock,
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:19.280]   or I like--
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.320]   I'm just saying, if that's your issue,
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:22.720]   we can solve that to change.
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:25.480]   I just don't want it to be a different time when I wake up.
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:27.720]   We know that VioT has spoken.
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.240]   We have clock changers.
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:33.960]   Actually, you know, completely off topic,
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:34.480]   but "Socken."
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:39.920]   "Bucking in Palace" has a brigade of clock changers.
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:40.640]   Did you know that?
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:41.480]   I did not know that.
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:44.120]   I read this somewhere.
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:45.040]   Let me see if I can find--
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.000]   I'd like that on my resume.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.640]   Royal clock changer.
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:55.680]   Yeah, they-- I think there are 450 clocks at Windsor Castle.
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:56.640]   Good Lord.
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:59.280]   There are 600 clocks at Buckingham Palace.
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:00.400]   Did someone as the god ask--
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:04.600]   And none of them are automatic, OK?
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:05.360]   Wow.
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:09.040]   Queen Elizabeth's palaces have over 1,500 clocks,
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:11.320]   and they all need to be reset.
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:14.960]   A whole team of conservators is required
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:18.680]   for this massive horological undertaking.
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:24.080]   It is quite the horological undertaking.
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:27.840]   Here's a picture of a horologist looking at a clock.
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:32.120]   You want another one?
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.440]   This was by Joff growing up when I was--
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:36.520]   Here's another one.
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:37.720]   The guy has a very--
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.680]   I gotta say, he's got a monk's toncher.
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.280]   He's definitely-- yeah, these guys, look at this.
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:45.440]   They're going to change all these freaking clocks.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:46.440]   Every one of them.
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:47.440]   They don't change.
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:50.200]   Well, there's a watch store, expensive watch store in New York
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:53.040]   where they make a big deal about how that night they
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.360]   change all the watches.
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:58.440]   I put on the-- in the Twitch chat,
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:01.080]   the map of the equivalencies.
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:03.640]   What major city is Seattle equivalent to?
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.000]   Latitude across the world.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.960]   Latavostok.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:10.520]   Yeah, we're actually the farther north in parts of Maine.
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:12.000]   But Paris is very far north.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.320]   I didn't realize that.
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:14.320]   I know.
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:14.680]   It's up in Canada.
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:16.480]   That's that whole thing.
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:17.480]   Yeah.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:21.560]   Europe's only warm and habitable because of the Atlantic
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:22.520]   current thing.
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:23.720]   What's that called?
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:25.360]   Coffee?
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:28.600]   No, it's the thing that we're worried it's going to shut down.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:30.480]   It's a current over the oceans.
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.880]   Yeah, the Gulf Stream.
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:33.640]   Jet Stream?
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.400]   Gulf Stream.
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:35.000]   Gulf Stream.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   Gulf Stream.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:36.840]   So San Francisco--
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:38.400]   And for a word, it's going to shut down.
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:38.920]   Let's see.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:39.440]   That's all.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.600]   We are-- Seattle is about Paris.
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:42.800]   Portland's a little south of that.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.440]   San Francisco-- oh, yeah.
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:46.720]   We're on the Costa del Brava.
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.640]   We're a very nice, warm--
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.200]   Where Fargo is.
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.000]   Fargo is--
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:51.840]   I like where San Francisco is.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:52.440]   Is that Ukraine?
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:53.720]   I don't know where that is.
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:55.920]   I really couldn't pinpoint Ukraine in a map.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:58.080]   I think that's Poland, maybe.
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:47:58.920]   No, that's Ukraine.
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:47:59.520]   Fargo's in Ukraine.
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.480]   No, Ukraine's to the right.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:01.520]   Ukraine's to Ukraine.
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:02.840]   Ukraine's right next to Russia.
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:03.720]   That's the issue.
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:04.880]   Oh, yeah, right.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:05.880]   So Winnipeg.
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:09.080]   Remember, Winnipeg's in Ukraine is the beef.
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:09.600]   OK.
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:15.000]   The only reason we're laughing is--
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.720]   well, there's no reason to be laughing.
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:18.520]   We should be very serious.
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.760]   Denver is in southern Italy.
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.520]   Denver is in southern Italy.
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:24.200]   See, that doesn't make sense at all.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.360]   It always made me laugh, because Texas was like--
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:28.280]   my Austin was in line with Morocco.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:29.520]   And I'm like, oh.
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.560]   That's pretty hot.
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:33.000]   Displaying.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.160]   Anyway.
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.360]   Facebook has a TikTok now.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.120]   They do.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:39.680]   That's the stupidest story ever.
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:41.040]   It is.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:41.680]   I'm the one who--
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:42.160]   Are they calling it?
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:42.960]   Bookmarked it.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:46.080]   They're calling it Facebook TikTok.
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:47.200]   I don't-- yeah.
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.600]   Facebook, see?
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:50.360]   And look at all the followers it has.
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:51.240]   That's what's fascinating.
[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:52.680]   21,000 followers.
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:53.840]   Oh, they have a--
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:54.680]   I thought they launched--
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:55.000]   I know.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.360]   Isn't that confusing?
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.400]   It's-- that's me too.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:59.240]   That's why I clicked on the story.
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.360]   Yes, me too.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:05.480]   So Facebook has an account on TikTok.
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:07.240]   Well played tech crunch.
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:07.840]   Well played.
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:08.680]   Well played.
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:09.760]   Editors of tech crunch.
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.640]   I should say.
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:15.440]   Mark Zuckerberg says, NFTs are coming to Instagram.
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:18.960]   That seems like a terrible idea.
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:22.200]   Instagram users will be able to quote mint things
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:23.800]   within the environment.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:27.720]   Now you can abuse and rip off people on Facebook.
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:28.240]   Where?
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.920]   Is this just like so you can show your--
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:31.920]   But that's the thing.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:33.360]   NFTs on?
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:34.320]   No, no.
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:37.440]   Mark says, we're working on bringing NFTs
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.680]   to Instagram in the near term.
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:42.000]   You sell like 90-year-old Mark.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.120]   Yeah, but what does that mean?
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:45.080]   Like, you know, is that like--
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:47.800]   I'm not ready to kind of announce exactly what
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:50.800]   it's going to be today, but over the next several months,
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:54.280]   the ability to bring some of your NFTs in, hopefully,
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:59.080]   over time to be able to mint things within that environment.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.160]   Oh, OK, so I could mint them.
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.360]   You could.
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.320]   Yes, that's the idea.
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:05.080]   You could.
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.720]   I don't get it.
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.400]   Well, right now all those gas fees going to other people,
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:12.280]   they got to get those gas fees coming into their Facebook
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:13.960]   coffers with their beaks.
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:14.480]   Right.
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:15.160]   That's what you're saying.
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:19.640]   So remember Facebook started at cryptocurrency
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:20.840]   DM, which failed?
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:22.800]   They folded it.
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:25.160]   They folded it.
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:29.760]   They have a cryptocurrency wallet now called Novi.
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:30.240]   OK.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:34.000]   And who doesn't have a crypto wallet?
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.480]   I have one that I can't access.
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:38.120]   Everybody who's anybody has a wallet.
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:43.440]   So I guess the idea is you would--
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.000]   I don't know.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.040]   You'd put your NFT in your wallet.
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:48.400]   Well, I don't know.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:50.440]   I don't get it because there's a lot of--
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:53.840]   There's a lot of entity artists out there on Instagram,
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:57.800]   quote, sharing their NFTs on Instagram.
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:59.640]   Well, you could put a picture and say, hey,
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:00.600]   that's not what this is.
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:00.880]   No.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.640]   This would be-- instead of OpenSea,
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:03.440]   you'd use Facebook.
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:04.360]   You'd use Instagram.
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:05.640]   You'd use your Novi wallet.
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:06.360]   Right.
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:06.880]   So that's--
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:07.520]   So you're linking--
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:08.640]   It's just a way to make money.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:09.040]   --with the whole way.
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.320]   There's a way to make money, right?
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.360]   It's NFTs in the metaverse too, right?
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:12.840]   OK.
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:13.920]   Yeah, that's what he wants.
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:14.440]   OK.
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:17.680]   But by the way, Zuckerberg spoke by video,
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:18.880]   South by Southwest.
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:19.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:22.880]   I saw basically no discussion of it.
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:25.360]   Sounds riveting.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:27.440]   There's fewer people at South by Southwest.
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:29.920]   I think goodness have not been--
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.360]   there's just fewer South by news in general,
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:33.720]   because I don't think there may be--
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:36.440]   Surprisingly, you're right.
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:37.680]   I mean, that would be--
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:38.320]   years come by.
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:41.800]   That would have been a big story.
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:42.440]   The last time--
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:43.440]   That's something the people walked upon and prayed.
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:46.240]   Was it, "Pessout by Southwest?"
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:48.320]   He got in a lot of trouble.
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:49.840]   Did he?
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:50.560]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:51.920]   Sarah Lacey, who interviewed him--
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:54.080]   Oh, I remember that, because she kind of flirted with him.
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:54.640]   I was there.
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:55.640]   Oh, boy.
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.200]   She did not flirt with him.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:02.840]   Well, that was the kind of story she was making googly eyes.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:04.640]   Sexism was showing.
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:06.760]   OK.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:07.240]   I like it.
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:10.160]   But she also-- this was early marketing time.
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.040]   So she also just wasn't as tough on him as people
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:13.400]   thought she should have been.
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.320]   Uh.
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:16.760]   Twitter hasn't--
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:17.600]   That's where I met him.
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:18.840]   NFT connection.
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:20.640]   Now that I think about it, if you're
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:25.400]   on the iOS app, you can connect your crypto wallet that
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:30.080]   has your NFTs displayed in it and use that as your avatar,
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.360]   I believe.
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:32.920]   Someone may want to fact check me down.
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:40.560]   Then, Miss Stacy, do you think Twitter would have had a wallet
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:43.560]   if Mr. Dorsey was still there?
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.480]   He was all in the crypto, right.
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:46.040]   You know, he--
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:47.160]   No, it's interesting to question that.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:50.000]   Fair interesting question.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.520]   Well, but is that going to compete with Stripe?
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:54.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:56.960]   I guess that makes sense.
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:59.560]   Conflict of interest, whatever you want to call it.
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:02.880]   Little disappointed, Google has announced Google I/O,
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:06.080]   May 11th to 12th, and it will be online.
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:06.720]   Square.
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:07.200]   That's right.
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:07.720]   Square.
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:08.240]   Sorry.
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:09.440]   Online, not--
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:10.840]   Maybe online?
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:13.840]   No, in person, online.
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:15.120]   Oh, well, wait a minute.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:16.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   Join I/O.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:17.840]   OK.
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:19.640]   I'm wrong.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:20.640]   Is that a seat map?
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:22.080]   Look at your history books, folks.
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:25.400]   I can't cancel this thing.
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:25.920]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.800]   First, I have to say, the site use cookies.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:28.960]   OK, got that.
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:29.400]   Oh, yeah, I did.
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:31.480]   Now I can close that.
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:35.120]   Now I can read Join I/O live from Shoreline and online.
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:36.720]   Oh.
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:37.640]   Lovely.
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:38.640]   I want to go to that.
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:39.920]   Lovely.
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:42.400]   Jason, are you going to go?
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:44.120]   Oh, we have to always figure out who's
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:47.880]   got to use the real live ticket and all that stuff.
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:48.880]   I won't be here that week.
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.080]   I'll just tell you that right now.
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:52.720]   Were you going to be May 11th, as well?
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:53.520]   Somewhere from--
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:53.960]   I'm famous.
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:54.960]   Oh.
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:55.480]   Ooh.
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:56.000]   Ooh.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.640]   Doing an event?
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:00.760]   Doing an event on the Industrial I/O team.
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.120]   It won't let me into it.
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:05.520]   Y'all are very sweet.
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:06.520]   Ooh.
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:08.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:13.040]   So what is this on the front at I/O.Google?
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:15.240]   This is a clock.
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:18.160]   But is it a game?
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.240]   I thought that was a stage.
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:20.240]   I'll tell the clock.
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.680]   Why do you tell the time with the clock?
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:23.280]   No.
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:26.520]   Ooh, it makes music, too.
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:30.960]   So days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:32.760]   Someone get went too down on the horn.
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:36.920]   So the yellow one is ours.
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:38.520]   The blue one is days.
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:40.080]   The little tiny dots have to be days, though.
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:41.040]   Pink dots are minutes.
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:43.440]   Well, no, there's a color.
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:44.640]   Well, if it's actually counting--
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:49.360]   Oh, there's an outside circle.
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:50.800]   Are there 55 with them?
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:51.640]   Yeah, one.
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:53.320]   That's a lot to count, ma'am.
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:54.600]   Two-- wait a minute.
[00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:55.760]   Oh, geez.
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:57.200]   Oh, boy.
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:57.800]   Oh, dude.
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:59.440]   There are 18 hours.
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:01.800]   Look, I just counted 18 hours.
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:02.320]   Y'all are fine.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:05.480]   Oh, boy.
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:06.840]   Why did you screw it up?
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:10.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:13.040]   There, it's back the way it was.
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:15.680]   So why, when I click the dot, does it all?
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:16.760]   See, they do this.
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:17.840]   They have a puzzle, right?
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:21.600]   And for Google I own.
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:24.480]   That's why I would never get hired at Google.
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:25.640]   My mind doesn't work that way.
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:28.600]   You would be a great quality assurance tester.
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:30.160]   Yeah, like what the hell is this?
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.680]   You're breaking things.
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:35.440]   All right, anyway, I guess we'll cover that.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:38.080]   We'll do the keynote May 11th.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:41.960]   And we'll send somebody, probably Jeff and Jason.
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:44.880]   I'm thinking maybe you two, Ant, if we get enough--
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:45.440]   You might come out.
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:46.480]   I'd love to go down there.
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:47.760]   It's fun to go.
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:48.680]   It's really fun to go.
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:49.760]   You haven't been Idaho, probably.
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:50.520]   Haven't been Idaho.
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:51.040]   Yeah, you should go.
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:52.320]   Oh, Ios, really great.
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:53.440]   People are really nice.
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:55.360]   I went to one of the extensions down
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:57.680]   here several years ago in San Francisco,
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:02.120]   but never on campus in Mountain View.
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:02.680]   Maybe.
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:07.200]   If I were using Vimeo, I'd be a little perturbed right now.
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:14.400]   Vimeo, which is owned by IAC, Barry Diller's IAC,
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:16.280]   which is a big Hollywood agency.
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:18.160]   Oh, it's timing and--
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:20.000]   Oh, that's right.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:20.680]   The Meredith.
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:22.800]   They shut down those magazines.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:26.080]   Apparently, money crunch don't know.
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:33.720]   They're going to start charging people more for Vimeo hosting.
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:36.200]   This is an article from The Verge quoting
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:39.000]   Lois Van Barre, a digital artist from the Netherlands,
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.840]   who joined Vimeo 13 years ago, has a number of videos up there.
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:46.760]   She says, "I was already paying $200 a year,
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:48.040]   which I think is pretty expensive,
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:50.520]   but I thought, well, it's a quality platform.
[00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:54.080]   She had 117 subscriber-only videos so far.
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:58.560]   She uses it for her subscriber-only Patreon content.
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:00.880]   Each one only gets around 150 views on average.
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:02.960]   Her most viewed video, I 800-15 views.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.360]   So not driving a lot of traffic.
[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:09.120]   She got a notice from Vimeo on March 11th saying,
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:13.240]   her bandwidth usage was within the top 1% of Vimeo users.
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:14.960]   Doesn't reflect very well on Vimeo.
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:16.040]   That scared me.
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:18.560]   And if she wanted to keep hosting her content on the site,
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:20.560]   she'd have to upgrade to a custom plan.
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:24.320]   Her quoted price $3,500 a year.
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:26.040]   But worse, she was only given a week
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:29.840]   to either pay for it, decrease her bandwidth usage,
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:31.800]   or leave Vimeo.
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:34.120]   Do you know how many independent filmmakers
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:36.120]   are out there using Vimeo?
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:36.640]   Absolutely.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:38.760]   It's a ton of high-quality--
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:39.840]   Because it's the best quality.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:40.600]   Yeah.
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:42.480]   And they're getting-- I'm sure they're getting way more
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:44.760]   than a couple hundred views a month.
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:47.000]   You think they're paying thousands of dollars a month
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.160]   to Vimeo?
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:53.720]   Vimeo is actually deleting files.
[00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:55.120]   Channel 5, a popular account doing
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:56.920]   Man on the Street-style interviews,
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:58:01.240]   got this message in January in a post on Patreon titled,
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:03.800]   Vimeo is holding our catalog hostage.
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:05.000]   That's crazy.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.080]   Channel 5 creators say that on returning from a trip
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:09.080]   they saw their videos disappearing
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:10.920]   from the Patreon feed resulting in hundreds
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:15.120]   of angry messengers and the lost of more than 500 subscribers.
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:21.480]   The quote from Vimeo for their new custom plan $7,000 a year.
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:23.080]   And you either upgrade or you move them.
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:26.160]   You spun off by AAC, which by explaining part of this.
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:28.680]   Ah, they want to make it worth something.
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:32.280]   I didn't see any other comment from Vimeo regarding
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:36.000]   the percentage-- what did they say she was in the top 1%?
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:36.840]   1%.
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:39.080]   There's no way.
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:42.960]   800 views is not a lot of views when there's a ton of difference.
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:45.480]   There's thousands of accounts that have been abandoned
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:47.600]   for years and years and years and years.
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:49.200]   And still getting the ton of views.
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:50.480]   OK, I have videos there.
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:52.680]   I wonder if my Vimeo's are gone.
[00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:54.080]   Go check.
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:54.680]   OK, let's see.
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:56.920]   This partly comes from the fact that Vimeo is pivoting away
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:01.280]   from the perception that they are kind of an independent YouTube
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:01.480]   right.
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:02.480]   Right.
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:02.800]   Right.
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:07.200]   What they really want to be is a B2B solution.
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:09.960]   It's for businesses to post their videos.
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:16.320]   He's one of the CEO of Vimeo, an Anajali Sud,
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:20.160]   said back in February, today we are a technology platform,
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:22.400]   not a viewing destination.
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:25.240]   We're a B2B solution, not the indie version of YouTube.
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:26.360]   So that's the problem.
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:30.440]   It's just kind of-- Vimeo has changed from what it was
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:31.440]   to something else.
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:33.160]   And actually, I've seen this coming for a while.
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:34.320]   That's fine to pivot.
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:37.680]   But yeah, something's not right with those numbers, at least
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:40.280]   not with that quote, I should say.
[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:43.720]   Oh, my video is still on Vimeo.
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:44.880]   How many views?
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:46.720]   Nobody's watching it.
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:49.000]   Oh, I said nobody go watch it.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.360]   Only 845.
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:54.320]   Yeah, but that puts you in the top 1% then.
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:58.040]   No, because I only have one video there.
[00:59:58.040 --> 00:59:59.600]   I have one video.
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:04.720]   It's been there six years and only 845 views.
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.360]   Well, now you've got me wondering.
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:08.080]   Let me just log in real quickly and see.
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.160]   Thanks, y'all.
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:12.320]   Now you've got me wondering.
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.640]   I can add-- see, it really does look like B2B.
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:18.640]   Add team members, modern tools for modern businesses.
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:24.600]   Here is a video I posted five years ago called Segwaying.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:26.560]   Let me see how many views.
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.200]   Wait a minute.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.440]   I hope you've got to hit the banner.
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:29.640]   Oh, I hate these things.
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.040]   Go away.
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:31.520]   Go away.
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.360]   It's new and improved.
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:33.840]   No, no.
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.920]   Boy, that looks like B2B.
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:39.800]   Look at that slow motion.
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.000]   Ooh, look at you in that one.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:41.560]   27.
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:42.560]   Boom.
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:43.400]   Fancy.
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:44.240]   Boom.
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.240]   I remember this.
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.320]   If you like it slow--
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:47.200]   You still have it, Leo?
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:47.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:48.800]   Have your Segway?
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:49.760]   Yeah, the batteries died.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:50.760]   I got to get new batteries.
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:53.400]   If anybody knows how to get new batteries here
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.080]   and it's going from slow to fast,
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:59.880]   this is a time lapse through the streets of London.
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:01.000]   Look at that.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:01.480]   I don't--
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:01.680]   That's absolutely--
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:05.080]   Where do you see how many views you've got?
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:05.800]   Video actions.
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:06.400]   And we've got it.
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:06.800]   Got it.
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:07.800]   Got it.
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:08.560]   How do I--
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:09.760]   It's a nice video, sir.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:10.920]   It's kind of cool, huh?
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:11.400]   Oh.
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.960]   It was when Hyperlapse first came out.
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.160]   Yeah.
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:17.440]   Inafreet says that Google I/O is going to be--
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.400]   Press is going to be online.
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.600]   Oh, man.
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:22.080]   Oh.
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.680]   Oh, man.
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.400]   Oh, let's pan it then.
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:28.200]   So I was in a double decker bus right in the front.
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:30.520]   And I had Hyperlapse from--
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.080]   it was Facebook, right, or Instagram.
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.200]   I can't remember.
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.200]   The thing was--
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:35.840]   No, I think it was Facebook.
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:39.240]   And I put plaster the phone up against the window
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:41.520]   and then we got to drive through rush hour
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:42.240]   in a double decker bus.
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.240]   It's so smooth.
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:44.000]   Look at the cycles.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.760]   Well, that was cool about Hyperlapse, right?
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:46.160]   Yeah.
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:47.800]   Look at all those people on the street.
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:48.880]   I can't-- I can't cope.
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:49.400]   Oh, my god.
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:50.800]   They're not wearing masks.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.720]   Run!
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:54.440]   This is 28 days later.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:55.640]   Look at all the lighting caps.
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:57.160]   Looks no different from Manhattan.
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:58.160]   I figured--
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.600]   Some-- some-- 100 years from now,
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.920]   this will be on some site on Mars.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:09.960]   They'll say, we've got a 4K copy of London in the 1850s.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:12.880]   So I don't see where you see how many people--
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:15.600]   Yeah, no, your view counts not showing.
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.360]   Yeah, my view count shows.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.200]   My screen did not look like this screen at all.
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.080]   Where's your show up, though?
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:24.320]   They've already converted you to the B2B platform.
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:24.720]   I might--
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.280]   You know, I might actually pay for this.
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.240]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:30.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:31.440]   Wait a minute.
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:32.160]   No, no, wait a minute.
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:35.880]   It says, come back to Vimeo Plus and save 25%.
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:37.920]   My-- here, I can't share my screen.
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:38.840]   Can I share my screen?
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:39.960]   No, don't share your screen.
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:40.800]   But just where is it?
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.200]   I don't-- like, here's when we moved into the brick house.
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:48.240]   Mine's-- so mine is right beneath my name as the creator.
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:50.440]   I get play-- I get the triangle play sign,
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:51.560]   and it says 8.5.
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:54.400]   I get the hearts and the collections and the comments.
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:58.200]   This is before we moved in in 2011.
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.560]   I've been trying to figure out where the dad gum brick house
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:03.400]   was, and Mr. Howell just told me today.
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.720]   Oh, it was.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.600]   Oh, no.
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.440]   I was thinking-- I was way off on.
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.120]   I thought it was like a bull of a--
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.760]   Look how bad this looked.
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:15.280]   We really fixed it up.
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.520]   There's our-- there's our--
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:20.160]   Roger Ambrose, our set designer, and Jim and--
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:22.360]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.880]   The builders.
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:25.720]   Yeah, it was--
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:26.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:28.800]   Memories.
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:30.240]   That was the basement.
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.080]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:31.640]   The basement.
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:32.040]   The bricks.
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:34.240]   So I don't know why I don't see you.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:37.320]   Maybe I have some--
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:38.600]   You're on the B2B point.
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:40.040]   You know, I sit on top to come back.
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:41.600]   I can send you a link.
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.240]   Oh, you know what?
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.240]   I'm not logged into my platform.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:47.720]   Oh, if you log in, you don't see.
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:48.080]   Here.
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:49.280]   That seems odd.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.200]   That's really weird.
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:53.840]   You should see it, if anything.
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:54.360]   Anyway.
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:56.960]   So maybe if you log out-- oh, look.
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.760]   Mash Potato found me.
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:01.000]   Mash Potato found you.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   Yes, my three video videos.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.640]   Mash Potato found you.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.200]   I don't know.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.680]   I don't know what that means.
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:10.720]   I have zero views.
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:11.720]   I'm the chamorant.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:12.800]   I have zero views.
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:13.920]   Keep the link in.
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:14.600]   I have zero.
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:15.280]   It says zero.
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.440]   Why is there a lock next to the segue one?
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:19.240]   Did you just put it there as backup?
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.280]   Oh, it's private.
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:20.760]   It's private.
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:21.600]   That's why.
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:23.680]   Oh, well, I guess I shouldn't have showed that.
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:24.520]   I probably didn't have permission.
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:25.520]   Oh.
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:27.640]   [LAUGHING]
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:30.040]   Well, if you need to, you could show mine and see.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.040]   I still don't see your view count.
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:33.240]   I'm looking at yours right now.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.400]   Oh.
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:35.240]   OK, let me see.
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:35.760]   Let me see.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:35.880]   Let me see.
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:38.000]   Stacy's Vimeo.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.680]   Stacy, I'm trying to go to-- I'm not logged in either.
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:44.120]   I searched for Leo's London video,
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:46.240]   and I can't scroll up to see how many views it has.
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:47.400]   Yeah, so I don't know.
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:47.900]   It doesn't--
[01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:48.400]   This is like--
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:49.000]   Vimeo is changing.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.360]   You have to click on a video to click.
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.160]   So if you click on that video, scroll down.
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.240]   Yours looks really-- no, I'm scrolling all the way down.
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.200]   Frogs sound like--
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:58.120]   Oh, it doesn't?
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:04:59.040]   No, it's not showing.
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.480]   Oh, that is so weird.
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:03.920]   That is-- that's not even what mine looks like.
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:05.720]   And I'm not logged in.
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:08.600]   And that's not how you spell Higginbotham.
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:09.080]   What?
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:09.720]   All right, let's take--
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:12.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:14.680]   I was like, I made this account.
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.440]   I should know.
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:18.440]   It's fake, clearly.
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:20.200]   It's Anastasia W.
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:26.120]   So apparently, according to my artist in the chat room--
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.120]   No.
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.680]   Leo's tour says 27 views.
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:32.720]   OK, we'll take your word for it.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:33.720]   That's probably about right.
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:36.160]   Because we know, yeah, I mean, that was a long time ago.
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:37.520]   I don't ever publicize--
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:40.480]   You also put it on YouTube, I would imagine, right?
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.040]   Yeah, probably.
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:41.520]   You did.
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:44.280]   I saw it on YouTube, originally.
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:46.400]   Hey, let's take a little break, because I want to tell people
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.000]   who are going back to work.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   It's going to be OK.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.920]   It's now the whole thing is hybrid work, right?
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:53.280]   Some of you are in the office.
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.640]   We had a lot of people in office today,
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:58.880]   because it was Wednesday, lunch day, which was really nice.
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.920]   But there's still a lot of people who don't want to come in
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:02.120]   and want to stay home.
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:03.760]   And that's the future of work, I think,
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.320]   is this kind of hybrid thing.
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:07.360]   But that means your conference rooms
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:09.880]   have to be kind of considering this.
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:11.520]   And audio is a big deal.
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:14.000]   If some of the people are at home, some of the people
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.680]   are at work, everybody needs to be heard clearly.
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:18.520]   You don't want people straining.
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:19.800]   You don't want them shouting.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.200]   But you also want them to be comfortable.
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.640]   You want them to be able to move around.
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:24.720]   That's why you want Noreva.
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:27.400]   Many people with their conference rooms, they go, just,
[01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.360]   you know, I guess if you don't think about it, oh,
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.920]   we got to go get the audio visual company in.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:32.840]   And they're going to measure.
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.400]   They're going to do sound tests.
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:35.520]   They're going to run wires.
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:36.440]   We're going to have microphones.
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:37.960]   We're going to have speakers.
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.960]   We're going to have all kinds of DSPs and stuff.
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:42.560]   And it's going to cost a lot of money.
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:44.720]   And they're going to have to come in and tweak it every once
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:45.680]   in a while.
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:49.280]   That's expensive.
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:52.080]   The industry has changed.
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:53.720]   Things are changing.
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:56.760]   And the best thing that's happened to conference room audio
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:01.760]   is Noreva, N-U-R-E-V-A with their patented microphone
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:03.080]   missed technology.
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:04.240]   Noreva makes it very simple.
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:05.320]   You just put in a--
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.760]   what it looks like a sound bar.
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:07.400]   It's a speaker.
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:10.400]   It's got some integrated microphones.
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:13.160]   But it fills the room with thousands of virtual microphones
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:15.360]   using computational audio.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:16.880]   So there are no dead zones.
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:20.040]   Everyone can be heard clearly, no matter where they're facing,
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.680]   no matter where they're standing.
[01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:24.040]   And you don't have to have a technician come and calibrate it.
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.800]   In fact, you can install this yourself for a really big room,
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.120]   put a couple of speaker bars in.
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:30.960]   Meeting participants, class participants
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.400]   can talk and move naturally in the space.
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.920]   And the people who aren't there won't be second class citizens.
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.520]   They'll be able to hear exactly what's going on.
[01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:41.640]   And by the way, it's continuously calibrating.
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:43.680]   So they're always ready with optimized audio.
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.400]   You don't need an outside technician.
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:47.240]   Your IT department can handle it.
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:49.680]   Your IT department will love this because they don't even
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:52.240]   have to go from room to room with the Norevas.
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:53.720]   You'll get a Noreva console, which
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:56.600]   means IT can monitor, manage, and adjust the systems
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:59.760]   from anywhere, no matter how many rooms you have.
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.880]   Noreva's installation is simple, a 30-minute DIY job.
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:06.560]   If you can hang up a sound bar, you can install an Noreva.
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:08.320]   So you're going to save on installation.
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.040]   You're going to save on cost.
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:12.680]   You're going to save on maintenance.
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.600]   And you're going to love the quality you get
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:17.080]   with this microphone miss technology.
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:20.880]   So really ask yourself before you just do the obvious,
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:23.200]   instead of going with that costly, complicated,
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:26.160]   traditional system, make the leap to simple,
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:28.080]   to economical Noreva.
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.000]   It actually works better.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.560]   Great audio simplified.
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:36.720]   N-U-R-E-V-A, Noreva.com.
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.240]   That they even invite you on the web page.
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.000]   Compare us to the competition.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.560]   Please, Noreva.
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:44.960]   This is a perfect example of Silicon Valley finding
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:46.000]   a better way to do something.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.080]   And I know it's a little inertia.
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.800]   We've got to get people to try it.
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.720]   But I think if you do, you'll realize how much better
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:54.120]   it is Noreva.com.
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:58.560]   Thank you, Noreva, for supporting this week in Google.
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:08:59.720]   May I add in?
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:00.800]   Yes.
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.680]   I've had to be teaching the first seven weeks so far,
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.880]   hybrid, that some of the students are coming in by video.
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.640]   How's that been?
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:08.600]   It is hard.
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:09.600]   Yeah.
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:10.240]   I wish I had Noreva.
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:12.560]   Because we've got an expensive little pod.
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:13.560]   Yeah, they can--
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.040]   I'm also wearing a mask.
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:15.760]   Yeah, I hate this.
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:17.920]   And so trying to-- and students are in the back,
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.640]   because we're trying to stay distant and trying
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:23.080]   to be heard by the people on the video.
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:26.040]   And I also came to a faculty meeting by video,
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:28.200]   where half the faculty were there and half weren't.
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:30.600]   I really came to appreciate the difficulty of the students,
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:31.240]   because the--
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:32.960]   Now you know how hard it is.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:33.520]   Yeah.
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:35.040]   Oh, it's just boring.
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:37.640]   Are you using a polycom in the middle of the table?
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:38.320]   Exactly.
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:39.600]   Not even in front of the room.
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:40.000]   Yeah, it's--
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.080]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:43.480]   New, New, New, New, New.
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:44.760]   This is the way to do it.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:47.160]   Yes.
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:48.240]   I didn't realize it's Google.
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:49.240]   Yesterday had a big event.
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.520]   If I had known, we would have covered it.
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.480]   Although Paul said it was kind of boring.
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:54.720]   It was their Stadia--
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:56.080]   Well, he's a Microsoft guy.
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:57.920]   Well, he said it was very kind of--
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:59.520]   Stadia.
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:00.240]   Oh, Stadia, yeah.
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:04.040]   It was the Google for Games developer summit.
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:04.920]   It was kind of stiff.
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:09.000]   But one thing Google did announce, which is kind of interesting,
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.600]   is they really wanted white label it for other companies.
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.600]   So Stadia, which you probably are familiar with,
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:19.080]   is Google's streaming gaming service.
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:21.200]   And it doesn't compete well, I think,
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:24.880]   with Microsoft's offering or Nvidia's offering,
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:28.240]   because you have to buy the game full retail price.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.480]   But you never own it.
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:34.480]   You buy it $60, but it's sitting on their servers.
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.040]   And if you're not a Stadia subscriber,
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:37.160]   you lose access to it.
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:39.040]   So that's, I think, a little annoying.
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.080]   It does work well.
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:42.040]   The back end technology is good, especially
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:44.560]   if you have this special Stadia controller, which
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:47.880]   uses Wi-Fi direct, so it doesn't have latency or not
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:48.640]   as much latency.
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:51.040]   And so it's a better way to play.
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.840]   That's a better way to play.
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:55.360]   So this year, Google is going to let any--
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.280]   so there'll be some changes here.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:59.120]   They're going to have white label partners.
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.440]   In fact, AT&T is the first one.
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:06.880]   So AT&T is going to have games that they offer
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:09.960]   to their customers on their phones using the Stadia back end.
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:10.960]   But it'll be white label.
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:12.520]   It won't say Google, it won't say Stadia,
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:14.040]   or in little letters, I don't know.
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.920]   But it's an AT&T product.
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.320]   I thought this sounded familiar.
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:20.200]   This was reported back in February of this year.
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.080]   Oh, yeah, the white label.
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:24.560]   They also will let any Stadia game developer
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:28.280]   offer an instantly accessible free trial of the game.
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:30.880]   And you don't even need a Stadia account to play it.
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:33.240]   So you click on YouTube or a search
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:35.480]   ad or social media and you can play the game.
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:37.960]   This was something like that, that they promised.
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:40.440]   They're finally getting around to doing.
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:43.120]   People will be able to browse the Stadia store for those trials,
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:43.320]   too.
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:48.600]   So you'll be able to find free games or free trials.
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:52.160]   Even if you don't have a Stadia account, you can browse the store.
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:53.600]   This is really interesting.
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:58.240]   They're going to offer a number of tools, like DXVK, which
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:02.200]   will let developers port games written with Unreal Engine
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:04.960]   or Unity to Stadia.
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:08.440]   So that's a very big deal for developers,
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.880]   because they don't want to write a second kind of version
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:14.720]   of the game if they can avoid it.
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:18.880]   So they're really pitching developers.
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:20.520]   And I think that that's-- you've got to get them
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:22.360]   before you can get the gamers.
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:24.360]   Mm-hmm.
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:27.680]   So there you have it.
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:31.360]   I still get emails about my free monthly game or whatever.
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:35.360]   I think I have Stadia, but I don't have it anymore.
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:38.960]   I just logged in just to confirm that I don't have it.
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.880]   And it says, yeah, get Stadia Pro.
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:41.240]   Right.
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:42.360]   So maybe I don't.
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:45.200]   Maybe I cancel.
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.360]   Yeah.
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:48.840]   Sounds like it's exciting you, too.
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.000]   Yeah.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000]   That's the approach.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.160]   That's the approach to Stadia from everybody, I think.
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.160]   Yeah.
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:57.400]   Or at least I really wanted it to work, because I did, too.
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:00.160]   As a Mac user and a Linux user, a lot of games
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:01.720]   are not ported to those platforms.
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:06.520]   To be able to play PC games in the browser is a great idea.
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:10.800]   I have one person that seems to be standing behind.
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:15.120]   And he's a twig listener, Mr. Leo, not LaPorte.
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:17.560]   But he totally digs the Stadia experience
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:18.960]   with his phone and everything.
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:19.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:21.480]   It's a great idea.
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:22.880]   It's a great idea.
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:25.120]   Meta told workers on Friday, you're
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:28.360]   going to have to do your own laundry.
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.120]   Where's my violence?
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:33.200]   I mean, I feel for these people, because it always
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:35.600]   sucks when someone takes away a cool privilege.
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:38.120]   But it's kind of like people who are like 28 complaining
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:41.200]   that their family took them off their Netflix or company.
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:43.400]   But it's more dastardly than that.
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:43.920]   Oh, gosh.
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:48.160]   They are starting dinner at 6.30,
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:50.440]   but the last bus is six or some such thing.
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:52.080]   Yeah, apparently there were complaints
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:54.160]   that people were packing up big to go boxes
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:55.320]   and running out to the bus.
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:57.280]   Run!
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:58.120]   So--
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:13:59.640]   But you totally see people doing it.
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:00.120]   Of course.
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:01.720]   Why not?
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:03.320]   Give it away, the meal.
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:05.080]   I don't want to stick around work to eat it.
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:05.920]   So--
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:06.360]   Thank you.
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:08.680]   When I worked at Time Inc, low many years ago,
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:10.480]   they used to have dinner on closing nights,
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.160]   because people would work through the night
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:13.360]   and we were all macho.
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:18.720]   And you'd also get a dark car home after a certain hour.
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:19.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:22.120]   So people would wait as long as they could stretch out
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:25.680]   every edit, drink as-- they also stocked the editor's offices.
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:27.120]   They had a bar cart.
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:29.920]   I think it's important that people know that Time Inc.
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:34.400]   had a bar cart that roved around the offices.
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:37.080]   Well, actually Time magazine, because they were higher class
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:40.240]   than we were people, they just stocked the editor's credence.
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:41.920]   The editor's had credence, but--
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:43.640]   It seems so counterproductive.
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:44.880]   Sounds like my old IT department.
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:48.080]   Portion, I missed the bar cart by a year.
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:49.160]   By a year ago.
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:50.640]   It just seems like-- do you really
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:53.600]   want your writers to be drunk?
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:54.280]   Oh, wow.
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:57.560]   There's this whole mythology about drunk writers.
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.200]   Thank you, Trim and Capote.
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:01.000]   Oh, drunk editors at Time Inc.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000]   It just seemed like--
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.480]   They would go to dinner at the steakhouse
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:04.160]   and then come back.
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:05.800]   You did not want your copy edited that.
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:07.200]   You did not.
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.040]   Who wants to even--
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.960]   He's been reworking a lunch game from somewhere.
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:13.960]   I don't understand the appeal of it at all.
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:19.840]   We had a guy who had a serious bad breakdown on the 29th floor.
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:22.840]   He threw his chair out the window, broke the window--
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:23.340]   What?
[01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:24.200]   --of the guy's building.
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:26.000]   Luckily, it was over another building that's in the below.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:26.480]   Yikes.
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:29.600]   He threw his A-text terminal out, which dangled by the wires.
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:30.600]   What?
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:34.480]   He was taken to the ER and then into--
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:35.240]   The Looney bin.
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:36.200]   He talks tank, right?
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:38.400]   And guess what the editors did, who took who came back--
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.240]   They brought him a bottle.
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:42.920]   They drank-- well, I got to have a drink.
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:44.320]   Wow.
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:45.800]   Wow.
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:47.320]   This is what I'm writing about now.
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:52.080]   Apparently, at Microsoft, they call it the Balmer Peak.
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:56.000]   This is from XKCD number 3, 2, 3.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.240]   This is a graph of blood alcohol concentration
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:01.640]   right between 0.12 and 0.16.
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:04.760]   There is a peak in programming skill
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.880]   that cannot be achieved any other way.
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:09.640]   Called the Balmer Peak, it was discovered by Microsoft
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:10.800]   in the late '80s.
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:14.440]   The cause is unknown, but somehow a blood alcohol content
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:20.240]   between 0.129% and 0.138% confers superhuman programming
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.360]   ability.
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:25.960]   However, it's a delicate effect requiring careful calibration.
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:29.880]   You can't just give a team of coders a year's supply of whiskey
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:32.240]   and tell them to get cracking.
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:34.000]   Has that ever happened?
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.960]   Remember Windows ME?
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:38.680]   I know it.
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:39.200]   OK.
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:42.200]   This may be apocryphal.
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:45.160]   Google employees are unhappy.
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:46.880]   Well, they're unhappy, too.
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:48.600]   Their Facebook employees are unhappy.
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:49.600]   They're unhappy.
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:50.080]   They're unhappy.
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:51.080]   And nobody in the country can--
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.760]   With pay, promotions, and execution.
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:57.360]   They get killed?
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.920]   I would prefer to be hanged if you don't mind.
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:01.960]   In the annual Google Guised survey,
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:03.860]   Google Workers gave their employer, particularly
[01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:08.760]   poor marks, according to CNBC, on how compensation compares
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:11.600]   to pay for similar jobs at other companies.
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:13.400]   This is just a trend worldwide.
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:16.400]   This is a work trend, a great resonation.
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:17.680]   Yeah.
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:21.040]   But a lot of it is because of inflation and housing
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:23.880]   prices in the Bay Area are insane.
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:26.640]   So it doesn't matter how much you make, you can't afford a house.
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:29.560]   I got to tell you, I appreciate you all buying lunch today here
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:30.560]   at Twit.
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:32.720]   It does mean a lot, sir, because boy, everything
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:34.680]   is so much more expensive right now.
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:35.080]   It is.
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:35.560]   It is.
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:35.560]   It is.
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:36.560]   It is.
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:38.560]   Especially gas.
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:43.240]   46% of survey respondents said their total compensation
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:47.040]   is competitive compared to similar jobs at other companies.
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:48.720]   That's 12% down, though.
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:51.520]   46% is fewer than half.
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:54.600]   56% say their pay is fair and equitable.
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:57.680]   That's a drop in eight points.
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:59.640]   64% of employees said their performance
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:04.080]   is reflected in their pay, that they work as hard as they
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:04.440]   are paid.
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:09.240]   My performance is reflected in their pay.
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:11.080]   I always told me that they actually work very hard.
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:12.960]   I'm sure they do.
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:14.960]   A Google spokesperson said, we know our employees
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:17.520]   have many choices about where they work.
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:20.400]   So we ensure they're very well compensated.
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.520]   It's a lot cheaper to keep an employee happy than it is
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:24.000]   to train a new one.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:24.960]   That's for sure.
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:27.800]   Yeah.
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:30.640]   I think this might just be a general cultural phenomenon
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:32.640]   as much as a Google--
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:33.040]   It's also--
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:37.120]   It's also, dare I say it, generational.
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:38.120]   You sound like a boomer.
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:38.680]   Hold on.
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:40.280]   What makes you say is generational?
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:41.280]   OK, boomer.
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:42.920]   I'll see you it is.
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:44.480]   I do always got to get crap for that.
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:46.520]   I don't want that to throw it.
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:47.520]   She just leaves.
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:48.520]   She just leaves.
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:51.480]   She says I'm out.
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:52.280]   OK, sorry.
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:53.520]   No, I was reacting.
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:54.880]   I just had to let my dog out.
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:56.400]   So my reaction--
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:58.960]   Is that why you call it when you scream into the pillow?
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:01.600]   You're letting your dog out?
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:02.600]   Exactly.
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:03.600]   Yeah.
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:04.600]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:05.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:06.600]   I got it.
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:11.640]   It might be generational only in the sense
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:14.040]   that people who are younger and recognize
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:16.080]   that they're not going to get to the point
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.360]   that basically all of this is BS when you wake up
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:22.120]   and realize that, why would you keep this job?
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:24.720]   I mean, and put yourself in their shoes.
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:26.400]   You don't even have houses yet, Jeff.
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:29.280]   They can't get houses because the housing prices are insane.
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:32.000]   It blew my mind to see the RVs.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.960]   The first time I went to the Google campus,
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:35.560]   the living in the parking lot.
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:38.200]   They're in the DAG park in Palo Alto.
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:39.360]   All around Palo Alto.
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:43.720]   I'm like, on the computer rail, there's campers, both sides.
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:44.240]   Open down.
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:49.160]   I went there to meet a friend that loves to quit.
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:50.680]   And I thought I was in the wrong spot
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:52.480]   because of all the RVs in the parking lot.
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:54.040]   It's like, this can't be Google.
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.360]   He's like, yeah, this is where people live,
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:58.720]   because it's cheaper to do this.
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:00.920]   You want to get your eyes opened.
[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:05.840]   Follow Reddit's anti-work subreddit/r/antiwork.
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:07.320]   That doesn't work.
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:08.360]   Yeah, I mean, it's just--
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:09.240]   Anti-work.
[01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:09.880]   Anti-work.
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:10.360]   OK.
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:11.720]   I'll just say, anti-eat's work.
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:13.080]   Here's a tweet from Burger King.
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:13.720]   You're beautiful.
[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:14.240]   You're loved.
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:14.760]   You matter.
[01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:16.040]   Don't forget it.
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:18.800]   And then from a response from low voter turnout,
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:21.000]   you pay people $8 an hour.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:27.320]   McDonald's near me pays $16 an hour.
[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:29.960]   Even my daughters looked at that and go in, yeah,
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:30.720]   maybe I'll work there.
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:33.040]   I was like, you're going to smell like French fries.
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:36.320]   And she's like, that's awesome.
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:37.440]   No.
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:37.960]   No.
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:44.000]   Yeah, I don't think it's--
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.520]   maybe it's generational in the sense
[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:48.200]   that this generation got a raw deal.
[01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:57.520]   But also, because our generation, Jeff and my generation,
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:02.200]   were able to work jobs and get paid enough to buy a home
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:04.360]   and build a family and send the kids to college.
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.280]   And now we're sticking around and not retiring.
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:08.200]   And we're not making any room for the people who follow.
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:09.560]   Yeah.
[01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:10.080]   Yeah.
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:12.680]   You've created policies and you vote against any sort
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:14.000]   of affordable housing you're at.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000]   Like, I see the people here as well where I live.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:16.880]   OK, there's that.
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:18.600]   And yeah, I took out loans in college,
[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:20.800]   but it was a total of $16,000.
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:21.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:24.520]   I'm going to say, you still work just as hard as everybody else,
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:25.440]   didn't you?
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:26.840]   It's not a function of--
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.320]   But I see there's other things--
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:30.080]   But these people are working hard.
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:31.080]   They're working even harder.
[01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:31.960]   They're just not getting anywhere.
[01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:33.720]   And they're not getting as much as they can play.
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:34.720]   Yeah.
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:36.840]   So I mean, it doesn't even-- at that point,
[01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:39.560]   you look around and you're like, why am I working so hard?
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:40.120]   Screw it.
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:44.760]   Meanwhile, Google's sponsoring F1, the McLaren cars.
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:45.680]   Ooh.
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:46.960]   That's some money.
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:47.480]   Look at that.
[01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:49.440]   It says the Android on the fairing there.
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:50.200]   And look at--
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:50.720]   Look at that.
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:54.120]   It's the wheels have chrome up caps, the chrome colors.
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:57.000]   Don't show it to the Google employees, though.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.320]   Official partner, the McLaren Formula One team,
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:04.520]   and the McLaren Extreme E team, which is their electric F1.
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.040]   Ooh, yeah.
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:08.760]   Y'all the computing inside the F1?
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:10.360]   Google could bring-- plus, they're going to get it.
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:13.120]   Hopefully, they push that team onto GCP,
[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:15.440]   and they'll get those sorts of cool things.
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:16.400]   GCP?
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:17.400]   Google Cloud.
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:18.800]   Google Compute.
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:19.640]   OK.
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:20.000]   They're fun.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.760]   McLaren Racing.
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:22.240]   McLaren's--
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:23.480]   Is that Daniel?
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:24.400]   Is that Daniel?
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:29.160]   Daniel Ricardo and Lance Stroll.
[01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:30.440]   I'm sorry, Lando Norris.
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:30.880]   Oh.
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:31.600]   Not Lance Stroll.
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:34.880]   Lance Stroll has got his own money.
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:37.240]   Daniel Ricardo, who's great, Lando Norris is great.
[01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:38.800]   So that'll be fun.
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:40.800]   Watch him, McLaren.
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:44.280]   Race with-- I love the hubcaps or whatever they call those.
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:45.280]   I love that.
[01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:45.800]   No caps.
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:45.800]   No caps.
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:46.160]   No, these are those.
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:47.120]   No, these are those.
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:47.480]   These are those.
[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:48.480]   That would be amazing, too.
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:50.080]   Yeah.
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:52.840]   So I wonder how they do it so that if it spins,
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:54.960]   it stays a solid color.
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:56.560]   I wonder, hmm, that's interesting.
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:57.400]   That's a photographser.
[01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:57.920]   That's a photograph, sir.
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:58.640]   Oh, it's a picture.
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:58.640]   Yeah.
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.640]   Photographser.
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:01.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:02.440]   How do they do that?
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:03.720]   I'm talking about deep fakes.
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:04.960]   I'm not a car isn't moving.
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:05.880]   How do they do that?
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.480]   But it looks like it's moving.
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:11.440]   That's called a great pan with the awesome shutter speed.
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:15.080]   But I feel like there may be-- they will do something with those--
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:18.360]   yeah, you're right, not hubcaps, but those pubs
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:20.400]   to make it look like it's standing still.
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:22.920]   Or if they're going fast enough, I guess it will.
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:23.840]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:25.760]   This is where the answer comes in so handy,
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:27.520]   because you could have said you dope--
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:28.720]   It's a photo dummy.
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:29.480]   You dope.
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.160]   And he said, you've done, sir.
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:33.640]   It's a photo, sir.
[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:34.880]   You idiot.
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:37.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:39.880]   All right, let's-- oh, by the way, congratulations
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:43.360]   to Pete Davidson, finally found a way to get away from Kanye.
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:46.640]   He's going up in Blue Origin.
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:50.280]   Worst move ever, because now Kanye can say, hey,
[01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:52.080]   he ain't even on the planet right now.
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:54.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.480]   Of course, this is in the--
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:01.600]   kind of sort of into space.
[01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:05.240]   Marty Allen will go on March 23rd.
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:06.240]   Isn't that a comedian?
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:06.680]   Yeah.
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:07.400]   The old days would be really--
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:11.360]   No, it can't be that Marty Allen with the frizzy hair.
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:13.920]   That's who I thought too, but then I realized he must be 100.
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:16.760]   It couldn't be that Marty Allen.
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:17.720]   Must be--
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:19.920]   You just squirreled that quickly, really?
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:21.600]   This guy?
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:22.400]   This guy?
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:23.600]   That guy?
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:25.760]   Yeah, Marty Allen.
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:27.680]   There's got to be some good video Marty Allen.
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:31.320]   Not only dead, but his hair isn't as good as it used to be.
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:32.440]   Come on, stay safe.
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:33.840]   You have no-- oh, man, that picture.
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:35.600]   Ooh, ouch.
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:36.800]   It was literally 10 seconds.
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.680]   Let's not make fun of this fella.
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:39.240]   All right.
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:41.200]   It was literally 10 seconds, and you squirreled
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:44.400]   into another subject.
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:45.120]   Marty Allen.
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:46.240]   Well, who is Marty Allen?
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:47.720]   Well, you mentioned Marty Allen.
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:48.320]   Who is he?
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:49.720]   We both said we all fart.
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:50.800]   Said it can't be our Marty Allen.
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:51.320]   Can't be that.
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:52.480]   Oh, he's blue.
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:53.000]   Oh, he's blue.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:53.920]   He's blue origin.
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.840]   He's with Blue Origin.
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:56.200]   Is he?
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:56.520]   No.
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:58.240]   The only Marty Allen I could find on Google
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:03.360]   is the fuzzy-haired member of the popular 1960 comedy--
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.200]   yeah, with Street Verasi.
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:06.120]   Allen and Rossi.
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:11.040]   He died in Nevagus at the age of 95 in 2018.
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:13.120]   So I don't know who Marty Allen is.
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:16.240]   It'd be funny if you had two comedians up there,
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:17.240]   but it's not that one.
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:18.080]   It's not enough room.
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:22.840]   Husband and wife duo Sharon and Mark Hegel, Jim Kitchen,
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:23.760]   and George Neild.
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:25.040]   I think these are the people paying.
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:27.000]   I think these are the paying guys.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.640]   So Jeff Bezos--
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:31.200]   Do you have to make it public?
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:35.080]   Like, if I decided to spend all my money in several inheritances
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:38.880]   going up into space, would they have to say my name?
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:39.320]   Probably.
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:41.640]   I mean, if you're Pete Davidson, yes,
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:43.600]   because that's the whole reason he's getting to go.
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:47.720]   The last time I checked, I am definitely not Pete Davidson.
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:48.760]   Thank goodness.
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:50.520]   So here's Marty Allen.
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:51.840]   His hair is completely normal.
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:56.320]   Boomer's must go after him.
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:57.120]   He's boomeraged.
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:59.120]   He totally missed out.
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:02.680]   Marty Allen is a turnaround CEO and angel investor.
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:05.360]   He was the CEO of Party America.
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:06.000]   There you go.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:06.920]   Oh, my.
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:08.920]   There you go.
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:10.920]   What are the others do?
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:13.400]   Pete Davidson joined the cast of Saturday Night Live in 2014.
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:14.400]   I do that.
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:18.200]   Sharon Hegel found his space kids global.
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:20.200]   Husband Mark Hegel, president and CEO
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:24.040]   of Tri-Core International, real estate development company.
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:27.600]   Jim Kitchen, teacher, entrepreneur, and world explorer
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:31.680]   who has visited all 193 UN recognized countries.
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:34.360]   And he's a space dreamer.
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:37.160]   University of California-- sorry, University of North Carolina
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:40.440]   is Keenan Flagler Business School.
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:43.240]   And Dr. George Neal is president of Commercial Space
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:46.720]   Technologies, former associate administrator
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:49.480]   for the FAA Office of Commercial Space Transportation.
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:51.760]   Space guy.
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:53.120]   So there you go.
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:57.520]   It's a space force person up there every now and then.
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:58.280]   Just to get--
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:26:58.800]   Steve Carell?
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:26:59.800]   That'd be great.
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:00.800]   Steve Carell.
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:01.320]   No, no.
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:05.200]   The actual guardians.
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:07.680]   They got their own rockets.
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:09.640]   They don't go up into space.
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:10.440]   So what would that be?
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:11.640]   So they're founder up.
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:12.760]   Donald Trump.
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:15.200]   They were creating--
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:18.680]   OK, so I'm coming around on Space Force, y'all.
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:20.200]   Are you?
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:20.880]   I am.
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:26.000]   So actually, the Russian-Ukraine conflict shows.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.280]   And also because I've been reading
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:32.520]   what's the title of this absolute downer of a paper,
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:34.200]   it is the annual threat assessment
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:37.600]   of the US Intelligence Committee that was released earlier
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:37.800]   this month.
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:39.880]   You have all the fun stuff, Steve.
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:40.800]   I know.
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:41.320]   But--
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:44.560]   Between that and the Sudoku over here.
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:46.640]   The challenges are--
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:48.640]   is our satellite infrastructure so relevant, right?
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:51.040]   Sudoku, sir, to you.
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:52.080]   Go ahead, Sis.
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:53.400]   Sorry, Ms. Stacy.
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:55.720]   I'm sorry.
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:57.760]   This happens all the time to me.
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:59.760]   I'm so sorry.
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:04.200]   I am sincerely trying to explain the dangers of space.
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:06.720]   I'm just trying to talk about Gutenberg, Stacy,
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:08.200]   and see how far you get.
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:11.160]   I can speak from experience.
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:11.600]   All right.
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:13.960]   We've already seen Russian interference
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:15.480]   with satellite communications.
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:18.880]   Satellite communications are not just key for mapping,
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:21.440]   but they're actually becoming control items in lots of--
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:23.160]   ready, the IoT.
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:28.320]   So having in China and Russia both have well-defined satellite
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:30.080]   space programs and they're creating
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:33.760]   missiles and infrastructure that legitimately are aimed
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:36.000]   like are targeted towards space.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.440]   So if we have an international conflict,
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:42.280]   it is fair to say that our infrastructure and space will
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:45.160]   be attacked, and we should think of ways to fix that.
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:49.480]   So that's why Space Force becomes actually relevant.
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:53.880]   Now, I don't know if their current Space Force is being
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:56.800]   trained with the skill sets we would need to counter out this,
[01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:59.680]   but that's why I'm coming around on Space Force.
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:00.200]   That is all.
[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:01.480]   Thank you, Hermione.
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:03.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:03.920]   Basically.
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:05.320]   Hermione, take him, Gotham.
[01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:06.280]   He can Gotham.
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:07.800]   Oh, good name.
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:08.800]   That beats you.
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:09.080]   Good name.
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:11.040]   That's better.
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:13.000]   Here's another one for Hermione.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:18.160]   Sci5, S-I-F-I-V-E, raises $175 million.
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:22.720]   They want to do risk five chips.
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:24.120]   So it's really exciting.
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:25.080]   Y'all don't really--
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:27.560]   You can't have two Stacey excitements back to back.
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:28.120]   Yes, we can.
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:29.760]   We just don't eat the podcast.
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:30.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:34.760]   So explain to us what risk five is one more time.
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:39.480]   Risk five is an open source ISA instruction set for chips.
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:42.400]   So it competes with Intel's x86 instruction set
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:43.760]   or the ARM instruction set.
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:46.240]   This is how chips--
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:48.160]   it's the operating system for chips, basically,
[01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:49.080]   is how you should think of it.
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:51.320]   And Sci5 makes chips.
[01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:53.800]   They're a foundry that makes chips based on the--
[01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:54.680]   They're not a foundry.
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:55.400]   Oh, they're not.
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:57.960]   Sci5 is a company that is basically
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:00.160]   like the arm of risk five.
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:01.760]   Oh, so they take the risk five designs
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:03.360]   and then they make more designs.
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:06.400]   Yes, and they make more designs and they've tested them.
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:11.280]   You don't need to use Sci5 because risk five is open source,
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:13.480]   but they just make it easier, much like ARM does.
[01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:14.440]   So that's why you should think.
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:15.240]   So they build bigger--
[01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:15.800]   They license their ARM.
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:18.880]   So Cs and things like that, more capabilities and stuff
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:19.360]   like that.
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:20.360]   OK.
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:22.640]   And then somebody else's foundry, I guess,
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:24.440]   who makes these, do you only know?
[01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:26.160]   You can set it to TSMC.
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:26.960]   You can set it to Google.
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:30.120]   So any foundry will be for risk five.
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:33.120]   So this is really exciting because risk five--
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:36.040]   I mean, I feel like it's been a sleeper hit since like 2014,
[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:37.560]   but that's just me.
[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:39.240]   But people are really realizing it now
[01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:41.880]   and it's getting a huge boost from the ARM Nvidia deal
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:42.760]   when that was announced.
[01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:44.520]   Everybody was like, oh, crap.
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:47.040]   If Nvidia buys ARM, we're going to need an alternative
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:48.240]   architecture.
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:49.320]   Let's check out risk five.
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:51.400]   And then a lot of people started designing and playing with it.
[01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:53.680]   And they were like, say, I have bad.
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:54.760]   Let's keep using it.
[01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:57.000]   So this is a really good--
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:57.880]   this is a huge series.
[01:30:57.880 --> 01:30:59.200]   It's like a series e-round for them.
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:00.600]   It's a lot of freaking money.
[01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:03.640]   But they're trying to go be the next ARM.
[01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:05.960]   So and Intel is back them.
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.800]   AMD is backing them.
[01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:09.920]   This is really a big deal in the chip.
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:11.360]   Oh, wow.
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:13.800]   Let's see.
[01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:15.960]   Oh, Intel's going to be a risk five factory.
[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:16.480]   Fowtery.
[01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:17.920]   Yes, that's right.
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:19.040]   In fact, they're one of them.
[01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:19.400]   Dumb question.
[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:20.480]   Greater is a risk five.
[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:21.320]   Yeah.
[01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:24.160]   With all those competitors backing the same thing,
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:27.600]   even though it's open, is there any kind of antitrust
[01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:29.720]   consideration at all?
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:30.760]   Is this a close one?
[01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:35.320]   If sci-fi-- the way it could be construed as antitrust
[01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:39.120]   down the road is if only the sci-fi versions
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:41.040]   get software support.
[01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:43.400]   But right now, the software that runs on top of it,
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:46.680]   Intel and ARM don't really have a big foothold in that.
[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:50.280]   Like if they owned Linux, then we might be worried.
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:52.400]   But because someone can always come out
[01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:55.960]   and make their own risk five chips and people already are,
[01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:57.400]   it's not as big of a risk.
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:59.320]   Does that make sense?
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:03.880]   If you saw sci-fi go in and buy Red Hat,
[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:05.320]   that might be--
[01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:06.480]   nobody uses Red Hat.
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:07.640]   Pick something that people use.
[01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:08.320]   Oh, people use Red Hat.
[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:09.320]   People use Red Hat.
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:10.240]   That's people use Red Hat.
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:11.240]   OK.
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:12.720]   A sponsor once in a while, right?
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:14.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:15.640]   Oh, right.
[01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:17.800]   That's not why I've said that.
[01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:18.440]   No, no.
[01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:18.800]   Let's just--
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:20.480]   No, I just--
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:21.120]   I'm like--
[01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:22.880]   They have a good sense to be a sponsor.
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:26.960]   And so we wouldn't credit for that.
[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:27.640]   Enterprise.
[01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:28.160]   Yeah.
[01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:30.480]   OK, so that's the Stacey Nerd Talk.
[01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:31.160]   Good.
[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:31.680]   Thank you.
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:32.400]   Anyway, and that's why--
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:35.480]   Bookmarked, I thought that would be a good story for you.
[01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:38.520]   And now a story for Jeff Jarvis.
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:40.080]   No, no, no.
[01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:41.760]   I'm really mad at the New York Times
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:46.920]   for saying Ben and Justin Smith, named Gina Chua
[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:47.920]   as executive editor.
[01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:49.920]   So first of all, congratulations.
[01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:52.120]   Gina Chua, executive editor Reuters.
[01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:55.480]   She's, I think, 61, 60.
[01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:57.640]   She previously editor in chief of the South China Morning
[01:32:57.640 --> 01:32:58.280]   Post.
[01:32:58.280 --> 01:32:59.640]   This is that weird startup.
[01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:03.760]   Nobody knows what Ben and Justin are doing.
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:05.240]   But they're not related.
[01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:06.840]   They have the same name.
[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:08.880]   The New York Times, which used to call people things
[01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:12.440]   like Mr. Smith and Mr. Smith, for some reason,
[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:14.880]   have decided to make them a couple.
[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:16.400]   Ben and Justin Smith.
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:17.280]   That is funny.
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:18.760]   That is funny.
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:20.560]   Is it just-- am I the only one who noticed that?
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:21.400]   I thought that is bad.
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:24.400]   Ben, just for the background, Ben was the editor of Buzzfeed
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:26.920]   News and then became media columnist New York Times.
[01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:32.600]   Justin Smith was the founder of the week magazine in the US,
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:35.040]   head of the Atlantic founder there
[01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:37.440]   with the people who started with the courts,
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:39.520]   and then head of Bloomberg Media.
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:43.640]   And the two Smiths went off to start a new media venture
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:45.680]   to serve everybody who speaks English in the world.
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:47.000]   But they said nothing more about it.
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.680]   We all don't know what it's going to be.
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:51.280]   So I'll be talking-- I'm having Justin come talk to our--
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:52.280]   Oh, good.
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:55.240]   Well, now they have a little bit to chew on,
[01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:59.400]   because Gina Twi is a very big name.
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:00.800]   Gina is brilliant.
[01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:01.480]   I know Gina.
[01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:03.360]   And I think this is important, too.
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:05.000]   Gina is trans.
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.600]   And to have a trans person that high up in news and media
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:12.280]   is part of the diversity we have to seek out.
[01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:13.920]   And I'm glad for that.
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:15.200]   I think it's going to make a difference.
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:15.720]   Yeah.
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:16.520]   Cool.
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:19.720]   Maybe they used Ben and Justin Smith as a headline--
[01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:24.080]   kind of like head line ease because you have limited space
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:24.840]   in a headline.
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:27.720]   I'm just thinking of ideas.
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:28.920]   You could have said Smith and Smith
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:29.880]   have already been making Smith and Smith.
[01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:32.840]   It's just a very strange thing.
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:33.840]   I get it.
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:36.520]   Pretty soon they're going to be calling them, you know,
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:37.680]   "Beniston."
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:38.720]   Are they married?
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:39.920]   Yeah, and they're not.
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:40.920]   No, they're not.
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:42.120]   They even would have learned other lines.
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:43.880]   So it doesn't even fit--
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:45.400]   It doesn't make sense.
[01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:46.840]   Yeah, it's a very strange--
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:47.280]   Somebody--
[01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:48.200]   Smith's.
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:49.280]   Somebody-- the Smiths.
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:51.480]   Yes.
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:52.960]   Or Smith squared.
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:53.600]   Smith squared.
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:55.800]   The other reference.
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:56.680]   It happened to me.
[01:34:56.680 --> 01:35:00.200]   I accidentally attended a crypto bro dinner.
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:00.720]   It's very gargy.
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:02.040]   Alex Kruger.
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:03.240]   I love the Gargian.
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:06.360]   At a Miami event, I found myself surrounded by a cult
[01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:10.640]   obsessed with minting bananas and trading ETH.
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:11.720]   Does it all mean anything?
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:13.720]   I just like the title.
[01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:14.920]   I don't know if they're kidding.
[01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:17.760]   I came to the dinner was where insurance was kicked out,
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:19.920]   came back, and then had that moment of realization
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:22.280]   when you realized, oh no, I'm surrounded by them.
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:23.280]   Oh, no.
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:24.280]   Everywhere.
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:27.560]   I've given Stacy's reaction last week to my suggestion
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:31.440]   that we should talk about crypto more.
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:31.960]   Nice work.
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:34.640]   This is her nightmare.
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:37.200]   This is a weird one.
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:39.880]   Board apes and crypto punks are merging.
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:46.680]   Yuga Labs, the NFT company behind the Board Apes Yacht
[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:49.780]   Club, acquired the rights to crypto punks and me
[01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:52.320]   bits collections from larval labs.
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:56.600]   These are the world's most valuable NFT collections.
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:36:01.160]   Yuga now controls NFTs with around $5.5 billion in market cap.
[01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:02.000]   Yikes.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:04.520]   B-billion.
[01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:05.680]   B-b-b-b-b-b-b-billion.
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:08.200]   It's unbelievable.
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:11.240]   Yuga Labs says it plans to open up the IP rights
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:14.600]   of individual crypto punks to their owners.
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:17.000]   That's, I guess, how Board Apes works.
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:20.800]   I don't even understand what that means.
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:23.200]   Apparently, there was a conflict between the crypto
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:25.960]   punk community and larval labs, which hadn't been
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:27.800]   willing to take such a step.
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:33.720]   So NFT marriage made in heaven.
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:36.200]   Board Apes and crypto punks.
[01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:39.000]   Just speed a next to the last person holding the bag.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:41.840]   Yeah, that's pretty much my work.
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:43.440]   I have the phenomenon to make bad holders.
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:43.960]   Yeah.
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:44.960]   Just speed next to the last.
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:46.400]   Yeah, just don't want me to the last one.
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:48.960]   That's for sure, yeah.
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:50.960]   Do you want the remote controlled cookie store?
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:51.680]   As long as we're on it.
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:55.640]   I put it in here because it's so stupid.
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:57.000]   It's got a smile.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.520]   Is that a waymo?
[01:36:58.520 --> 01:36:59.800]   Looks like one of those waymo.
[01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:00.320]   It's adorable.
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:02.320]   It's like the giant robot, the robot
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:05.920]   who roams around the Philadelphia stores,
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:09.200]   plus a smaller wagon robot.
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:10.360]   It's got two faces.
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:11.720]   It's adorable.
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:12.280]   All right.
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:13.240]   It's from a company called--
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:14.560]   You're going to put it there for you, Stacy.
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:15.720]   It's very cute.
[01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:16.360]   Make you happy.
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:17.560]   It's very cute.
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:20.240]   It's from a company called Tortis.
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:21.720]   They're steered by operators, though.
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:23.840]   They're not autonomous.
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:25.560]   Big trended robots, by the way.
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:27.440]   When you see a robot, you might be
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:29.840]   having a person operating behind it.
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:31.520]   This is a big thing in autonomy.
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:32.920]   So when people say this--
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:33.880]   Do you have to walk behind it?
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:36.200]   Or do you have to sit in an office with a steering wheel?
[01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:36.880]   Yeah, that was my question.
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:39.120]   A lot of them are office controlled.
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:39.760]   And they have--
[01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:40.480]   I mean, like a decent--
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:40.920]   You can do drones.
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:41.920]   Those like, watch the drones.
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:42.960]   And the miles away.
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:44.960]   You could deliver cookies in an office.
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:48.600]   So I want to know who was driving this drone in Shanghai
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:51.920]   that drove straight into wet cement and guts.
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:55.680]   Oh, poor drone.
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:57.320]   Wait, tell me about the cookie robot.
[01:37:57.320 --> 01:37:58.880]   Does it take a different--
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:37:59.520]   Cookies?
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:00.480]   Yes.
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:05.360]   Retailers can use the Tortis mobile smart store
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:07.400]   to deliver whatever you want--
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:10.800]   chocolates, air pods, knee socks.
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:12.040]   Oh, by those--
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:13.000]   Oh, is this like--
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.800]   This is actually a really interesting way,
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:17.600]   because in some areas, not all areas.
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:22.400]   If I said, oh, I need this, and enough of my neighbors
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:24.000]   got together and needed it, maybe it
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.040]   could deliver it to our area in a cost-effective way
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:27.800]   by just solving it.
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:27.800]   Yes, OK.
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:28.720]   Here's an interesting--
[01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:29.120]   Oh, I can--
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:29.920]   --in perfect foods.
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:32.520]   They're being used right now by 18 retailers in the US
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:35.440]   and Europe, but they're all being driven by humans
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:38.280]   in the Ramon Operations Center in Mexico City.
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:38.760]   We're toward--
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:39.760]   Yes, it exists.
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:41.400]   Yeah, why not, right?
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:44.400]   People who encounter the robots can tap their credit card--
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:46.080]   this is from the story in Axios--
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:49.200]   open the lid and take a box of cookies or air pods
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:50.560]   or sweat socks.
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:53.160]   Remote operators watching listen as the transaction takes
[01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:55.240]   place.
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:56.800]   The merchants don't pay for the robots.
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:00.120]   They just give them 10% of the gross sales.
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:01.160]   Leo, I have the socks.
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:01.680]   You're going to want--
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:02.000]   It sounds like a--
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.520]   --a little bit of like 151.
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:04.200]   These are the socks--
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:07.480]   Wait, how do they prove that they've paid?
[01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:07.960]   Like, there's a--
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:08.720]   --tap a credit card--
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:09.200]   --tap a credit card.
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:11.320]   It won't even open until you tap the card.
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:12.520]   Yeah, it won't open until you tap it.
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:14.640]   Is everything in its own bin?
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:15.840]   Yeah, you must have some sort of sensor.
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:17.200]   Yeah, own stuff you don't take.
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:19.200]   If I pay for a cookie and I grab air pods--
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:22.240]   This is the Amazon store all over again.
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:23.360]   What's interesting is--
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:25.480]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:28.000]   The co-founder Dimitri Chevie-Folenko,
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:33.960]   who was the Uber's micro-mobility guy,
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:36.280]   said people spend more on these things.
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:40.040]   People are buying a $35 pastry box when previously the most
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:42.440]   they've ever spent at a vending machine is maybe $4.
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:45.000]   They're spending more than they would at a vending machine.
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.920]   On the 18 merchants on board so far, GoGroser, convenience
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:52.520]   stores in Chicago, Lady Shokalot, a confectionery
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:54.880]   in Los Angeles, and Edith's, which
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:57.880]   sells what it calls Jewish comfort food in Brooklyn, New York.
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:01.240]   If somebody came up to me with a bagel and schmear--
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:01.880]   You're in.
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:02.240]   I'm--
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:03.440]   You're in.
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:04.440]   --bakes some.
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:06.880]   I do it for chicken, fried steak and mashed potatoes.
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:08.960]   Oh, talk to me.
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:10.840]   I'm going to beat that.
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:14.120]   I'm going to put in the chat here the oyster vending machine.
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:16.200]   Now, see, that's a bad idea because oysters--
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:17.480]   That's dodgy.
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:18.400]   Go take a look.
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:19.680]   The oyster vending machine.
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:21.800]   Right there it is.
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:22.800]   Right there.
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:23.480]   Right where?
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:24.480]   The chat.
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:26.120]   Oh, in our chat room.
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:26.600]   Look at that.
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:28.120]   Look at you getting all fancy.
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:29.040]   Wow.
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:32.360]   It's a French vending machine that spits out fresh oysters.
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:33.040]   Spits maybe the wrong way.
[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:33.800]   Don't say spits.
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:35.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:36.680]   I won't say that.
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:37.680]   Shucks out.
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:40.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:43.160]   So, and Calvin Trillan, who's a writer
[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:46.040]   I admire greatly worked for the New York Times for years--
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:48.520]   New York-- New Yorker for years.
[01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:49.040]   The New Yorker.
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:50.440]   Right now food.
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:52.000]   He covered great food stuff.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.360]   Alice Litzy is one of my favorite books ever.
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:57.800]   And he covered once an oyster festival
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:40:59.520]   in somewhere in New England.
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:01.280]   And he said the firemen in the oyster festival
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:02.560]   was always held at the firehouse.
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:05.280]   Used to like to get people crazy because they would tell
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:07.960]   people that the real way you eat oysters
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:11.080]   is to snort them up your nose, which to a non-oistreater
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:12.320]   makes as much sense as you do.
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:12.320]   No.
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:13.320]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:15.360]   Oh my gosh.
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:16.680]   Oh my.
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:17.400]   Ew.
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:18.480]   Ew.
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:21.520]   So this-- actually, this is actually quite a good story.
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:25.520]   You came up with here, the oyster vending machine.
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:28.520]   All of the oysters are sold unshucked.
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:30.560]   Some shucking is involved.
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:32.520]   Shellfish fans can also purchase
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:36.600]   the oysters in advance via text.
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:37.800]   And it just sits there.
[01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:38.880]   The picture is not good.
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:41.160]   It just sits there on the street.
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:41.800]   Well, the--
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:42.760]   You drive up to it.
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:43.560]   Yeah, the problem was--
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:44.680]   It's not like in a wall or something.
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:45.960]   No, the problem was there--
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:48.240]   The store that sold these, people
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:50.360]   would always come when they were closed
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:52.640]   because people sometimes need oysters in the middle of the night,
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:53.680]   I guess.
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:56.680]   So they actually got this themselves.
[01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:59.000]   It's the Viagra of food, after all.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:02.520]   The owner, Tony Bertello, explains,
[01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:05.240]   "People has arrived when the shop door is closed,
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:08.440]   which is frustrating for customers and for us.
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:10.040]   So we looked at the systems.
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:12.520]   We looked at those being done in agriculture
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:16.200]   because there are many distributors in the countryside
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:17.960]   who contacted the manufacturer who
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:20.280]   responded to the machine for oysters
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:23.800]   since it is a particular product that is not very restrictive
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:28.080]   but requires some adjustments."
[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:29.560]   $8 a dozen oysters.
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:30.120]   Not bad.
[01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:30.600]   That's good.
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:31.400]   We need that out of here.
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:32.600]   We got a great oyster.
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:34.160]   We got Haw Guy in the water here.
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:35.920]   You can open only in months with ours?
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:37.200]   Yeah, that's the problem.
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:38.840]   So now you can get in December.
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:42.560]   No, that's what I want to know.
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:44.960]   I was Socks Leo, 151 socks.
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:47.080]   I found the socks that should go in the thing.
[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:47.600]   The socks--
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:48.600]   I'm leaving one of mine in room.
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:49.160]   --point size--
[01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:49.800]   That's just going to take--
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:51.560]   Point size socks.
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:52.520]   Point size?
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:56.160]   You mean like the pencil pushers like lettering department?
[01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:57.120]   No, it's not size.
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:57.960]   Oh, I get it.
[01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:00.080]   72.60.40--
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:00.600]   Are those cute?
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:01.480]   --like font points.
[01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:01.920]   That's cool.
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:02.240]   Oh, look.
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:04.080]   And they also have toolbars.
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:04.800]   Yeah, they have a toolbar.
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:06.200]   They have a CMYK too.
[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:06.680]   That's cool.
[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:08.480]   CMYK socks.
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:12.080]   And if you want to buy a pencil that says keep on pushing,
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:13.640]   all types are welcome.
[01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:14.640]   Put out the maternity ward.
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:15.920]   What store is this?
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:20.640]   This is the PSTypeLab.com.
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:22.080]   They actually sell, I think, fonts.
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:23.000]   But--
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:24.920]   Are those cool to CMYK socks?
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:26.080]   Oh, look at those CMYK socks.
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:28.320]   OK, socks.
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:29.160]   All right.
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:29.560]   That's enough.
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:32.280]   Do they have a size 14?
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:33.640]   That's the problem.
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:34.080]   Wait a minute.
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:34.560]   So many--
[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:35.960]   Socks don't come in sizes.
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:37.600]   They all have one size fits everybody.
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:39.120]   --smell medium sizes.
[01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:39.600]   Oh, medium sizes.
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:40.720]   Bomba-- no, not bomba.
[01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:41.920]   It's supposed to be the one that does the sizes.
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:42.880]   There's another one that's like--
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:44.040]   Oh, yeah, that's all they do.
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:46.400]   It's like, oh, she's shock to her sizes.
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:49.240]   Light, regular, medium, and bold.
[01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:50.080]   I like that.
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:50.580]   That's cool.
[01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:51.080]   How?
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:51.080]   I like it.
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:52.560]   They didn't put heavy on there.
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:54.200]   Heavy.
[01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:54.920]   All right.
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:59.920]   Let's press the button that plays the music that begins.
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:04.320]   The Google Change Leo's favorite part of the show.
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:06.080]   That was perfect timing.
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:07.080]   Y'all, good job.
[01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:08.440]   So much depth, dark time.
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:10.400]   If I could talk up an intro, and I just
[01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:11.680]   wanted to show that I can't.
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:16.440]   Google details its latest big Android feature drop.
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:18.800]   This will be for next month, I guess.
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:24.400]   Improvements to Google's keyboard, Gboard, Google Photos,
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:27.600]   and more, Google Photos Portrait Blur feature.
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:29.280]   We'll soon be able to blur backgrounds
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:32.160]   in a wider range of photos, including pictures of pets,
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:33.640]   food, and plants.
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:39.120]   OK.
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:40.200]   Gboard's--
[01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:42.600]   Google Photos constantly insults me.
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:44.000]   I just want everyone to know.
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:44.480]   Why?
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:45.000]   Why did you do that?
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.400]   You can take a photo with your Google phone.
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:49.920]   It always is like, pick a better shot.
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:55.080]   Can you press your hair?
[01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:56.040]   What's going on?
[01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:57.400]   Did you get on a good night's sleep?
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:59.120]   I figure you would appreciate that, Aunt.
[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:00.080]   Oh, well, I mean--
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:00.680]   Every time.
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:02.120]   You can use this like your mother.
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:06.160]   The TV slash hop, also known as hands-on photography, right?
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:09.080]   Aunt, it is only how to show I think I've ever watched--
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:10.160]   Do you ever say--
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:11.680]   Take a better photo, Aunt.
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:12.680]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:14.840]   Does your camera--
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:17.320]   Wait, does your camera on your phone do that to you?
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:18.600]   I need to know.
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:20.000]   That would be no, ma'am.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.960]   Every shot he takes is perfect.
[01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:25.160]   So every time, it's like, pick a better shot.
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:25.880]   Pick a better shot.
[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:29.640]   We were trying to get some numbers off of a box way up
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:31.920]   in the ceiling up there.
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:34.560]   And Burke was standing up on this shelf behind us here,
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:35.640]   and he was going like this.
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:37.840]   Camera, and then he got a picture, and they couldn't read it.
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:42.120]   And he said, here, try this Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:44.400]   with its 100x zoom.
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:45.000]   Look at that.
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000]   You found a use for the one that's only 100x zoom.
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:48.000]   Look at that, yes.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.640]   It looks good.
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:50.840]   You can read the numbers.
[01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:51.360]   Wow.
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:52.520]   That looks good.
[01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:53.520]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:56.000]   And that was an optical zoom.
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:56.800]   Not optical zoom.
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:57.320]   That was digital.
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:45:58.240]   It was digital.
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:45:59.960]   But it was able to really--
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:01.920]   Yeah, normally it looks like crap.
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:04.000]   That's good.
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.000]   That's magic.
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:06.480]   So there you go.
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:08.360]   And it said, take a better shot afterwards.
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:09.360]   I don't know.
[01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:11.240]   You're stupid.
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:12.160]   It doesn't say take.
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:13.560]   It's just like, pick a better shot.
[01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:14.320]   Pick a better one.
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:15.560]   Then it goes through all the possible--
[01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:17.080]   You could get a better shot.
[01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:17.840]   Look at that.
[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:19.320]   Then that kitty cat.
[01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:20.440]   That's a great photo.
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:21.280]   That is Paris.
[01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:24.880]   Well, you're a very cute cat.
[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:27.360]   So again, it's really handy with the pets
[01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:28.760]   to have a big zoom.
[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:30.880]   Because then, otherwise, if I got that close to her,
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:31.720]   she would--
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:32.720]   Yeah.
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:33.880]   --be gone.
[01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:36.360]   No, you'd have more stitches on your face.
[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:39.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:42.200]   The Google Keyboards Grammar Correction
[01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:45.120]   feature, which has been exclusive to Pixel Phones,
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:47.200]   will start to come to other phones as well.
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:48.400]   Great.
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:50.520]   That's a good thing.
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:55.240]   The Google has also updated the Gboard Emoji Mashups,
[01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:57.720]   2000 additional emoji mashups.
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:01.720]   So let's take two emojis and mush them together.
[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:05.800]   The Live Transcribed, which I love, accessibility app,
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:10.760]   which will transcribe anything, will now work offline.
[01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:12.520]   So if you're in a subway or an airplane,
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:14.040]   you still can get the Live Transcribe.
[01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:14.560]   Kudos.
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:14.560]   That.
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:15.060]   Kudos.
[01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:16.880]   Yeah, really good.
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:18.680]   A bunch of other stuff coming.
[01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:24.440]   No release date yet, but presumably sometime
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:28.680]   in the next couple of weeks since it is March.
[01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:30.560]   Steam is coming to Chromebooks.
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:35.000]   Steam, which is the number one gaming marketplace on Windows,
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.720]   now because of the Steam Deck Linux.
[01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:40.480]   You can even get it on the Mac, but now it's on select Chromebooks.
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:41.800]   You can't do it with every Chromebook.
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:43.240]   You'll have to have enough hardware.
[01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:46.640]   This is also part of the yesterday's Game Developer Summit.
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:50.120]   Keynote.
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:52.960]   So far, the Asus Chromebook CX9, very good.
[01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:54.320]   It flips CX5.
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:57.120]   Those, I think, are Kevin Tofel's favorite Chromebooks.
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:03.160]   HP is Pro 6 C640, G2, and an unnamed Lenovo model.
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:08.880]   You probably need at least an i5 and it says 7 gigabytes of RAM.
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:09.520]   I don't know.
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:10.520]   7.
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:11.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:14.640]   Somewhere between 6 and 8.
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:16.520]   I don't know.
[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:18.120]   So that's interesting.
[01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:19.400]   That's good.
[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:20.440]   That's good.
[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:24.280]   Hey, pay for my parking.
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:27.320]   Wouldn't you like to be able to do that?
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:29.760]   Google announced Thursday and a slew of new features
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:31.600]   that rolled out through its latest software update.
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:33.920]   I haven't tried this yet, including the ability
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:37.040]   to pay for parking using your voice through a partnership
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:39.560]   with Park Mobile.
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:41.080]   You know, we've talked about this before.
[01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:41.800]   It's really annoying.
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:44.240]   Every jurisdiction has a different parking app.
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:46.320]   So every time you want to park somewhere--
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:47.920]   You got to download that?
[01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:48.920]   So annoying.
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:50.560]   So annoying.
[01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:54.520]   I'd love to see this if I could just say, hey, pay my parking.
[01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:55.920]   That'd be great.
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:59.040]   So this partnership with Park Mobile
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:00.640]   is only for people using Park Mobile,
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:05.960]   but the idea is Google would be adding partners over time.
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:08.000]   Once you park in a spot, you say, hey, you know who?
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.360]   Pay for parking.
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:11.680]   The assistant will prompt you to pay from your phone.
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:13.760]   Google pay handles of transaction.
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:17.360]   No more coins, no more confusion says Google.
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:18.800]   Thank you, Google.
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:21.200]   Park Mobile is the, according to Park Mobile,
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:23.680]   leading app coordinating parking zones
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:27.880]   across more than 400 cities.
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:29.800]   Google's domain name registrar-- did you
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:31.480]   know that Google had a domain name registrar?
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:33.200]   It's actually a very good one.
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:36.520]   It's perhaps the lowest cost.
[01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:39.600]   It has been in beta for the last seven years.
[01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:40.720]   Oh, good.
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:42.000]   It is now out of beta.
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:43.000]   That's why I know about it.
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.560]   It's just 10 nervous employees.
[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:47.400]   Are they ever going to let us on the beta?
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:50.280]   I'm afraid to ask.
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:52.040]   There was the best tweet about it.
[01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:54.600]   They were like, and now prices will rise,
[01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:56.920]   and in another year it will be deprecated out.
[01:49:56.920 --> 01:49:58.800]   Right.
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:00.000]   That is true.
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000]   The Google roadmap.
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:02.800]   The Google way.
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:05.400]   I have not experienced this, but maybe you have--
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:09.320]   some Google Pixel phones cannot make contactless payments
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:11.400]   after the March security patch.
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:13.720]   It was only for the 12L folks.
[01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:16.480]   Oh, 12L March feature drop.
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:18.920]   So we didn't get 12L on our Pixel 6.
[01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:20.240]   No, so maybe we're glad.
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:20.760]   We're good.
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:23.080]   Let me ask you a question since you're a Pixel 6
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:23.680]   complainer.
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:24.720]   Yes, sir.
[01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:25.800]   No, no, no, no.
[01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:26.920]   No, stop saying that.
[01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:29.120]   I'm not a Pixel 6 complainer.
[01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:30.520]   Is it end-to-right or--
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:32.960]   You say end-to-right 12.
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:35.680]   Well, so I think I got the latest version
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:36.720]   because it happens, right?
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:36.920]   Right.
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:38.160]   And I don't know whether this is me
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:39.560]   or whether it's the towers around me,
[01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:43.200]   but suddenly my connectivity at home from my AT&T
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:43.960]   has gone to--
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:44.960]   Yeah.
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:45.960]   Oh.
[01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:48.200]   Is that a known problem around--
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:50.800]   That was a problem with the previous version of the OS.
[01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:54.000]   They supposedly patched it to fix connectivity.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.760]   Oh, it patched the screw up mine, I think.
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:50:57.200]   Right, bro.
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:50:58.440]   Yep.
[01:50:58.440 --> 01:50:59.600]   I wonder if you can do a little bit.
[01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:01.000]   I wasn't on Wi-Fi calling.
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:02.080]   I had a switched Wi-Fi calling.
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:03.560]   I can't call them a bloody phone at home.
[01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:04.400]   Oh, wow.
[01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:07.880]   And by the way, AT&T is town.
[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:09.240]   Oh, wow.
[01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:12.320]   I wonder if you can do a rollback.
[01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:13.320]   Mm.
[01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:14.160]   What's the thought?
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:15.160]   Because I don't have a terrible--
[01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:17.360]   The contactless payment issue was
[01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:19.680]   fixed with a server side.
[01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:22.920]   Fixed Google and that's that on Pi Day, which
[01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:25.640]   was day before yesterday.
[01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:28.720]   Android's iOS friendly emoji reactions officially
[01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:31.960]   launch in major Google messages updates.
[01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:34.120]   I still see people saying, when am I going to get them?
[01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:35.720]   When am I going to get them?
[01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:40.640]   But now when you use Apple's messages to react to a message,
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:44.080]   you will have a similar reaction instead
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:48.080]   of a text-based reaction on your Google messages.
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:50.120]   Oh, and so laughed at this.
[01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:51.240]   Yeah, it was so bad.
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:53.280]   Oh, and so loved this message.
[01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:55.360]   I didn't love a lot.
[01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:56.640]   Loved, loved.
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:59.240]   Well, you know what it is anyway.
[01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:03.160]   And wow, I don't know if this is anything to celebrate,
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:07.080]   but Google has started integrating air raid alerts
[01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:10.440]   into Android phones in Ukraine.
[01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:10.960]   Kudos.
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:11.680]   It was a service.
[01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:12.200]   Kudos.
[01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:13.240]   That seems helpful.
[01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:14.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:19.040]   You get a red warning triangle icon sent by Google Play Services.
[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:22.640]   I don't think you get the actual sound,
[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:24.640]   but you will be alerted by your phone
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:27.520]   without installing an additional application.
[01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:30.440]   And a lot of the cellular service
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:32.040]   has been staying up and it would appear,
[01:52:32.040 --> 01:52:33.680]   especially since all the people were sharing.
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:36.080]   And by the way, did you see that Ukraine
[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:39.160]   switched to the European power grid in three weeks?
[01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:39.520]   Wow.
[01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:40.960]   Is that why they weren't brought down?
[01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:42.600]   Wow.
[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:43.920]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:44.400]   Yeah.
[01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:44.720]   It's amazing.
[01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:46.680]   Because the Russians had some years ago
[01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:50.280]   used hacking tools to bring down the grid in Ukraine.
[01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:53.960]   As was clear, it was kind of a test of their capabilities.
[01:52:53.960 --> 01:52:56.600]   And I gathered that it didn't work this time.
[01:52:56.600 --> 01:52:57.200]   Right.
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:59.680]   So they had to blow up the nuclear planes.
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:01.480]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:03.160]   No one probably wants to say anything,
[01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:04.760]   because you never know about it.
[01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:12.960]   So this is what the alert looks like on your phone.
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:15.080]   And that's a good thing.
[01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:15.680]   That's a good thing.
[01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:18.200]   We get extreme weather alerts and stuff like that.
[01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:22.720]   It seems sensible that you would get air rate alerts as well.
[01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:25.000]   And that is a quick change.
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:29.360]   That was nine minutes on a change log.
[01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:29.920]   I'm impressed.
[01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:31.560]   Is that a long time or a short time?
[01:53:31.560 --> 01:53:33.000]   That's-- I don't even know.
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:34.360]   I think that's a long time.
[01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:34.880]   Yeah.
[01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:36.560]   Because it's been a bit of hit or miss.
[01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:38.000]   And a lot of times--
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.080]   I think you had a 30-second record once.
[01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:41.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:42.080]   Yes.
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:43.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:44.560]   Like, change log diarrhea was--
[01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:48.720]   You literally scroll through and like, this change log sucks.
[01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:51.040]   Well, if that's how you feel, maybe it's
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:55.320]   time to get to our picks of the week
[01:53:55.320 --> 01:54:00.280]   with our fabulous team on this week in Google.
[01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:03.200]   First, as always, Stacey Higginbotham
[01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:06.000]   with her thing of the week.
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.880]   I can't remember if I've done this one.
[01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:10.560]   So did I already do the firewall of purple?
[01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:11.240]   No.
[01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:12.160]   Do not recall that.
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:14.840]   The firewall of purple?
[01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:17.200]   No, the firewall of-- so I've talked about firewall of.
[01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:19.080]   This is a device you use on your router.
[01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:22.600]   Oh, I might have mentioned firewall of before.
[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:23.440]   Do you have one now?
[01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:24.600]   The gold and the blue.
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:25.240]   I do.
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:26.480]   So y'all probably saw a lot of my data.
[01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:28.280]   Oh, you have done a firewall.
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:29.920]   I recognize the logo now.
[01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:30.420]   Firewall.
[01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:30.920]   Yeah.
[01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:32.960]   Tell us about it, because you didn't have one at the time.
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:34.200]   So I want to hear about it.
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:35.080]   I didn't.
[01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:37.080]   And I--
[01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:37.880]   This is the idea.
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:38.720]   I thought this was one of the--
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:41.720]   Like a Raspberry Pi kind of a security appliance
[01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:44.240]   that you put in your network, right?
[01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:46.280]   Did you get the gold or which one did you get the purple?
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:47.400]   I got the purple.
[01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:49.400]   And I got that because I'm on a gigabit network,
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:52.720]   but I don't need quite the tools of the fancy purple.
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:53.240]   Right.
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:54.240]   Sorry, of the fancy gold.
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:55.240]   Right.
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:57.240]   So what this is--
[01:54:57.240 --> 01:55:00.200]   I'm pulling-- I pulled it here.
[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:02.320]   This is the firewall of device.
[01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:04.920]   And what I got it for is actually,
[01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:09.000]   because I've got probably about 80 or 60 to 80 IoT devices
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:10.040]   on my network.
[01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:14.080]   And this actually shows me all the traffic on my network.
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:15.160]   That's really useful.
[01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:16.000]   Yeah.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:16.520]   It's a lot.
[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:18.040]   It shows me the traffic on my network.
[01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:21.480]   It shows me how many gigabytes or megabytes or kilobits,
[01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:23.360]   whatever they're sending.
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:27.000]   It breaks down by MAC address what things are sending data,
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:28.560]   where they're sending it to.
[01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:30.840]   So you can see things are going to like the People's
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:34.880]   Republic of China, if you would like, or to Colorado.
[01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:37.480]   I still can't figure out who's sending traffic to Colorado.
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:38.200]   But whatever.
[01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:40.160]   Can you block my country?
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:43.200]   On my ubiquity, I blocked China, for instance.
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:44.160]   Can you say I don't want to--
[01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:46.200]   If I do that, some of my devices won't work.
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:47.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:47.520]   Yeah.
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:48.280]   Oh, so cool.
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:50.280]   I'm not going to lose that.
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:53.440]   So-- but I think it's a really interesting tool.
[01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:56.000]   It's good for this audience because y'all are super nerdy.
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.080]   It's not that nerdy.
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:55:58.200]   It's not hard to use at all.
[01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:00.000]   You download an app and you plug it in.
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.280]   That's it.
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:04.920]   It will also quarantine things on your network if you want.
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:07.400]   You can also set up VPN features if you want to do all that
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:08.920]   through this.
[01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:11.560]   But it's really just deep packet inspection on your own network.
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:14.640]   And I found it to be pretty cool for tracking
[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:15.840]   how my devices behave.
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:18.680]   And some of them--
[01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:21.040]   why does my outlet need to send that much data?
[01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:22.600]   I really don't know.
[01:56:22.600 --> 01:56:23.240]   So it also--
[01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:23.240]   So it's also--
[01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:25.040]   --what questions to ask manufacturers.
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:26.640]   It also works as a firewall though, right?
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:28.400]   It's a security device as well.
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:30.200]   Yes, yes.
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:31.560]   I'm less worried about that.
[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:33.200]   But I know I should be.
[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:35.600]   Well, you've got parental controls on it, which is nice.
[01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:37.680]   And I presume it's got to add blocking.
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:41.120]   It makes some of the features that your Euro Plus or some
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:41.320]   of the--
[01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:41.840]   Or Pi-hole.
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:43.200]   --plus services you may--
[01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:44.680]   Yeah.
[01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:45.360]   Oh, it has to--
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:45.840]   It's way easier than Pi-hole.
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:47.600]   It has its own VPN server.
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:48.520]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:49.520]   Yes.
[01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:50.640]   Oh, that's really interesting.
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:52.160]   Yeah.
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:53.360]   Cool.
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:54.280]   And you're happy with it.
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:55.480]   Did it slow your network down?
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:56.640]   You feel like it was fast?
[01:56:56.640 --> 01:56:57.360]   It did not.
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:56:58.200]   And that's what I was--
[01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:00.920]   because some of these cancel your network down,
[01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:03.160]   I have not felt like this.
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:07.760]   So for everyone who's telling me I should segment my network,
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:11.720]   I counter with, if I segment my network properly,
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:12.720]   then my--
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:13.880]   I'm not sure if your IT stuff works.
[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:16.400]   --I would be devices won't talk to my phone
[01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:17.560]   in some of my--
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:18.560]   It's really telling me.
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:19.560]   --it's so annoying.
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:19.560]   Yeah.
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:20.360]   I've done that.
[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:24.160]   I have an IoT--
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:24.840]   what do they call it?
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:25.960]   A VLAN.
[01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:30.320]   And I have a regular VLAN for secure VLAN.
[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:32.280]   But you have to then do all sorts of rules
[01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:34.360]   so that things can talk to one another.
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:36.520]   By the time you're done, it's like a pain.
[01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:38.000]   So how many devices-- I'm just curious.
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:39.440]   I'm looking at mine.
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:41.280]   I have 83 devices on my--
[01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:42.280]   Unbelievable.
[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:42.800]   Good.
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:44.560]   I don't think I have--
[01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:46.600]   it used to show me, but it no longer shows me how I'm--
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:47.120]   Which map?
[01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:51.360]   This map and 40% of those are in a closet somewhere.
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:52.280]   I have 65.
[01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:55.680]   You have a better map than I do.
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:56.760]   And also, let me see.
[01:57:56.760 --> 01:57:59.600]   I think I could block geographically, can I?
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:01.120]   Oh, you're doing ubiquity.
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:03.480]   Did you ever see-- did I send you that video about how
[01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:06.400]   to supersetimate your ubiquity network from YouTube?
[01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:07.400]   Yes, you did.
[01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:08.280]   That's what I was using.
[01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:09.080]   Yes.
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:10.560]   And that's the thing is you did-- oh, yeah.
[01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:11.720]   Look at this.
[01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:13.400]   So I'm also blocking Ukraine.
[01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:15.920]   I didn't realize that.
[01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:19.680]   So I'm blocking China, Russia, and Ukraine.
[01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:23.320]   Maybe-- I wonder if that is impacting some of my IoT
[01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:23.800]   devices.
[01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:25.480]   I never even thought about that.
[01:58:25.480 --> 01:58:26.520]   Everything seems to work right.
[01:58:26.520 --> 01:58:27.280]   I know, maybe.
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:30.440]   Yeah, I should check and see if I have any devices that
[01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:32.520]   aren't working.
[01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:33.520]   Yeah.
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:35.080]   All 83 of them are.
[01:58:35.080 --> 01:58:36.120]   Yeah.
[01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:37.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:39.400]   Well, you know, you get voice assistance.
[01:58:39.400 --> 01:58:41.440]   And I actually was going to ask you, Stacey,
[01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:43.040]   if I should get a--
[01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:45.600]   I was talking to Lisa about a Bluetooth door lock.
[01:58:45.600 --> 01:58:47.040]   Like the-- like--
[01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:50.080]   with HomeKit, like the new Apple HomeKit thing.
[01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:51.320]   Oh, the HomeKit one?
[01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:52.320]   Yeah, HomeKit.
[01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:53.160]   That's it.
[01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:55.320]   Akara makes one, but there's another one.
[01:58:55.320 --> 01:58:55.960]   Schlage, I think, that's one.
[01:58:55.960 --> 01:58:57.160]   No, there's another one.
[01:58:57.160 --> 01:58:59.600]   Schlage-- the Schlage encode now has HomeKit.
[01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:00.720]   That's a good lock.
[01:59:00.720 --> 01:59:01.200]   Is it?
[01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:02.440]   It's very efficient.
[01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:04.960]   It's a Wi-Fi lock, which is great.
[01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:08.520]   I don't know if the HomeKit one is a Wi-Fi lock.
[01:59:08.520 --> 01:59:10.440]   But they also use NFC.
[01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:11.960]   I think they use NFC, right?
[01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:13.000]   They use NFC.
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:14.960]   Yeah.
[01:59:14.960 --> 01:59:16.600]   I'm actually going to buy a new smart lock,
[01:59:16.600 --> 01:59:19.400]   and I'm torn between the level, which I think
[01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:22.320]   is aesthetically pleasing, but doesn't have a keypad attached
[01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:24.280]   and just going with the encode.
[01:59:24.280 --> 01:59:26.840]   Some of these, apparently, they're
[01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:28.120]   very flexible.
[01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:32.520]   They will use varieties of ways to--
[01:59:32.520 --> 01:59:37.760]   including face ID to identify and thumbprint.
[01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:38.280]   Wow.
[01:59:38.280 --> 01:59:41.360]   So the Schlage, the encode plus, you think, is all right?
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:42.440]   That one's Wi-Fi.
[01:59:42.440 --> 01:59:43.760]   Is that their HomeKit one?
[01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:45.320]   Yeah.
[01:59:45.320 --> 01:59:46.080]   Yes.
[01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:49.040]   I have that lock on my front door.
[01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:50.360]   Y'all, come on over.
[01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:51.240]   Come on over.
[01:59:51.240 --> 01:59:54.840]   I'll bring my iPhone and get to that.
[01:59:54.840 --> 01:59:57.920]   Well, I love the idea of being able to say to somebody,
[01:59:57.920 --> 02:00:00.720]   here's a temporary pass or something like that.
[02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:01.040]   That's kind of--
[02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:03.480]   Well, you don't actually need a smart lock,
[02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:04.840]   a connected lock to do that.
[02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:07.080]   I mean, my friend has a programmable Schlage lock,
[02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:08.040]   but it's not--
[02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:09.920]   Oh, yeah, you can just give him a code.
[02:00:09.920 --> 02:00:10.440]   Yeah.
[02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:12.080]   She just creates a code and gives me
[02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:13.720]   the code that's set for X number.
[02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:15.720]   Yeah.
[02:00:15.720 --> 02:00:19.360]   Thank you, Stacey, the firewall of Purple's Gigabit Cyber
[02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:21.560]   Security Firewall and Ratter with Wi-Fi,
[02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:22.840]   protecting your family and business.
[02:00:22.840 --> 02:00:24.960]   Well, you mentioned it was Raspberry Pi size,
[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:26.840]   but it ain't Raspberry Pi priced.
[02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:28.080]   New--
[02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:28.680]   --several hundred--
[02:00:28.680 --> 02:00:31.280]   Is 189.
[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:31.640]   Is it?
[02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:32.280]   That's still like--
[02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:33.280]   It says 319.
[02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:33.780]   Oh, no.
[02:00:33.780 --> 02:00:34.280]   I thought it was 319.
[02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:34.280]   I'm sorry.
[02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:35.280]   It's 319.
[02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:35.780]   I'm sorry.
[02:00:35.780 --> 02:00:36.280]   I'm sorry.
[02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:38.080]   Oh, OK.
[02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:39.600]   There's a cheaper one for--
[02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:40.080]   I want this face.
[02:00:40.080 --> 02:00:41.240]   You don't have a gig of it network.
[02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:42.400]   You can go down.
[02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:43.960]   Yeah, they have a variety of solutions.
[02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:44.800]   Yeah.
[02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:45.120]   Yeah.
[02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:48.120]   So if you have like a 500 megabit per second network--
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:49.480]   I can't remember if it's gold.
[02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:52.560]   There's the Blue Plus, which is 189.
[02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:55.600]   The gold is the most expensive, 468.
[02:00:55.600 --> 02:01:00.040]   And there's the firewall of red, which is only 139 bucks,
[02:01:00.040 --> 02:01:03.640]   but doesn't have anything inside.
[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:04.600]   I think you want the blue.
[02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:05.760]   Dancy.
[02:01:05.760 --> 02:01:06.760]   Dancy-winkie.
[02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:07.720]   Dancy.
[02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:11.480]   There's all the different firewall lists.
[02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:13.200]   I am-- oh, no.
[02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:14.200]   I'm sorry.
[02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:15.200]   Jeff first.
[02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:16.360]   You're a number of the week.
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:17.600]   You could do it in any order you want,
[02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:18.680]   because this is not a democracy.
[02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:19.520]   You are the boss.
[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:20.840]   You could choose what you do.
[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:22.120]   You are empowered.
[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:23.760]   Who do you want to go next?
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:24.760]   There you go, Nick.
[02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:26.760]   Yeah.
[02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:27.280]   OK.
[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:29.760]   That's what it is.
[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:30.280]   OK.
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:32.680]   So 10 minutes to five, I looked at five by time.
[02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:33.920]   I looked and I said, oh crap.
[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:35.920]   I don't have a number.
[02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:37.880]   So I went a little mad trying to search for things,
[02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:38.520]   some of which are crap.
[02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:39.600]   Look at all of them.
[02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:40.800]   You got 100 numbers.
[02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:41.320]   Wow.
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:42.720]   I don't want to mention two things quickly.
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:43.840]   Plug them.
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:46.600]   One is I just finished reading, listening to.
[02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:50.240]   Ellie Mistal's allow me to retort.
[02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:54.400]   If you watch MSNBC, you see Ellie Mistal often.
[02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:55.240]   Oh, he's great.
[02:01:55.240 --> 02:01:55.920]   Legal commentary.
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:01:56.840]   Oh, I love him.
[02:01:56.840 --> 02:01:57.880]   I know who you're talking about.
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:01:58.720]   Now I see these pictures.
[02:01:58.720 --> 02:01:59.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:01:59.840]   Yeah.
[02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:04.640]   And this is-- so I've never seen a case before where
[02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:07.640]   I more highly recommend the audio versus the print,
[02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:10.640]   because you have to hear him do it with his full anger.
[02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:11.560]   It is audacious.
[02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:12.560]   It is brilliant.
[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:15.720]   And what he argues in it is that the US Constitution
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:17.880]   is a racist document.
[02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:20.840]   And then goes on to brilliant--
[02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:22.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:24.000]   --really?
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:24.880]   Yeah.
[02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:28.080]   But he goes through the nuts and bolts of it, and how that is.
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:32.920]   And he says, the Constitution is junk, which
[02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:34.560]   will get him in trouble in all kinds of places.
[02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:38.160]   He was on the view when they were just clutching their pearls.
[02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:42.480]   But it brilliantly argued, I want to assign it to my students.
[02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:44.520]   So that's a recommendation for the week.
[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:47.480]   But I also want to recommend something else.
[02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:52.000]   So the guy who created a movie about the line of type
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:56.000]   has been uploading all of his artifacts.
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.160]   And of course, to me, this is just heaven.
[02:02:58.160 --> 02:02:59.800]   This is the line of type.
[02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:01.440]   Gutenberg, Geek Heaven.
[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:04.320]   He started printingfilms.com, which
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:10.240]   has old, wonderful corporate videos for things
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:11.760]   like the line of type.
[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:14.920]   If you go down and just pick any minutes in the blue streak
[02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:17.400]   line of types video, Leo--
[02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:21.080]   Oh, we saw one of these farewell at the Unsured, Lou.
[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:22.080]   That one we showed up about.
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:22.760]   We showed that.
[02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:24.600]   That was a New York Times.
[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:26.960]   Now these are the corporate videos.
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:30.880]   So the line of trial in 10/10, the line of trial in 505.
[02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:32.760]   Pick any of them and play two minutes.
[02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:34.880]   And it's just delightful.
[02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:35.880]   Impeath time.
[02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:39.960]   This is from 1969.
[02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:40.760]   Let me see.
[02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:43.320]   Am I getting audio?
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:45.240]   Well, you didn't test it before.
[02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:48.040]   Here we go.
[02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:50.440]   It's a night on line of type mountain.
[02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:54.160]   Oh, well, now that will get us pulled down.
[02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:56.960]   The ride of the line of trial in 505.
[02:03:56.960 --> 02:04:00.040]   I was like, no, that is definitely public, isn't it?
[02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:02.040]   Well, it depends on the performance.
[02:04:02.040 --> 02:04:03.040]   Oh, yeah.
[02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:03.840]   It depends on performance.
[02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:04.640]   It's not the--
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:05.640]   Not the opposite.
[02:04:05.640 --> 02:04:08.040]   --moving world of constant change.
[02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:12.680]   We can't always rely on yesterday's tools for today's work.
[02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:16.080]   At Mergen-Thala, we make a tool for the graphic arts
[02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:20.160]   industry, a sophisticated tool using modern electronics
[02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:22.600]   to perform one of the most vital functions
[02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:24.600]   in printing and publishing.
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:27.480]   High speed, phototype set.
[02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:30.640]   It's a cathode-rayed tube phototype setting system
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:33.480]   called Linotron 505.
[02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:36.760]   Oh, we're going to let Dick Di Bartolo play the rest of that
[02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:37.760]   on the ginseng.
[02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:38.760]   That is awesome.
[02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:39.520]   That's great stuff.
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:40.520]   It is the blue streak.
[02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:43.800]   The glenotype, which came before, was the tape-fed
[02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:44.320]   Linotape.
[02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:50.040]   You still want to check on the-- how about the tactics of tape-setting?
[02:04:50.040 --> 02:04:54.040]   [INAUDIBLE]
[02:04:54.040 --> 02:04:58.080]   The result is galleys of classified and semi-classified ads
[02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:00.760]   with all lines in order ready for proofing.
[02:05:00.760 --> 02:05:06.600]   Time consuming slug collating and hands-facing
[02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:08.520]   are held to a minima.
[02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:10.800]   A little collating.
[02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:14.000]   You know how time consuming slug collating can be.
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.800]   No one wants to slug collate.
[02:05:16.800 --> 02:05:20.440]   OK, that is printingfilms.com.
[02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:23.280]   Man, this is a fun one.
[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:26.200]   I know he's going to show us some slugs that he is personally
[02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:27.560]   collating.
[02:05:27.560 --> 02:05:29.040]   He's getting his slugs down.
[02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:32.560]   We've seen your slugs before, dude.
[02:05:32.560 --> 02:05:33.560]   Wow.
[02:05:33.560 --> 02:05:34.320]   It's got to--
[02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:35.440]   You don't have a new toy.
[02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:39.880]   When you buy slugs, you've got to show off as often as you can.
[02:05:39.880 --> 02:05:45.280]   This is a compositor's typesetting thing, would you?
[02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:46.280]   Yeah.
[02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:46.780]   I'm sorry.
[02:05:46.780 --> 02:05:48.360]   What is a composite or do I--
[02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:50.200]   This is where you put the letters one at a time.
[02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:51.040]   It'll tie you up to the letter.
[02:05:51.040 --> 02:05:53.600]   It's the person who lays out the newspaper.
[02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:54.280]   Into that.
[02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:56.760]   One before the letter type.
[02:05:56.760 --> 02:05:58.440]   Hand by hand.
[02:05:58.440 --> 02:06:00.120]   I have to do the letter.
[02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:02.480]   After you finish the newspaper, then you have to do your slug
[02:06:02.480 --> 02:06:02.840]   collage.
[02:06:02.840 --> 02:06:04.440]   Oh my god.
[02:06:04.440 --> 02:06:08.600]   No one wants to do time consuming slug collation.
[02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:09.920]   I can't prove it.
[02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:11.400]   What do you got for us?
[02:06:11.400 --> 02:06:11.920]   Wow.
[02:06:11.920 --> 02:06:13.120]   Gotta be better than mine, right?
[02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:14.120]   No, I like yours.
[02:06:14.120 --> 02:06:15.040]   That was pretty cool.
[02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:16.400]   No, I love this.
[02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:18.040]   And I noticed that it wasn't on YouTube.
[02:06:18.040 --> 02:06:20.040]   It was on Vimeo.
[02:06:20.040 --> 02:06:21.560]   It's actually--
[02:06:21.560 --> 02:06:23.680]   It says printing films.
[02:06:23.680 --> 02:06:24.240]   Oh, you're right.
[02:06:24.240 --> 02:06:26.040]   That does look like the Vimeo interface, doesn't it?
[02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:27.040]   Oh, no.
[02:06:27.040 --> 02:06:27.520]   Uh-oh.
[02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:29.200]   How much longer will that be there?
[02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:29.720]   Uh-oh.
[02:06:29.720 --> 02:06:31.320]   Go download them all quick.
[02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:31.960]   Oh, boy.
[02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:32.960]   Put them up on YouTube.
[02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:34.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:35.920]   Wow.
[02:06:35.920 --> 02:06:39.560]   Because everybody needs the tactics of tape setting.
[02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:40.440]   Oh, my.
[02:06:40.440 --> 02:06:41.560]   But that's fascinating.
[02:06:41.560 --> 02:06:43.000]   Yep.
[02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:46.920]   My pick-- first, it's a great mirror image
[02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:51.200]   that they find folks at ESPN and Sports Center,
[02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:55.600]   because I know all of you folks watch that stuff religiously.
[02:06:55.600 --> 02:06:56.840]   But I thought it was pretty cool.
[02:06:56.840 --> 02:07:01.840]   And also, heartwarming, this featuring Tiger Woods.
[02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:05.200]   And it's just a great mirror image right there
[02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:06.720]   on line 154.
[02:07:06.720 --> 02:07:09.200]   Uh-oh.
[02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:10.200]   And the--
[02:07:10.200 --> 02:07:11.520]   Tiger looks in the mirror.
[02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:14.880]   And this is him.
[02:07:14.880 --> 02:07:15.680]   Is this his kiss?
[02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:16.600]   His son, Charlie.
[02:07:16.600 --> 02:07:18.080]   Oh, and they do the same.
[02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:19.320]   Of course they do.
[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:21.320]   Is Tiger going to burst into tears, I bet he is.
[02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:22.560]   But watch it, though.
[02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:23.160]   It's--
[02:07:23.160 --> 02:07:24.640]   They have all the same mannerisms.
[02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:25.480]   It's really true.
[02:07:25.480 --> 02:07:25.800]   That happens.
[02:07:25.800 --> 02:07:26.600]   It's crazy.
[02:07:26.600 --> 02:07:27.840]   Look at the walk.
[02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:28.680]   The gate.
[02:07:28.680 --> 02:07:29.200]   Yeah.
[02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:31.200]   Look at that.
[02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:33.760]   Oh.
[02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:36.720]   And he digs that, man.
[02:07:36.720 --> 02:07:39.480]   Yeah, that's really sweet.
[02:07:39.480 --> 02:07:41.200]   I like how you talked about--
[02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:42.280]   Oh, I have the audio muted.
[02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:44.440]   I should turn it on.
[02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:46.200]   No, those things that we have.
[02:07:46.200 --> 02:07:49.120]   We both have allergies.
[02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:50.480]   People struggle on the golf course.
[02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:52.960]   We get wind blowing or roll sniffing.
[02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:55.800]   And they rub their nose the exact same.
[02:07:55.800 --> 02:07:57.280]   It's so cute.
[02:07:57.280 --> 02:07:57.760]   Yeah, they are.
[02:07:57.760 --> 02:07:58.760]   Look at that.
[02:07:58.760 --> 02:08:00.280]   That's crazy.
[02:08:00.280 --> 02:08:00.840]   That's neat.
[02:08:00.840 --> 02:08:01.520]   That's on the--
[02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:02.840]   That's on the other side.
[02:08:02.840 --> 02:08:07.040]   The Sports Center Instagram, if you want to see it yourself.
[02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:09.720]   Well, I'll let you sports ball folks as part of Twitter.
[02:08:09.720 --> 02:08:11.440]   Yeah, that's for the family.
[02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:13.440]   Next up is the--
[02:08:13.440 --> 02:08:14.560]   I don't know how to pronounce it.
[02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:15.880]   Closse or Closse.
[02:08:15.880 --> 02:08:16.360]   Closse.
[02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:17.360]   CLOS.
[02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:20.720]   This app has been around for a little while.
[02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:25.040]   And one of the hands-on photography listeners, Mr. Jim,
[02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:26.680]   mentioned it to me a while back.
[02:08:26.680 --> 02:08:28.160]   But I never really said anything about it
[02:08:28.160 --> 02:08:29.920]   because it was only iOS.
[02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:34.880]   And now they have it for Android as well and limited use.
[02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:38.360]   But the point of this app is to create a virtual photo shoot.
[02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:41.760]   And I'm looking to dial into this because I've
[02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:44.760]   had some people back east that want some work for me.
[02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:48.360]   But oh, they can watch you while you're working.
[02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:50.440]   I can guide them through.
[02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:52.480]   Well, yeah, if you want to do this too--
[02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:55.080]   I was going to say I'm actually going to get a new headshot.
[02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:56.600]   So if you want to--
[02:08:56.600 --> 02:08:58.200]   I was going to hire someone here.
[02:08:58.200 --> 02:09:00.120]   But we could practice if you want.
[02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:01.320]   Well, yeah, this is--
[02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:03.880]   I thought this would be pretty cool to try it out.
[02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:07.920]   Because I did have the Android version a little while ago.
[02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:09.960]   And it just kept crashing and kept crashing.
[02:09:09.960 --> 02:09:11.560]   And I reached out to devs.
[02:09:11.560 --> 02:09:13.360]   And they said, yeah, we got an update coming out.
[02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:14.360]   It's going to fix all that.
[02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:15.040]   We know.
[02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:17.080]   And the update came out yesterday.
[02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:20.440]   And it is much better on Android.
[02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:21.680]   And it's a free app.
[02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:25.280]   And the images, when I played around with it just in the house,
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:26.640]   it looks pretty good.
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:29.080]   So I'm going to try it out with some real people
[02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:32.040]   and highly recommend.
[02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:37.480]   And lastly, order some prints at pruit.com/prints.
[02:09:37.480 --> 02:09:40.800]   And go check out the images and order some prints.
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:41.720]   Beautiful stuff.
[02:09:41.720 --> 02:09:43.560]   Help continue to pay for college.
[02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:45.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:46.680]   Oh, college.
[02:09:46.680 --> 02:09:48.480]   How many of those college tuition checks
[02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:49.680]   you're going to be writing this in?
[02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:50.480]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:51.240]   College.
[02:09:51.240 --> 02:09:52.160]   Yeah.
[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:52.840]   Yeah.
[02:09:52.840 --> 02:09:54.760]   Yeah.
[02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:56.320]   That's fine art in America.
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:09:58.440]   But you can just go right to your website, right?
[02:09:58.440 --> 02:10:02.440]   Yeah, at pruit.com/prints will take you right to the shop.
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:05.000]   And are they really doing a nice job printing those out?
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.800]   They do a great job.
[02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:09.560]   And it saves me a lot of money doing it myself.
[02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:10.360]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:12.760]   You don't want to ever want to get that business.
[02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:13.960]   To pay them.
[02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:15.120]   You lose money if you did that.
[02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:16.160]   Yes.
[02:10:16.160 --> 02:10:17.960]   They do a really good job.
[02:10:17.960 --> 02:10:21.480]   Even the large prints come out looking really, really good.
[02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:23.960]   I've had a lot of positive feedback about that.
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:25.480]   Nice.
[02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:27.480]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:29.040]   We are now on summertime.
[02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:30.600]   So we're a little bit different.
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:32.720]   And I have some people maybe thrown by this,
[02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:35.400]   because the US went to summertime a little early,
[02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:38.720]   just like we go a little late to stay in time.
[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:41.320]   Just because we want to mess with the rest of the world.
[02:10:41.320 --> 02:10:46.240]   We do this show at 2 PM Pacific, 5 PM Eastern time, 2,100.
[02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:47.240]   2,100.
[02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:47.240]   2,100.
[02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:48.240]   2,100.
[02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:49.240]   2,2,2,2.
[02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:52.360]   And that's going to stay that way for the rest of the summer,
[02:10:52.360 --> 02:10:53.760]   I guess, until--
[02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:56.480]   In fact, if Marco Rubio has his way in 2023,
[02:10:56.480 --> 02:10:57.320]   he changes their mind.
[02:10:57.320 --> 02:10:59.680]   We'll stop doing this entirely.
[02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:04.120]   You can watch live at live.twit.tv, chat live at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:11:04.120 --> 02:11:05.160]   Join us in Club Twit.
[02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:07.240]   If you're a Club Twit member, you can chat there.
[02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:09.600]   But there's a lot of other stuff going on.
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:11.000]   We've got a big event tomorrow.
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.440]   Patrick De La Handy.
[02:11:12.440 --> 02:11:15.200]   Get your Twit engineer, our coder.
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:16.920]   He knows how the back end works.
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:20.520]   Mr. Back End, he will be doing an inside Twit
[02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:22.000]   at 9 AM Pacific.
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:25.280]   Stacey's Book Club is Thursday, March 24,
[02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:27.000]   week from Thursday.
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:28.920]   The unauthorized bread book club,
[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:30.680]   you still have time to read it because it's in the valley
[02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:32.200]   as you have time easily.
[02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:33.120]   I've finished it for sure.
[02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:34.120]   I'm done.
[02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:36.680]   And then Paul Theron at the end of the month.
[02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:38.240]   Now, that's just really the main thing
[02:11:38.240 --> 02:11:40.280]   we thought people would want to join Club Twit for
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:43.040]   is the ad-free versions of all of our shows.
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:46.080]   Turns out the Discord is also a great clubhouse, thanks to you,
[02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:48.160]   Ant, and is our community manager.
[02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:49.640]   And we're having lots of fun in there.
[02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:51.560]   So please join us in there.
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:53.720]   We've got all sorts of conversations.
[02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:57.160]   We've got our Twit Minecraft server.
[02:11:57.160 --> 02:11:58.320]   People want to do that.
[02:11:58.320 --> 02:12:02.760]   We talk about sports, space, coding, travel.
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:03.600]   There's Stacey.
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:06.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:08.640]   I had to make that joke that week.
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:11.720]   I had to do one of these.
[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:13.840]   Oh, we call her somebody.
[02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:15.840]   You're all part of it.
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:17.800]   $7 a month puts you in the club.
[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:19.840]   And I tell you, it is worth every penny of it.
[02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:21.840]   Just go to twit.tv/
[02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:24.120]   And we are grateful to every one of you there.
[02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:24.760]   Thank you.
[02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:26.960]   It's a big contribution, makes it possible to do things
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:29.880]   like this week's space, which we just launched,
[02:12:29.880 --> 02:12:31.240]   and a lot more so.
[02:12:31.240 --> 02:12:33.120]   It's pretty cool to see the club is growing.
[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:33.840]   I love the club.
[02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:34.320]   Every week.
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:35.080]   I really do.
[02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:37.000]   I hang out there all the time.
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.960]   We also have, of course, plenty of freeways you can play.
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:42.360]   We have our Twit forums at Twit.community.
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:44.280]   Our Twit Mastodon is Twit.social.
[02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:46.040]   You're both invited to join both.
[02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:47.240]   They're free.
[02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:50.040]   I do approve each person so that we don't get spammers in there.
[02:12:50.040 --> 02:12:51.680]   So please just go on in there and I'll
[02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:54.200]   approve you within 24 hours.
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:56.240]   irc.twit.tv is open to all.
[02:12:56.240 --> 02:12:57.680]   And of course, all of the shows are

[02:13:03.240 --> 02:13:05.480]   There's also a YouTube channel dedicated to this week
[02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:06.760]   in Google, so you can watch there.
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:08.640]   That's a good place to share.
[02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:10.760]   And of course, if you have a podcast--
[02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:12.880]   preferred podcast player--
[02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:15.000]   if you subscribe there, you'll get the show limited.
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:15.560]   It's available.
[02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:16.880]   That's the best way.
[02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:20.680]   Our recommended route to listen to this week in Google.
[02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:21.480]   Thanks for being here.
[02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:23.840]   Everybody will see you next week.
[02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:24.360]   Bye bye.
[02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:30.960]   Hey, I'm Rod Pyle, editor of Ad Astor Magazine.
[02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:34.000]   And each week I'm joined by Tariq Malek, the editor in chief,
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:35.840]   over at space.com.
[02:13:35.840 --> 02:13:39.040]   In our New This Week in Space podcast, every Friday, Tariq
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:41.800]   and I take a deep dive into the stories that define the new space
[02:13:41.800 --> 02:13:42.280]   age.
[02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:43.440]   What's NASA up to?
[02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:46.160]   Windwell Americans once again set foot on the moon.
[02:13:46.160 --> 02:13:48.240]   And how about those samples from the Perseverance Rover?
[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:49.680]   One of those coming home.
[02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:51.920]   What the heck is the one I'm most done now?
[02:13:51.920 --> 02:13:54.600]   In addition to all the latest and greatest in space exploration,
[02:13:54.600 --> 02:13:57.600]   we'll take an occasional look at bits of space flight history
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:13:59.400]   that you've probably never heard of,
[02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:02.600]   and all with an eye towards having a good time along the way.
[02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:05.240]   Check us out on your favorite pod catcher.
[02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:08.600]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
