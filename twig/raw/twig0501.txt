[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.760]   It's Tacey Higginbotham. We have a lot to talk about including
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.840]   Article 11 and 13 now
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.080]   Passed through the European Parliament. It's gonna be up to the individual European nations to make it law
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.720]   What will that mean for the internet next?
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.920]   Netcasts you love from people you trust

[00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.880]   which these days is includes Facebook and
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.240]   Twitter and
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.240]   Every journalism
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.560]   Matthew Ingram's here back from Italy or you about to go to Italy just about to go. I'm so jealous
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.040]   This is the big news event every year in
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.960]   Where is it peruja peruja? That's right. Yeah, mm-hmm and
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.900]   Jeff's going to I think so that'll be fun. Jeff isn't here today. He's traveling
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.860]   Matthew is of course
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.820]   Chief digital writer at the Columbia Journalism Review
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.020]   Long-time giga-omir and fortune-er
[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.600]   He's been around and he's been in on our shows many times
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.180]   We always love having him on and Stacy's not here either
[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.420]   But she said in her place a fine
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.720]   Cockapoo named Norman and along with Norman comes Kevin Tofel
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.540]   He's already sacked out on my I can't I just made that up. I don't know he's shown free is which is for all or I
[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.820]   Had to be shown for today
[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.580]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, I should have read I mentioned this before but I should have I don't know if I said it to you
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.220]   in the description of be Jean
[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.740]   On the kettle club site. It says they make excellent circus dogs
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.540]   And I should have read between the lines
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:30.580]   What that what that men now your norm is very calm, but our our be Jean was not when the camera is on Norman's very calm
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.680]   No, only a couple times a day. He'll just go wild and run around the house and yeah
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.480]   Yeah, like a mad man like like a cheetah really fast. I loved our be Jean
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.980]   He was great, but he but the kids were too sometimes. Yeah, right?
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.220]   I remember I remember fun. I worked with you. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.140]   Oh, there's a basket again give my bonk give my bonk
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:59.420]   Forgot Leo. I meant to have my lower third updated. It's not about Chromebooks.com anymore
[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.740]   No, it is it is on a temporary assignment as a former TV guide critic this week
[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:14.820]   Mocking poor Jeff Jarvis is lower third on MSNBC the last time he was on of all the things you could say about Jeff Jarvis former
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.740]   TV guide critic is absolutely the most demeaning
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.300]   Nothing lower
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.660]   Nothing lower holy cow
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:31.740]   Yeah, so I think there's a very big story of brewing it isn't imminent, but it is a brewing the
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:42.140]   European Parliament yesterday passed the new copyright bill and that means they passed articles 11 and 13 unchanged and
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.020]   This is a big freaking deal
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:54.580]   Now it's not law because each country has to then endorse it and they can change it
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.440]   It's very likely that we'll see France endorsed it first since really it was France that pushed this new
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.900]   Copyright law
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:11.060]   And just to confuse everything they've changed article 13. It's article 17. Yeah. Oh that that's oh
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.620]   Never mind. No problem
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:20.260]   This despite millions of petition signatures phone calls letters complaints from the big
[00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.140]   internet companies and regular internet users
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:33.060]   What is so first of all this is a general copyright bill. It's called copyright in the digital single market directive
[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.260]   Whatever that is
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.460]   And it's not a directive. It's a directive not a law
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.180]   So because it's a directive the EU nations now have two years
[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.100]   To do something called transpose it which is make it their own law
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:57.260]   Written into their law and possibly modified for that country so countries have until 2021
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.700]   Now France will almost certainly
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.740]   jump on this
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.700]   And I think that's actually part of the problem is that we don't know how lots of these countries are going to interpret
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.340]   this somewhat vague
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:17.100]   Descriptions of the things that the EU agreed to and so you could actually wind up with this incredibly
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:23.380]   Sort of balkanized process where if you do something in you know Denmark, it's okay
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.300]   But if you do exactly the same thing in France, it's not okay
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:35.580]   Which one of you would like to why should you take this Matthew tell us what articles 11 and now 17?
[00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.540]   Say and what that what it means?
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:45.100]   This is so 11 without going into too much detail 11 is about
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.420]   Upload filters. I'm pretty sure I have that right
[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.700]   so
[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.340]   It's the link so is 11 the link tax, okay, so 11 is
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.700]   broadly speaking
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.660]   gives
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.060]   content owners the right to charge
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.380]   aggregators for
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:16.100]   Excerpts of their content so this is aimed at Google because Google's it's the snippet tax Google. Yeah, it's nippet
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.820]   It's search results Google News has larger chunks
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:26.660]   Google's already said if this is the law of the land in Europe then we will no longer be able to do Google News
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:33.380]   They even showed a little extremely a picture of what a search results look like in Europe
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.820]   To this but what we wouldn't see anymore is snippets
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.340]   This is by the way not something
[00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:46.180]   This is something's been tried Spain did it and Germany did it both with very little success and Google pulled out of Spain completely
[00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.900]   Yeah, there's no Spanish Google News, right?
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:56.140]   So that's a little one of the things that's fake about it is it says
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:02.300]   You can change by the way that Google says this is what the internet is going to look like no excerpts
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.620]   It looks like the page failed to load. Yeah
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.340]   Which was obviously partly a PR
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:14.340]   effort that look how terrible completely but if you did search for a story you would just get daily star in a link and you
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.880]   Wouldn't know anything about the headline or anything because they're all snippets
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:27.700]   I'm just curious. What is this done in Spain for example to those publishers and their traffic killed traffic?
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:35.300]   So it has reduced traffic, but not by as much as you really think. Oh, yeah, so it has definitely
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.260]   I think the last estimate I saw there was a study done
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.980]   It was in the neighborhood of 15 to 20 percent, which is not
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.700]   I mean, yeah, it's not but it's still
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:52.740]   Significantly, you know change those businesses and Germany I think when they
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.100]   Axel Springer
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:02.380]   Removed itself effectively from Google News and I think it said that it saw traffic declines of like 60 percent
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.060]   so
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:09.780]   That part one of the things that makes this this particular article difficult is it just says that
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.900]   publishers content owners can charge
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.180]   for
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:20.100]   Exerps that aggregators like Google are allowed to use short
[00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:25.140]   Exerps it doesn't say how short oh boy doesn't say a number of words
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:31.720]   It doesn't so this is all going to be open to interpretation is it 10 words is it a hundred words
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:37.300]   800 words. Yeah, well the worst it might be different in each country
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:44.260]   exactly so then the second one 13 which is now 17 is the
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.340]   effectively makes
[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.220]   any
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.820]   Tech platform like Google or Facebook or Twitter
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:59.780]   Responsible for the content that gets uploaded and it is those companies are required to remove
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:06.700]   Copywriting content before it gets uploaded to prevent it that's being upload to me much more significant
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.380]   It's potentially yeah, the ramifications are huge
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.620]   So now for instance when we upload something to YouTube that has
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.780]   Material in it the copyright holder disputes
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.340]   There's a takedown process using the digital money and copyright act
[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:26.580]   But there's also a defense for us the fair use defense that were a news organization
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.380]   Apple for instance took down the YouTube video of
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:36.140]   Our coverage of apples event on Monday. They also did a takedown on
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:45.020]   iOS today, which we showed a small little snippet of one of the movie clips or something like less than a minute in both cases
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:49.780]   We'll dispute it and say no no, it's fair use. This is commentary on a news story
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.740]   We're a news organization and YouTube will say oh yeah
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.580]   Never mind and bring it back up after some period of time
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:59.380]   And so there's a week or two that you're down that you lose that revenue
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:08.020]   That's the process today right under article 30 under article section two three allows fair use
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:14.980]   And it also protects the platforms from any liability. That's important right they get a safe heart
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.980]   Exemption there they can't be put they can't be punished
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.540]   Right and all they have to do is sort of make a good faith
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:27.060]   Attempt to take content down when someone complains so that the EU
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:31.340]   Directive would completely reverse that so there is no protection a
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.980]   For anything that's uploaded no fact use exemption
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.100]   The onus is on the companies to prevent it
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:44.580]   Sort of prior restraint if you want to think of it that way to to stop stuff from being uploaded
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.780]   So the risk is they'll just stop
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:51.980]   Everything right or at least huge quantities of stuff that arguably is
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:58.100]   You know fair use for fair dealing as it's called in the UK and Australia and Canada
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:04.020]   I think Google's moving closer to this anyway with YouTube because I are takedowns happen much faster
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:11.100]   And I'm guessing that they're tuning up content ID to do it on submission as opposed to on posting
[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:16.740]   Right that as soon as you submit something content they'll have to with this article 17 the way to do it
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.740]   Yeah, which means our stuff will get turned down before it is even
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.620]   aired
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.580]   They actually it would not surprise me if you're a right Leo
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.820]   Just I missed your episode on on the stadium news last week
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:34.140]   But if you recall using the Google assistant button on that when you're playing a streaming game on Google on
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:40.820]   Stadia it knows where you are and brings up a YouTube video at that specific spot in the game if you need right so they're already
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:46.420]   The technology is in some ways already there. Yeah, I'm sure Google's been thinking about this and planning for it
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:51.980]   That they seemed inevitable and they had it, you know an experience of it the snippet tax in Germany and Spain
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.340]   That's that light shung ji trek that the Jarvis is also
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.340]   There's also been a huge amount of pressure on them
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:06.540]   In both Germany and France to remove hate speech and of and basically illegal speech
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:11.820]   Right, so they've been gearing up to do that because there are massive fines involved
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.460]   if they don't take down
[00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:15.700]   sort of
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:25.180]   Speech that breaches the rules within 24 hours. I'm concerned and I mean obviously there's lots of concern about this article new article 17 slash 13
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:34.580]   But I I feel like something like what we do which is commentary on news and almost always the commentary on news is on somebody else's
[00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.140]   Copyright story
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.860]   Would be jeopardized by something like this
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:45.980]   So the EU has said that there there were a number of complaints obviously one being
[00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:53.700]   The upload filter was going to stop lots of stuff that was not copyright infringement that it would stop
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:13:02.820]   people from say uploading memes and so on that you use copyrighted content but as a as a form of commentary so the EU has said
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.100]   That's not the case. That's not what we want to do
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.580]   Gifts will be in memes will be protected
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:13.900]   journalistic and academic I got a point out they're not protected
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:19.180]   Well, and they're not the ones who are going to be implementing it. They're just saying this is our principle
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:25.580]   Yeah, we don't want to punish memes exactly, but it's not if you don't want to punish memes you put it in the law
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:29.020]   Otherwise, it's the interpretation of the countries in the courts, right?
[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:32.900]   And that's the risk is that each of these countries are going to interpret it
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.820]   You know in some cases in the most draconian way possible
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:41.220]   So so is this really a whole about revenues for these?
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:48.420]   Publications I guess I should say I'm trying to look at it from my perspective as a publisher all three of us on the show publishers obviously I
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:54.620]   Don't have like a you know subscription fees and things like that. I have my commentary out for free on the web
[00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:59.980]   You know, it's ad supported obviously, but I'm trying to figure out I get the
[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.420]   Even mentioned commercial versus non commercial
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:08.180]   Yes, see that's an interesting aspect to me because I understand a
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:14.660]   publication that wants to you know preserve its revenues and so on but we know that's been declining for years and
[00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:19.820]   I'm just there's nobody sitting in my you know house with my dog blogging and I
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:24.300]   Actually like having new snippets in Google news. It brings me traffic obviously
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:28.300]   So I'm just trying to figure out where I fit in and how this all is going to work
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.100]   Yeah, and I think I mean obviously this goes back
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:38.300]   Decades in sort of a decade in some cases the the feeling on the part of European
[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:44.220]   Publishers that Google in particular has been stealing content from them stealing revenue from them
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:49.860]   They've been putting pressure on the company, you know for God knows how long and it's led
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:54.060]   Effectively to these kinds of restrictions. I'm not convinced
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:58.540]   That they're even going to help that they're even going to sort of accomplish
[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:03.940]   What these publishers and copyright holders see erratically want
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:14.820]   So we'll we'll just watch with interest. I mean, I don't know there there's both
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:19.780]   There's hope in one respect because there's still time to lobby individual countries
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:24.340]   Although there was a lot of lobbying that over the weekend 200,000 people
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.980]   took to the streets across Europe. There are five million signatures on a petition and
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:33.460]   The parliament quickly passed the resolution
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:39.300]   the directive anyway, so I don't know what kind of hope we're gonna have but I
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:44.260]   Think it's as I've said before it's up to our listeners in the EU to
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:50.380]   To try to moderate this in their individual countries because there's nothing I could do about it from here
[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.860]   Just to make it even worse
[00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:59.300]   I saw a piece I think in the Guardian that said some of these EU members voted
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:05.740]   Wrongly voted incorrectly because they understand what they voted no
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.540]   They voted for the wrong article because of the way it was structured
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:15.700]   So some of those votes might actually not have been they could theoretically have been against those articles and
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:22.140]   One estimate I saw said that if they had voted the other way they wouldn't have passed
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:27.700]   So there's a there's a voting issue there as well unless you think this doesn't really matter I
[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:33.220]   Think I mean this is an interpretation, but I think what we're actually seeing is
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:41.260]   The old incumbent media chiefly in a Germany actual Springer the printed newspapers and magazines
[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:46.460]   Who are terrified of the new media and internet doing everything they can to?
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:52.060]   Disable or hobble the internet and there's good reason to do it. We just got
[00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.740]   information on
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.300]   mobile viewing in the United States
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:02.260]   40% of mobile web traffic is YouTube 40%
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:12.300]   Wow, and this and this is a significant jump in time spent from 29 to 34% at the expense by the way of television
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:17.580]   And so this is exactly what's happened to all sorts of incumbents bookstores
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.660]   grocery stores
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:23.300]   When's the last time you went to a video rental store?
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:28.620]   This you know, this is what's been happening thanks to the internet and now it's publishers turn and
[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:31.220]   they're very scared and
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:40.860]   Television and newspapers and magazines. It's it's a changing environment and the funny thing is they've actually had the longest amount of time to actually deal
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.860]   with the change because
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:47.700]   Web was all text in the beginning, you know, so and they're coming now with
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:55.020]   Regulation or directives and all and I get it. I do it's just where have you been for 25 30 years?
[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.420]   Yeah, and I think a lot of the a lot of those sort of
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.900]   the reaction to
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.300]   Google and to the internet and even to Facebook is
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:10.100]   Is an attempt to blame them for problems that have actually been going on for decades?
[00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:17.100]   I mean readership of newspapers started declining long before the internet came along because people had TV and radio
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.180]   So it's not as though
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.560]   Google and Facebook suddenly caused this sharp decline
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:29.980]   They just caused the already existing decline to speed up a little bit. Here's a this is a great from Nielsen
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:33.380]   A great graph
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.460]   This is 18 to 34 here
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:40.260]   The blue is TV and that includes DVR
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.460]   from
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.740]   year over year from 27% to 22% and
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:53.540]   Then the orange is watching the internet on a computer. That's gone from 29 to 34% big growth in the most important
[00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:57.020]   Demographic from that point of view of advertisers, but also the point of view of the future
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:02.300]   You know if you go to adult 65 plus these oldsters are still watching TV
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:08.780]   A lot of it 60% but there's even a drop. I have to point out. There's even a drop there
[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.420]   so
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:17.140]   You know the others are TV connected devices like game consoles or Roku's that's green
[00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:25.380]   Watching on an app is red. That's a small. That's interesting. Apple web watching on a smartphone is a small and then
[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.420]   I'm sorry read his tablet and then
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:35.620]   Orange is a app or web in a smartphone. Oh the light orange is so good. Never mind forget
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:40.580]   Thank God there's an eraser on this thing. Just forget
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:47.660]   I even tried to make any sense of that at all, but you could see there's a definite trend to increase time spent on mobile
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:52.020]   And not a surprise frankly not a surprise at all
[00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:55.500]   Let's see what else
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.140]   Tuesday it's the end of the line for aloe Google plus
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:02.900]   inbox
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:08.220]   Am I leaving anything out probably oh Google dot goal their URL shortener?
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:14.380]   The Google graveyard if you go to killed by Google comm I think we should we show this last week
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:18.460]   Or no, I just I just bookmark this. These are all the things in
[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:25.380]   In chronological order killed by Google and it's kind of a long scroll
[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:30.260]   Kind of a goes a long way. There's Google now remember that
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.940]   There's Google code. There's Picasa. Oh, I remember that
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:39.860]   Those things have evolved into other things though. I mean Google now is still part of your Google feed
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:46.140]   Is it yes really is that Google now? What is that?
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:50.100]   Yeah Google reader. Yeah sort of I don't know
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:54.020]   Sparrow
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.220]   That they bought it then killed it
[00:20:56.220 --> 00:21:02.140]   Anoramio panoramio that was cool Google wave don't tell Gina Trappani. It's gone
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:06.940]   Remember songs that that was cool songs that Google flu vaccine finder
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:12.940]   Remember we talked a lot about how you could see how the flu vaccine was working all over. Why do they even?
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:21.660]   Why why why Google why why this is a great site? I read I don't know anything about this
[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:27.660]   But I I was reading some commentary by someone about the very first one on the list Google fusion tables
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.380]   And they were saying that this was a hugely
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:35.500]   You know valuable thing to have and lots of people used it and in fact built
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.300]   services around it and then
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:41.820]   And then just put this on to be honest
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.220]   This is why
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.620]   But my wife when we talked about Google stadia
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:52.220]   She said don't tell me about any more Google stuff. They're not I don't want to get involved. They're just gonna break my heart. I
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.780]   Forget it
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:22:02.060]   And I think that that's a genuine problem for Google is they don't especially yeah people don't trust them like developers
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:06.860]   You you're not gonna build anything into those and they're on those services
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:12.540]   That was the whole pitch of stadia was at game at the game developers conference. Come on. We need some games right?
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:15.820]   So we got no games. Please write some games. Would you do that?
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:21.580]   Yeah, I mean you wake up one morning and what sorry never mind we changed our minds
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:26.940]   We're not doing that anymore. That's as bad as even bright in a game to run on facebook
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:33.260]   It's it's also bleeding into their hardware a little bit in my opinion and that's even worse
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:40.620]   Well, you are on a pixel book right or you were you love that pixel book. It's pixel slate right now. You're honestly I love pixel book
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.540]   Um, but they didn't announce a new pixel book this year
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:51.900]   They announced instead of a katka tablet. You like the tablet. I love it. Okay, but I'm a different user
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.420]   Different all right. No, you're different. All right
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:23:01.900]   I evaluate it and I recommend this to all the folks I write to or write about you know, I'm about crumbooks
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.660]   You need to think about what your your own use case is and for me
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:12.300]   50% of the time I'm using a device to watch tv on youtube tv or
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:17.260]   Hulu or Netflix and so on and I prefer a tablet the other 50% of the time
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:25.180]   I am writing coding and so on but I don't need you know a 14 hour typing device. So this is perfect for me
[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:27.980]   I think one thing google did that's a little
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:34.300]   Difficult is that they have five models ranging in price from 600 to 1600 dollars
[00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.060]   and
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:41.580]   A normal person going to buy this is not going to know. Oh, it's the difference between
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.580]   Mm this and that I don't even understand
[00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:50.940]   That's why I write articles about this goodness is about crumbooks.com and there's no link tax
[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:53.660]   why why
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:57.500]   Uh at this point you can't get the uh the two bottom of the line
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.780]   The seliron no and they never had them
[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:07.580]   They did people have pre-order them so they never once the so if you didn't pre-order the day they announced it
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:15.980]   So so marquez brownly he pre-ordered one and got one and I think that was the beginning of the end for the seliron
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:17.260]   Quite a
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:21.500]   Man that guy's got some power. I think that's a fair assessment. I don't know that for a fact because he panned it right
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:26.220]   He panned it um wow for some good reasons no no question
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:28.860]   I do question google's judgment in trying to bring a
[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:32.540]   3000 by 2000 display to a seliron processor
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:35.100]   uh with four giga verham and uh
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.820]   Did he say it wasn't fast enough? What did he say?
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.940]   the biggest well he said a lot of things the
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:46.860]   Some I agree with some I don't the one I agree with and that most people took away from was very valid and that is the
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.340]   uh animations when you're switching
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:54.060]   Apps like when you go into like the overview mode like on an ipad when you see all your apps running
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.220]   That's the butter smooth right?
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:02.060]   When you do that on pixel slate or the one that he was using it was janky frame rate drops
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:08.140]   Stuttery and I get it and in chrome was 73. We may talk about that a little later in the show that just came out
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:11.740]   That is supposed to address some of the issues does that mean the seliron will be back?
[00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:17.500]   I don't know. I really don't know but I question their judgment of even bringing that device out and
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:22.460]   Yeah, it is what it does. I know I know marcus is has a lot of you know his
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:28.220]   million of millions of subscribers on youtube and his widely revered among geeks
[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.860]   But honestly, I don't think he carries
[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:35.580]   That much weight in the general populace would have expected to buy this
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:41.820]   I mean, maybe he killed it. I think it's much more likely google put it out so that they could say starts at 599
[00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:45.260]   Never intended to sell it because that's too many skews
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:49.100]   Just from the point of view a consumer going to the store saying I don't know what to get now
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.420]   They've got they should actually take it off of this
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:54.060]   Uh, yeah, I really I would agree
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:26:01.020]   One point about marcus is reach. I mean we know he's got the geek following he's got i said and eight million subscribers however
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.580]   Many it is and and he's earned everyone and he's awesome
[00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:07.660]   The thing is Leo. It wasn't just the people who watched this video on youtube
[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:13.900]   It was all the other outlets picking up on it people repeated it. Yeah, exactly so that expanded the reach
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:18.700]   Sorry, I'm just I just started marcus
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.100]   Page I think so
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:25.980]   This is his youtube page will give him a plug and increases subscribers by about five people
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:30.220]   He's got a 8.2 million now mk bhd on youtube
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:35.260]   Wow, I mean if he has that much power, that's pretty impressive
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:38.700]   I don't even know if in his heyday wall mossberg could have killed a pixel book
[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.260]   But maybe maybe
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:46.700]   And I think you're right. I think people listen to him influencers listen to him and then tell their friends. Oh, don't get that one
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:53.340]   Right, but honestly, we're also not talking about I would guess not vast quantities. They don't sell a lot of these
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:58.140]   No, and I think that's part of the problem with the pricing as well aside from numerous skews
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:02.620]   Google doesn't move enough hardware to get really sweet deals on ships and that so forth so
[00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.340]   You know it is what it is
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:10.060]   I would I would expect people buy Samsung Chromebooks or other inexpensive Chromebooks
[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:14.060]   premium graces or a sir aces yeah
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:19.420]   Thing is they really they could buy lower costing ones that were not as good say as the pixel book Leo
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:23.100]   But when you bought your pixel book what other high-end Chromebooks were there?
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:29.100]   Right. No, that's right. And I still love that pixel book. I think that's a really great device
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:35.020]   And what that device has done has gotten a susan del and linovo to start selling
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.580]   568
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:42.060]   $900 1,000 Chromebooks now. Yeah, so you have choice now
[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:48.380]   Um, what's the best selling Chromebook out there right now? Oh, I'm sure it's a low-cost one
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:53.180]   Yeah, maybe you know the asus uh c 302 flip has been around for two years
[00:27:53.740 --> 00:28:00.460]   And people love it. It sells like hotcakes. I think and it just got a replacement that uh you can now order a refresh that just
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:06.540]   Uh when available last week for this week rather one thing that you can get in non google hardware
[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:10.060]   I don't know does google sell it with an lte a radio
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:13.740]   No, they do not yeah, so that's something desirable
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:18.860]   I think for a lot of people is the ability to be always online and sam sung and others do offer Chromebooks with
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:24.700]   Lte you know the original did have that I was at the launch. Yeah, I remember it. Yeah, they stopped doing it
[00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:29.980]   Great idea another thing google kill put that like graveyard and smoke it
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:33.260]   Uh, yeah, I mean I'm looking here's a Chromebook
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:36.380]   From a certain 11 inch for 200 bucks
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:40.860]   Uh those 11 inches typically are around 200 $14
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.820]   HP's got 125
[00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:49.180]   And then you're right there's like the Chromebook plus which is what my daughter uses in college. That's 500 bucks
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:51.180]   from sam sung
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:55.660]   Um, and I think is a really nice piece of hardware and of course you get aluminum body
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:59.420]   That's one one one one thing. It's really one of those choice is really
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:03.260]   Exploated about a Chromebook for our youngest when she went to
[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:09.500]   University actually we might have bought it when she was still in high school and I still have it and use it as a sort of
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:15.420]   You know, it's it's on the kitchen counter and I use it for this and that it's not like a main work computer
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:24.780]   But it's still it still works. Yeah, yeah, it's not the fastest what do you recommend? Uh, Kevin? I mean, what do you you recommend the slight to people?
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:28.060]   I tell them that if they're going to
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:33.820]   Use it more as a laptop to get a pixel book or an ace or Chromebook spin 13
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.940]   Yes, I think that's a nice choice. Yeah, I mean I
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:41.740]   Listen to what I use is not best for everybody. I state that repeatedly so
[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:45.740]   Depends on what you need it to do, you know, the $200 laptop
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:50.860]   So that you just said very capable devices their cellarons may be 4 gig ramps 720p displays
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:55.820]   But if that's all you want to check for email and browse 200 bucks well spent right?
[00:29:55.820 --> 00:30:02.220]   I often recommend users. I recommend it for people who want to secure banking and things like that, you know, yeah
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:07.100]   Yeah, you can use your windows laptop, but you'll be you know for bad you want to stay secure use a Chromebook
[00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:10.620]   Um
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:14.220]   I just wish they hadn't killed stuff like inbox. I really liked inbox
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:21.980]   I don't understand why it was great. What so what was wrong with it and unlike microsoft when google killed something
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:29.100]   You can't use it anymore. It's dead. Yeah, you could still use windows xp if you should have a mind
[00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:32.700]   But you can't use inbox after uh, tuesday. Nope
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:37.500]   And I mean aloe. I never used aloe. Did you guys use aloe? Well jeff and i joke about it
[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:42.540]   We messaged each other when aloe launched and that's the last time we used i forgot it even existed
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:47.260]   So that i'm not worried about although had google said this is our future going forward messaging
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:53.980]   We want all android devices to use it. We want google phi users to use it aloe is a as a great messaging tool
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:58.540]   I could have survived that's just google not giving it any steam
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:01.420]   But i mean messaging we've talked about
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:08.940]   As before messaging is the worst example of google at like google at one point what they had like five or something
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:13.820]   And and it wasn't clear which ones they were sort of investing in and should you be using hangouts?
[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:18.220]   Should you be using you know, it was just and multiple teams. It was just nuts
[00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:23.500]   They're pushing rcs now this rich communication system over sms
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:27.500]   Aloe didn't do as I remember aloe did not do rcs
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.140]   uh, and they want you to use
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.060]   messenger, which is
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:34.060]   android messenger, which is
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:36.940]   The messenger that comes
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:40.460]   Yeah, your samsung phone in addition to sam song messenger
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:43.900]   Yeah, it has pretty much the same icon the same name
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:46.460]   Yeah, uh, one's green one's blue
[00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:52.060]   It's very confusing and the reason I mentioned samsung is as well as the pixel three has done
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:57.660]   And there's new models apparently coming. We'll talk about that in a second by far the biggest android
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:06.300]   Handset out there is is samsung by a long shot number two from number one phone manufacturer in the world number two is apple
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:08.220]   Uh
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:11.340]   At or walway depending on which way the wind's blowing
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:15.740]   So really the experience most people have of android is on samsung
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:22.780]   Yeah, it's extremely confusing because you get the android messenger from google plus the message or from samsung
[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:26.940]   and then you know you can if you want download aloe and
[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.820]   message
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:39.180]   You know internally there's just too many teams trying to do too many different things and this is just strictly dependent for being on the inside
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.700]   uh
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:45.340]   It's just a coordination effort too many competing priorities, you know different
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:50.940]   Yeah, that's right. I forgot you were a contractor at google. Did you did you have any insight into what was going on at the time?
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:56.540]   I dog fooded aloe for eight months before you even saw it. Yeah, wow
[00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:03.180]   Yeah, I bet you liked it. I actually did. I liked it a lot, but the thing is uh
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:06.460]   Again, just as you said too many different competing
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:10.780]   Apps that do the same thing plus with the android, you know
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.100]   licensing terms
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:17.580]   The same song or somebody can create their own so now you've got two and three duplicates the same thing just from
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:22.700]   You know an a messenger app. It's yeah, it's and I have to wonder like if some
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:27.900]   Someone in google says you know what we need we need another messaging app
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:36.060]   Wouldn't wouldn't a bunch of people put their hands up and say well as it turns out we already have five and uh, so
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:42.460]   You know, maybe we don't need another one aloe with aloe because aloe's whole claim to fame was that used google assistant
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:51.260]   And it had the smart replies that were built in the inbox and so it it must have been from the a the ai assistant division. Okay, right?
[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:58.300]   That was their their thing, right? Is that right kevin? Yeah, I mean it was a I don't think it's a secret
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.820]   And I don't think we're getting trouble for saying it now. Um just about every decision
[00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:07.740]   From a product standpoint that I heard of or was involved with there not that I was making the decisions
[00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:13.020]   Just to be clear. It was all about how do we get ai and the cloud in this problem?
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:19.100]   Right. Yeah, and that's pretty evident based on the products you've seen since and by the way, that's not a bad strategy
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:25.100]   That's a very good stretch. It's a lot better than the thick and dotra era strategy. How do we get social and everything?
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:27.020]   True
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:31.820]   Yeah, that didn't work out so well, but but what google doesn't do a great job of I don't think is
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:34.620]   Is kind of make clear?
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.260]   This is an experiment
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:39.500]   You know, and we're gonna learn stuff from it
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:44.060]   But we're probably gonna shut it off at some point or we might because people you know, they
[00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:48.700]   Download these things and they start using them and then they become parts of their lives
[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:54.700]   Even google plus for that matter and then it's just suddenly man. We're not doing that. So yeah
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:35:00.940]   Well, we we we rag on google almost every week for this their messaging strategy
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:03.980]   only because I use hangouts
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:11.820]   And uh, I want it to survive for something like it. Yeah, I'd like a unified strategy that here's here's what I need
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.220]   And I don't think i'm alone
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:18.620]   Something that works on the desktop and read messages does that sort of thumbs up
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:20.940]   something that works on iOS
[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:23.740]   Hangouts does that hangouts is all three
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:26.620]   uh, and uh
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:32.860]   That's pretty much it and something to work with my sms on my phone whether I use a pixel or a samsung
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:38.780]   And hangouts is the closest thing they've got right now, but I don't think hangouts is gonna last very I think hangouts is
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:44.300]   Yeah, what's the problem with hangouts? Yeah, I don't understand
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:50.700]   I don't know. I mean i'm sad to see that go because that's how stacey and I communicate for our iot things and
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:57.020]   Um, I know that hanging out's meat is going to like the g-sweet side and I don't think that's what you're talking about leo
[00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:59.980]   You don't want that you want to consider you know although i was talking with lee's in this morning
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:04.940]   She says well that I use hangouts. They're not killing it. I use it on g-sweet and I said yes
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:08.700]   They are it's gonna be yeah chat for text
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:11.820]   and then meet for
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.980]   video and audio calls
[00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:19.580]   Right and will it that'll be automatically replacing hangouts or will she has shot to download those one she
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:26.700]   Um, I think it wouldn't surprise me. She gets it in a app update to hangouts if she's got a g-sweet side
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:30.140]   That's almost worse because then you had hangouts there and now it's something else
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:34.700]   Yeah, and it doesn't end this up by the way, there's something else doesn't do all the things that hangouts did
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:39.500]   And by the way, if you're a google phy subscriber as I am
[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:42.460]   You still use hangouts
[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:47.740]   Mm-hmm. I don't know that's all been worked out yet. I'm sorry
[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:52.060]   It's crazy. This is why i'm using an iPhone these days. I sorry
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:58.300]   That's why I actually so the and the other problem has been the pixel 3 reliability and there's been a lot of complaints about this
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:02.620]   I love the camera on the pixel 3 and I like a pure google experience
[00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:05.820]   But once the sam sung s 10 plus came out
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.940]   I there's just not it's not a there's no
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:15.340]   It's not a there's no competition. It's it's just a much more reliable phone not not more affordable, but
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:20.780]   Much more reliable phone that works better. It's got better screen, etc, etc, etc
[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:26.060]   I just I don't I think google needs to figure something out. I don't know what
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:31.660]   I don't feel like the messaging the messaging stuff at least and even the social stuff
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:34.300]   It was so clearly not
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:39.740]   Anything that core google kind of cared about deeply because it didn't really involve
[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:44.060]   Well, the social did involve search and it it sort of tangentially involved search
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.700]   But it always felt like these things were kind of
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:52.540]   You know toys for for engineers to play with but not real products not things that would affect
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:56.540]   Google deeply enough that they would sort of care about them. Yeah
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:59.740]   so that brings us to stadia
[00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:03.260]   and um
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:06.940]   We've met we already talked about a little bit because this was announced last week
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:09.660]   at the
[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:16.540]   Every time I go to see net now and brave it says this site is stealing logging credentials is bad
[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:19.420]   I don't know. I can't go to see net anymore. I guess
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:23.340]   What so
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:27.820]   Oh no, that was variety. Come on brave chill out. There we go
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:33.020]   google stadia great article by travert travertroobin and variety is
[00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:35.660]   a net neutrality nightmare
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:38.220]   and
[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:44.460]   It points out the real Achilles heel of stadia, which is yes, google has lots of server capacity
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:46.140]   They're going to put
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:49.340]   high-end graphics processors, especially designed a md
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:51.740]   GPUs
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:59.340]   in every instance so you'll have what they said that you'll have 10 uh teraflops was a teraflops or yeah teraflops of
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:07.340]   processing performance compared to the three or four in a ps4 pro or an xbox one s and and they'll even be able to combine
[00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:13.580]   Instances if you really need it'll be great for cooperative play because you and your friend can be playing sitting on the couch together
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:19.500]   Uh, and you'll each have your own instance even though they show up as one on the screen, etc. It's all sorts of really great things
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:25.260]   Sounds wonderful except that they're completely at the mercy of the last mile
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:27.980]   your internet service provider
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:34.780]   And the variety article raises a really interesting point now that they don't have to pay lip service to net neutrality
[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:40.780]   Watch and see I wouldn't be surprised at all if if Comcast and Verizon and AT&T
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:44.460]   If I don't get it something in the mail from my isp
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:48.700]   Comcast in a few months saying, you know for best performance
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:51.580]   Google stadia requires our special
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:57.580]   High latency connection. I mean low latency connection for a mere five dollars a month
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:00.940]   Well, and it would be a perfect
[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:05.500]   Perfect pitch because they know that gamers are obsessed about this. I'll pay it
[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:09.660]   If i'm reading websites, I don't actually care if it loads
[00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:16.700]   In a lot of seconds or two point seven seconds, but your game is going to be huge. You know unplayable
[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:18.460]   Huge
[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:21.980]   Well, I don't disagree, but I question how many true
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:29.340]   Quote unquote gamers are even going to do this because they're going to use it. Well, yeah, it needs some games that would be a place to start
[00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:34.620]   Oh, yeah, it needs games people have already invested. I mean true gamers have invested. That's a good point
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:39.740]   Thousands of dollars on the other one where they already have an Xbox or PlayStation or a gaming
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:42.300]   Online and yeah, they don't
[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:51.340]   Yeah, yeah, this is to me. This is the bigger opportunity for people who haven't spent, you know a $2,000 on the latest gtx video card and
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:58.220]   Everything else and that it's a tremendous potential opportunity for these people. Yeah, I could see the isp is jumping in here
[00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:04.540]   But I I was actually happy about stadia personally. I'm like I can I can use my pixel slate for something else now. Yeah
[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:12.060]   Yeah, and I think you're right. There's probably a a fairly big chunk of potential gamers kind of casual gamers
[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:17.580]   You know who they're never going to build their own rig. They're never going to get the latest, you know
[00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:22.140]   Console, but they might be willing to use stadia
[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:32.940]   Yeah, I mean they're getting access to high-end hardware on the cheap and certainly certainly it's the case that uh, there are existing
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:37.580]   Streaming gaming solutions. I play geforce now in my shield
[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:42.140]   My video shield that plays quite I haven't had any problems with latency. Have you?
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:51.020]   Now it's been great. I mean, I don't know what your isp or who it is or what your i'm not a pretty fast comcast connection, but uh,
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:54.700]   gigabit files connections shop
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:03.500]   I would I still wouldn't be surprised even though you and I don't clearly don't need it
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:07.260]   If we didn't get emails from verizon and Comcast respectively saying
[00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:11.100]   You really have to get our special new gaming connection
[00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:16.300]   To play so they're gonna start the letter. Hey, that's a nice. There's just some nice games you got
[00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:19.020]   The shame that some was a habit though
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:20.780]   Yeah
[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:22.380]   I I think
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:25.660]   The challenge for google is gonna be they have no presence in gaming at all
[00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:31.980]   Uh, microsoft is very quick after the google announcement. I think a lot of us including me watching this saying this
[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:37.420]   This is a shot across the bow of microsoft and sony because both are planning similar services
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:41.020]   Uh, microsoft was very quick to respond last week saying
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:47.100]   Wait till we get to e3. We'll have some announcements for you. They have a streaming service. They're planning a lunch next year
[00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:51.420]   And the advantage microsoft has is that they have a lot of games
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:52.380]   They have their own
[00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:57.660]   microsoft studio games which are very popular and they have relationships with all the big gaming companies
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:00.860]   They already offer many of these games on the xbox
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:07.660]   Um goal. What is it the xbox plus service where you can subscribe, but you still download them. They're not streaming
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:11.180]   Uh and sony using the same boat and tendos in the same boat
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:17.340]   Uh, these companies already have relationships google starting from scratch going to be very challenging
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:21.980]   It's definitely an uphill battle. It's uh, we'll have to see it all comes down to content
[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:27.820]   Content is king. Um, the other one that I wouldn't discount is amazon and twitch because what we didn't talk about
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:33.500]   Probably last week was the youtube uh factor here with stadia. I think it's huge
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.940]   Um, and amazon could pull the same thing with twitch
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:38.380]   Yeah
[00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:41.180]   Is that a case of google doing so
[00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:45.820]   Clearly it's some even said this is to save youtube. I think that's an overstatement
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:51.740]   But uh as they pointed out during the event youtube sells or down law offers a lot of gaming downloads
[00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:55.980]   Billions of people watch youtube gaming videos not this not the live streaming so much
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:58.540]   But the gaming videos to learn how to play a game and so forth
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:04.220]   Uh, obviously they see a threat from twitch amazon's live streaming gaming service
[00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:08.860]   Uh, they did offer some unique features in youtube you mentioned one of them the ability to be watching a
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:11.260]   Gameplay and then pick up right where
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:17.100]   That gameplay is right now by pushing a button and you're streaming on stadia. There's also the ability to package
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:19.740]   a current position in a game
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:23.180]   And offer that so somebody like ninja could say all right
[00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:29.980]   This is a great chance for you to try fortnite except fortnite won't be on this but is a great chance for your try fortnite
[00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:35.820]   Uh here. Here's a download. You could pick up right where i've left off. That's cool
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:40.540]   Uh the ability to stream directly to youtube from stadia. That's cool
[00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:42.940]   Uh, although
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:47.660]   We'll see i mean i don't they didn't say anything about an instead of the gamer or chat room or any of the features
[00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:52.540]   That makes twitch really powerful for those guys who are streaming gals and guys who are streaming
[00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:54.460]   Um
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:45:01.420]   So but on the other hand that's that's google shoring up its own business as opposed to giving gamers what they want, right?
[00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:05.340]   It's it's sometimes a lot of times companies do this and i always wonder
[00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:13.180]   When when especially in silica valley when companies are solving their business problem ahead of solving their consumers problems
[00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:19.900]   See you're you're going back to the gamers. They're not solving the titties gamers problem
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:23.020]   They are solving the non gamers problem
[00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:29.100]   The non gamers asking for those features or are those features designed for youtube to succeed against twitch
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.580]   You see what i'm saying
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:39.660]   I do i see what you're saying, but i think there's just i mean how many how many people in the us have a custom built gaming rigor spent
[00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:43.980]   No, i agree i understand in fact i said that during this day to launch this is not for
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:45.980]   current mainstream gamers
[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:48.300]   But those features sound like they're trying to woo
[00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:56.380]   Ninja away from twitch right if you're gonna save youtube with this you got to woo the twitch guys
[00:45:56.380 --> 00:46:02.860]   Well, they might as well try like if they can get a sort of broad mass of kind of either non gamers or casual gamers
[00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:09.820]   And they can kind of chip away at at amazon at twitch and why not it's a win all around and see this
[00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:12.380]   They've got nowhere to go but up. Yeah. Yeah
[00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:15.340]   There's an advantage of starting at zero. Yeah
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:20.460]   The game developers themselves. I mean at first i was like, oh, they're not going to want to be on this thing
[00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:25.260]   Because they got to port their games over to linux because of the stadia hardware is linux yada yada
[00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:29.660]   But then i'm like wait unless it's an exclusive thing they can still have their
[00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:34.860]   millions and millions of sales to regular true pc gamers and add
[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:36.940]   Onto that through
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:41.340]   You know the the bigger audience of non gamers that say hey i can play these awesome games
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:47.420]   You know and not buy two thousand dollars with the hardware. Mm-hmm. Well, and here's the funny thing because that's exactly what
[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:51.020]   apple announced on monday is a
[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:54.220]   Our apple arcade which would get like stadia won't be available to the fall
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:57.260]   We don't know how much it's going to cost a lot of big question marks
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:01.420]   And they don't have any games for it. So they're actually saying to developers
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:07.660]   We want you to develop a game exclusively for apple arcade. You can't not only can you not sell it on android
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:13.420]   You can't even sell it on apple people have to play it through arcade with their one price subscription
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:16.380]   And developers now now go to work
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:19.580]   And i think that's a tough pitch
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:22.140]   Especially if you're a developer
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:25.580]   That is making good money on the app store. Look how much
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:28.300]   Epic makes on
[00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:31.740]   Fortnite in-game purchases which would not be eligible for apple arcade
[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:34.380]   they make billions
[00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:36.380]   so so what are the what are the
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:43.580]   Distribution what's the distribution deal for a game developer in apple arcade? Well, I haven't seen that yet. Yeah, here's here's
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:47.100]   Oprah said it on stage when she was standing there
[00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:53.740]   A billion pockets y'all billion pockets. It's in a billion pockets. That's the distribution offer
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:58.220]   I don't know how many people subscribe to apple arcade certainly not the full billion
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:02.380]   But the fact that you are on a billion devices and available on a billion devices is
[00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:05.100]   Probably fairly compelling
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:11.020]   Also apples wait wait you can't say that and opra said it. I didn't say it opra said it
[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:13.740]   you can't agree with opra because
[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:19.980]   Stadia for example can run probably on two billion that's true it can run on all of those plus
[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:25.420]   Run on every iPhone and every android phone and every chromebook and even on chromecast
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:30.300]   Yeah and tv's and exactly we don't know if stadia is exclusive
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:32.940]   We know apples exclusive we stadia may not be exclusive
[00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:36.860]   In fact, I why would I don't think they need to make it exclusive the pitch of stadia is
[00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:41.180]   You could play this game on this cheap device is 35 or well
[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:43.820]   $60 for the $1000 pixel slate new fool
[00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:46.700]   I think
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:49.340]   Sweet spot for this. I don't know what google sweet spot
[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:52.700]   But from the player's sweet spot is a chromecast ultra $75
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:55.900]   And then you really want the best experience you buy the Wi-Fi
[00:48:55.900 --> 00:49:02.300]   Google controller which reduces latency because it's correct just like the chromecast connecting directly
[00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:07.340]   Uh, that's a pretty sweet bundle. So what I don't know what you've spent there because they didn't announce a price for that
[00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:13.100]   But let's say 200 bucks and then whatever the monthly fee which they also didn't announce. So let's say 20 bucks
[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:18.140]   Um, that that might be pretty cool. I mean if but but then it sounds like you're a gamer
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:20.940]   And maybe if you are you already had a xbox
[00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:25.020]   But maybe I mean there's lots of kids you're you're not gonna let your kid
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:27.500]   You're not gonna know lots of people
[00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:33.100]   Are gonna do it, but not everyone's gonna give the kid next box right one or a plus
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:37.580]   So the kids will demand these daddy. I want to come cast ultra
[00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:41.020]   And then you can grow future gamers, right?
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.980]   So if you can get them young, maybe they'll get used to it
[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:48.060]   Maybe they'll even like it and as it gets better and you add more features more games
[00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:50.860]   I probably got to watch in these games on youtube now
[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:53.180]   Yes, that's true
[00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:57.500]   And they did mention and I have to say I was thrilled to hear this cooperative gaming because lisa and I
[00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:01.180]   Lisa says my wife let's I want to sit on the couch and play a game with you
[00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:04.220]   Like golden. I remember golden. I you could two people could be yeah
[00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:09.580]   And I looked and there's like it's like the lego game is the only game you can do that with it
[00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:11.580]   We didn't want to play so
[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:17.740]   That's one of the things google explicitly called out at the statey announcement is cooperative gaming and because each person will have their own
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:19.580]   Instance in the cloud. It'll be good quality
[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:25.820]   You can actually be at different places in the world and I mean and and she could sit there with her pixel book or
[00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:29.660]   I could have the big screen we could I mean there's really some options here
[00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:34.300]   And I could see this being a family gaming opportunity you guys should play jackbox
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:36.620]   What's jackbox
[00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:44.460]   Ever play that no, so it's their games. Uh, I think it started with you don't know jack do you remember that love that played that many years?
[00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:45.420]   Yeah
[00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:49.500]   So jackbox effectively it's all it does is multiplayer games
[00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:55.820]   We played it at a family reunion kind of thing with nieces and nephews and cousins and
[00:50:56.220 --> 00:51:01.100]   There's a bunch of there's a game where you're called quiplash where you have to come up with
[00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:06.940]   Stupid sort of funny saying party games. Yeah party games, but they're really well done
[00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:10.460]   They won't let me look at it unless I give them any
[00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:16.060]   Yeah, anyway, they're fine
[00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:25.420]   Real quick did apple say what developers will get as a cut of the 999?
[00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:29.980]   No, first of all they had say 999. We don't know what it is
[00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:36.220]   Uh, the deal for apple news we should talk about apple news too since you both are journalism types
[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:43.340]   Uh, the deal for apple news according to the wall street journal is 50 percent. So it's 999
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:50.540]   Oh, I subscribed immediately because I had I used to subscribe to texture. It's the same same price apple keeps five bucks
[00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:57.740]   the rest of the money gets distributed based on engagement time so and and so
[00:51:57.740 --> 00:52:01.420]   That was another interesting announcement
[00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:09.020]   Yeah, well, I'm really curious both of you have had experiences in print and have watched print struggle
[00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:15.820]   Uh, a lot of people blame facebook for the end of journalism. Um, this is apple
[00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:23.740]   Is it apple's attempt to save journalism or is it apple's attempt to draw the last drop of blood out before they toss away the corpse?
[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:27.900]   But which i'm going to go with number two option number two. I'll take number two for the win
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:32.620]   I mean if they wanted to save journalism, they could not take 50
[00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:38.620]   Like that would be suggestion number one. Yeah, if you're going to try and help media companies
[00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:41.580]   You would not take 50 of the revenue
[00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:47.900]   You know yesterday we were talking about it on mac break weekly and I said the thing I hate about this is it's a walled garden
[00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:54.380]   And it's not the web and everybody yelled at me. They said well. No, this is great. You want a walled garden. This is a what do you what?
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:53:00.060]   Web I can still look at the web. Yeah, but this doesn't interact with the web this draws resources from the web
[00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:02.300]   No, no, this doesn't hurt the web
[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:07.420]   And that's what really worries me more than anything is that journalism as soon as it's becomes a walled
[00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:11.580]   Who were we talking about to that worked for the daily Rupert Murdoch's?
[00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:15.020]   Mm-hmm crazy usually successful
[00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:22.940]   Yes, he spent what a hundred million dollars or something building a newsroom and hiring journalists
[00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:30.060]   And somebody we talked to regularly was one of those journalists. Wow. Yeah, it would have been fun. Oh times
[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:34.860]   Yeah back when that's what I think you're pretty good there for a little while called stupid money
[00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:37.500]   Until they launched us
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:40.540]   Okay, Rupert's doing fine. Rupert's not me
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:46.060]   He loses 20 million estimated a year on the New York Post
[00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:52.140]   He doesn't care 20 million and he's lost that for 15 years. Why does he still do it?
[00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:57.420]   Because he doesn't care. He wants the New York Post and he doesn't care. It's power. It's power
[00:53:57.420 --> 00:54:01.660]   20 million is nothing. He makes so much money off for Fox that he subsidizes it
[00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:05.660]   It's a rounding air and it gives him a voice in Manhattan an important voice
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:09.420]   It's for Pat. So Apple, I mean
[00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:16.220]   You know a bunch of people Josh Benton at the Neiman journalism lab did quite a good piece on news plus it's um
[00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:19.020]   I don't I don't see why
[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:23.020]   And in fact the New York Times and the washing post decided not to take part
[00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:29.180]   But I don't I don't actually see I think it's like a Hail Mary pass for a lot of publishers. They're like well
[00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:32.780]   Who cares like apple is in a billion pockets?
[00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:37.980]   Maybe we only get 50% of whatever pennies people contribute
[00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:44.700]   But at least we'll get something and maybe it won't cost us a lot and so why not? I mean, we're literally so desperate
[00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:50.300]   That's what it is. It's a it's a very sally set up eliminates to hand and said she'd put your paper there
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:56.300]   They would go for right because that's really what's happening is that these all these magazines are are dying on the vine
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:59.420]   And a billion pockets y'all well, right?
[00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:07.260]   If I make one penny for pocket, I can I mean I thought it was fascinating though. The Wall Street Journal is part of it
[00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:11.740]   So the New York. Oh, but they're not fully a part of it. We don't know they are. They know they're not
[00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:14.380]   What yes, no you get a
[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:21.340]   Everything from the journal is in there. No, so that's what's fat. Yes. That's what's fascinating. So we're all in research
[00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:25.660]   No, everything from the journal is in there, but they are only going to surface
[00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:32.700]   General news. So it will only show up sort of in your feed or in the highlights general news
[00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:36.540]   Everything from the journal is in there, but only if you search for
[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:40.620]   So if you know a specific keyword or you know a headline
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:43.820]   You can find it, but I think they're counting on
[00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:47.500]   The fact that like 99 percent of people are not going to do that
[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:50.700]   They're just going to get whatever journal stuff comes to them
[00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:53.180]   So it's they're actually trying to
[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:55.900]   Take you know have their cake and eat it too
[00:55:55.900 --> 00:56:01.260]   Put your content there, but actually only highlight the general news that you don't care
[00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:05.980]   So I could so for instance, I pay $149 for the journal digital subscription
[00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:11.180]   The difference between this and apple news is for one thing apple news only keeps it for three days
[00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:13.180]   You can't go past three days, right?
[00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:17.660]   And then you're saying all the content is there because I I apologize for saying you're wrong
[00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:22.620]   Obviously, you know you're talking about but I had read is that only a few things would be
[00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:26.860]   From the paper would be on apple news. You're saying it's all there. It's just not surfaced
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:30.460]   Exactly. So the journal zone reporting on it said
[00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:33.020]   Basically, so they should know right?
[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:34.460]   Almost all
[00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:38.300]   Or virtually all so who knows there's probably some stuff that isn't on there
[00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:40.860]   But most of it is you just won't be able to find it
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:46.300]   I don't know if you've tried the search, but it's terrible and there you can't browse anything
[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:48.860]   You can't you can't say hey show me everything from the journal
[00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:55.740]   So you're only going to see the stuff that apples at it. I see highlight right and that'll be just the general
[00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:56.780]   That's a good offer
[00:56:56.780 --> 00:57:00.300]   That's a good deal for the journal because the journal is going to get basically plugs
[00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:04.380]   On the front page of apple news, but if you really want to see more
[00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:10.540]   You're gonna have to go to the site. You're gonna have to eat it. It's also interesting that the journal is hiring 50 people
[00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:17.980]   And they tied it to this launch so they said being part of news plus they're gonna hire 50 people
[00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:23.580]   What just to report on things some of which might actually be exclusive to news plus
[00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:31.660]   Non-business related. I just find that fascinating. It feels like a daily kind of thing like merduck is just what the hell
[00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:33.740]   Apples really big
[00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:35.980]   Let's just hire a bunch of journal. This is though
[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:40.940]   That's that stupid money. I was talking about if you make enough money from another source say fox
[00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:46.380]   You can play with it. You've got you know, you got the dance side
[00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:53.500]   I mean, I would do that if you know in a little way, you know, if I if I had $100 a month discretionary income
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:59.580]   I wouldn't care and for for five or ten. Yeah for rubric. It's probably the equivalent of $100 a month
[00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:03.980]   It's like well, let's do so what I'll buy a lot of reason what the hell
[00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:11.180]   I think the long-term risk is that if people figure it out and they do start getting more journal content
[00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:16.940]   Some of them could decide well stop subscribe. That's the next that's the golden goose
[00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:21.900]   Which is for blogs like nine to five Mac and then apple and cider to start publishing the tricks
[00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:26.460]   To searching apple news and getting wall street journal articles
[00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:31.340]   But there is no in there are no inbound links, right? You can't know no
[00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:34.940]   You have to classic apple product. It is a wall
[00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:38.380]   Anything nothing goes in anything. Nothing goes out
[00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:45.660]   It's literally just like a newsstand on your tablet. Yeah, and it's it's a
[00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:48.540]   it's interesting to me sort of
[00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:52.380]   In an academic way that they they play so much emphasis on
[00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:58.540]   No algorithms no data. No privacy. We don't know anything about you. We don't know what you read
[00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:02.860]   We don't know where you live. That's apple and I and I actually had somebody say
[00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:05.500]   I like recommendations
[00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:09.660]   Made by companies that know me and what I read so apple's basically saying
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:15.100]   We're just gonna choose a bunch of stuff. We have no idea whether you're gonna be interested in it because we literally don't know you
[00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:16.620]   So I care
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:18.860]   I tried to get rid of people magazine in my
[00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:22.060]   My apple news plus a very retro approach, right?
[00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:26.460]   It's like the guy at the newsstand and the people that put the newspaper together didn't know you either
[00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:31.340]   Right and you would think it's really that bad though. Matthew from a from a anonymous
[00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:37.900]   Don't they are they using some algorithms to recommend based on what you're doing on device algorithms?
[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:39.260]   Yeah
[00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:41.020]   So
[00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:43.900]   They said they will not track what you read right?
[00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:51.260]   Well, they they they will not track what mean on the server side and apple but on the device your phone your phone's tracking you
[00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:53.900]   Yeah, I'm not telling anybody
[00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:56.140]   Well, I'm just not gonna get random. I have to say
[00:59:56.140 --> 01:00:00.380]   as a as a regular user of apple news because I try it all the time
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:04.220]   It's not doing a great job of figuring out what I want to read
[01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:10.220]   At all and I have to say it's a great it is like a little go into the newsstand and reading through random
[01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:12.940]   Like that which is the serendipity that could be fun
[01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:15.660]   Sure, and that's that definitely has value
[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:20.700]   But I think things like flip board and and even facebook god love them who do
[01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:26.300]   Kind of recommendations every now and then there is something that is interesting that you would not have found otherwise
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:31.660]   So now you're counting on apples editors who nobody knows how many of them there are who they are
[01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:34.220]   To sort of select those things for you
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:36.940]   um
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:43.340]   I've been asking every show since the apple event every panel
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:50.300]   Do you use apple really is selling this privacy right and it's it's it's obviously
[01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:57.340]   In-contrariness to google and facebook right well they they snoop on you they collect data
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:01.340]   But we promise we won't and they say that as a selling point
[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:06.140]   And of course in the tech press we're very aware of all this we see it as a selling point
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:08.940]   My question that I ask every panel I'll ask you guys this
[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:15.340]   Do real people care do they I mean I know they're aware of it because we've been hammering this for years
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:21.500]   But to honestly to people when you go out in the world say oh, I'm gonna choose apple because they're they stand for privacy
[01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:28.460]   So in my experience no, yeah, I've never heard that from anyone
[01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:30.620]   um
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:37.500]   In the list of reasons why people say they choose apple. Yeah, that does not appear right like I like the gross gold cases
[01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:42.220]   Is probably number one. Yeah, which message is number two?
[01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:49.260]   No one has ever mentioned privacy there is I think a somewhat subliminal awareness of security right like people think
[01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:51.900]   Oh, I don't want to use an android phone because I hear apple phones are safer
[01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:58.540]   But not more private. I have not heard that not even heard. Yeah, no one has actually specifically mentioned it
[01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:03.580]   I don't really hear the privacy as a selling factor either. I do hear a lot about the security
[01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:10.220]   Obviously writing about google devices. I get my case on comment there. You're buying spyware because google spy and so on
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:16.300]   But the privacy factor. I don't think normals really
[01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:19.340]   care, you know actively
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:22.620]   I don't even have people talking to me about
[01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:28.380]   Oh, there was a huge leak and all these passwords like I just don't think a lot of that stuff
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:37.260]   Can it's it's complicated. I just don't think it affects people in their daily lives unless they get hacked or unless you know, they get fished somehow
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:39.900]   um
[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:41.900]   I did have one conversation about apple and
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:47.500]   Security or privacy and I pointed out that they're what to me is just a massive
[01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:50.620]   hypocrisy the way they treat users in china
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:58.220]   Um, so they're happy to protect your data and not snoop and so on if you're not in china, but
[01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:02.860]   In china, they pretty much do whatever the government tells them to do right so
[01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:05.580]   All of that data is available
[01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:10.940]   Even I think encryption keys are stored locally. Yeah, the keys are stored in china as well. Yeah
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:14.300]   So that's that's another another issue
[01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:19.100]   mr. Pichai goes to washington
[01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:26.140]   Uh and and the president tweeted about it. He met with uh, donald trump in dc
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:29.900]   Today, I think right or was it yesterday
[01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:33.180]   uh trump said that uh he tweeted
[01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:36.940]   That sooner pichai met with him and is obviously doing quite well
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:41.660]   That's nice. That's nice. I like to get that inside that look
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:46.940]   What does that mean though? Obviously, what does he mean? Yeah, it's kind of implies there's something the ferry is right
[01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:49.820]   Googles doing well
[01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:56.460]   You guys don't have a gm don't have a job, but googles doing a nine. I don't think that's what he was he wearing the diamond rollax again or
[01:03:56.460 --> 01:04:03.660]   Like what does he mean for trump? He was wearing nice shoes. He had good expensive shoes. He's doing quite well
[01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:07.900]   Uh, this is also from the twitter. He stated strongly
[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:12.220]   That he is totally committed to the us military not the chinese military
[01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:16.540]   In case you were like a freaking toddlers writing this
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:18.060]   uh
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:20.060]   also discussed political fairness
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:23.820]   And that it various things that google can do for our country
[01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:27.420]   Meeting ended very well
[01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:29.820]   Like facial reckoning ended good
[01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:32.220]   um
[01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:37.740]   On on google's part, uh, spoke spurson said we're pleased to have productive conversations with the president
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:43.100]   About an shouldn't you capitalize president? Let me ask you journalists this guys is it uh lowercase p
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:46.540]   It's lowercase p unless you're referring to him
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:51.500]   In his official capacity like president donald trump then his capital
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:53.660]   Then the president
[01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:59.980]   Uh about investing in the future of the american workforce the growing the growth of emerging technologies and our ongoing commitment
[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:02.300]   To working with the us government
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:07.020]   Earlier, uh, I guess this month trump had accused google of helping china and their military
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:13.500]   So sinner said I just want you to know we like the us military we prefer the us military
[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:16.700]   Um
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:20.700]   In case you hadn't figured that out already. Yeah, and then of course, uh
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:27.660]   trump and republicans have accused all social media including google of having a bias towards democrats
[01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:33.100]   Uh trump tweeted earlier this month google is helping china and their military, but not the us terrible
[01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:37.820]   The good news is they helped crooked hillary clinton and not trump and how did that turn out?
[01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:41.900]   Like a freaking toddler. It's just like then okay, um
[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:45.420]   Yay, nay, nay, nay, nay. How did that turn out?
[01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:47.420]   um
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:50.860]   Yeah, so yeah, so I can kind of read between the lines
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:52.780]   google
[01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:55.580]   Of course, uh because uh their engineers
[01:05:55.580 --> 01:06:02.940]   Kind of rose up decided to decline to do any work for the militaries of was it the
[01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.500]   Jedi, uh
[01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:09.100]   They didn't bid for jedi which microsoft has done as well as oracle
[01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:10.860]   um
[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:13.900]   Microsoft's ceo satin and della said
[01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:15.500]   Uh
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:23.100]   Even though he was also getting some heat from engineers at microsoft said well work, you know, we've always done contract work for any
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:27.180]   Uh, you know, what did he say legally elected government democratically elected government?
[01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:32.540]   And it's patriotic. I think jeff bezo said because they are bidding for as well. It's patriotic
[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:35.580]   To support the military. What what are you talking about?
[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:38.140]   Um google did decline
[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:41.020]   But I think google did it not because they didn't want the money or they didn't
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:45.340]   Think they weren't patriotic, but but honestly you got to keep your engineers happy
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:51.900]   And if a lot of engineers are saying whatever you do don't sell our work for the military
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:56.460]   You kind of don't have a lot of choice. It's not like you can fire them all
[01:06:56.460 --> 01:07:00.860]   Yeah, it was project naven too, wasn't it naven? Yeah, yeah
[01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:04.300]   To use a i to get to help drones
[01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:11.020]   Right, wrong that was what it was. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yep. Face recognition. Yeah, they were in the running for jedi too. Yeah
[01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:13.820]   so that's why
[01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:14.380]   uh
[01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:18.060]   Sundar pachai had to go to the white house and and tell the president
[01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:22.460]   That we are committed to the us military not not the chinese military
[01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:27.100]   The great thing about president trump is
[01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:31.740]   You can just go in there. You can pat him on the back of him a party handshakes and no no no
[01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:37.820]   We love you and that's and then he believes it. Yeah, it's so it's oh, okay. Never mind forget
[01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:40.460]   forget what I said forget that the
[01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:47.260]   Chairman the joint chiefs of staff told the senate that google was working directly or indirectly counter to us interest forget that
[01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:51.740]   But you know an hour and a half from now. He's just gonna say no i know i know right
[01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:58.460]   Do you it must be hard for these ceos you could see tim cook almost literally grinding his teeth
[01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:04.300]   Sitting there next to the frame for the watch. Yeah, but you have to do this
[01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:07.020]   You have to kiss the ring you can't not go
[01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:15.180]   And especially now i think google facebook apple microsoft amazon all understand that they are deep doo-doo
[01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:18.300]   And they and they've got to appease the us government
[01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:23.420]   Because there's a big anti-trust hammer. Oh, yeah, just sort of waiting. Oh, yeah
[01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:29.260]   And you know at this point they might actually prefer trump to somebody like elizabeth warren who wants to bring them up
[01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:31.260]   uh
[01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:34.940]   Remember the eu
[01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:39.740]   We were talking about them earlier. Remember the fact that they find uh google
[01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:42.700]   1 and a half billion euros
[01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:47.580]   For monopolistic behavior
[01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:55.260]   Yeah, turns out the same day google's price went up 2% adding 17 billion dollars
[01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:58.140]   market value
[01:08:58.140 --> 01:08:59.900]   10 times
[01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:04.220]   The amount they were fined by the european commission. Yeah, so
[01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:07.500]   This is why gloogles glad to pay that
[01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:09.260]   Yep
[01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:11.260]   A good day on the street
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:14.940]   But then there's then there's the guy i love this
[01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:18.060]   Who uh who made?
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:23.180]   How many hundred twenty two million hundred twenty two million dollars i love that story sending
[01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:27.500]   phony bills to facebook and google which they just paid
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:35.340]   Now you get caught that one the shad and froyda was pretty was pretty strong
[01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:41.980]   Yeah, I mean it was total fraud he pretended to be a company that they actually bought her and were from he just sent him in
[01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:46.060]   Voice love the fact. Yeah, they wouldn't just pay them. Yeah, the enlisted were accompanied by
[01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:53.180]   Forged invoices contracts and letters that falsely appear to be executed in signed by executives and agents of the victim companies facebook and google
[01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:57.180]   And which bore false corporate stamps and boss with the victims companies names
[01:09:57.180 --> 01:10:02.780]   To be submitted to banks in support of the large volume of funds that were fraudulent he transmitted
[01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:06.220]   via wire transfer he's he's in lithuania
[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:08.460]   Yeah
[01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:15.180]   No one should part is he's only he's only agreed to give back 50 million he made so that was like 72 million
[01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:18.540]   Yeah, what's gonna happen on that?
[01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:25.740]   Well, probably they can't find it because apparently he scrolled cash away in cypress lithuania hongreese lavaki and latvia
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:32.140]   He does face up to 30 years in prison. True. So that's the down. So i'm we're not recommending this
[01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:38.940]   Yeah, but there was a there was a company actually in canada that used a similar strategy didn't create
[01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:42.780]   A real company name but would send out fake invoices
[01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:45.660]   And that I think the name of the company was something generic like
[01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:50.380]   telecom services and there was a picture of a phone and then it would
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:56.860]   Normal looking invoice and right at the bottom in tiny print. It said this is not an invoice. Oh, and so
[01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:59.660]   So he would send it to
[01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:05.980]   You know old ladies and like people on mailing lists and and to some companies and they would just pay because they're like, oh, okay
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:12.060]   I guess we used some telecom services and he would make it for such small amounts that nobody would
[01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:14.860]   Think this happens all the time
[01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:18.700]   Yeah, I mean, I'm not convinced we wouldn't fall for such a thing
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:23.340]   I know. I mean we have a full-time bookkeeper we late my
[01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:25.260]   You know
[01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:29.420]   CFO and with long time experiences a controller. I'm gonna have to ask her
[01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:33.260]   If somebody were you know, I let's just
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:36.780]   Matthew would you send us an invoice and see if we pay it
[01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:41.500]   Services rendered services rendered make up a good name make it in canada
[01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:46.620]   I thought it was interesting this guy's company was actually registered. I think in Lithuania
[01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:53.820]   But the company he pretended to be I don't think it even had business in Lithuania. So I guess nobody even noticed
[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:59.900]   I don't think it would work with us because we're not that big and we kind of know we're spending money
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:06.940]   You got to figure googles got hundreds of invoices a day, right? At least oh yeah thousands
[01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:08.940]   Yeah
[01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:15.260]   Is this why I have four electric bills this
[01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:23.900]   See to be honest the reason I kind of laugh is because I would I could see myself doing that paying bills sitting down you stick sit down a
[01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:29.420]   Pilot and pills. I guess pay you write checks. This is I remember writing check you just write checks for everybody
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:32.460]   Like it. Hope they don't cut off the electricity and nail it
[01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:38.540]   The case of the Lithuanian lapser
[01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:45.180]   Let's take a little break when we come back. I want to talk about chrome 73 kevin toful is here from about chrome books.com
[01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:47.180]   He has much to say about the new
[01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:49.980]   Chrome OS 73
[01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:53.660]   Including features not mentioned by the big goog
[01:12:53.660 --> 01:13:01.740]   Matthew ingrum is also here. He is the chief digital writer at the columbia journalism review at cjr.org
[01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:08.460]   And it's great to have you guys. It's fun. It's just for me. It's like just sitting down and chatting with my old buddy
[01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:14.140]   About all the silly stuff happening today chatting shoe chatting shoe
[01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:18.620]   Um, we're it where is that?
[01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:21.180]   It's somewhere in northern Ontario
[01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:25.660]   You know somewhere in northern Ontario sound like
[01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:30.460]   Some that sounds like a Neil young song actually. Yeah. Yeah, it is
[01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:32.460]   Somewhere in northern
[01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:37.980]   Our show today brought to you by cap terra whether you're somewhere in northern Ontario
[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:42.540]   Or in the heart of the city in the big apple or the big orange
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:46.300]   You got a business you need business software and I have to say
[01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:51.420]   Um, I remember working when I first started working at a camp bure in seif or just going to 1984
[01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:54.460]   So I mean pcs were out max were outs
[01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:58.780]   Uh, and I was the music director and I went into the music office
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:01.500]   To put together the playlists
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:07.420]   For the dj's and they said there's your computer that generates a playlist. It was a it was a pdp 11
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:13.180]   And it and it was running software off a big eight inch floppy eight and a half inch floppy
[01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:15.820]   And they said here's the software
[01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:18.620]   1984 you put this floppy in
[01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:22.300]   You close the thing and you push the button. It would go the head would go
[01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:27.980]   It would spit out a playlist
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:31.740]   The very first thing I did was break that
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:36.780]   I don't know what happened, but the floppy stopped working one day shortly after I was employed
[01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:41.260]   And we managed to get something a little more modern and that's when we had to search for a little more modern software
[01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:45.660]   I hope you're not in a situation where you're using software design for an ed Explorer 8
[01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:51.660]   But if you are can I point you to cap terra cap t-e-r-r-a
[01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:54.780]   The place to find modern

[01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:19.260]   Narrow it down by checking boxes saying it has to do this. It shouldn't do this
[01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:22.940]   I want it to be like this you can make a comparison chart

[01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:41.580]   Simplify
[01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:48.380]   So uh chromos 73 is now stable and arriving on chromebooks. It's way
[01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:55.340]   Sometimes I don't know that there's an update. How will I know that there's an update uh kevin toffle
[01:16:55.340 --> 01:16:59.900]   So you you've got the chrome release this blog which you're showing on the screen right now
[01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:05.580]   Which I when I was especially when I was at google I would say guys better release notes
[01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:09.500]   And they're slowly doing that because before it used to be we've got a new release
[01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:14.540]   You know check for updates and they never tell you what was in it. So at least we're getting bullet points now
[01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:20.060]   But your chromebooks should automatically show a notification at the bottom right system tray
[01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:24.060]   It's not immediately obvious. It's like a little funny little notification, right?
[01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:29.020]   Correct correct and the thing is and a lot of people don't realize this even though chromewests
[01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:33.820]   Is announced when a stable channel update is available like it was on monday this week
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:40.700]   It's a stage rollout and and they actually I think they do it to 5 of users were a day than another 10
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:42.860]   They um
[01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:49.020]   So my tip of the week of one of two actually will be to tell you or show you a place that you can bookmark
[01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:53.900]   And see if your device is ready to get the update because you can always manually check for updates
[01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:58.060]   And in most cases on an update like this you need to
[01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:00.940]   Restart this system, right?
[01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:04.940]   Well, that's correct in a yes technically and and
[01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:11.260]   One of the reasons chrome is very quick with updates for actually applying them is and I don't know if the very very realizes
[01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:18.940]   So quickly go through it. There's actually two system partitions on every chromebook one is the active chromo s that you're using
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:26.940]   And there's a backup of the last version and what happens is the update gets downloaded and is installed to the partition not in use
[01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:29.420]   when you reboot
[01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:35.900]   It then boots into the new one and therefore everything seamlessly updated because it already is updated if that makes sense
[01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:42.940]   If you were if you were to suggest to somebody who wasn't super wealthy or super techie to get a chromebook
[01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:45.660]   Which one would you suggest?
[01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:48.140]   Well, the first thing I would ask them is what are they going to use it for?
[01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:54.060]   And if it's just basic browsing and maybe an occasional android app
[01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:59.260]   Geez some of the new aces are like the 514 250 dollars
[01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:06.140]   Something something in that range. I mean there's a they're almost all the same Matthew at that price point in terms of the specs
[01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:12.700]   It comes down to like which one might have a better keyboard for you, you know that you like or or something to that effect
[01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:21.420]   There's just so many so many low and choices and really it's that they're in a sense all the same just minor differences at that point
[01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:23.500]   right
[01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:28.460]   This is a big update though, right? I mean I mean it's a not a point update
[01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:33.900]   Correct. This is a full release. We were all on 72 points something up to this point
[01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:37.260]   And in fact my pixel slate is still on 72
[01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:39.580]   Uh, I did not get it yet and again
[01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:43.820]   I'll I'll share on how you can find out if your device has it and when it's available
[01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:45.100]   Um
[01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:50.700]   All of the all the major releases are big updates. It's again. It gets back to they don't really tell you what's in them
[01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:54.940]   and I think that's a very very bad choice from a user experience because
[01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:59.020]   You know, we've got the bullet list that we had on the screen before and there's a great
[01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:05.340]   Bits, but I've been tracking all the other things and they didn't mention them there and
[01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:08.780]   I mean, I I probably found six seven
[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:14.780]   Large features that are very impactful. Well run run through. I wouldn't name. Why wouldn't they mention them?
[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:17.420]   You know
[01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:22.140]   I think it's more of a cultural thing with release notes than anything else method. I don't think it's to diminish
[01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:27.340]   Any of the features. I think it's you know, some of them are tied directly to bugs
[01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:32.140]   So they know that a lot of people you know want to for example be able to map
[01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:37.020]   Google drive in linux for example, maybe not a lot of people do but whatever
[01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:40.220]   There was a lot of folks following that but I do can see
[01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:42.060]   There you go
[01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:45.900]   You can see all the open bugs and you can star them and I have a feeling the more stars something
[01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:49.820]   Yes, which gets you on an email list for the updates of of that particular bug
[01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:54.300]   Probably has a lot to do with what they highlight and what they don't got it
[01:20:54.300 --> 01:21:03.020]   There is one bullet point that has concerned some people and it's this one report additional telemetry data for chromo s devices
[01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:08.300]   Well, okay, and I understand that I guess I would say
[01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:13.820]   But well, I just point out that this is exactly the phrase Microsoft uses
[01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:17.020]   And then Microsoft windows get gets a lot of heat for
[01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:20.380]   Selling or sending data back to the home office
[01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:25.260]   Microsoft will say and I bet google will say we use that telemetry to make our products better
[01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:29.980]   We said know what's going wrong and know what you use how you're using it. Is that what this is?
[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:35.900]   That's a that's exactly what it is. It's nothing to my knowledge. That's nefarious or data that's being sold
[01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:38.380]   It is in fact you can
[01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:44.140]   Well, you probably wouldn't I go through the the actual code commits and you can see that they are generating
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:48.540]   Data from some of these after they roll out beta bits and things and they're like, let's see
[01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:50.940]   Is this actually fixing the problem or is it not?
[01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:56.380]   So they they have lots of histogram type data that they generate and send back to the mothership
[01:21:56.380 --> 01:22:04.300]   But to my knowledge, it's it's really all to make the product better and see that the work they're doing is actually doing what they want to do
[01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:05.580]   right
[01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:10.860]   So are there what are the biggest features that you think people will be excited about and especially any features that
[01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:14.940]   People don't know about that aren't listed on that very sure bullet list
[01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:22.140]   Yeah, so um, I mean we talked earlier about the the really bad animations for example on the seller on slate and and actually
[01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:27.260]   It wasn't smooth on any of the devices, but there are many transition
[01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:33.020]   Animation fixes in this version. I have not been able to test them unstable because I don't have it yet
[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:35.820]   But I have been testing it in dev and beta and I've seen an improvement
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:37.260]   So that's always a plus
[01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:39.740]   I know a lot of people bought this as a tablet and
[01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:45.420]   I still kind of question that because it's really a Chromebook in a different form factor, but that's a whole mother one other issue
[01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:50.700]   Um enterprises should be pretty happy because they're getting in fact google mentioned on the bullet point something about um
[01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:52.220]   uh
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:57.740]   printer mapping and so on and that's obviously big in enterprises where they still print but they're also getting
[01:22:57.740 --> 01:23:05.260]   uh, crostini and the reason they couldn't have it before is because there was no enterprise policy built into the chrome administration management
[01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:11.820]   So they added the tool to manage that and so that way if you're in uh, you know, you're in a an enterprise and
[01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:18.460]   You have managed devices. They can actually be managed to have cornie christian. You're not maybe they don't want you using linux for
[01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:24.460]   Whatever reason. I don't know. Um, one of the other really nice ones that will is more universal
[01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:28.220]   um, the native pdf annotation support
[01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:33.580]   Which is fantastic because even if you don't have a device with a pen if you have a touch screen device
[01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:36.700]   You could mark up a pdf sign your name, etc
[01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:40.860]   Didn't work for fields feeling in fields when I tested but I know they're working on that
[01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:47.180]   Um, but I know a lot of people are like yeah, I got this pdf and I like to do is print it or look at it and that kind of sucks
[01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:50.380]   so so that's a nice fix and uh
[01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:54.700]   So you don't really need a third party pdf utility. I use commie
[01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:59.500]   Uh in chrome as a extension for pdfs. It sounds like I don't need it on chrome books
[01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:06.780]   Well, I mean you could still use it. There's plenty of great android apps for example and extensions like you said lio that that let you do that
[01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:08.140]   They're not going away
[01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:12.780]   But no the pdf annotation is built in and native and if it does enough of what you need to do
[01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:17.180]   There's no need to you know, junk up your hard drive with extra stuff. So
[01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:22.540]   About I tell you how you found out about this stuff just go to about chrome books.com
[01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:26.460]   Kevin could be obsessive about this. I've heard of that
[01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:30.940]   Everything you'd ever want to know it's right there
[01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:39.660]   Some more leaks about google's new low priced pixel threes the pixel three a and three a excel
[01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:42.540]   Um, they'll be available
[01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:50.540]   In iris color in addition to black and white. I'm not sure what iris is. Is that a bluish? This is according to wind future
[01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:52.860]   blue violet color
[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:57.260]   Uh, we also uh think that pricing is going to be
[01:24:58.220 --> 01:25:00.940]   Around 500 bucks for the 64 gigabit
[01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:07.740]   Gigabyte, I'm sorry pixel three a and the excel a little bit higher. So it's about 200
[01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:11.740]   To $300 less actually 350 less
[01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:17.660]   Than the big boys although google seems to be offering some discount slightly on the pixel
[01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:20.620]   excel three excel and the three
[01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:26.460]   Uh previous rumors said the pixel three a and three excel would launch it for rizin in the spring
[01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:31.420]   Which we're in right now. So keep your eye peeled if you want a low price pixel three
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:38.700]   I would grab that $300 off that they're doing right now at google. That's right. I mean and the chrome books are a deal too, right?
[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:41.420]   Oh, that's right through march 28th
[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:43.740]   The pixel books are all $200 off
[01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:50.060]   So 799 for the the base model which wasn't a seller honor and m3. I mean that was a core i5 where they giga ram nice
[01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:53.500]   And $200 off pixel three and three excel right now
[01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:57.420]   Yeah, I mean, I'm very happy with my pixel three. I had a
[01:25:57.420 --> 01:26:01.740]   A period of time when something weird was going on and then it just got fixed by you know
[01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:06.140]   I don't know if it was an update or somehow but i've been very happy, but I read boy do I read the
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:09.100]   people with speaker issues still and
[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:15.980]   Screen issues and all sorts of stuff. I don't know what the qc usually you'd expect
[01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:23.260]   That after phones been out for six months. It's going to be a pretty consistent product and that seems like it's getting less consistent not more consistent
[01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:26.140]   so
[01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:29.980]   I'm much I have I have in the past recommended of pixel three
[01:26:29.980 --> 01:26:35.180]   And I used it for a long time, but i'm not sure I would still recommend it especially in light of these new
[01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:38.140]   Samsung s10s which are really good
[01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:41.100]   uh
[01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:45.020]   YouTube has decided uh not to do scripted
[01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:50.220]   Series or maybe it is doing scripted series. It's kind of hard to tell
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:56.620]   They deny now that they're canning scripted series and plan to launch an ad supported
[01:26:56.620 --> 01:27:02.700]   uh list of scripted series that bloomberg had said that youtube had stopped accepting pitches
[01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:05.740]   um
[01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:13.420]   Google did confirm it plans a big focus on paid subscriptions by introducing an ad supported slate that will include new and existing series
[01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:15.980]   In the coming weeks. This is according to
[01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:20.380]   Tech crunch. This is in addition to youtube premium. This is something new
[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:23.180]   It feels like youtube's trying to
[01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:28.300]   Have it both ways. I mean bloomberg said it was basically bowing out of the
[01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:35.820]   Kind of expensive right scripted show race at the same time as apple announced. It's you know apple tv plus
[01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:38.540]   Right. So not that they're not still gonna do it
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:43.100]   And then I guess too many people said wait, what the hell you're not gonna
[01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:47.340]   Keep doing scripted shows so they had to say yes, we are
[01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:51.580]   But really but not they're not no
[01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:57.100]   Tech not the really expensive ones tech crunch says that uh, they are canceling two existing shows
[01:27:57.100 --> 01:28:01.260]   Which I haven't seen called origin and overthinking with kat and june
[01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:04.620]   I haven't seen either of those
[01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:09.980]   I'd better see karate kid. That is good. That was good. I liked it
[01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:15.660]   And that made this it was because of you somebody recommended on this show and I I watched it and it was really good
[01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:21.900]   It was a it's a reboot of the original karate kid. Okay. And I is mr. Miyagi back in it
[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:28.940]   Or is no it actually takes place in present day. It's the son of the karate ref ralph ralph machado son
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:32.380]   A neighbor
[01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:34.780]   Okay, yeah, but it's
[01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:37.340]   It is did he move around with it?
[01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:42.220]   Grown up versus oh the karate kid grown up is the new mr. Miyagi yes
[01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:48.860]   Okay, more importantly his opponent in the first oh, that's right is the new mr
[01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:56.060]   And the twist the twist is he's the good guy is that he's the good guy the bad guy in the karate kid movie
[01:28:56.060 --> 01:28:58.380]   Who got beat up at the end good guy?
[01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:03.340]   Turns out we didn't be completely misunderstood him and his motivations and he's the good guy
[01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:06.860]   Love it
[01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:09.580]   Did I can feel it? I think I confused
[01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:17.340]   No, um, do you have to pay to see that? I thought that was just part of youtube that is part of youtube tv
[01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:19.100]   Oh
[01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:21.820]   Okay, so you have to pay for youtube my promise
[01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:25.340]   I just get bills from google and I pay them
[01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:31.740]   So I I don't I think I subscribe to everything I might be wrong. I don't know
[01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:35.660]   Hey, matthew when you send an invoice to leo can you add my name?
[01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:41.340]   I think I'm paying for you tv.youtube.com
[01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:45.660]   I think I have youtube red what used to be called youtube red. I don't know what color it is now
[01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:49.580]   Uh, I think I have google music. I think I pay for it all
[01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:53.580]   But now there'll be another thing to pay for so just google to send me a bill, okay
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:58.540]   Facebook
[01:29:58.540 --> 01:30:02.380]   You know when you start a sentence with facebook just finish the sentence for me. Well, yeah
[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:04.620]   apologizes
[01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:06.460]   production
[01:30:06.460 --> 01:30:08.460]   And says it'll never do it again
[01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:12.780]   In this case is the passwords. Yes, it's this
[01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:16.460]   Yeah, just pick take your pick a story. This is from crabs on security
[01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:22.300]   Uh, fortunately the hundreds of millions of user passwords facebook stored in plaintext for years
[01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:25.980]   We're never visible as far as they know outside of facebook
[01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:30.380]   But any employee at facebook 20,000 of them had access
[01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:35.340]   To these and could have downloaded them facebook said the investigation so far
[01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:40.140]   Actually, this is a source a senior facebook employee who's familiar with the batter
[01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:43.740]   speaking to crabs on security and condition of an anem and anem and anemity
[01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:46.620]   Says that between 200 million and six
[01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:53.980]   600 million facebook users may have had their account passwords stored in plaintext and searchable by more than 20,000
[01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:56.540]   facebook employees
[01:30:57.500 --> 01:31:00.620]   plaintext user passwords dating back to 2012
[01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:07.740]   Logs showed some 2,000 engineers or developers made approximately 9 million internal queries
[01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:09.980]   for these
[01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:11.980]   passwords
[01:31:11.980 --> 01:31:16.700]   Uh facebook apologizes a set that will never happen again
[01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:24.060]   It's hard, you know computers are hard math is hard
[01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:28.300]   Mean it was only a couple hundred million. It's not a big deal
[01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:32.700]   Small percentage of our user base. Yeah, it's not like a billion or something
[01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:37.260]   And here's the good news facebook is banning white nationalism and white separatism
[01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:40.380]   Yeah, I thought that was interesting
[01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:46.860]   Uh, they'll be treated the same as white supremacy for a while facebook said no, that's just nationalism
[01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:48.460]   It's just separate
[01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:51.020]   Now they're saying well it kind of is like white supremacy
[01:31:51.660 --> 01:31:56.780]   And they're gonna I think they're trying to get out in front of yes potential legislation
[01:31:56.780 --> 01:32:01.580]   To show that they're being sort of proactive. That's the way it feels to me. Yeah
[01:32:01.580 --> 01:32:10.860]   We've been talking about pwn to own the big vancouver can seque west security conference
[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:15.260]   Uh went on the last few days steve kipson has a full report
[01:32:15.260 --> 01:32:20.300]   Uh, but firefox and edge both bowed to hackers
[01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:23.100]   So did a tesla
[01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:26.300]   So did saffari on mohavi
[01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:31.340]   It's uh, it's a bloodbath, but it's a good bloodbath because
[01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:36.780]   These exploits end up getting handed over to the company so they can fix them
[01:32:36.780 --> 01:32:41.900]   And the hackers get a nice reward. Although as many have pointed out
[01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:45.820]   Not as much as they would have gotten paid by bad guys
[01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:50.860]   Companies that sell these exploits to nation states and things like that like cerodium
[01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:55.100]   Uh, there was a uh escape from a virtual machine that would have been worth
[01:32:55.100 --> 01:32:57.500]   I think half a million on zerodium
[01:32:57.500 --> 01:33:02.540]   And uh the team florro acetate that made the big bucks on pwn to own
[01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:06.700]   Uh only got a fraction of that actually they did it all right over the three days
[01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:11.820]   I think they are in something like 345 thousand dollars and they the reason they call it pwn to own is when you pwn it
[01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:19.500]   You own it and one of the things they pwned was a model three tesla, which they drove off with their winnings and trunk of so that's good
[01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:26.940]   Free car free car man. I just I just love that one of the exploits they used was involved the calculator
[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:30.460]   integer under blow
[01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:35.500]   Well, I think that uh, I think that it didn't evolve the calculator the uh
[01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:38.780]   They call it popping calc
[01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:44.140]   Right. Yes way you show victory is the least open the calculator. Yeah, the least kind of
[01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:48.860]   Evil thing you can do which is have the calculator open up and that shows yes
[01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:55.420]   I own this machine and I all I'm going to do is launch the calculator so popping calc is is like cross-cut finish line
[01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:57.980]   Got it
[01:33:57.980 --> 01:34:04.700]   Now there's a big fjord going on we spent some time talking about this on uh security. I yesterday as well
[01:34:04.700 --> 01:34:11.340]   Uh with asus and asus computers, uh, and it's not clear exactly what happened
[01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:13.340]   um
[01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:14.540]   So
[01:34:14.540 --> 01:34:19.980]   I'll just give you the facts. This was discovered by the russian cyber security firm kaspersky lab
[01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:22.060]   And they said we saw this with our customers
[01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:25.340]   So it may be a mere fraction of the total infected computers
[01:34:25.340 --> 01:34:32.700]   But our customers got malware on their computers pushed to their computers by the asus software update tool
[01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:37.660]   And the software was signed with a legitimate asus digital certificate
[01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:42.140]   It what's weird though, and I think very telling is
[01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:49.820]   That the way the malware worked is would only activate on about 600 systems and it did that by mac address
[01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:52.700]   So the malware would get on your system in other words
[01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:57.980]   I mean while this is not a good thing and asus has pushed out fixes and if you have an asus laptop
[01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:59.420]   You should be aware of it
[01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:04.780]   But it probably didn't infect you because or affect you it didn't infect you but it didn't affect you because
[01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:07.340]   uh only 600 systems had the
[01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:13.020]   Right mac addresses and the malware searched for those and once on the system
[01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:19.900]   Uh, it would reach out to a command and control server and then install additional malware in the machine. This is but that's actually more disturbing
[01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:21.980]   How did they get those mac addresses?
[01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:28.620]   Well the ones they targeted yeah, so that's that's what steve and i spent some time talking about i'll give you my scenario
[01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:34.860]   Which steve said that very possible in fact i think asus now says it it was what we call an advanced persistent threat
[01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:41.900]   When a bad guy gets into your network like they did with sony pictures entertainment often they spend months they're just browsing around
[01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:46.780]   Looking for assets figuring out what's going on and one scenario would be
[01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:55.260]   Uh, let's say a nation state. Let's say north korea or souty arabia or israel or the nsa
[01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:57.660]   Uh had
[01:35:57.660 --> 01:36:00.060]   penetrated this maybe they knew that the
[01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:03.340]   an adversary's embassy had just taken order of
[01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:06.220]   600 asus laptops
[01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:11.980]   Uh and they knew the range because they'd been browsing around in the asus right customer records
[01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:15.660]   That would be a perfect opportunity for them to put
[01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:17.740]   uh to
[01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:23.980]   Make a modified payload so that asus wouldn't know that this update payload have been modified would sign it with their certificate
[01:36:23.980 --> 01:36:29.500]   And push it out and then it would go look for those particular computers and that put spyware on there
[01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:33.900]   So which means they were in asus's systems for a good long time
[01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:41.580]   Yeah, and I think that is uh since the security now show I think that uh asus has said that that it was an advanced persistent threat
[01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:45.900]   Um and that kind of confirms that scenario
[01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:52.700]   Yeah, nobody wants to admit that and that's the other reason that asus uh took a while to confirm it
[01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:55.820]   um
[01:36:55.820 --> 01:36:59.500]   It is bad and I bet you would happens all the time
[01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:03.020]   because these nation states
[01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:05.580]   are really good
[01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:08.380]   um
[01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:10.540]   at uh
[01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:11.900]   Langlow
[01:37:11.900 --> 01:37:14.540]   Well and but doing spearfishing attacks right if so
[01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:20.140]   It's one thing to kind of put out a a virus that affects a lot of people ransomewares, you know, you want to
[01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:22.540]   cast a wide net
[01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:26.860]   And while that's not hard to do it's hard to predict the results of it, but if you're uh
[01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:33.500]   A hacker working for a government. You know what you want. You want let's say you want the israeli embassy
[01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:36.620]   In washington dc and your soudi arabia
[01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:40.780]   And you get some intelligence that said well, they just bought 600 new asus computers
[01:37:40.780 --> 01:37:43.740]   It isn't so far fetched to think that you would then
[01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:50.620]   Say, oh good. Let's go get into the asus network find those computers and and put something bad target them target them
[01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:54.860]   uh so asus um
[01:37:54.860 --> 01:38:01.100]   Had been targeted by advanced persistent threat attacks according to their press release
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:08.380]   And uh, that's typically government hackers or highly but rarely highly organized criminal groups
[01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:15.660]   A small number of devices according to asus have been implanted with malicious code through a sophisticated attack on our live update servers
[01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:20.220]   In an attempt to target a very small and specific user group
[01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:27.260]   asus customer service has been reaching out to affected users are providing assistance to ensure that the security risks are removed
[01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:29.820]   uh, they also
[01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:38.700]   Put out an update to prevent this because spursky dubbed the malware shadow hammer because you got to have a good name
[01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:46.140]   We know or know we know that yeah, and uh, they said that 57 000 of their customers had it
[01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:50.060]   Um, I think that mother board then went to semantic
[01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:54.060]   Which confirmed that they had seen it on their customers computers as well
[01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:57.100]   Um
[01:38:57.100 --> 01:39:00.540]   So anyway just an update on that and the latest go ahead
[01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:04.300]   I kind of wonder and maybe I shouldn't be worried about this but
[01:39:04.300 --> 01:39:07.180]   We never hear about like the
[01:39:07.180 --> 01:39:11.980]   attacks or hacks on the supply chain when these things are being built that either
[01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:14.380]   Are we just don't hear them? No
[01:39:14.380 --> 01:39:19.340]   So there was one there was one report about i'm trying to remember
[01:39:19.340 --> 01:39:24.460]   If it was the fbi they were they were grabbing
[01:39:24.460 --> 01:39:27.420]   Products routers, I think
[01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:29.660]   In transit to customers
[01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:31.980]   And diverting them and then installing
[01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:38.700]   Yeah, and snowed one of the snowed in leaks showed that there was a supply chain in tach
[01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:42.460]   uh by the uh cia or was he
[01:39:42.460 --> 01:39:45.660]   Or maybe it was the nsa. I think was the nsa
[01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:52.220]   That involved modifying ethernet adapters in right in computers in transit so you do it in transit
[01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:56.220]   You don't do it at the manufacturer. You do you know you get the mail truck
[01:39:56.300 --> 01:39:58.780]   You tour the truck detour it and you make those
[01:39:58.780 --> 01:40:03.900]   Changes, I think they're hard to detect this is one of the reasons you don't hear about it
[01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:06.620]   A good supply chain attack is probably very hard to
[01:40:06.620 --> 01:40:15.900]   Detect well, and the guy the this guy from the center for internet excuse security who was a um nsa analyst said
[01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:20.140]   Supply chain attacks are in the quote a big deal category. Yeah
[01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:24.060]   And are a sign of someone who really knows what they're doing. Yeah
[01:40:24.860 --> 01:40:28.060]   We're gonna I convinced we'll hear a lot more of these kinds of attacks
[01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:31.580]   Uh that they're not really something individuals have to worry about
[01:40:31.580 --> 01:40:37.740]   But uh companies do unless you're targeted. Yeah, it democratic national committee should
[01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:44.620]   Uh, you know, uh, this is this is something that if you're a target exactly you do have to worry about and I think it's going to happen more and more
[01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:48.620]   And I think it's going to be part of it kind of a background cold war
[01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:51.340]   A cold cyber war that will be
[01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:56.540]   With us for many decades, maybe forever. I think that's why that bloomberg story
[01:40:56.540 --> 01:41:00.940]   Got so much attention in the one micro story. Yeah, they haven't been able to
[01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:06.460]   Sort of confirm, but yeah right on a motherboard tiny chip. Yeah
[01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:11.740]   Yeah, um, let's do the google
[01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:15.420]   Change log the google change log
[01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:21.900]   These are new things google is adding to make your life better than ever
[01:41:21.900 --> 01:41:26.220]   And google is now amping email and I have no idea
[01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:31.500]   Great
[01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:35.260]   So amp is that technology that they do for news organizations to make
[01:41:35.260 --> 01:41:43.740]   Uh web pages load faster actually it could be any web page my my uh website pages are amp because there's a word press dot com plug-in
[01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:47.660]   I just click the switch and it means it loads faster google
[01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:52.540]   Despite their denials. I think it improves the search results
[01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:56.860]   Uh, you know amp stuff shows up in an amp carousel and all that stuff
[01:41:56.860 --> 01:42:00.140]   Um amp for emails coming to gmail
[01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:03.900]   But other major email providers like yahoo mail
[01:42:03.900 --> 01:42:10.620]   Outlook and mail dot ru the russian email provider will also support amp emails
[01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:19.340]   It'll turn basic messages. Oh boy. This sounds so dangerous into a surface for actually getting things done
[01:42:19.340 --> 01:42:28.060]   Including hacking you and your computer. Oh my god. Well, the good news is the javascript here has to all come from google servers has to be approved
[01:42:28.060 --> 01:42:30.540]   JavaScript, um
[01:42:30.540 --> 01:42:36.940]   It sounds like interactive email, right? Basically it's amped websites in your email, right?
[01:42:36.940 --> 01:42:40.220]   Uh booking dot com is going to use it doodle
[01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:47.340]   Equid freshwooks next oil rooms Pinterest and red bus. I have no idea and despagar
[01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:52.380]   Uh if you build amp websites, it should be a simple thing to do
[01:42:52.380 --> 01:42:57.020]   It's standard html markup and that's by the way the one reason that I haven't completely
[01:42:57.020 --> 01:43:01.260]   You know deprecated amp and I don't like it
[01:43:01.260 --> 01:43:05.340]   But it's why I put up with it because it does degrade to regular html
[01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:07.740]   So you don't have to use an amp browser and you don't have to
[01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:10.380]   uh support it
[01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:15.020]   Um, so your email will continue to work in other words. It just won't be as pretty. It's kind of like html email
[01:43:15.020 --> 01:43:17.980]   It'll continue to work. It just won't be as pretty
[01:43:17.980 --> 01:43:23.180]   Uh apple music is on chromebooks. You'll be happy to know
[01:43:23.180 --> 01:43:29.420]   But probably not in the most bestest way because it's coming through the android app
[01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:36.380]   That's okay. That's better than nothing, right? Hey, it works for me. I don't know. Yeah
[01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:42.780]   Apple uh supporting apple music on chromebooks and and uh, that's just part of an android update
[01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:44.940]   That's coming out. So if you want apple music on your chromebook
[01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:47.580]   You can now install the android version of it
[01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:51.820]   If you used if this then that with gmail sad to say
[01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:54.220]   They're turning off almost all
[01:43:54.220 --> 01:43:59.260]   Actually google is turning off almost all if that's then that
[01:43:59.260 --> 01:44:02.700]   Support all you'll be able to do is send an email
[01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:05.900]   Or send yourself an email all the other if this then that
[01:44:06.460 --> 01:44:08.460]   uh triggers are are gone
[01:44:08.460 --> 01:44:11.580]   Which is a shame because I think a lot of people use this
[01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:17.500]   Yeah as a way to you know, I mean you could think of a lot of ways you might want to use email to notify yourself or
[01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:23.900]   You could have custom things happen in your house based on email, uh subject head or something. Yeah, right
[01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:26.380]   That's actually part of a
[01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:28.700]   I think twitter and facebook have both
[01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:32.460]   Shut off things that used to work with if this and that
[01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:37.500]   It's a shame. You moved on huge amount of functionality like I used to use it to do all sorts of things
[01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:41.340]   I think it's you know the excuse google gives is security
[01:44:41.340 --> 01:44:46.460]   That's part of tightening our females policies concerning third-party services
[01:44:46.460 --> 01:44:52.380]   Which is great, but the reality is it prevents you from doing things that are actually useful. Yeah
[01:44:52.380 --> 01:44:59.420]   If this then that said they've tried to find a way to become compliant with the new policies, but that it couldn't do so without major
[01:44:59.420 --> 01:45:01.340]   infrastructure
[01:45:01.340 --> 01:45:03.900]   Changes uh, apparently they're
[01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:06.700]   Unable to do or afford
[01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:12.620]   We've long had a good relationship with google if this then that writes and we support their efforts to improve privacy and security
[01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:19.660]   Though we understand this change may be a disappointment to the communities that use these applets. We look forward to working with google in the future
[01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:23.180]   To blah blah blah blah blah
[01:45:23.180 --> 01:45:27.420]   That's too bad. I I use if this then that a lot
[01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:32.220]   I also use something called zapier, which is a paid version of this if this than that
[01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:36.300]   But I presume if this then that can't do it zapier won't be able to do it either
[01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:40.380]   Um google podcasts
[01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:43.820]   finally
[01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:50.700]   Adding this is it was really a stripped down podcast app, but I think this could make it the podcast app of choice
[01:45:50.700 --> 01:45:54.940]   They're going to add add in episode search
[01:45:56.300 --> 01:46:02.860]   Means you without doing anything and we I should add because you know what we do podcast too
[01:46:02.860 --> 01:46:05.660]   Oh automatically have transcripts
[01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:13.900]   And that those transcripts probably computer generated, but you know google's good at that they're not terrible
[01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:16.300]   Will be searchable
[01:46:16.300 --> 01:46:19.980]   Which will make a big difference you'd be able to in theory in google podcasts
[01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:24.460]   Search for leo talking about google podcasts and jump right to this part of the show
[01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:27.660]   I hope that happens
[01:46:27.660 --> 01:46:31.180]   Apparently, but what's finding the EU thanks to article 11 or 17
[01:46:31.180 --> 01:46:34.700]   Not available in the EU
[01:46:34.700 --> 01:46:38.300]   And google podcasts is great unless you want to listen to the bbc
[01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:42.540]   Yeah, did you see that the bbc is pulled its podcasts from google?
[01:46:42.540 --> 01:46:46.300]   Um, they say they don't get enough information
[01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:50.860]   From google. Yeah, but what it feels like to me
[01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:56.700]   And I've only followed this sort of tangentially but what it looks like to me is bbc wants
[01:46:56.700 --> 01:46:59.900]   You to use bbc the bbc's podcast app
[01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:06.380]   And not google's podcast app. Yes, and so they're hoping that if you like the bbc you'll
[01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:10.700]   Go to their podcast app and if you could just get the bbc in google's app
[01:47:10.700 --> 01:47:13.740]   Then why would you use the bbc's in fact?
[01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:17.340]   BBC's been removing podcast from other third-party platforms too
[01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:20.380]   uh
[01:47:20.380 --> 01:47:24.140]   The license that they've asked google to sign
[01:47:24.140 --> 01:47:28.060]   requires google to supply user data to the bbc
[01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:31.180]   And since google will not do that
[01:47:31.180 --> 01:47:36.460]   Uh, this is you know, this is going to happen and i'm sad and we will never bow to this
[01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:39.500]   We certainly haven't done that
[01:47:39.500 --> 01:47:42.700]   but uh
[01:47:42.700 --> 01:47:46.620]   Because I support google not sharing information with us
[01:47:47.820 --> 01:47:51.260]   Uh, but I have a feeling that uh, what's going to happen is
[01:47:51.260 --> 01:47:53.500]   Advertisers want
[01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:57.740]   The same kind of data from podcast that they already get from other digital media
[01:47:57.740 --> 01:48:01.580]   You know the the facebook kind of data all the information about
[01:48:01.580 --> 01:48:04.380]   The ads who are seeing the ads that kind of thing
[01:48:04.380 --> 01:48:08.700]   Uh, we as podcasters don't offer that but it's just going to be a matter of time before
[01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:12.540]   Well, you see it was spotify and spotify's acquisitions
[01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:14.780]   Spotify
[01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:17.420]   If it's an exclusive to be really trying to lock down. Yeah
[01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:21.260]   If it's an exclusive podcast that you can only hear on spotify
[01:48:21.260 --> 01:48:24.540]   Dollars to donuts the spotify app is sending information
[01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:27.580]   About you and what you're listening to how long you listened
[01:48:27.580 --> 01:48:34.620]   Where you stopped listening is logging all that and sending it back to spotify and the reason they do that is because advertisers want that information
[01:48:34.620 --> 01:48:37.180]   Um advertisers always ask us
[01:48:37.180 --> 01:48:39.740]   Well, how do you know that people listen to the whole show?
[01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:44.060]   I mean they don't ask a newspaper. How do you know people read the whole newspaper?
[01:48:44.060 --> 01:48:46.620]   They want to ask a thing that
[01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:52.780]   The thing that struck me about the bbc thing is the bbc's it's a public entity. It's not a private corporation
[01:48:52.780 --> 01:48:59.420]   It's supposed to distribute its content as widely as you think but it's effectively saying no you can't
[01:48:59.420 --> 01:49:06.140]   Have it unless you use our app. Yeah, and and you get ready because that's going to happen more and more
[01:49:06.140 --> 01:49:10.620]   It's and it's a bad thing for podcasting and it's a bad thing for you as listeners
[01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:13.100]   And you have my promise
[01:49:13.180 --> 01:49:18.780]   That we won't do that you'll never see we never hear us say oh this podcast available on apples iTunes only
[01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:20.940]   That's or whatever that's not going to happen
[01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:25.340]   Um, we want to and it's not in our interest. We want our podcast to be heard everywhere
[01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:29.100]   We have an advantage. I have to say because we're so narrow in our niche
[01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:33.740]   That we have plenty of advertisers because they they know who you are
[01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:36.300]   Your geeks
[01:49:36.300 --> 01:49:38.060]   You're tech enthusiasts
[01:49:38.060 --> 01:49:44.540]   So it's not you know the average that's enough for advertisers and we and we do that survey once a year to find out how many men how many women
[01:49:44.540 --> 01:49:49.580]   You know how much education average income it's completely voluntary. We don't do any other data collection
[01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:54.860]   But so far that's been sufficient for the advertisers for our shows but I can see a day coming
[01:49:54.860 --> 01:49:57.340]   Where people won't buy a podcast ad?
[01:49:57.340 --> 01:50:01.580]   Uh like that like they buy regular media they'll buy it like they buy facebook ads
[01:50:01.580 --> 01:50:07.500]   We want 25 to 54 year old men who live in northern, California. Can you give us that?
[01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:10.460]   No, we sure
[01:50:10.460 --> 01:50:14.620]   You can't can't do it. There's another way around it, which is insertion advertising
[01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:17.420]   And we've toyed with that
[01:50:17.420 --> 01:50:20.300]   It's not our model because as you know our model is
[01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:26.860]   Uh personal personal like endorphments from the host and if you trust the host then you'll
[01:50:26.860 --> 01:50:30.940]   Trust the ad and mean a lot of insertion ads are terrible, right?
[01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:34.620]   Yeah, insertion is kind of what you get now with but tv and radio
[01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:40.060]   But the way podcast insertion would work you would have to again use a particular player
[01:50:40.060 --> 01:50:44.300]   To listen to show or you would actually the way it would work
[01:50:44.300 --> 01:50:50.780]   You could use your regular podcast player, but it would announce your location to the download source and as
[01:50:50.780 --> 01:50:53.420]   You're downloading the podcast
[01:50:53.420 --> 01:50:55.500]   the the
[01:50:55.500 --> 01:50:56.780]   the
[01:50:56.780 --> 01:50:59.260]   Host would insert ads in based on your location
[01:50:59.260 --> 01:51:02.620]   So dynamic. Yeah, it's dynamic insertion
[01:51:03.340 --> 01:51:07.100]   And there are companies that do this now and and we've actually we took a few uh
[01:51:07.100 --> 01:51:12.780]   Podcasts that didn't get advertising to see you how that worked. We had some issues with it and we stopped doing it
[01:51:12.780 --> 01:51:17.100]   Um, that's not tracking you well it is because of course any podcast
[01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:21.580]   Anytime you download a podcast our servers know your ip address
[01:51:21.580 --> 01:51:28.220]   Mm-hmm, but that's all that's all we know we don't use that but you could see how it could be used by somebody who wanted to insert ads
[01:51:28.220 --> 01:51:31.180]   um
[01:51:31.180 --> 01:51:33.020]   I don't know
[01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:35.500]   We don't do that. I can't say we would never do that
[01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:40.860]   but uh, I don't want I I'm a big believer and I know it mostly because I know our audience is in
[01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:45.100]   Not collecting information about you. I remember you and I talked about that
[01:51:45.100 --> 01:51:48.620]   NPR
[01:51:48.620 --> 01:51:52.460]   They came up with yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and they have their own app right
[01:51:52.460 --> 01:51:58.300]   And uh almost certainly that's part of the reason they bought an app. They bought pocket casts
[01:51:59.180 --> 01:52:03.260]   Uh, why well because I bet you anything they'd like to put that kind of tracking in it
[01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:07.580]   And we see a lot of pressure. There's a group called the IAB the interactive advertising bureau
[01:52:07.580 --> 01:52:12.220]   That is really a lobbying group for advertisers who buy digital
[01:52:12.220 --> 01:52:17.100]   They pretend to be listening to podcasters, but I think the IAB really is about advertisers
[01:52:17.100 --> 01:52:20.540]   And really what they are as a pressure group in my opinion
[01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:23.340]   to pressure podcasts
[01:52:23.340 --> 01:52:26.220]   to uh adhere to advertisers needs
[01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:28.220]   I
[01:52:28.220 --> 01:52:31.260]   I'm just glad that I'm close to retirement
[01:52:31.260 --> 01:52:37.340]   I can I can hold on for 10 more years, but after that. I like here's your show title
[01:52:37.340 --> 01:52:43.500]   That's right. Thank god. I'm close to some new features in google maps as we continue the change vlog
[01:52:43.500 --> 01:52:45.660]   I don't know. I got uh, sorry. I got off drifted off topic
[01:52:45.660 --> 01:52:48.060]   uh speed limits
[01:52:48.060 --> 01:52:53.340]   And if you have an electric vehicle also chargers on your map. Yeah, yeah
[01:52:55.100 --> 01:52:58.300]   So you'll know and easy to see business hours. I always like that
[01:52:58.300 --> 01:53:03.900]   So I know when they're open and google maps does something that remember that uh, um
[01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:06.940]   Was a little controversial
[01:53:06.940 --> 01:53:14.700]   When uh, what was swarmed at it, uh, not swarmed their parent company did it at south by south west google maps will tell you when it's busy
[01:53:14.700 --> 01:53:18.060]   At a place. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah
[01:53:18.060 --> 01:53:22.300]   Four square four square. Yeah, that that thing they only did for south by this year
[01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:25.020]   Where I would say oh, there's a lot of people at that bar right now
[01:53:25.020 --> 01:53:31.580]   I thought it was a little creepy because it's they know a lot about where people are because they're handy information
[01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:37.180]   Yeah, but it is handy if you if you want to go when it's less busy and that google maps also has that information on there
[01:53:37.180 --> 01:53:38.380]   Which is nice
[01:53:38.380 --> 01:53:45.500]   speed limit bit. I didn't realize it was so new I I uh drove 1,100 miles in two days last week to date in ohio to
[01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:52.220]   See my son devils play in the first four basketball game and I saw speed limits almost the entire way on google maps. I thought
[01:53:53.100 --> 01:53:55.500]   Yeah, I don't get out of the house much so I didn't know that was a new thing
[01:53:55.500 --> 01:54:01.260]   Wow, that's apparently a new thing. I've never seen some four. Yeah, I like it
[01:54:01.260 --> 01:54:07.260]   Yeah, it's great if it just shows up there, especially if you have android auto and it's showing up clearly on a
[01:54:07.260 --> 01:54:14.140]   Visible screen that's very handy because I mean otherwise you've got to make sure you look for the signs
[01:54:14.140 --> 01:54:16.940]   Yep
[01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:20.140]   Uh, I think that
[01:54:20.700 --> 01:54:23.500]   That is the google change log
[01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:31.580]   And I think that's pretty much our show
[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:36.860]   I would love to get if you wish a pick of the week from you kevin toful
[01:54:36.860 --> 01:54:41.740]   So I I promise to uh one is for everyone so i'll do that one first
[01:54:41.740 --> 01:54:48.700]   I have a link in the show notes to show you and this is great to bookmark if you're a chrome os user by the way
[01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:54.300]   Which version of chrome os is available for your individual device?
[01:54:54.300 --> 01:54:58.380]   Oh, well just by the name of the device not by you personally, but you know what I mean
[01:54:58.380 --> 01:55:04.380]   Uh, so on the right hand side they list all the device names on the left hand side. They have the device boards
[01:55:04.380 --> 01:55:09.100]   True geeks know what their board is. It's knock turn for the pixel slate for example
[01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:12.620]   Wow
[01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:15.820]   I'm great at parties too
[01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:18.860]   Yeah, so you can see in the blue
[01:55:18.860 --> 01:55:24.780]   That some of these guys have the new chrome os 73 already so there's your race your chrome book 15 for example
[01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:30.620]   It has it whereas the chrome book flip 101 does not so you can always see what's there
[01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:36.060]   And I believe those recovery links you can actually download and kind of roll back if you need it too
[01:55:36.060 --> 01:55:38.220]   But I don't think anybody really needs to do that
[01:55:38.220 --> 01:55:43.580]   So but yeah, so bookmark that if you're a chrome book user and you can see when something is released
[01:55:44.060 --> 01:55:46.220]   What version it is and when it's available for your device?
[01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:50.700]   Do you at parties to people come up to you with their chrome book and say hey kevin
[01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:53.740]   What what model did you take a look at this?
[01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:54.700]   Could you yeah?
[01:55:54.700 --> 01:55:57.580]   What is this knock turn? What is the motherboard on this?
[01:55:57.580 --> 01:55:59.980]   Yeah, I can I can actually do that
[01:55:59.980 --> 01:56:03.980]   Sometimes with my eyes closed if they tell me the name of the device or I can feel it
[01:56:03.980 --> 01:56:07.580]   It's the other thing
[01:56:07.580 --> 01:56:12.540]   Your wife carries me takes me around the neighborhood and so here he can figure out your chrome book in 10 minutes support
[01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:15.820]   Yeah, it's like right here a doctor
[01:56:15.820 --> 01:56:18.140]   Yeah, I got a pain right here
[01:56:18.140 --> 01:56:24.220]   How about an ungeeky just for leo pick although if anybody else enjoys this I would that be great
[01:56:24.220 --> 01:56:25.500]   Uh is it a Beatles pick?
[01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:28.220]   Of course it is. I believe it is
[01:56:28.220 --> 01:56:30.380]   Happy now
[01:56:30.380 --> 01:56:32.620]   The daily Beatles instagram account
[01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:35.580]   If if you're not even if you're not on instagram

[01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:42.060]   The videos and photos of some of these things are phenomenal things
[01:56:42.060 --> 01:56:49.020]   I've never seen before oh, this is really cool. Yeah, click it. It's awesome. There's john and uh, is that mik jagger?
[01:56:49.020 --> 01:56:51.500]   Yeah

[01:56:56.940 --> 01:57:03.820]   What
[01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:07.340]   So wack and then a little mick. What is this is from what?
[01:57:09.260 --> 01:57:11.260]   I don't know
[01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:15.260]   English people still a lot of stuff with fan clubs
[01:57:15.260 --> 01:57:20.780]   Yeah, they use to not that christmas record every year and stuff like that. I don't know if that's what this is
[01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:26.140]   Or i'm waiting for my christmas album. I never got one. It's the ro- it's the Rolling Stones
[01:57:26.140 --> 01:57:28.460]   Circuits, I don't know that's what it is
[01:57:28.460 --> 01:57:33.260]   But I mean for people who like their music, it's great and and for people who just think they were just
[01:57:33.260 --> 01:57:37.100]   Rock and roll stars and don't know how wacky funny these guys were
[01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:39.820]   Some of these interviews are absolutely hysterical
[01:57:39.820 --> 01:57:44.140]   All right, well, I got something for you if that's what you're gonna if that's what you want music
[01:57:44.140 --> 01:57:46.700]   Oh, yeah, the press conferences great
[01:57:46.700 --> 01:57:49.420]   This is for us being about a prostitute
[01:57:49.420 --> 01:57:54.060]   And our wage and what about as being about a lesbian? No, I just wanted to know what
[01:57:54.060 --> 01:57:57.980]   What your intent was press hasn't changed much have they
[01:57:57.980 --> 01:58:05.740]   Time magazine criticism of the music that is being written today. We're just trying to write songs about prostitutes and lesbians. That's it
[01:58:05.740 --> 01:58:07.740]   Love you
[01:58:07.740 --> 01:58:13.420]   Love you
[01:58:13.420 --> 01:58:18.700]   So that's that's something I visit all the time. It can be a huge time suck really so i'm really curious
[01:58:18.700 --> 01:58:24.140]   If you've seen this this is the danny boil movie
[01:58:24.140 --> 01:58:32.220]   Coming soon. Oh, right called yesterday. I am dying to see this became the biggest star in the world
[01:58:33.580 --> 01:58:37.820]   First of all because kate mckinans in it and i'll go see anything she's in
[01:58:37.820 --> 01:58:43.260]   The premise of it is something's happened to the timeline of the world
[01:58:43.260 --> 01:58:48.540]   And this guy is suddenly alive in an era that had no beetles
[01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:51.340]   They never happened, but he
[01:58:51.340 --> 01:58:54.220]   knows all the beetles music
[01:58:54.220 --> 01:58:56.540]   so
[01:58:56.540 --> 01:58:59.660]   When he sits down with a guitar and plays yesterday everybody says
[01:59:00.620 --> 01:59:04.460]   Wow, that's really good. Did you write that? No, the Beatles did who?
[01:59:04.460 --> 01:59:10.700]   I didn't write it pomer gartney wrote it the Beatles
[01:59:10.700 --> 01:59:16.460]   All of a sudden he's a superstar
[01:59:16.460 --> 01:59:19.740]   Playing Beatles music
[01:59:19.740 --> 01:59:21.900]   Yep
[01:59:21.900 --> 01:59:26.220]   I think this is a great premise for a movie plus a chance to get some great music
[01:59:26.220 --> 01:59:29.340]   It's not cold play. It's not fixed here
[01:59:30.140 --> 01:59:32.140]   Not cold play it's not fixed
[01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:41.580]   My favorite part is in the recording studio. They say I think you should call that hey dude
[01:59:41.580 --> 01:59:44.860]   Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, hey dude
[01:59:44.860 --> 01:59:51.820]   And shirren who says that is it Ed Sheeran? That's awesome. Oh my god. That's something i didn't say
[01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:54.460]   It's incredible
[01:59:54.460 --> 01:59:58.940]   We need you to come to LA. I'm on for you money and fame
[01:59:59.900 --> 02:00:05.980]   And of course Kate McKinnon is the evil music executive. There's Ed Sheeran. I really know how would he kill him
[02:00:05.980 --> 02:00:08.540]   Uh leave it to the brothers. That'd be my advice
[02:00:08.540 --> 02:00:15.980]   Relieving so I can ask you anything. How did I get in the friend column?
[02:00:15.980 --> 02:00:18.860]   Instead of the hand I love her column
[02:00:18.860 --> 02:00:23.500]   At one point
[02:00:23.500 --> 02:00:25.820]   it's he's on
[02:00:26.780 --> 02:00:28.860]   He's on one of those late night tv shows
[02:00:28.860 --> 02:00:31.660]   And the guy says we're at his song for us right now
[02:00:31.660 --> 02:00:37.100]   And what is he right he writes George Harrison something in the way she moves
[02:00:37.100 --> 02:00:40.460]   And they're all like you're amazing
[02:00:40.460 --> 02:00:46.780]   It's a great premise and of course being beetles. I will I will be there on day one. Absolutely
[02:00:46.780 --> 02:00:52.460]   Yeah, I I really think that's a great idea. Danny Boyle is one of my favorite directors except for the steve jobs movie
[02:00:52.460 --> 02:00:54.540]   But in every other respect
[02:00:54.540 --> 02:00:58.380]   Uh a really great director who is this is perfect material for him
[02:00:58.380 --> 02:01:02.220]   Matthew engram. How about you have anything you'd like to tell us
[02:01:02.220 --> 02:01:05.660]   So I sort of stole this from the lineup
[02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:08.300]   Um good because we didn't get to it right
[02:01:08.300 --> 02:01:11.740]   the motion picture association of america
[02:01:11.740 --> 02:01:14.460]   said that uh
[02:01:14.460 --> 02:01:15.420]   The
[02:01:15.420 --> 02:01:21.980]   That basically digital home entertainment or digital entertainment has now surpassed cable. Wow
[02:01:22.700 --> 02:01:24.700]   so streaming video
[02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:26.860]   I think they said
[02:01:26.860 --> 02:01:28.540]   613 million
[02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:35.340]   Subscriptions worldwide up 27 percent. Wow cable subscriptions are at 556 million
[02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:38.300]   So the interesting thing is
[02:01:38.300 --> 02:01:42.380]   cables still makes orders of magnitude more money
[02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:48.620]   Than streaming right? So this is the streaming is either free or or you know one flat fee
[02:01:49.500 --> 02:01:56.380]   But you think about the number of people that are signed up the amount of time spent the amount of content consumed
[02:01:56.380 --> 02:02:00.380]   That gap has got a shrink right cables got to lose
[02:02:00.380 --> 02:02:06.940]   And digital has got to win. I mean we're talking 118 billion for cable. I think yeah
[02:02:06.940 --> 02:02:12.220]   Wow, I I this is the kind of disruption I enjoy
[02:02:12.220 --> 02:02:17.420]   You could stick it to Comcast. It's okay. It's okay
[02:02:18.540 --> 02:02:24.380]   It reminds me of um those great slides from uh, who's the veteran?
[02:02:24.380 --> 02:02:26.700]   Silicon valley
[02:02:26.700 --> 02:02:27.820]   mary meeker
[02:02:27.820 --> 02:02:31.420]   Yeah, mary meeker. So every year she would have a slide showing
[02:02:31.420 --> 02:02:35.980]   Time spent on mobile. Yeah, and then you know time spent with print
[02:02:35.980 --> 02:02:43.100]   And then the amount of money spent and it was always hugely out of whack, but you knew you know over time those things
[02:02:43.100 --> 02:02:47.420]   We're gonna you know get close maybe not. I mean in a way that's kind of part of the the problem
[02:02:47.420 --> 02:02:52.620]   We've got which is that we're people are moving to non monetizable content or content that has
[02:02:52.620 --> 02:02:57.660]   Per snow perceived value right or where it's more difficult to monetize. Yeah, come on
[02:02:57.660 --> 02:03:01.100]   And it's becoming commoditized. So then what happens right?
[02:03:01.100 --> 02:03:03.500]   If you think about the early days of cable
[02:03:03.500 --> 02:03:05.340]   They couldn't figure out how to monetize it either
[02:03:05.340 --> 02:03:10.940]   Right, they've just got like jack benny to hold a pack of cigarettes or something and say hey smoke lucky strikes
[02:03:10.940 --> 02:03:15.500]   You know and then they hope that it works. A lot of people smoke my life strikes
[02:03:16.140 --> 02:03:18.140]   And eventually they figured it out
[02:03:18.140 --> 02:03:22.860]   A little pick from me just something that zone out and relax with
[02:03:22.860 --> 02:03:29.500]   Actually, I've got two picks one is our sponsor calm calm mobi just announced his new album
[02:03:29.500 --> 02:03:34.300]   Is available only on calm calm which is wild
[02:03:34.300 --> 02:03:38.620]   Um, it's I think the first time I can remember anybody
[02:03:38.620 --> 02:03:41.180]   uh only shipping
[02:03:41.180 --> 02:03:43.180]   You know an album on a premium
[02:03:43.660 --> 02:03:48.140]   web service, I guess this kind of speaks a little bit to what you were talking about with the
[02:03:48.140 --> 02:03:51.580]   the move towards our content streaming
[02:03:51.580 --> 02:03:55.660]   So, uh, that's one but if you don't want to
[02:03:55.660 --> 02:03:59.740]   Pay calm calm for your uh mobi music
[02:03:59.740 --> 02:04:04.060]   Here it is long ambience to exclusive album only on calm
[02:04:04.060 --> 02:04:08.700]   It's uh, let me I'll play a little bit just so you can hear that I love mobi. I'm an um mobi fan
[02:04:09.420 --> 02:04:13.900]   There's a only I think six or seven cuts, but they're long this one's 47 minutes
[02:04:13.900 --> 02:04:21.260]   It's kind of for me to be yeah, but if you don't want to pay for mobi, this is generative
[02:04:21.260 --> 02:04:25.420]   Dot fs just nodded off there. Sorry wake up

[02:04:32.860 --> 02:04:35.740]   and then generative
[02:04:35.740 --> 02:04:39.340]   Music around that style. So it's a collection of music pieces
[02:04:39.340 --> 02:04:43.660]   That are created in real time by a computer
[02:04:43.660 --> 02:04:50.300]   It's created by Alex bainter and i'll just i'll give you there's a a lot of different stuff. So this is didgeridoo beats

[02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:06.940]   Wow, but maybe didgeridoo isn't what you want. So there's different types of sounds. This is drones
[02:05:06.940 --> 02:05:10.620]   Maybe you want something a little lighter here's spring again
[02:05:10.620 --> 02:05:14.460]   That's amazing
[02:05:14.460 --> 02:05:18.220]   And these are all computer-generate completely in real time computer-generated
[02:05:18.220 --> 02:05:20.780]   Wow, and actually pretty good
[02:05:20.780 --> 02:05:25.660]   That's amazing. Yeah, I mean this is be good for meditation good for relaxation
[02:05:26.140 --> 02:05:30.860]   A lot of people like to play kind of this kind of music in the background whether they code or write

[02:05:56.620 --> 02:05:59.900]   I mean this could be a
[02:05:59.900 --> 02:06:01.900]   Chopin
[02:06:01.900 --> 02:06:03.900]   This could be debut c
[02:06:03.900 --> 02:06:06.540]   But it's really eniac
[02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:08.300]   Wow

[02:06:13.500 --> 02:06:18.220]   Thanks in no small part to the genius of matthew ingram
[02:06:18.220 --> 02:06:20.940]   chief digital writer at cdr.org
[02:06:21.820 --> 02:06:25.340]   Off to perujia with his boxing gloves and his notepad
[02:06:25.340 --> 02:06:29.020]   When do you leave i'm not going to take the gloves i don't how good
[02:06:29.020 --> 02:06:32.220]   What is perujia what goes on there?
[02:06:32.220 --> 02:06:35.420]   Um, so it's a beautiful
[02:06:35.420 --> 02:06:37.820]   hill town in umbria
[02:06:37.820 --> 02:06:41.900]   Used to be a big deal in like the year 300 or so it was
[02:06:41.900 --> 02:06:45.980]   The capital of the atruscan empire nobody heard of the beetles there either
[02:06:45.980 --> 02:06:50.860]   Uh, yeah, and um, but now it's you know, it's got a university. It's
[02:06:51.500 --> 02:06:56.140]   Known for its chocolate and it has i think a jads festival and it has the jr
[02:06:56.140 --> 02:07:00.700]   This journalism festival. So what is a what is a journalism festival?
[02:07:00.700 --> 02:07:05.420]   So I think they called it a festival just to make it sound more interesting
[02:07:05.420 --> 02:07:08.220]   Come up on stage and read some of their best works or
[02:07:08.220 --> 02:07:12.940]   Not usually no, but it's it's the I think the idea was this is going to be
[02:07:12.940 --> 02:07:17.500]   Better than just a regular conference and it's um, it's a spectacular
[02:07:18.220 --> 02:07:21.660]   Event i've gotten to know the fenders and it's five days
[02:07:21.660 --> 02:07:24.380]   and there's I think something like
[02:07:24.380 --> 02:07:30.460]   300 or 400 speakers there's 15 different venues and the whole thing is free. It's all
[02:07:30.460 --> 02:07:32.780]   sponsored
[02:07:32.780 --> 02:07:34.780]   a live translate sessions
