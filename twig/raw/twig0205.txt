[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.560]   I'm Leo Laport joined by Gina Trapani wearing her beige glasses.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.800]   I think it's shale it's gray. Shale. Yeah, it's a sleet. I mean it's sleet.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.120]   Sleet. She's a smarter where.org fanning at her life hacker.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.840]   I just.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.400]   Tope.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.640]   And from Brussels Belgium.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.680]   Mr. Blackglass Jeff Jarvis. How are you Jeffrey?
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.080]   Tired but otherwise fine.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.640]   Is it late?
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:46.160]   It is 10 30 but I got four asleep last night and I have an early flight to roam the morning.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.920]   No, we'll make this short.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.440]   No, it's fine. I'm fine. I'm going to be. So could we do all three of us do hang out
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.840]   and then people could see it from our point of view or should I just do a hangout and have you
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.520]   go in it or what should we do? We could do that. Jeff can't get online because he's in Belgium.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.760]   Glass does not work in Belgium. Let me go ahead and host it.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.160]   Well, it would work but it would cost $6,000. I'm just kidding. Of course it works.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.720]   So what should I do? Just wait for my invite. Okay, glass.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.960]   How would an invite come into this though? Oh, yeah. I wonder if the invite's going to come in.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.560]   Oh, I don't even know what I can do. Chad, I actually started it with you.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.240]   How do you start a hangout? You'd say start a hangout. I think it's a hangout with.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.480]   Okay, glass hang out with.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.440]   Who Chad? Yeah, but it has to be somebody in your address book, right?
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.120]   I don't think you got a hangouts on here because I don't even see hangouts.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.560]   Or maybe it's make a video call to. Okay, glass. All I have is Google take a picture.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:06.400]   Oh, I don't want these on. Okay.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.320]   Hi there, everybody. Good to see you again.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:21.440]   These are Jason Howles glasses, obviously. I don't have glass.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.040]   Nor am I having a seizure, though it might look as if I am.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:33.440]   Video call. I guess that's hangout. Okay, glass.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.920]   Video call. It's not one of the phrases that's on here. I only have.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:50.480]   Oh, cool. We have to make sure. Record a video. Oh, you also have to go to the page,
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.400]   webpage and enable certain function. Now I'm recording a video.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:02.560]   Oh crap. 10 seconds. Thank goodness. Now I know why there's a limit.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.640]   Gina, Gina, don't you have to go to the my glass page and enable that function?
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.960]   Uh, yeah, you know, you might say I've got make a video call to.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.800]   Chad Johnson. And then it'll Chad that probably sent you a hangout invite.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:23.040]   Okay, NSA. Now it doesn't understand that. I'm taking these off, but that was fun.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.400]   Okay, good. I feel a little cross side.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.160]   Do you feel all the cross side when you take yours off, Gina?
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.800]   A little bit. Yeah, a little bit. I'll see what we did. So, but we.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.040]   Okay, so I can see you, Chad. I can see you in my glass.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:46.560]   Hello. Can you see what I see? Not quite yet. So there's a rumor.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.960]   Oh, okay. Right here. Now Jason's going to do it.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.120]   And then you can bring it back. I think you have to update yours, right?
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.800]   Have you done a hangout on that?
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.120]   Oh, then it would show up on there that you've been invited. I see.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:10.960]   I can totally see you, Chad. I don't know why mine's not sending video.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:20.400]   We should point out that this is a very beta product. It was never intended to be anywhere outside.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.840]   Yeah, it's a developer tool.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.600]   And that's that's that is exactly the key. If you're a developer,
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.040]   that's who should have these things now because you can start to write things for it.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.640]   Otherwise, to use them. They did see them to a lot of people in the Twitter hangout,
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:43.840]   you know, Google plus thing. If I had class and it wasn't like I will develop software for it.
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.120]   Some of it was, you know, I'll change the world. And the curiosity,
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.960]   so it will find this all the time. I'm in a conference today in Belgium.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.440]   World journalism educators Congress and people are standing in line to put a
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.560]   mock and they're thrilled with it. They can say, okay, glass the thing. Listen,
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.320]   that's really the key. Yeah, right. Yeah, is saying give it into command and having it do
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.880]   something is what's thrilling people. Yes. Talking about keyboard. Yes.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:19.280]   Okay, well, we'll work on it. I had said I thought it'd be fun if we did this last week and
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.240]   we're trying. I left I left the hangout because I could hear I could double hear everything.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.680]   Oh, yeah, I heard it too. It was coming back. Yeah.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.960]   Yeah, it was coming back. Yeah. So this is Jason's glass right now.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.080]   Okay, we'll bring it over here and I'll I'll wear it. And then can you invite the public to that?
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.400]   Yeah, Jean, if you can rejoin because I'll mute myself. I should have done that from the
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.040]   very beginning. Oh, that's where the echo was. Yeah, it was my fault. And now this is what I'm
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:51.520]   seeing. Oh, oh, that's sorry. That was me inviting Jean again. Okay. This is cool. This is cool. So
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.200]   this would be something and they can we make it public? So the people. Well, it says
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.200]   Gina Trapani is in the hangout. Okay, so I just got you invite.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.400]   That's that's my view you're looking at right now. That's really cool. Yeah.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:11.040]   I have to say the bone conduction does work really well. It sounds like I have a speaker.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.720]   I'm kind of shocked that you can't hear it.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:18.240]   For some reason, I'm not sending video. I can I'm in. I can see your view.
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.360]   Leo, that's awesome. Isn't that wild? There goes Aussie. Aussie.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.720]   I don't know why mine is in sending video. I have to tell you, my video will be really boring.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:32.320]   That's just my screen in front of a, you know, window. That's a cool view.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.160]   Yeah, you see our nice little family here visiting from Sacramento.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.520]   Wave. Wave. Wave.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.280]   That's what people do on TV, don't you know?
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:46.080]   Let's see if there's anybody outside the window. Oh my god, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:55.280]   The funny thing is you can't see what other people are seeing. I can only see Chad, for instance,
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:02.160]   he's the other person to hang on. So I can't see what you're seeing.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:07.600]   All right. Yeah. But I have a monitor so I can look at the corner of my eye and see what you're
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.480]   seeing. All right. Well, let's just make this public and if people want to see what I see,
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.720]   I don't know why they would. It's much the view this way is much better than the view that way.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:26.640]   We got a lights at cameras and all right. If you think this is ungainly,
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:34.800]   you can apply now to get the 42 pound 15 camera backpack for a loner.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.280]   Good transition boss.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:45.200]   It's called the trekker. It's one of the pieces of Google uses for street view imagery.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.160]   And it was the one that you perhaps saw going through the Grand Canyon.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:59.600]   It's a 42 pound backpack that lets you access areas where bulky your camera rigs can't navigate.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:04.880]   The trekkers operated by an Android device consists of 15 lenses angled in different directions.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.120]   So they can be stitched. Chad, you left the hangout.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.120]   So we can't make it public because you're gonna make a new one.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.400]   And why don't you make a new one? We'll do and we'll make it public.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:22.800]   As the operator walks, photos are taken every two and a half seconds.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:29.040]   So in the application, you have to say why you would want to take a journey or take it on your
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.200]   journey and do you have permission?
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.760]   Okay. Okay. I make a prediction. I make a prediction right here and now.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.080]   Maybe it's not a prediction. It's already happened. Scope will is already applied.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:50.000]   I'm applying right now. It's what Leo LePort. Where would I like to take it? My organization
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:57.840]   is a twit. Okay. Email. There's my email country where this would take place. Oh, oh, I should take
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:03.680]   where should I take it? What country? Where's your next big trip? I'm going to Venice in a couple
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:09.680]   of months. Your best bet is going to be if you have access to a place that's like the lap of those
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.320]   there's someone nobody can go right. Yeah. Actually, they're very good. But how do I answer this?
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:19.840]   Do I tap it? So I just send them in a hangout request for those who.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:24.400]   I'm sorry. I want to throw a joint hangout. Joint hangout.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:31.280]   Peacock. Just tap it. Okay. You're back. You're back. Okay. Now let's make this public.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:37.840]   Now you are going to hear anyone who jumps in this hangout from the sensor. I don't care.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.880]   I can. There's no one. There's no volume control. That's all right. I can live with that.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:49.120]   Oh, son of a bee. The video can't be made public after it has started. Okay. So you have to do it
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:56.080]   beforehand. Apparently and then I'll invite you separately. Yeah. So start your own public hangout
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:02.320]   and do it on the do it on live. Right. Do it the do it the hangouts live. Okay. I don't know if you
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:08.080]   can make those public. All right. Perhaps. Whatever. Okay. Help us plan for import export issues for
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:13.600]   the equipment. Describe your interest in the Google Street View tracker and your proposed trek.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:21.760]   Who wants to carry a 42-pound backpack if they're going to something in some place, you know,
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:27.680]   so exotic and and sort of restricted. I mean, I mean, I get like that you want to contribute to
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:32.720]   the to Street View and to the world sort of access or these visual access to an area. But
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:38.400]   same time, like it's a commitment, you know, that you can't carry anything else. I think Sean Parker
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:45.120]   should have worn it at his wedding. Perfect. Perfect. I felt bad for him. I don't think he did
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:51.280]   anything wrong. He was just misunderstood. So he had an elven wedding because he and his wife
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:59.200]   were big fans of the Hobbit or something. And so they took over a public campground, an asphalt
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:06.000]   paved public campground and groomed it to look like an elven wood. I know where it is because
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.920]   that's I've stayed there. In fact, I had my honeymoon there 20 years ago at Ventana. It's a beautiful
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:20.320]   place. And then he got and then with unbeknownst to him, Ventana had illegal even keeping the
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:25.520]   campground private. Actually, it was this county of Monterey and keeping the campground private
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:32.080]   because it had a sewage problem. So nothing that the parkers did at their wedding was in any way
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:39.120]   jeopardizing the coast of California, the Redwood Forest or anything else. It was it was it was a
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.840]   Hollywood set, but he got treated like a pariah for it. Yeah, he really they did rake him over
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:49.360]   the coals of that. He got treated like the the rich guy who didn't care. Right. It's not good to
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.560]   be rich in this country. We that we it's not good to be famous in any way. We prop you up. We put
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:02.320]   we put you on a pedestal and then we like take a one of those those bats they use to destroy
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:08.800]   pinatas and you whack at it whack at it till you're dead. Or here's another way life becomes a game
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:15.920]   of ginger. Yeah, exactly tower. Oh, put you up. We'll put you up. We'll take it out. We'll take
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:22.000]   it out of the world. All there you go. Right. Best to stay out of the public eye if if you are
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:30.800]   wealthy or successful if you can. Oh, this is a good infographic from web page fx.com. This is a
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:38.880]   history of Google acquisitions. I think every web page infographic should have a coffee cup with
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:45.680]   a stain at the top. I think I just add something. Google's acquisition history. Here's Google
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:54.560]   Heaven. By the way, a new member of Google Heaven as of Monday. Cool reader. Oh, the world and
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:05.120]   so what they've done is they've actually divided this up among different groups. So
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:10.000]   Android, you've got clever sense, Motorola mobility, pit, pet, talk bin, blind type, zettawire,
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.160]   annual luck, slab, pixies, peak stream, ski, a buffer box.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.800]   And what I don't understand is how many of those things were put to good use and how many of those
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:24.640]   things were in the great tradition of Yahoo and AOL bought and killed. Well, I think keyhole,
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:29.200]   Google Maps. I mean, that's what you the satellite images came from. So those were good. Great example.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:34.320]   I think Zagit or Zagat. I'm sorry. Google's done a great job into grading Zagit.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:40.560]   The other way of the story, we didn't talk about last week that the employees of Zagat were unhappy.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:45.600]   But can you be surprised at that? Well, are they out of work? I think some of them work.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:50.960]   Hmm. Yeah, that's probably why. I was forget about dodgeball.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:56.800]   That's why that's your to four square. Yeah, predecessor to four square, which is kind of cool.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:01.600]   So then's basically sold dodgeball to Google. Google didn't support it. And then hopefully
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.800]   he came out of it with some cash and started for I think so. Basically,
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.720]   we write a dodgeball, right? I mean,
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:11.200]   yeah, it was a different concept. SMS based. Yeah. Yes, it was different.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:17.760]   What was possible? And did it become latitude or did it die because latitude already existed?
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:23.760]   It just died. I wonder what's going to happen to latitude when ways comes around.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:28.240]   Yeah. I think that those have different
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.320]   overlapping with different jurisdictions. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:38.480]   Google has spent a record, a recorded total of 22 billion dollars on acquisitions.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:43.440]   And this is kind of interesting. The average age until a startup is successful,
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.680]   a little more than four years, almost five average years until Google acquired six years.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:52.960]   The youngest acquisition was less than a year old. That was CalTix. The oldest acquisition
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:58.480]   Motorola, more than 80 years old. Excuse the average. Yeah.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:04.640]   Acquisitions by year. It's kind of a jaggy line. 2010 was the biggest,
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:10.560]   it looks like the biggest year for acquisitions for Google. I don't know what this is supposed
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:17.280]   to illustrate, but they've got Larry and Sergey dressed as ministers with a shepherd's crown.
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:22.000]   They have a hell thing. Oh, I get it. I get it. What does Google look for? What does Google
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.640]   learn? Two thirds of the acquisitions have been successes. That sounds about right.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:31.280]   That's pretty good. Yeah. Versus my favorite acquisition story that we
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:37.840]   could not to jump ahead, but Bibo. What is Bibo? Or Bibo was an early,
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:43.120]   Myspace, an early social network company, UK. It was bought by AOL for, was it six,
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:49.600]   50 or 850 million? Wow. And then AOL, Armstrong, when he came in, sold it for 10 million.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.400]   And one of the founders just reborn it for one million.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:17:04.400]   Michael Birch aims to reinvent the site. It's lost most of its users since 2008.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:09.760]   Well, it's probably worth a million. He sold it for 850 million.
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:19.440]   Founded it with his wife in 2005. Hey, it's a million bucks big deal. It's pocket chain.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:25.200]   Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Why not? Why not? It's like buying a car and saying I'm going to fix it up.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:30.000]   Hey, Leo, I need you to leave the hangout. You're in so that I can invite you to a new one.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.800]   How do I do that? Good. Low battery charge soon.
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:42.640]   I'll do it for you. It seems stuck. People, you in hangout.
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:50.320]   In hangout. And hangout. Peacock. Oh, and now I'm seeing what I'm seeing.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:18:02.640]   You. Goodbye. You've got mail. Hello. I give up. I can't. It's also hot. Yeah,
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.080]   does get hot. Wow.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:09.840]   Got a little brand on the side of my head now.
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:16.800]   Google's 30 days, right? 30 days.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:22.800]   30 days. What return policy? Yeah. You see, you got plenty of time to really mess with it and
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:28.800]   not lose a penny. I think 30 days is very generous. No, it is. They're offering me a charger cable.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:35.120]   No, no, you could take the last thing. I've had enough. 30 days. 30 minutes.
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:41.760]   I could have seen for your head. I actually, the customer service that I was saying was really good.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:48.960]   They actually a box showed up for Mountain View today. It was a glass branded like water bottle.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:54.000]   Oh, yeah. Those are the mystery boxes. So what were those? Yeah, yeah. They're water bottles.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.760]   The other water bottles with the glass logo on them and just a little note that said like,
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:03.680]   Dear Explorer, you know, here you go. Stay hydrated. Stay hydrated. Yeah, I guess. Were they glass
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:11.440]   water bottles? No, they were like metal. So I don't know. I missed a bet there. I'm just saying.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.960]   Like, I don't know. Maybe they just had some extra swash. Oh, I got over and.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:21.440]   Hey, speaking of acquisitions today, Samsung bought Boxy Box.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:29.760]   Yeah. That was the really originally Boxy was, I thought, open source software that was a
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:37.040]   enhancement of XBMC, the Xbox Media Center, open source software. They eventually decided to
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:43.840]   kill the software side and really focus on hardware. They sold the boxy box through a D-link.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:51.280]   And Samsung apparently acquired them for something less something south of a 30 million dollars.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.880]   I tell you, you know,
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:20:02.640]   I'm not sure what I don't know. I love Avenue Ronan, who was the founder of Boxy Box. I really
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:07.680]   thought a lot of them. Avenue is great. Yeah. Yeah. I met him as well. I'm happy for him.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:15.120]   But they raised 28 and a half million in funding. So after he's going to be walking away with,
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:23.360]   I don't think he's going to walk away with anything because they said something less than 30 million.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:29.440]   Samsung has acquired key talent and assets to help us improve the overall user experience
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:33.840]   across our connected devices. It was good software. Speaking of acquisitions.
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:40.560]   On the way home, you're going to Rome, right, Jeff?
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:47.840]   Well, not on the way home. It's weirder than that. I'm flying to Rome tomorrow morning and back
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:52.720]   the same day. This is a sin of sins. I've never been to Rome in my life. I'm flying there in and
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:57.280]   out the same day to go to a Google Big Tent event with Google with media people, all of whom will
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.120]   be speaking Italian and going to be listening to translations with headsets. And then I'll do
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:06.080]   the panel and then the I looked at the Google Maps. The venue is a 20 minute walk to the Coliseum.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.520]   So I will at least walk to and go around the Coliseum and then go to the airport.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:15.760]   Sounds like fun. And I come back to Belgium. Then tomorrow night,
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:21.120]   tomorrow night, Friday, I'm at this conference again. And then Saturday, I take the train to London
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:27.040]   for the Guardians activate events next week. So you can go see Google's new or the site of
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:32.080]   Google's new London H site. I can go look at it and be like, they spent a billion dollars for the
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:39.120]   plot of land. And they've now put out renders of what it's going to look like. In fact, the total
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:45.520]   cost expected to be well over $1.6 billion. It will be three and a half football fields long,
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:55.680]   11 stories tall, environmentally friendly as near Kings Cross, St. Pancras station,
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:01.280]   which is also where the Guardian is. You'll see the whole in the ground. It's day. It's
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:08.160]   it's developing. Wow. One side take up an entire site of Kings Boulevard, which is a new road that
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:14.560]   links the station with Regent's Canal and Granary Square. It's pretty central, isn't it? Wow.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:20.640]   It actually is. Again, it's a neighborhood that was, you know, not great. A lot of rail yards,
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:24.720]   that kind of stuff, but it's it's up and coming. And there's a canal there, another neat stuff.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:31.680]   And so it'll be it'll be soon. Very, very neat. Google wants a tax refund on the taxes it didn't
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:44.160]   spend. To add insult to injury, Google is suing the IRS for an $83 and a half million refund
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:50.800]   because they wanted a deduction for a stock transaction in 2004 with AOL. The IRS disallowed
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:23:02.560]   the deduction apparently in error. And the lawyers found it and they said, Hey, you owe us $85
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:13.440]   83 and a half million dollars. Actually AOL's suing saying it wants $4.6 million as well.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.280]   Okay. They can just sign the check over to the UK to try to check.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:28.880]   This is one for you, Jeff German, a German minister.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:38.000]   The Germany's top security official says, Hey, if you avoid about US intelligence agencies,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.080]   just stop using Google and Facebook. Actually, as it turns out, stop using faxes as well. Apparently,
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:52.960]   that's also in the interior minister Hans, Peter Frederick told reporters in Berlin on Wednesday,
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:58.240]   whoever fears their communication is being intercepted in any way should use services that don't go
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:03.120]   through American service. I can't actually say he's wrong on that, right? Well, but hold on.
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:09.760]   Right. Right. But hold on. Hold on. Number one, why just say Google? There's a lot of services,
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:14.240]   right? Don't use AOL. Don't use all the mystery. No, I think you said don't use American services
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:18.880]   of any kind. Well, but then second, but hold on. The way that the spying is actually happened,
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:27.840]   we've Stephen on this, is that going to Google is on warrant. What they're doing is eavesdropping
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:33.440]   as Steve has described so eloquently and smartly on to the actual fiber. Right. And they're doing
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:38.000]   that. And the internet, the way the internet works, right? Things can go routed any which way
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.480]   all around. Well, that's actually, I think one of the real source spots is even traffic that's not
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:48.000]   intended for the US often goes through the US. Bingo. So you could be using a French service,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.720]   but it happens to be routed through the US. And let's not forget the Brits. We now know the Brits
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:58.560]   are doing this too. So if it's going around Britain, you know, if it's going from from Germany through
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:02.880]   Britain to France, boom, gotcha. I'm just depressed. There's nowhere you can go.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.880]   So it's basically don't use the internet. Don't use the internet.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:13.920]   I didn't follow your advice. I wrote a piece for the Guardian this week, but just saying that I
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:19.360]   think that even though it's somewhat symbolic that the service companies, not the internet service
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:28.320]   companies, but the service companies like Google and Facebook and such need to start encryption
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:37.200]   inside their networks and to the users, just to bring some faith in the cloud and the network
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.480]   back. Because the truth is the government's not going to do anything. They're the ones where the
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:45.280]   bad guys here. Legislatures aren't going to do anything. Courts aren't doing anything. And the
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:50.000]   ISPs, nobody's pushing the ISPs and questioning the ISPs and the bandwidth providers. But that's
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.880]   where the vulnerability is to the government's fight. And so I think that there is a need and
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:01.360]   an opportunity for services like Google to say, we are actually your best protector.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.480]   Here's what we're going to do about it.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:10.640]   Well, when you're at the Guardian, thank them for their Guardian Guide to Extradition,
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:16.560]   because I've been really looking through the list of places where you can go, by the way.
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:23.120]   There is it. That's amazing, isn't it? Yeah. It's basically they've come down
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:31.280]   to three countries that would be perhaps okay, Bolivia, Venezuela, or Iceland.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:36.160]   I'd take Iceland. I go to Iceland. Yeah. Yeah. It didn't. Snow didn't
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:40.480]   set Iceland kind of from the beginning, didn't he? He's requested asylum. Iceland has not responded.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:45.520]   I think everybody's going, oh, I don't know.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:58.960]   Wow. See, I don't understand. Maybe in some ways he may have thrown himself on the sword because
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:04.720]   if he really, I mean, he must have known that this was going to be the problem. And he could
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:09.920]   have done this like deep throat style where he didn't reveal his identity or had a plan for
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:15.120]   disappearing from sight. But it didn't seem like he had either of those. And I'm thinking he really,
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:21.920]   he felt like it would carry more weight if he said who he was and why he knew this. And he really
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:28.800]   sacrificed himself because this was how he had to do it. That's true. He also said that he wanted
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:33.840]   the leaks to be out first before his name was up because he wanted the story about the leaks and
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:39.040]   about not about him. Right. But he also, you know, the big question early on, and he answered this
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:43.760]   in a chat at the Guardian, why didn't you just go straight to Iceland? Right. And try it there.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:47.920]   And the problem was that that would have taken too many hop over flights. And by then the end,
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:52.800]   I say, what is this guy going from here to there and there were direct flights to Hong Kong. That's
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:28:00.800]   why he went there. You know, you could fly Icelandic airlines to Europe and you get a free trip to
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:08.720]   Iceland. So he really felt like if he did anything untoward, he would have been busted before he
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:13.200]   could reveal this. Yeah. I mean, didn't he have to get all of his travel pre-approved and all
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.200]   that? I thought that was that was the issue. And so that he felt like they would have gotten
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.560]   suspicious or he would have been difficult for him to get clear on Stiseland.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.760]   He's obviously really smart though. It seems like he should have prepared
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:29.520]   some escape or he just knows, Hey, I'm gonna go to jail. I'm gonna fight this as best I can.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:35.920]   But this is the price I have to pay. The Washington Post had an absolutely shockingly,
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.840]   appallingly stupid editorial this week. Well, I had a lot of things that were stupid this week.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.560]   Both of them first was they did an editorial basically saying, you know,
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:48.720]   Snowden should come back to the US and plea and stop these leaks. Hello,
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:55.440]   you leak to you Washington Post. You sir. Then there's an amazing column. Actually,
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.760]   you need to look it up. I don't have it in the rundown. But Google, Robert Samuelson
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:06.480]   in the Washington Post wrote a column tongue nowhere near cheek saying that we should repeal the
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:11.680]   internet. Yeah, that's really where the problem lies, isn't it? If there weren't an internet,
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:20.160]   all of this would be so much easier. Repeal the internet. It's not really brought much good.
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:24.320]   Let's just get in too much trouble. Let's just get rid of it. Let's just let's just roll it back.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:29.280]   We'll just go back. Yeah, just just the way things were wrong. This isn't the economist Robert
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:32.880]   Samuelson. No, it's not everybody thinks that is that's I think Paul Samuelson. It's a different
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:38.640]   Paul Samuelson. Okay. Yeah, that's that was like that's economics 101 textbook is by
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:42.160]   Samuelson. Yeah, yeah, this guy this guy is life flunked wife 101.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:48.000]   Oh, let's read it. I want to read it now.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:54.480]   Just dash down. You'll find the music. You need your P and the internet. It's not your bad idea.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:30:01.920]   You only we didn't have an internet and then they mean me around him and
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:09.440]   it's kind of hard to believe. I can't find just through in the chat room. You did? Yeah.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:16.000]   We have a chat room. I think so. Okay. We're in chatting. There it is. Oh, that's that's ours.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:23.120]   Yes. Oh, wow. Beware the internet and the danger of cyber attacks.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:28.160]   Right. It's Robert J. Samuelson opinion writer. If I could, I would repeal the internet.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:33.680]   It's the technological marvel of the age, but it is not a symbol of progress. Just the opposite.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:40.400]   We'd be better off without it. Wow. Yeah. I mean, I, I understand the pleasures of YouTube and
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:44.880]   iTunes, the convenience of GPS, which does not use the internet incidentally and much more.
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:51.600]   It's not the internet, Bobby. But the internet's benefits are relatively modest compared with
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:58.160]   previous transformative technologies like the automobile and the toilet. And it brings with it
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:07.600]   a terrifying danger, cyber war. Wow. Unbelievable, huh? The mother Jones had a good article in which
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:12.960]   it's proposed based on what we know about Robert, about Snowden that Edward Snowden is that
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:18.240]   he was in fact a cyber warfare expert that he, the reason he had so much access is that he was
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:27.360]   testing vulnerabilities in amongst our potential enemies. He was a hacker for the CIA. Yeah.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.880]   Yeah. Yeah. I like that. I think that's probably true.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:37.280]   So, so you know, we wouldn't have any of this if we didn't have the internet. That's true.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:41.280]   That's true. But we'd still have GPS. I'm sorry, Robert.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:48.800]   Who is this guy? He's a, he's a columnist been there for years. Yeah.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:52.720]   That's the problem with opinion. It's very different from the editorial side, right?
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:56.880]   Yeah, but that's no excuse. It still appears under their brand.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.480]   I had a big argument with it with a big Dow Jones executive on Twitter this week because
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.240]   the Wall Street Journal's opinion column is basically from the Stone Age.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:09.680]   And they had a column on Greenwalt that just said, well, what if he did help Snowden and
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:15.280]   shouldn't he be arrested? You know, asking what if doesn't mean crap. There was no fact whatsoever
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:20.880]   in there. It was, it was liable. And, and the executive at the news corps said to me in Twitter,
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.920]   well, what, you know, don't you understand this difference opinion? I said, it's still occurring
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:29.200]   under your brand. You're you're in Brussels. You're in the headquarters of the EU. What is the,
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:36.960]   what do you hear on the street? Are people upset? You know, we were, we were tapping their waffle.
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.720]   Oh, sorry. Waffle could be good. I love a waffle right now.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:45.680]   A belge, a little part of the street. I had, I went to this dinner, this conference,
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.840]   and the dinner took forever. So I left with no dinner. And so I walked by this kitty carnival.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:53.680]   I almost think waffle Belgium. Yes. Right thing to do. But I rushed back here for
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:58.080]   you. Freete. They're famous for freete that you if you like French fries with mayonnaise,
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:03.760]   you're in the right spot. They're also famous for waffle for twig. I sacrificed a waffle for twig.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:08.880]   I also, so I wouldn't be too bad. I didn't have a Duvelle, which is a high alcohol mirror.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:12.320]   I love Duvelle's Belgian. I would have taken a waffle. I would have been late. I would have
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:18.320]   been like texting Chad like, Oh, I got to get this waffle. Oh, yeah. Yeah, really. Jeff, I'm so sorry.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:25.440]   You didn't have dinner or a waffle for you. I had no, he had something from the mini bar.
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:34.960]   What they call a crock once you're in the hotel is just a grilled cheese. Oh, no,
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:42.400]   bechmill. So I'm going to finish complaining. Why do you? Because we're okay. So we've been
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:49.600]   tapping their phones. We have captured their faxes. There was a story this week that was
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:56.080]   well, last week it was was wrong by the observer and then the guy who was the source is a known
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:01.840]   paranoid and the story never should have gone in saying that that Germany was trading stuff too.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:08.000]   And immediately German politicians is one I know from the Green Party was in right away in Twitter
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.120]   saying, by God, we're going to go after this. And I said, are you going to go after this? He said,
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:17.200]   Oh, yes, very seriously. And then the forget was wrong. So it's still remains. It's on on US and UK.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:21.200]   And yeah, we're we're we're bugging governments and what Obama's been saying is kind of, well,
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:28.240]   you know, everybody does some of this. Yeah. Yeah. That's all. The US had, according to this German
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:32.560]   magazine, conduct, and this is not what you were talking about. This is another story.
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:36.400]   That's a different story. This is their story. And this, this one is credible in Der Spiegel.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:41.120]   Had conducted a wide ranging effort to monitor EU diplomatic offices and computer networks.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:44.480]   I mean, this, these are our allies, kids.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:53.120]   In fact, the French say they're they're this is jeopardizing future transatlantic trade talks.
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:35:01.040]   Partners do not spy on each other said EU Commissioner for Justice Vivian Redding at a public
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:05.520]   event in Luxembourg on Sunday. We cannot negotiate over a big transatlantic market.
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:10.320]   If there is the slightest doubt that our partners are carrying out spying activities in the offices
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:14.640]   of our negotiators, now we know why they're pissed off at Snowden. This doesn't have anything to
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:20.080]   do with alerting the terrorists has to do with alerting our allies to what we're up to. That's
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:23.840]   why we're upset corporate espionage. It's corporate espionage. It's exactly what we've been accusing
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:28.320]   the Chinese of doing. President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz told reporters and
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:32.400]   Brussels on Sunday, it's shocking that the US take measures against their most important,
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:37.440]   their nearest allies comparable to the measures taken in the past by the KGB, the Secret Service
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:46.000]   of the Soviet Union. He felt treated like an enemy. NSA had placed listening devices in
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.880]   diplomatic offices in Washington and New York, had breached an EU computer network that provided
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:55.440]   access to internal emails and documents and accessized phone lines in EU headquarters in Brussels
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:02.800]   in order to monitor top officials' phone conversations. It had seen documents from Snowden
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:10.400]   but didn't publish them in 2010 or was that of 2010 documents?
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.520]   I can't imagine that it was anything from 2010 though.
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:21.760]   Yeah, that's where the upset is. That's where the upset is. You think, you know, I mean, craymany.
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:32.160]   It's government going far too far. But on my TV here in Brussels, I have CNN International on
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.920]   Lucky Me versus CNN Regular. Right now I'm sure it's nothing but the trial on CNN Regular.
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:39.360]   But more-- Is it a different amount of trial?
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.640]   Is there a different amount of copies? Yeah.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:48.720]   But the news in the real world, of course, is that as the president of Egypt has just been
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:54.720]   ousted by the-- Right. Huge story. And I talked to somebody tonight at this conference, a wonderful
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:58.960]   woman who's a journalism professor, a communications professor from Turkey and the things that are
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:02.640]   going on there are absolutely amazing. I talked to a-- at the last conference I was at, I was
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:10.160]   talking to an editor from Brazil. There's this-- there's a twilight of the gods moment going on
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:14.560]   here that I can't quite figure out yet and not say anybody could, nothing to figure out yet.
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:17.360]   But governments going-- the one hand you have something like the American government, supposedly
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:21.120]   a government of principle is going overboard and just incredibly wacky ways.
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:24.480]   On the other hand, you have these countries where you have people able to take to the street
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:30.560]   and maybe it's mob rule. Maybe it's a bad thing but who can now find each other and organize in
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:37.040]   a way that's just shocking governments. The disruption that's going to come to government I
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:41.520]   think is huge. And in the case of the US, A, you can argue that we bring-- the government's bringing
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:51.200]   on itself but B, you wonder why isn't there more outrage in the US? Are some of the two
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:57.440]   complicated of a story? I don't know. We don't care. I mean, I think that really there is a certain
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:10.000]   amount of the people of the United States are somewhat complicit in all this. We want to be safe
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.160]   from terrorism. So we're kind of honest. Part of it's too is that you can't spy on us but we've
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.520]   always known you can spy on everybody else in the world. That's okay. We should have been mad
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:24.080]   about that. All right, we're going to move on. There's happier stuff. We shouldn't be talking
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:29.360]   about anything like this. It's too complex. Leave this to the politicians. They'll work it out.
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:35.360]   Leo, you're right there on the run. Have you seen the 15-year-old girl's hand power flashlight?
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:47.680]   That's a story. That is a happy story. That's a happy story. It really is a great story.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:54.160]   It's chosen for the Google Science Fair. The video is amazing. This kid is unbelievable.
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:39:01.440]   Let's watch. You got the video there, Chad, Chaddington. Anne Mckasinski of Victoria, British Columbia
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:06.320]   is the sole Canadian finalists for the Google Science Fair competition.
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:13.440]   Hi. My name's Anne and I'm 15 years old. I live in Victoria, BC, Canada and today I'll be talking
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:19.280]   about my hollow flashlight. So I became interested in the area of harvesting surplus energy when I
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:25.520]   realized that humans are a great source of untapped thermal energy. And my objective became to make
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:31.360]   a flashlight that runs solely on the heat of the human hand. I decided to use some cheap pelche
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:37.280]   tiles. If this is a tile and you heat one side of the tile and you cool the other, electricity
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:43.600]   is produced. In my case, I'd be heating one side of the tile with the palm of my hand and cooling
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:49.120]   the other with just the ambient air. My first step was finding how much heat per centimeter
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:57.360]   squares our body radiates. I found this to be around 5 milliwatts and I needed only 0.5 milliwatts
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:03.200]   to obtain a good usable LED brightness. Step two was to do a small characterization test of the
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:08.960]   two different sized pelche tiles. I found that both tiles produce sufficient energy but only
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:16.320]   around a few millivolts. I needed around 2.5 volts. Step three was finding a way to boost my
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:22.080]   voltage. My final circuit had only four components. I obtained a good LED brightness with less than
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:29.920]   a 50 millivolts input and around a 50% efficiency. My last step was designing the physical aspect
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:36.720]   of my flashlight. Because I only needed to heat one side of the pelche tiles, the heart of my design
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:42.960]   was a hollow aluminum tube. The air flowed freely through the tube and also cooled the other side
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:49.760]   of the tiles. My results proved my hypothesis and I was able to produce around 5 milliwatts of power
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:54.800]   and 5 foot candles of brightness. I achieved my objective of creating a flashlight that runs
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:58.720]   solely on the heat of the human hand. Let's see it. Let's see it. So here's my flashlight.
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:03.600]   You know. I'll just give you a quick demo and I'll put my hand on top of it and turn off the light.
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:14.800]   Wow! It works! She's awesome. Thank you. It's a 1.1 million views on YouTube of the
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:21.200]   hollow flashlight. And she's 15 years old, a 10th grader from Victoria of BC.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:26.640]   She said before it was at 200 views and I was like, "Yes! 200 views!"
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:33.200]   I just think this is just wonderful. The more who see it's the better.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:38.960]   And it really, I think it's important because we talk a lot about STEM and how important STEM is
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:43.120]   and now I think now more Canadians will get into the STEM stuff and I think that's great.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.720]   No, I'm joking. I met girls. I joked at the time on Twitter that Google and Tesla were
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:52.560]   competing to hire her and then turn off Google. Do they offer an internship?
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:58.080]   It's from the science fair. No, she's in science fair. But she's only 15.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:01.760]   Yeah, you can't hire her, yeah. All right, let's take a break. When we come back,
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:05.600]   we're going to do the change log. We'll talk about a farewell to Google Reader and what you're
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:10.640]   using instead. And an interesting leaked ad, actually, I guess today's the day the ad actually
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:17.040]   comes out officially for the Moto X, a fully customizable smartphone. What could that mean?

[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:20.400]   time to break out the trumpets because it's time for you were ready.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:28.000]   Google change log. Gina, Japan. He has the latest from Google.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:35.360]   Not a whole lot to report this week, but I put on my glass because I think the biggest update this
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:40.160]   week is a Google Glass update, which Leo, you don't have yet, but it's X E seven. It's rolling out
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:45.840]   slowly to explorers. And I think that the kind of the biggest update is that you can get a full
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:50.720]   web browser inside glass. So it used to be that if you did a Google search, you would get back
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:55.200]   just cards with links. Now there's an option to view the website. So it loads the entire website.
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:46:01.520]   It's the mobile. It's usually the mobile skin. If it's if it's if it's got a mobile skin, the
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:06.160]   site that you're looking at and a couple of new interesting modes. Like, so once the website loads,
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:10.880]   you can swipe back and forth on the touchpad to scroll up and down. There's a look around mode
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:17.040]   where you use two fingers to tap and hold on the touchpad and then you can you can look up around
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:23.040]   to pan on a on a page. Yeah, Chad showing us right there. You can see an example, like the Wikipedia
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:28.480]   page is their mobile theme. And then, yeah, you can zoom by dragging along the touchpad. You can
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:33.360]   you look around, you can tap so you can know you can actually navigate websites by tapping on links.
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:38.880]   You can watch YouTube videos in glass. That's a clever way to solve that navigation thing.
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:43.520]   Yeah, it actually is. You know, I didn't have this update last night for all about Android. And
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:47.520]   I but I just got it this morning. It finished updating and I was saying last night on a that I
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:53.680]   just couldn't imagine this would be anything but cumbersome. But it actually is pretty usable. It's
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:58.720]   a lot more usable than I thought that it would be. Although I was standing with my wife in the
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:02.160]   room and browsing websites. I was looking up something on on urban dictionary. It kind of looked like
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:06.480]   a dork, right? Yeah, and she was just she was looking at me sort of just not disgusted but sort of
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:10.160]   like, you know, because I have this screen on and I'm looking up at the screen. You know,
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:16.480]   it's moving around like right? Yeah, exactly. She's like watching someone use glass is just it's not
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:21.920]   nothing fun about it. But but it is handy when you want to look up something on the web because
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:27.600]   honestly doing a Google search without having the web page was pretty useless before this update.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:31.200]   This update also gave you a couple more voice commands. If someone calls, you can say, okay,
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:36.240]   glass answer. If you get a text message, you can say reply without having to touch the touchpad.
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:41.520]   I'm activating my glass and then all your Gmail contacts are available now on glass. So used to be
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:46.640]   limited to like 10 contacts and now all them are updated. So Jeff and Leo, you should
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:50.560]   you guys and Jason, you guys should get this update pretty soon. It's it's XC seven and the
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:55.280]   glass has to be plugged in and connected to Wi-Fi in order to get the update. What else do we have?
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:48:02.240]   Ah, this is for you, Jeff. Chrome OS, the dev channel, quick office support just got enhanced. So now
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:09.200]   you can do Microsoft Word and Excel filing at a file editing in Chrome. The next web reports,
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:14.560]   they were kind of watching a chromium chromium check in. Check in there. If you go into, I think
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:20.400]   you have to go into Chrome flags and there's a there's a box to enable document editing and then
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:28.080]   you can edit documents. It looks like this is a local Chrome based, not this isn't dry, right?
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:31.680]   This is this is an actual Chrome. So I'm not sure exactly what happens to the file
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:37.360]   when you're in Chrome OS. I guess you can you can either store it on drive or save it on your local
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:41.760]   your local storage. But so easy Microsoft Word and Excel editing in Chrome OS.
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:47.600]   Google News got a little little change this week. They're adding sports scores and weather to the
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:53.200]   home page and they're also they've got these editor pick sections of so they're giving business
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:58.000]   and text sections. They're adding these editor picks and that's those are going to also expand to
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.520]   other sections. Jeff, did you see this? I know you're a big Google News user. What do you think about
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:11.440]   the have you seen the editor's picks content or? Yeah, I haven't seen it yet, but I'm still
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:19.680]   upset. I kind of like the purity of the algorithm view of Google News. Yep. Yep. Yeah. It's a it's
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:24.480]   a collection of headlines handpicked by publishers, right? So it goes back to an old media idea of
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:29.120]   like someone, you know, editorial control picking picking stories versus having people
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:33.520]   that the stories that are most. I mean, I think it's a soft editorial ego. It's a
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.880]   soft to the to the brands to say, Oh, no, no, you really you matter. You still matter.
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:44.240]   Right. Right. Right. Right. And last thing, the Google search field trial, which if you have an
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:50.560]   opt-in, you can opt in at Google.com/experimental/gmailfieldtrial. This is the this is the little bit of
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:59.040]   functionality that basically lets you search for information across Google products in your in your in your
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:04.800]   regular search box. So email and calendar and files from Google Drive and reservations. They've
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:10.480]   just added your Google or your Gmail contact information to search. So if I went to this, so if I'm
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:15.840]   up into this field trial and I go search for Leo, for example, I'll see Leo's details from my
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:21.200]   Gmail contacts and they're also going to be adding Google plus profile support soon. Sadly,
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:24.480]   this doesn't work so well for me, but I keep most of my contacts in my apps account. It doesn't
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:32.960]   work for apps accounts, but promise promise. I know promise of what's to come. And that's all I got.
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:40.720]   Let's say blog and growling from the app users. Yeah, I get your iSearch Regina,
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:45.440]   Japan, and I get your contact info. Yeah, there you go. Yeah. A little card comes up. It says
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:50.000]   visible only to you from Google contacts. Oh, okay. Yeah. So I was interested to know what that UI
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:55.200]   was like, right? Because information in your in your contact in Gmail might be different than
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:51:01.360]   information that's like publicly on a Google plus. So it says visible to only you. Yes. Yeah,
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:05.520]   that's that's well, that's good. That's nice. I think you could show this chat. This is your
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:11.200]   information. I almost took to it. No, I think this is safe. There's no phone number in here.
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:16.480]   Okay, good. Contact info from Chad Johnson's profile. There's some stuff and then from Google
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:21.440]   contacts visible only to you. There's some additional stuff. So that's separate. And then it shows
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:27.520]   recent posts. This is really cool. Actually, oh, that's not doing the right thing. That's pretty
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:34.720]   cool. Yeah. And that addresses our studio address. LOL. Yeah, that's not where Chad lives. That's why
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:40.160]   I said it's okay. Good point. But this is the contact info from Google plus that you post at
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:44.320]   Google plus. And then you see here, it says from Google contacts visible only to you. There's
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:49.200]   additional stuff. And in this case, it's just a separate email address, which is public. Yeah.
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:52.960]   But it would presumably have phone numbers and other stuff. If I had that, I think I do have that
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:58.000]   in there, which is odd. So I'm not sure why it's not showing everything. And then I find a USA
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:02.960]   Today article with you running 24 miles an hour on a treadmill. Yeah, you know, just quick up in
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:09.520]   the morning. Impressive. Got to do it. Ritty, pretty impressive. Chad Johnson's getting into the
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:16.320]   running tremendous. Yeah. Yep. Good. Good. Go and Chad Johnson. If that's your real name.
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:24.720]   Thank you for the changelog. Sure. The that's it. Right. Yeah, we played the Trump the drums,
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:30.160]   the temps. Okay. I don't want to drink anything. You did notice of Franz Kafka and the US is
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:35.360]   being celebrated on Google on the front page today. That's why there's a cockroach coming out of a door.
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:43.520]   If you weren't sure. Right. That's why. Of course. Yeah. For those of you who live in New York,
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:51.760]   it's like home. Hey neighbor. Somebody turned on the lights. It's Franz Kafka's 130th
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:57.760]   birthday. Now I have. Remember back. Say again, we're back in the day when we used to think that
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:01.600]   changing the doodle was a big news story. I mean, every week we say Google changed the
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:07.120]   Google Wow. Well, that's funny because it was Time magazine that made this big splash. I bet
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:12.160]   that that one. I don't know why. Hey, there was a big splash. I haven't looked yet at the Wall Street
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:16.560]   Journal of the New York Times, Washington Post, USA today, the paper editions. But apparently,
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:26.880]   there is a full page ad in each of them. In the US in the first smartphone designed. Here's the ad
[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:32.560]   engineered and assembled in the USA is coming tomorrow in the US. That's Independence Day,
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:37.680]   the 4th of July, you'll eat burgers, watch fireworks and celebrate the freedom to be whoever you want
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:44.880]   to be. The freedom to be spied upon. This is with the same spirit we're bringing you something new.
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:48.400]   The first smartphones you can design yourself. This is what I want to know what you think this
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:54.240]   means because today you should have the freedom to design the things in your life to be as unique
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:58.480]   as you are. And this is just the beginning. Imagine what it'll be possible when you have the world's
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:03.360]   best design engineering and manufacturing talent located here in the US. This is Google's first
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:10.640]   Motorola phone since they bought them two years ago designed by having your event up there Leo.
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:17.360]   I'm going to see them next week, I think. Yeah. Yeah. Wednesday after Twitter, great. Right after
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:22.800]   the show next week. That's right. That's right. Driving to the Googleplex, a special invitation,
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:28.640]   Guy Kawasaki who's now doing some evangelizing for Motorola said as a personal favor to me.
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:34.400]   So I'm thinking we're going to get to see this thing. Right. This new phone. Yeah. You're going to
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:38.960]   get to see the phone. Yeah. Pretty sure. What do you think that means? Customizable.
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:46.240]   We were speculating last night on all about Android and my brain immediately went to software.
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:51.520]   I was thinking, oh, they'll have different skins or different launchers. You'll be able to choose.
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:56.960]   You'll be like, do I might explore? Am I a sports nut? Am I a cook? Am I a fitness?
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:01.440]   And then they'll have different things. But this seems specifically chasing me the good point that
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:05.840]   this seems specifically kind of about the hardware. This is about a phone that you can design yourself.
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:11.600]   So we were speculating that maybe it's that you kind of get to design like the back of your phone.
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:17.600]   Maybe you can choose a color or you can get it engraved with something. But we were saying
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:22.640]   choose your carrier. Not too much. Choose your carrier. I mean, the MotoX is going to be it's
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:25.840]   not going to be Verizon exclusive the way the droids are. It's going to be across carriers.
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:31.280]   So there's that. But you know what else? What is really customizable? Most phones are just sort of
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:37.680]   black rectangular. Slabs. There's not much that you can customize except really kind of the back.
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:43.200]   I don't know. I mean, if I want to get sparkly rainbows on my phone with that,
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:49.840]   you know, the version saying laser laser engraving. Laser engraving. Okay.
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:54.400]   Colors and laser engraving. Have you ever heard of everything dot me?
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:56:02.000]   So they have software that you use as a launcher on your phone that pays attention to what you've
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:08.880]   been looking for and changes your desktop, your wallpaper, everything, your apps even depending on
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:15.600]   what you've searched for. So all of a sudden if you search for a Dell, you see a lot of a Dell on
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:21.600]   your phone. Do you think it could be that? I think yeah, that could be something.
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:25.200]   It's a something I want. You can get that right now in the play store if you want it.
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:31.120]   Yeah, there are there are apps that kind of sort your apps. It seems like they're different
[00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:35.200]   modes. Like when I'm traveling or having a conference or I'm traveling, I'm using apps like
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:40.800]   Tripit and Navigation and locals so much more. And I wish that my phone should be able to know
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:46.080]   that that I'm away from home or that I'm in a new city, you know, and it really could adjust
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:50.480]   to to feature those apps. I think more prominently when I'm in that mode.
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:54.320]   I'm trying to think of other other times even just going into the gym or
[00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:58.400]   you know there are certain apps that I would use there or I mean, on one hand I think well I
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:01.920]   really like to customize my phone and I really like to figure out, you know, I like to make my
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:05.600]   little folder most use apps and it would annoy me maybe if my phone just sort of morphed
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:11.280]   without my intervention and especially if it got it wrong. But I think that there is some
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:16.880]   innovation around that. In fact, one of the things about Android 4.3, the K release,
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:24.880]   is that it might have some like, you know, most used apps sorting versus least used stuff.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:31.280]   So is everything that me, is that an app or? It's a launcher. It's a launcher. Okay. Yeah.
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:33.920]   Yeah. Which you can get right now if you want. Joanna Stern,
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:41.840]   Reading for ABC, says sources at Google have told ABC News that their new 500,000 square foot
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:46.800]   factory in Texas will be able to deliver the personalized device to buyers within days of
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:52.080]   placing the order. You choose the color and the engraving. Now they happily this with the iPod,
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:56.400]   right? It's through the website buyers will be able to select from palette of different colors.
[00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:59.280]   One color can be used for the back another for the front for the trim.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:04.000]   Users will be able to engrave a name or message in the back cover as well as upload a personal
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   photo through the site to be used as wallpapers. So when you take it out of the box,
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:15.440]   it'll have your wallpaper on it. It will run Android 4.2.2. You'll be able to buy the
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:19.760]   mid range priced phone via the web, but also carriers will have it in their stores.
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:27.920]   All major US carriers. And it won't be a droid if you buy it from Verizon. New, new, new.
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:33.520]   You cannot customize the and this is Joanna Stern. Still while you cannot customize the
[00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:39.280]   internals of the phone processor. Remember, you will have variety of storage options.
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:43.120]   So it sounds like we'll be an unlocked version.
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:48.640]   Well, if it's on Google's website, there ought to be a nexus. This should be the next nexus, right?
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:54.000]   Those Google edition phones, as we now know, are not next. I.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.680]   Right. They're not.
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:58.320]   Because updates come from the manufacturer, not from Google.
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:02.160]   Well, right. They work together on it, but right. The manufacturer is involved.
[00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:04.080]   Right. And the manufacturer in this case is Google.
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:12.480]   Yeah. There are also, according to ABC, added voice capabilities to leverage Google's advanced
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:16.400]   voice recognition technology. It's smart enough to know when you're driving and will automatically
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:21.040]   launch the speaker phone function. You know what? They do that now with, I think Joanna is an
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:27.280]   iPhone user, but you can, your car home will automatically launch when you, when you are moving
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:30.640]   at a certain speed or when you dock the phone. If you say that.
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:33.200]   Yeah. That's a new API in Android now as well.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:35.840]   What driving, cycling and walking.
[00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:40.000]   Instead of having to fumble to find the camera icon, button users will be able to flick the
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:44.240]   phone to launch the camera. We could do that right now on the HTC One and the Galaxy S4.
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:47.680]   On the lock screen, you just flick it over and it has the camera.
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:53.120]   Yeah. I mean, you can do that on stock as well as you can with the camera.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:59.280]   Yeah. I love it that is fully made in the US. I think that's, that's a selling point from
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:04.960]   Americans point of view, you know, obviously, internationally. And it also helps them customize
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:13.920]   faster. There you go. Make your phone less likely to be stolen or have less value.
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.560]   You've got your naming graves on the back of it. Good point.
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:23.680]   Good point. I just, I don't know that I would put my name on my, I guess I put my name on my phone.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:36.240]   You could put, you know, at his name. Here's a couple of photos supposedly revealing the
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:44.160]   rear case from the French site, nowhere else. Teal, red, purple or green. No, if you go teal,
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.800]   nobody's going to steal your phone. I can promise. Yeah.
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:54.800]   Oh, I don't want that teal phone. Oh, it's like the glass color is very bright. Yeah.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:01:05.760]   Well, actually I use a purple gel case. Yeah. And my wife hates that. You know, it's just so
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:10.160]   one masculine to use purple link, but nobody ever steals it. Nobody wants it.
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:13.680]   Do you dye your eyes with little hearts?
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:30.560]   No. Oh, it'll lead with my wife. Oh, you gals stick together.
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:37.840]   Got Jeff. No, I think it's cute. I think purple pens are cute and gender neutral.
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:45.120]   I like purple. I listen, Edda is, I don't do pink with her. So it's pretty much all purple
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:50.160]   and teal. We try to be green and yellow. We try to go pretty gender neutral.
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:54.960]   I don't know what color this is. It's like a royal blue for my laptop. I like it. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:02:00.880]   I have a color theory. Have I shared this theory with you? No. No. There is no,
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:06.400]   there is no teal. It is actually a conspiracy by women that they point to different colors and
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:13.440]   call it teal. You know that magenta does not in fact exist.
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:17.760]   Did you know that there is no magenta. That is actually true.
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:25.840]   I'm image searching teal. It's a Tiffany's conspiracy is what it is.
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:31.840]   Magenta is not in the there's teal.
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:36.480]   Well, the other one I hate that I think is the same is mauve.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:40.160]   Mauve is a color no one knows what the hell it is. Yeah, you're right.
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:44.000]   That's that's that's a good test. Actually, let me ask Gina. Do you know what color mauve is?
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:52.560]   It's in the red family, isn't it? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It's more sort of
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:59.360]   purplish. Yeah. Yeah. You can't you googled it. I did. I did Google. I'll stick to stick with teal.
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:03.840]   I'll give you mauve. So magenta is actually an after image.
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:11.040]   Is that mauve all that? Those are mauve. But the most ridiculous image search for mauve I've
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:18.160]   ever seen. There's purple and red and tan and that's what happens to me. They're pointing to tan.
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.480]   That's mauve. I said no one's not a tan. Mauve.
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:27.680]   It's search for mauve color. We have on earth the conspiracy right here if there is to Google.
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:37.040]   There is no move. It is a suspicious. I met mauve not.
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:44.000]   Now here's this is this is good. This is the color mauve color chart. These are all mauve.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:53.200]   So there you go. I mean, this looks like gray, but it's actually it's first blush.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:59.280]   Don't get that wrong. You see, you could tell you're a guy. Did you see it? You can install
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:08.400]   Android 4.3 on your Galaxy S4. 4.3. Yeah. Yeah. This only works on the snap dragon S4s,
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:13.520]   which means I can't do it because I have an X and O space to S4. What so what's the difference
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:18.720]   in 4.3? It's not first of all, it's not key lime pie. It's still ice cream. It's still jelly bean.
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:25.920]   Right. That's right. Not a whole lot of not a whole lot of differences. A lot of kind of under
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:33.360]   the hood stuff to reduce battery usage. But and maybe some some camera UI changes, but not that
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:38.160]   but not that crazy. I think they changed the fact that the menu is a big is a circle to the
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:44.080]   fact that it's just kind of an arc, but nothing else that really jumped out of me that nothing
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:48.880]   earth shattering that I was like, Oh, I absolutely want this right now. I don't know why they did
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:55.440]   a point release. They could have done 4.2, 3. Yeah, 4.2, 3 instead of 4, 3. Yeah, it's true. It's true.
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:03.840]   I'm ready for key lime pie. I am too. Google Earth now has Street View.
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:09.360]   So they're really, you know, I recently deleted Google Earth for my Android phone because I felt
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:17.200]   like maps did everything I cared about. Yeah. It takes a lot of space. Yeah. So what so I would
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:22.160]   love one of you experts to explain which is there a compelling reason to have Google Earth instead
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:28.320]   of maps and maps. Maps, I guess, has turned by turn, which Google Earth does not and latitude.
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:35.440]   I have a confession. What does yes, confess away. I cannot navigate Street View to save my soul.
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:44.000]   Really? No, I end up going into alleys and up and I can't go there. I go nuts. I go absolutely
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.680]   nuts. I cannot use it. That's why you have a pixel. You just touch where you want to go.
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:51.520]   Well, that's true. When you use maps in the pixel, well, it's pretty cool because you can
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:57.600]   pinch the maps. Oh, that is nice. Yeah, that's very cool. That's very cool.
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:04.720]   Altavista. We mentioned that Google Reader's gone. Did you know that Altavista's business?
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:11.200]   This is really this is a huge deal before there was Google, my children. There was Altavista.
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:14.880]   It owned the world. It was the coolest. It was the big search. It was everything.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:19.280]   Little story here back when I still worked for advanced publications, the new houses,
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:25.520]   cutting ass new house newspapers. I ended up on a big team with Tiny. We were going to buy Altavista.
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:30.960]   Wow. And when did all kinds of due diligence and all kinds of meetings and all kinds of this and
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:34.240]   that and then ended up getting, I think we got outbid by Yahoo. I think it was what happened.
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:40.720]   So it was started in 1995. It was the search engine everybody used.
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:47.040]   In fact, it was the one I remember using. And I remember in about probably 98 or maybe 2000,
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:52.560]   Dvorak started to test people's tech savvy by asking them which search engine they used. If
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:58.240]   they use the newcomer Google thumbs up, if they said Altavista, then they were behind the times.
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:04.080]   In 2000, except that is now probably Dvorak is the one morning of the death of all this
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:09.520]   out there. I lost out to Richard. In 2003, it was bought by Overture. Overture was bought by
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:13.840]   Yahoo. Overture was an ad company, the Yahoo bought. That was Bill Gross's company.
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:22.400]   Right. Altavista is not really, it's been around, but not heavily used anymore.
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:27.600]   And if you go to Altavista. I couldn't believe it was still there. The logo was still there. I
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:33.520]   was shocked. Well, until it is till the eighth. Let me go there. Altav, I haven't been there in
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:37.680]   since 1998. There it is. Wow. Looks just like Google.
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:43.120]   I would have just assumed that it was a. And here's trending searches. The number one search
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:48.080]   right now is clear. You want a real good joke? Yeah. Scroll to the bottom and see where it's
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:54.000]   powered by probably powered by Yahoo. Right. Mm hmm. And I know it's nothing on the bottom anymore.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:00.080]   Oh, then do a search. Oh, oh, do a search. Okay. I'll search for digger Phelps. I don't know why
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:03.840]   it's the number one search. Who's searching? Oh, because that's why because he's ill.
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:08.560]   Now, scroll the bottom. Powered by. Powered by Bing.
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:18.640]   There is no Yahoo search. Yahoo is Bing. So that's what you get. Bing.
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:24.640]   Wow. So who was the product manager sitting in some dark little office amazed here. She still
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:29.520]   had a job for the last five years. So I got to, I got to change Altavista, but Bing in there.
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:34.400]   Okay. I'll do whatever it takes to keep my job. Number two search camp to wanga.
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:41.360]   I don't know. I don't know. Oh, because there was an accident. A tree fell in camp to wanga.
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:47.040]   So apparently knows who I am. Oh, because it's got my Yahoo count is logged in. So it does have
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:55.360]   Yahoo stuff up at the top. Yeah. Anyway, it's July 8th is the end. Other things, Yahoo will be killing
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:05.760]   Yahoo access the browser plug in. Yahoo browser plus citizen sports. Yahoo web player.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:17.440]   Foxy tunes. Wow. Yahoo RSS alerts. That's sad. Same day as Google reader. Yahoo neighbors.
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:24.880]   Yahoo stars India. Yahoo downloads beta. Yahoo local API and Yahoo.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:34.720]   Term extraction API. Huh. So let's talk about reader. Was there, was there, you know,
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:40.080]   did the earth come to a close anything? Anything? No, no, just went with the.
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:43.440]   There's an argument to be made. Some people are making the argument that this is a good thing
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:48.400]   because when Google did reader, all the other RSM readers went away. And by killing reader,
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:53.280]   there's been some new development not necessarily. I don't know if I agree or not, but I have
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:58.800]   silver lining in any cloud. It's too late. If you haven't exported out, I think you're done, right?
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:03.760]   Google take out no longer works. I don't think we should try it. Let me check.
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:10.480]   I went to as many different replacements as I could and signed up and said,
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:15.200]   import my Google reader. So now I have choices. So this is the dig reader that which is actually
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:21.840]   very credible. It looks very much like the Google reader. And in fact, still uses JK all the keys
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:28.240]   are the same. I think they've done a nice job. I think this is pretty sweet. It has built in sharing.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:36.480]   Then there's of course, Feedly, which is a little prettier, although Feedly can be made to look
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:44.320]   as bad as Yahoo. I mean, as Google reader. Takeout is still for readers, still up.
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.960]   It's still up. Last chance. Hurry.
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:51.680]   Choose services. Yeah, you can go to you can go to reader. Although, Mihai, paparita, who actually
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:58.080]   worked on reader at at Google, he launched a site. It's reader is dead.com. And he's saying
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:03.360]   to basically take out doesn't include all your red items, your start items, your tag,
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:08.480]   your shared items, the shared items, the people you were following, the comments on shared items,
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:15.360]   your liked items. So he put down he put together a Python script, which exports all this for you.
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:20.320]   I have not tried this after, you know, yesterday, after two days ago, so I'm not sure if this Python
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:26.880]   script will still work. But yeah, you only really get the opml and a couple of Jason files from takeout.
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:31.840]   Feedly has it when a nice thing about Feedly is it does have the kind of more traditional
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:36.800]   magazine look, but there is a view that looks very much like Google reader. Feedly has more
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:40.640]   much more sophisticated, it's more mature, it has much more sophisticated sharing capabilities,
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:45.280]   works with if this than that, which is neat. I'm like, it's fun.
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:50.400]   Can you import you can't import opml and Feedly can you unless I missed it?
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:55.840]   Well, I didn't even do that. I just it's it had a button that said import your Google reader.
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:00.960]   Yeah, that's all right. That button doesn't work anymore. That's gone. Yeah, that's so hope you did
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:07.120]   that. Yeah, so the only one that I found that I could I could just import my opml was because I
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:11.600]   was I had done takeout, but I had waited to move over was the old reader.
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:19.360]   Our E.E. is okay. D.E.R. and that's temporarily free. Yes, maybe permanently. I don't know.
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:27.680]   I use like like 2000 people on the import. Yeah, I used Net Newswire for years
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:34.320]   as a feed reader on OS 10 and it's it's come back and they also.
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:41.680]   While we're on Android. Yeah, well, there you go. I think they have a Windows version of this as
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:45.440]   well. I'm not might be wrong, but it's owned by Blackpixle now. So there are lots of choices.
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:50.480]   If you're one of the few that half million or whatever that still use a reader, there are choices
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:58.720]   for you. I think that's about all we need to talk about anything else. The Bing Challenge.
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:09.040]   Yeah, that's the challenge Bing Challenge still second place. Vivo was a hot topic for a while.
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:16.160]   People were thinking the music video site might move off of YouTube and go to Facebook.
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:21.520]   Such a big deal that Google has today announced that it did in fact make a deal with Vivo,
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:27.360]   including buying a stake in the company. Means that's a that's a lot of money Google spent to
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:34.560]   keep Vivo's music videos on YouTube. 50.2 million users a month, according to ComScore.
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:38.960]   Not huge, but one of the companies one of YouTube's biggest partners.
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:46.160]   Terms of the agreement not disclosed. Bill board said between 40 and 50 million dollars,
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:52.080]   which is a good deal. I mean, I think that's a fair deal if it's for 50 million views a month.
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:58.000]   And really that's the that's the MTV, isn't it now? Kids don't. Kids don't watch MTV. They
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.520]   want music videos. They go to YouTube and search for them. And Vivo was a play by the record labels
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:09.120]   to make sure those were legit. And then they got the money. Yep. That's good.
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:17.760]   It's like Twitter made an update to their developer guidelines. I see your link. Let's see.
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:24.720]   Yeah, they banned auto following and bulk following. That's good. That's good for users.
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:29.680]   Yeah, because I mean, your typical app didn't do that, but there were specialty apps
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:34.160]   that people could run and have say anytime anybody follows me, follow follow them back,
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:40.880]   that kind of thing. And they just junk sit up. Twitter also less benignly has announced that
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:47.680]   it's going to allow advertisers access to information that you provide Twitter and further
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:54.800]   allow third party tracking cookies for advertisers to propagate to Twitter. And you can opt out
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:59.840]   if you are if you have a Twitter account, you can go to your settings and opt out of tracking.
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:02.320]   So that's something that they just announced today.
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:09.600]   You know, we've talked about this before. Jeff and I kind of are in the same page on this. We don't
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:12.960]   really we don't really care if people track us.
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:18.240]   Tracking cookies. Yeah, Boing Boing had a good article on what to do
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:26.160]   because they're privacy advocates. So as Jenny Jardin wrote an article on how to
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:32.320]   there's an article she links to the article in advertising age. Unlike Facebook, which is also
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:38.240]   doing the same thing. Twitter does let you opt out of this. Advertisers will be able to tailor
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:41.760]   ads for you based on your activities, not only on Twitter, but off Twitter.
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:47.280]   And we'll also use personal information like email addresses to target the ads you see.
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:52.000]   Twitter's senior director of product and revenue says users won't see more ads on Twitter,
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:58.400]   but they may see better ones. So go into your Twitter settings and now there is a do not track
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:05.120]   check button. Your visits to sites that feature Twitter are not available to personalize your
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:11.680]   experience. Facebook does this with a like button. And I guess there's a Twitter like button.
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:20.800]   So there you go. Yes, this has to do with the personalization. Taylor Twitter based on my recent
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:26.800]   website visits. Right. Yeah. Yeah. You could that's tracking basically. Right. Right. And then
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:31.440]   Taylor ads based on information shared by ad partners. Right. Display ads, but things
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:35.440]   have already shown interest in. Yeah. But the point is not only on Twitter, but other places.
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:42.080]   You go to visit a site that has a Twitter button on it. Twitter knows now that you visited that
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:46.640]   site because it's a third party tracking cookie. And now so I go to let's say the Starbucks site.
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:50.400]   I don't know if they have a Twitter button on there, but I bet you they do. I go to the Starbucks
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:54.480]   site. Now Twitter knows I went to the Starbucks site and I may happen to see an ad for Tim Hortons
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:17:04.800]   on my Twitter feed because of that. All right. Let's get our tips numbers and tool of the week
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:11.200]   starting with Gina Trapani's tip of the week. So this is a pick this up on the life hacker.
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:16.400]   If you're on Android phone and this totally happens to me. So I tested it out and it works really well.
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:20.160]   You're on your Android phone and you tap the Google search bar and you start to type in the
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:26.480]   Google search and it's just slow, super, super slow to type in and then and then you know,
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:30.640]   press enter to run the search. If your Google searches on your Android phone seem super slow,
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:36.000]   life hacker recommends this week. Now this is one of these kind of proceed with caution,
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:41.840]   be prepared for it maybe not to work on your phone, kind of go in, go in knowing that this is
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:47.360]   kind of kind of not recommended week, but that does work for a lot of people. If you disable a
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:51.920]   built-in app called search application provider, which can run kind of slow on some handsaps,
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:58.800]   excuse me, if you for stop that application, your Google searches will speed up significantly
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:04.400]   and they did for me on my on my Galaxy Nexus. So yeah, if you just you could just Google speed
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:09.120]   up slow Google searches in Android with the street, you'll see the life hacker article.
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:15.040]   Just go to your settings and apps and you swipe over all apps and there's this built-in app called
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:19.360]   search applications provider. You tap it, disable it, you'll get a little warning that I'll say,
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:25.120]   hey, if you disable a system app, you know, things might get wonky, feeling brave, tap okay, and then
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:31.280]   try your Google search again, you'll see that it's super fast or it's faster than it has been
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:36.240]   if you've got the slowdown that I had. So get that on try, speed up your Google searches.
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:40.720]   This is what happens when you restart the phone, does it go back on you get my default?
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:46.560]   I think you're actually disassembling the app versus stopping. So I believe that that sticks
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:55.440]   from one start to the next. Yeah. Did you end up buying the Google experience phone or not?
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:58.720]   I did. I did. It ships on July 9th. And you got a one?
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:04.400]   Ships. Oh, yeah, I got an one. Interesting. Yeah, I'm excited. Good.
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:10.000]   Is there anything, Gina? Is there anything about the Motorola announcement that might make you
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:15.600]   stay might cancel that? I don't care about laser etched.
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:22.880]   Hands out. I don't care about that. In fact, the thing that I love about the one,
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:27.120]   and I shared this with you guys is that the reason why I chose the one, because I just think
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:31.760]   it's a beautiful handset. It's a really nice phone. It's the handset I want to carry. So I'm not
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:37.840]   concerned about that. Although, I mean, I am look, I'm sure that my updates are going to come out a
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:43.600]   little slower than the Nexus and the Moto X. We'll get them. So I made there might be some,
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:50.160]   some, you know, shaking of the fist when those phones get the updates. But otherwise, I'm not
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:54.640]   I'm good with it. I mean, I want to see it. I want to see the Moto X and see what they do with it.
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:20:00.080]   But I colors and laser etching doesn't doesn't really. Here's the reason. Here's the reason that
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:04.800]   the one was the right choice. By the way, it is gorgeous. You're right. And the front speakers
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:09.120]   and all in the aluminum, a unibody and everything. It's really a gorgeous phone. I'm kind of,
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:12.160]   I'm not crazy about the button positioning, but you get used to it.
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:18.960]   The reason was right choice is that HTC with an unlocked boot loader, it's easy to root. I don't
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:24.000]   know yours doesn't come rooted, but it's easy to root, right? And you could put any ROM on it you
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:29.280]   want, including, and I'll show you a little later on my favorite ROM. I put, because I've rooted this,
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:35.200]   the Google experience ROM is available for both the Galaxy S4 and the one. So I put the Google
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:40.480]   experience on there. And after a while, I thought, that kind of missed sense. So I went back to sense.
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:44.080]   But the point is you have the choice. And in fact, I have both sense on here and the Google
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:50.400]   edition tomorrow, I might reboot and go into a Google edition. I could do both. So that's kind of
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:55.760]   a nice, you could add sense to a senseless phone. No, no, that's that's the thing. So I'm not going to
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:21:00.240]   be able to go to sense. Oh, you're a kid. I got I wait a minute. I don't know. And that's what I'm
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:06.160]   going to show you. So that may not be the case. Okay. But let's get Jeff's number of the weekend.
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:13.440]   We'll talk about truth is my number was, I don't have much time to go before I, and I can't even
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:17.200]   have a waffle before I forget on twig. So I didn't have a lot of time to get numbers. But I found
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:23.120]   this moderately interesting, somewhat obvious. Have a good enough caveats now.
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:30.480]   Nelson Maddos, who's the emerging markets of VP for Google, said straight out. And if you think
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:34.080]   about this, it makes sense. But he said straight out that the next billion people online will not
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:40.640]   speak English. Wow, full stop. Wow. And so Google's growth is going to come, for example, this was
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:44.640]   the times of India story. So there were say that it's going to come from the native languages of India.
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:50.560]   Wow. We're not going to languages. He's in that interest area. Right growth there. And you
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:55.680]   think about that way that that's a rather sobering way for us English speaking folks to look at it.
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:22:00.320]   And I'm here at conference where people are speaking five languages. It's just unbelievable.
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:05.680]   And I'm just stupid America to speak 1.1. And they all said to me, they'll love it. Hey,
[01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:11.360]   you got the one to speak, man. You speak that everybody speaks that's okay. But but Google
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:18.000]   can't can't rely on that. So so the fact that none of the billion will speak English just sober me up a bit.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:28.000]   Are you learning? What is it? Erdou? Are you learning something? I asked, I keep on, you know,
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:34.560]   what I can't stand is genders. Because I'm a genderless guy, you know, I can't stand because
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:41.120]   my brain just does not dare DDoS. Some nouns are feminine and some nouns are masculine.
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:45.920]   Cannot do it. Cannot do it. Those synapses were not exercised. So I say to people who are speaking
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:49.520]   Dutch, well, I hear you don't quite have that. They say, oh, no, but there's all these other
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:57.120]   complications. You don't want to do it. Well, there you go. We're just going to have to stick
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:01.760]   with English. I think English will not lose its ascendancy. I hope I pray. No. No.
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:07.840]   Oh, my stupidity's sake. So I think this will work on your Google edition phone, Gina.
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:13.520]   Okay. Talk to me. So this is what I've been doing. So yeah, because it's nice to have,
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:21.760]   it's nice to have the choice. Yeah. Right. Yeah. I bought an AT&T HTC one. And of course,
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:26.400]   the nice thing is HTC, if you go to their dev site, lets you unlock the bootloader and then
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:31.120]   it's a trivial thing to root it. So once you've rooted it, you could put any ROM you want.
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:35.280]   Immediately, as soon as the Google edition started coming out and enough people had it,
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:39.200]   people were sucking the ROM off the same thing with the Galaxy S4 and you could make a Google
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:46.000]   edition phone out of any HTC one. I think you can go the other way too. And what I would recommend
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.160]   the site, I'd recommend is trick droid.org. There are a number of people who make sense ROMs.
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:55.360]   These guys make a sense ROM as well as a Google edition ROM. So you can get the Google edition
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:24:01.280]   ROM here if you have an HTC one, a rooted HTC one and get stock Android. I put 422 on there all
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:07.600]   day yesterday and it was nice. I'm not sure I buy the argument that somehow because Google did it,
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:15.040]   it's a better UI than what say Samsung or HTC or somebody else is doing. They also though have
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:22.160]   an HTC sense ROM that is much, you know, they have some nice improvements in it and it's 4.2.2.
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:28.800]   Here in the US, we still are at 4.1.2 on the HTC one. I'm pretty sure that as long as you've
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:34.000]   rooted it that you can put trick droid 8 on and that's what I've got on here and then you get all
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.640]   the benefits of sense and you get choice. Now what's funny is I, you know, the reason that I didn't
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:43.760]   really care about the Google edition is because I use Nova launcher. You use Nova launcher, right?
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:49.120]   I don't. I use a, I'm just vanilla. You don't need to. But if you use Nova launcher, this looks
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:56.480]   just like vanilla 4.2.2. You know, I mean, I don't, there's not, and this is sense with a few
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:25:01.840]   extras. This is sense. Right. So, and then I like, there's a few things like I like to have multiple
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:07.840]   docs so I can scroll through my docs. There's, there's, I can do this. I could swipe up for Google
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:15.200]   search. I can tap this for Google now. There's just, there's a few things you can do with Nova launcher.
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:21.120]   So I'm pretty sure I'd be curious, but I believe trick droid will work on your Google edition phone
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:27.120]   and if you have a non Google edition HTC one, they also have the Google edition ROM. So what I did
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:33.200]   is I downloaded both and I just, I reboot and if I, I could choose it's a dual boot phone.
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:36.640]   You have a dual boot phone. I have a dual boot phone. I don't, I don't want to have to choose one
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:42.560]   or the other. I just like to do a boot. Exactly. Yeah, because I would like to, to compare the two.
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:48.400]   I don't necessarily think that Google has the best Android UI, but like as an Android developer,
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:54.480]   it's in my interest to close to what Google thinks is the best Android UI. So like even,
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:58.240]   even the fact that the buttons on the HTC one aren't in the right order. They're not the Nexus
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:01.600]   experience buttons. They're not like the recommended order buttons. Like that bothered me a little bit.
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:07.200]   I was kind of like, this is, you know, but and the GS four has the menu button, which you love,
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:11.680]   right? Right. I like a physical button, although I've gotten used to this HTC and once you
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:16.160]   overload the, the two buttons, there's only two buttons at the bottom, capacitive buttons at the
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:21.520]   bottom of the HTC. Once you overload them, though, they do everything you want. So I'm, I'm completely
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:26.720]   happy and you still get a, you know, the overflow menu, the dot dot dot you haven't given that
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:31.520]   overflow shows up in the action bar versus right. Right. Yeah, it shows up where it's,
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:35.680]   where it's supposed to. So right up here, right? Right up there. Yeah. But I can also, I can also
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:40.080]   press and I think I can, I can't remember what I've assigned it to, but I, yeah, that did that do
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:46.720]   it. Anyway, I can, I can press and hold. I can't, I can't remember. But yeah, you have all the
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:53.520]   functionality plus is the ball and it's dual boot. Trick droid has both ROMs, the Google edition
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:27:00.400]   ROM and a sense of up, very up to date sense is the European four to two version. And I think
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:05.840]   you're pretty sure I'm going to play around this. I go back and forth. Part of me is like, do I
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:10.000]   really want to do it with my phone and maintain two, you know, two setups and have to update my app
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.600]   second both and, you know, whatever. But I might just play around with this just to get a sense of,
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:17.680]   Oh, well, that's the other thing. That's the other thing. The first time you install them,
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:22.400]   you probably should wipe it. But after that, I just wiped the cache. I do not wipe all the data.
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:28.800]   So I don't have to reinstall apps. That's probably not a fruit. But if app, but if you're booted up
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:32.800]   to the Google edition and app, app updates come down for the play store, they stay there.
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:37.760]   But then you reboot into the, into the sense edition, don't you have to update those apps
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:42.080]   again or only no, only maybe the Google apps, because the Google apps are built into the ROM.
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:48.000]   The other apps don't get wiped out. So it's just accessing the apps. Oh, that's nice. That's pretty
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:54.160]   sure. Don't quote me on that one. I just wiped the, I do think you should wipe the cache and I do
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:28:03.440]   wipe the cache, but I do not do a full wipe. I should try it right now. Anyway, it's great.
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:08.000]   And you get a dual boot phone, which is fabulous. And then the best of both of us.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.720]   A dual boot phone. Yeah. And I just think, I think the sense camera app is great.
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:18.240]   Although, and this is another tip because of the Google edition coming out, you can now download
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:24.080]   an APK of the Google camera, the Google edition camera, the stock camera and stock gallery and
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:27.760]   put that on your phone. So if you don't like Samsung's crappy camera, you can have both.
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:35.280]   It becomes a separate app. So then, so I, more choice, right? That's what we want.
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:40.960]   More choice. I don't know if he'll show up in the place, the keyboard has and cloud print has,
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:47.680]   right? But I don't know if they'll put it. Yeah. I have to say stock gallery is the best gallery.
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:52.880]   That I will grant you is really much. And that's saying something. That means there's a lot of room
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:57.920]   for innovation. I know, because it's very simple, but it's very, very simple. And sometimes it's
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:01.360]   just kind of slow. And I don't know. I feel like there was times when I was like,
[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:06.000]   "Samsung's gallery is the worst." Is it? Yeah. But now you're going to get the sense gallery,
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.080]   and you could have both, by the way, both can run. You don't have to choose one or the other in
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:14.400]   that case. The sense gallery does have all those, you know, the highlights and the zoies and all
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:20.080]   of that stuff. Right. So you kind of want the sense gallery. But you can have both.
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:24.960]   All right. I think we're done. We're done talking hacking phones. That's really a conversation
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:27.760]   for all about Android. That's where you'll find Gina Trapani every Tuesday.
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:34.800]   She's here every Wednesday. And of course, smartawear.org. Think up.com
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:42.160]   to do text.com. She's a very busy person. Yeah. 2.0 this week, we did a big overhaul
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:45.680]   to do text user interface. There are hot debates about where buttons should be,
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:49.600]   and what should be in the overflow menu, what shouldn't, and a much simpler interface.
[01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:52.480]   So check it out to dotext.com. Absolutely.
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:57.440]   You'll find Jeff Jarvis all over the world. If it's Wednesday, he must be in Belgium.
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:03.760]   I'm off a day. The movie was, if it's Tuesday, this must be Belgium.
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:08.720]   He will be in Rome, then back to Belgium, then to London, and then we'll see him next week right
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:15.200]   here. Yes, we hope. You got it. Airlines willing. God in United Airlines willing.
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:19.680]   Buzzmachine.com is his blog. His book, Public Parts is available everywhere. You must read that.
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:27.360]   And don't forget his Amazon single Gutenberg, the G of that a fun read. Thank you, Jeff.
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:30.880]   Thank you, Gina. Thank you for joining us. We do this week in Google every Wednesday,

[01:30:57.120 --> 01:31:00.000]   Really, Chad does 90% of the work I just show up and sit in the chair.
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.000]   Thank you, Chad. Thank you, everybody. We'll see you next time on this weekend.
