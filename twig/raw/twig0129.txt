[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.400]   This is Twig, this week in Google.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.640]   Episode 129 recorded January 9, 2012.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.720]   You must be this dope to enter.

[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.000]   show, Leo Laport here, and joining us right now,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.080]   Jeff Jarvis, from his office at home in New York.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.200]   Good to have you, Jeff.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.200]   Good to be here.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.840]   Jeff is the author.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.680]   On Monday.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.760]   Yeah, we remove the day, and I'll explain that in a second.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.160]   He's the author of Public Parts, brand new book from Simon
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.200]   and Schuster, how sharing in the digital age improves
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.880]   the way we work and live.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.040]   And this was a book that he's been writing
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.200]   as we've been doing the show.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.440]   So we got a lot of insight into this.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.360]   And it's just fantastic about public, life in public,
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.480]   and the new public and so forth.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.720]   Thank you for being here, Jeff.
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.120]   Gina is not here.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.680]   She's-- oh, she's at the White House.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.920]   Yes.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.200]   She's at the White House.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.360]   All hail Gina.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.440]   Yeah, she's-- she asked us not to talk about why she's there.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.680]   But I think when she comes back next week,
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.320]   she'll explain it.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.680]   She'll explain it.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.280]   But I'm going to vote for her vice president.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.840]   Shh.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.080]   We weren't supposed to say anything.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.520]   Kevin Purdy is here, and her place
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.880]   are so glad to have the Purd Man.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.520]   Hey, Kevin, good to have you.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.960]   He's Kevin Purdy on Twitter, the Purd Man on the internet.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.400]   And author of Google+ the Missing Manual,
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.480]   which I don't have a copy of.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.520]   Oh, that's right.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.200]   Google+ the Missing Manual.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.560]   Yes.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.920]   Where can we--
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.920]   We're just out from O'Reilly.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.760]   You can find it at O'Reilly.com.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.640]   Searched out there.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.400]   We're on Amazon.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.600]   And out in print and ebook form very soon,
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.920]   but printed over the holidays.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.920]   So I don't have my copy yet.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.400]   How exciting.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.000]   Congratulations.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.400]   Thank you.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.240]   Also an Android wizard.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.560]   And follow him on Google+.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.560]   I just-- Indeed.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.640]   I just added you to my-- I should add you to celebrity--
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.920]   Add me to a circle, which you won't tell me the name of.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.280]   I know.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.520]   I have a lot of circles here.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.020]   What?
[00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.560]   I could put you in Microsoft Groupies.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.560]   No.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.560]   No.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.400]   Mavens?
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.720]   No.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.360]   Photographers, new podcasters.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.880]   I think tech journalists.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.720]   You'll join an elite crew of 716 people.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.480]   I like this feature, which we never
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.920]   talked about on Google+ of the sliders in the circles now.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.160]   Yeah, you talked about it previously.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.680]   Did we?
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.180]   I think.
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.920]   Yeah, we did briefly because none of us had it yet.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.960]   I don't like it.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.000]   Showing up for some people.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.880]   It's rolling out like everything in Google and--
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.480]   I like it too.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.520]   So I'm looking now in my circles.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.960]   Where do I get-- how do I find it?
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.000]   Do I click a circle and then it will be in the circle or no?
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.800]   Say it's on the stream page, I believe.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.080]   It's on the main page.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.600]   Oh, that's right.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.120]   I remember now.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.160]   Here's what you do.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.880]   Here's what you do.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.640]   You click, like, say, acquaintances.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.000]   I'm going to click one of my circles and go there.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.240]   And then I will get a slider on the page
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.440]   of that particular circle.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.240]   Yeah, it's in the top right corner of your stream.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.800]   And you can slide it to determine how much of that circle
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.320]   shows up in your mainstream.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.400]   I wish I had more granularity because you really only
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.480]   have four positions.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.000]   You have--
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.200]   And it says most for all of them.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.480]   And everybody's in my circles because I
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.000]   want to see most of what they say already.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.720]   Right.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.200]   Most is most of the default if I have not done this before.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.120]   So everything is most.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.880]   As usual, Google is not exactly transparent
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.800]   about its algorithms here.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.320]   Do we have--
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.200]   What it also reveals to us is that we're not
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.960]   seeing a lot of things in the stream of all people's.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.760]   So there's no presumption that I've
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.400]   seen everything that you've had to say.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.000]   Right.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.560]   I went to family and turned that up all the way
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.280]   because I always want to see anything my family posts.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.320]   Same thing with the people I work with.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.560]   And then I turned down some groups, like photographers.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.400]   There's so many photographers on Twitter.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.120]   And it was becoming like a photo blog.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.880]   And I love them.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.600]   But I don't want to see as much.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.160]   So you can kind of fine tune it.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.080]   And previously, you could create a circle.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.960]   And as I was just joking about, nobody
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.400]   could see what you named a circle.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.240]   So you could create a circle called like frenemies
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.640]   or something or people I actually hate.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.120]   But they'd show up in your main stream.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.800]   You'd say, what's the point of the service?
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.400]   But yeah, that's a really neat new feature
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.720]   that I need to add to a revision of my book.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.120]   Well, there's one feature that I would really like to have.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.120]   And maybe Google will listen to us someday, which
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.560]   is the ability to un--
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.920]   well, I guess they have added that in effect with this slider.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.000]   So I could say, what I'd like is to have some custom streams,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.520]   like this plus this plus this.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.080]   But that might be too complicated to implement.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.960]   You could manually do it.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.040]   But yeah, to remix your stream, so you just
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.120]   see like friends, and photographers, and--
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.440]   Yeah, like let me shift click or command click on the stream
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.480]   and say, I want to see this, this, and this,
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.840]   and make a kind of a meta circle that
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.800]   can includes those circles or something like that.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.720]   And to share that, we had Vic and Dotra
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.400]   plus this weekend about people being
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.800]   able to go to the starter page.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.280]   And thank goodness we're listed there.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.720]   And get circles.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.920]   But I think the more powerful thing
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.600]   is not to have one size fits all circles,
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.680]   but to have each of us have our own circles
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.000]   that you could subscribe to, we keep updated,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   and may the best circles win.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.240]   And that's really what the power--
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.320]   it's going to give Google more data on who's authoritative
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.600]   and who's good and who's recommended more by more people.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.440]   Right.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.440]   Right.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.200]   What is-- how do I see the starter page?
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.680]   Oh, look, if I've already signed up, I guess I can't.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.440]   Look, I know you can't.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.560]   Yes, again, look up Vic.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.080]   You can get to it, yeah.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.600]   All right.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.160]   Remember.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.320]   If you look up Vic's posts, let me
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.160]   see, I'll bet that it's not too far down.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.600]   If you skip the dog caught in the balloons--
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.360]   Funny video of a beautiful baby lab running around the house
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.320]   getting tangled up in balloons.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.320]   Oh, hey, if you go down--
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.840]   Oh, for me, skip the bungee jumping video, which I hate
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.000]   because I hate my-- Oh, my God.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   You know what?
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.040]   Folks, I've been telling you for years, don't bungee jump,
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.760]   and this video confirms it.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.640]   What if the cord broke?
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.760]   She survives.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.040]   She survives.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.120]   Go down below her.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.520]   I want to--
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:51.720]   Here it is.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.840]   --you see, this is a great place to find a picture of life.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.400]   Just click here.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.880]   Plus.google.com/getstarted.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.840]   Here's the weird thing.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.520]   I thought I was off the list.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.520]   Turns out that it won't recommend you to yourself.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.520]   Oh.
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.480]   So if you look, you won't find yourself on the list.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.680]   So which list are you in, Jeff Jarvis?
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.880]   Well, I believe they got it mixed up.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.520]   I'm in tech and Gena's in news.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.880]   They can-- should be the opposite.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.040]   But I'll take what I can get.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.560]   This is cool.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.640]   Yeah, I follow both of you guys.
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.880]   I don't see either of you.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.560]   And I can add all these people.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.800]   Yeah, you can just add a circle there.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.920]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.800]   Which is kind of-- which is kind.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.800]   I didn't realize that's what it was.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.960]   It wasn't just a recommended list.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.400]   You can now subscribe to a whole circle.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:29.800]   Oh, cool.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.000]   So I'm going to add a technology circle.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.280]   I'm going to add a politics circle, a photography,
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:34.840]   an art circle.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.480]   That's nice.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.840]   Their version of the Twitter suggested users list,
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.440]   but implemented, I think, in a little more benign way.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.920]   And the reason both Twitter and Google+ do this
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.400]   is when you're new to a place like this,
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.600]   you often say, well, I don't see anything.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.640]   What should I do now?
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.520]   The big problem is that you come--
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.360]   I know people who come in, I'm sure you've heard it too,
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.080]   come in and say, well, what's with this Google+ thing?
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.040]   All I hear is crickets.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.960]   It's boring.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.680]   And they've got to have starters.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.720]   Right.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.160]   Now, do you guys yet have the new Google Bar?
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.400]   Because how long ago was it we talked about this?
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.280]   And I still have that big black bar at the top.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.240]   So do I.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.040]   So do I.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.040]   I manually enabled it.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:17.680]   There's a--
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.440]   Yeah, there's a hack.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.000]   But I don't like to--
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:19.800]   It's a cookie trick you can do.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.320]   I don't like to do that because I kind of
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.280]   want the real world experience, you know?
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:23.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.640]   It's very slowly rolling out.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.160]   Very slowly, surprisingly slowly.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.760]   Adam, almost as slowly as timeline.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.080]   Yeah, a lot of folks don't have it yet.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.840]   Timeline is now out, right?
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.280]   The Facebook timeline.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.320]   Still being--
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:37.840]   Oh, really?
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.120]   It's in.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:39.640]   That one is--
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.200]   I don't have any--
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.160]   I implemented with the developer trick,
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.200]   because I really wanted to play with the timeline.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.040]   I love it.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.080]   You know what's really interesting now?
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.080]   Because of subscriptions, that completely,
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.320]   at least for people who enabled subscriptions,
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.200]   changes the experience of Facebook entirely.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.640]   So my experience of Facebook, because I allow you--
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:04.320]   if you go to my Facebook page, which is Facebook.com/leogloport,
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.640]   because somebody else has Leola port,
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.840]   you can subscribe, which means a asymmetric follow,
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.360]   just like a Twitter style or Google+ style follow,
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.000]   where I don't have to approve you or anything.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   But what that means is everybody who subscribed to me
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.520]   now suddenly is seeing my posts and commenting on them.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:27.160]   And I have 33,000 people subscribing to me, commenting
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:27.640]   on my posts.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.480]   That means almost everything I post,
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.360]   there's dozens of comments.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:36.120]   And then people bitch, because I don't read the comments.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:41.080]   So have you noticed the kind of more prominent public/friends
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.480]   slash close friends switcher then on the right side
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.680]   of the poster?
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.120]   Is that still not like--
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.880]   Well, I do everything public, right?
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.680]   Because like Jeff, I live in public.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.760]   But one thing I do notice, while there's
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.920]   a lot of engagement on Facebook--
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.040]   please forgive me if you're one of these people.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.480]   There's a lot of dumb engagement on Facebook.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:05.920]   People who just say things because they want to say things.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.920]   Comments like--
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:14.600]   I don't know.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.920]   I put a picture of Frost on my car, which is a stupid post.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.320]   But I did it anyway.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.960]   And somebody posted Dandruff, then Patrick said slow day.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.040]   And then somebody said, is that a euphemism?
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.120]   And then here's a great comment.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:30.760]   What?
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.880]   W-A-T?
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.440]   It's like--
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.440]   so Jeff, you live in public.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.640]   Doesn't the public sometimes get on your nerves?
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:43.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.720]   Yeah, it does.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.520]   The public is-- what I often say about this
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.880]   is that the internet is just life.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:48.960]   Life is filled with bozos.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.520]   Ergo, the internet is filled with bozos.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.640]   It is life.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:52.640]   And it is life.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.000]   And there's-- you can avoid--
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.440]   let me ask you this.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.960]   When you have a reflex to post something, what's your order?
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.680]   Twitter, Facebook, Google+,--
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.760]   Can I tell you what I've been doing lately, which is bad.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.760]   You know bad, bad, bad.
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.160]   I break all the rules because you know when things--
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.640]   and I agree this is a rule.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.040]   You should post natively.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.360]   So when you're posting on Twitter,
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.000]   you should be on Twitter posting on Twitter.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.560]   When posting on Facebook, you should be on Facebook.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.520]   I don't do that because that's too difficult.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.240]   And as Facebook and Twitter and Google+ kind of
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.240]   seem to merge in terms of what they're all becoming--
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.200]   for me, broadcast media.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.040]   So I use a cross post tool called
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.680]   Publish Sync on Google+, when I post on Google+,
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.440]   I check Twitter and Facebook in most cases.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.280]   But even more when I'm using-- and I know this is shocking--
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.880]   is path.
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:41.640]   So path is intended to be a private stream.
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.680]   You only have 150 friends at max.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.080]   You're only supposed to friend people you know.
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.840]   My friend Alex Lindsey says, I only
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.160]   friend people on path that I would want at a dinner party.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.960]   It's kind of like a dinner party.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.600]   And then you post stuff privately.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.120]   But path has subtly at the bottom little boxes
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.880]   for Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, and 4-square.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.200]   And most of the time now, if you see a tweet from me,
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.800]   or especially if there's a picture associated,
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.000]   or Facebook posting, most of my Facebook postings,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.480]   they come from path.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.080]   Is that bad?
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.400]   Is that wrong?
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.520]   And friends of mine who work in marketing and that field
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.320]   say that you actually kind of get penalized for doing that
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.480]   on Facebook in terms of--
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.400]   Yes, you do.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.520]   That's a definite thing.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.440]   Yeah, Facebook-- and again, Facebook also
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.440]   is a little opaque about their algorithms for rising stuff
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.760]   up through the news stream.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.800]   But it's absolutely true, if you're not natively posting,
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.760]   that they will degrade you.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.200]   But on the other hand, if you're following me,
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.320]   and you go to my timeline, everything's there, right?
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.200]   But Jeff's question then was, was there anything
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.560]   in particular that makes you want to post a certain thing
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.840]   to one type of--
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:53.760]   Yeah, how about you, Kevin?
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:59.800]   Anything that's ephemeral goes to Twitter,
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.520]   like, hey, this bagel's terrible.
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.920]   That goes to Twitter.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.560]   Anything that's-- usually, I think things that do best
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.000]   with the link go to Google+ for me.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.320]   When I want to center a conversation around something,
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.560]   if I want to say this photo, this link, this thing,
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.160]   this video, that's--
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.640]   Google+ seems to be the place for me
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.000]   where I get the most benevolent good feedback
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.040]   on that type of thing, when you can actually point at something
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.800]   as opposed to just saying, really warm and buffalo
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.560]   in the winter.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.960]   And Facebook is-- I only use it as friends and family.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.680]   That is where I go to post things about my life
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.840]   from folks who know me from the meat sphere.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:44.320]   Yeah, I'm so-- I think, first of all, it's a moving target,
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.280]   right?
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.200]   I mean, there's no rule.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:47.800]   And as--
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.000]   Facebook has completely changed from being my friends
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.360]   and high school classmates to anybody now.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.080]   So I don't know how Facebook or Google+ or Twitter
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.720]   differ very much.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.680]   The engagement might differ.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.800]   And now Facebook's status limit is so much longer now.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:06.800]   It's like Google+.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.480]   You can post a whole blog post on there if you wanted to.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.240]   It's many people.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.480]   I think it's their blog.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.720]   You used to have to use a note.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.760]   Now you just put in statuses.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:17.720]   They're blog.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.880]   Here, one thing I'll say is--
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.560]   and this is partly because I've abused my blog.
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.760]   Well, I was writing the book.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.640]   I blogged-- about the book that I blogged less as a whole.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.080]   And I still haven't picked up my pace
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.960]   because I'm just writing a different pace.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:31.240]   But the quality of conversation on the blog--
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.520]   now, when I grew up careful and I wanted a conversation,
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.560]   I put it on Google+ now.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.360]   I might put it on the blog for the record.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.000]   But I have basically a few people who don't like me coming
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.920]   in there and reminding me how much they don't like me.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.080]   And the trolls are everywhere.
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.360]   Now, I'm seeing more and more people--
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.040]   MG Seagler just did this-- turning off
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.080]   comments on their blogs.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.160]   And I thought his post was kind of interesting.
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:01.120]   He said, it's not my job to give you a bully pulpit.
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.000]   If you have something to say, get yourself a blog or a Twitter
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.040]   account or a Facebook.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:10.080]   And I still have comments on my blog.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.280]   I think comments are great.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:18.200]   But I have to say that especially for somebody who
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:23.480]   is a lightning rod like MG is, comments really just
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.680]   deteriorate very quickly.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.440]   Yeah, I used to defend comments because it
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.760]   was the means of having a conversation online,
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.800]   online's about conversations and power
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.320]   of the people and all that.
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.640]   But there's nothing requiring us to get noise.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.160]   And I just had an exchange just now
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.240]   an email with a flak who sent me something.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.080]   And I just put on an unsubscribe coming back.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.840]   And she yelled at me for that.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.360]   That was rude.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.400]   I said, well, it was rude for you to send me something
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.200]   I didn't ask for.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:53.080]   I love it when I freeze in an unhappy position.
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.200]   As you have.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:54.760]   As I have.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.000]   You do look like you're receiving email
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.920]   you don't want right now.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.600]   Or something else I don't want somewhere else.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.080]   I don't want it.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.160]   Yes.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.520]   But-- I'm sorry.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:08.840]   It's distracting, isn't it?
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.720]   Help unfreeze me.
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.280]   There he goes.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.360]   There we go.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.440]   So I was writing a post.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.280]   I haven't put it up yet.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.160]   I was about to put it up about email.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.440]   And Bob Wyman, the brilliant Bob Wyman founder of Pub/Sub
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.000]   and other things, who's now at Google,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.200]   sat me down one day and explained that the real problem
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.400]   with mail is that it's sender controlled, not recipient
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:29.720]   controlled.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.120]   And he's absolutely right.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.880]   And when you kick that through, that's the whole problem.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.280]   And that's what changed everything.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.400]   And Google+, because I think we might have
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:43.080]   discussed in the show before, is in almost all recipient
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.880]   controlled.
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.880]   You see the stuff that you have agreed to get.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.240]   And if it's not recipient controlled, it becomes spam.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.640]   So that's why they used to be able to send us notifications.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.280]   Anybody could.
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.040]   That became a spam.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.120]   So now we all turn off notifications
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.640]   from anyone we don't follow.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.480]   It does limit the serendipity a bit,
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.760]   but it gets rid of that.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.360]   Comments are still spam worthy because somebody we don't know
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.560]   can put something in there.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.480]   But we have more controls to kill that.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.320]   So whenever the recipient loses control, it becomes noise.
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:16.080]   And that presents--
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.160]   Just like phone calls.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:19.560]   Yes.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.840]   That's why we hate telemarketing.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:22.400]   Right.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:22.740]   Right.
[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.360]   And that's why what gave us more control.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.560]   Well, to an extent, the voicemail did.
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.880]   But then the obligation fell to us to return the call.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.760]   To an extent ID did.
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.640]   But then there's fights about that.
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.760]   And so we fight around this so much.
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:43.520]   It just seemed somehow wrong to post
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.520]   and not engage in conversation about the post.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.920]   That's the ultimate in broadcasting, right?
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.680]   And I thought we were moving beyond broadcasting
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.760]   to conversation, but maybe not.
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.480]   But it gets ruined.
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:55.720]   It gets--
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.360]   It gets ruined by trolls and people who are not really
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.440]   engaging, they're just spewing.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.800]   But what do you do about that?
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.880]   I mean, Fred Wilson's blog has magnificent comments
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.400]   because he gives a lot of care and feed.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.280]   And he values them.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.320]   And I respect that about him.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:15.600]   Maybe I'm just more hateful than he is.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.440]   And I get junkie comments, but I just
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.920]   don't want to bother to some extent.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.800]   It's a lot of work.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.200]   It is a lot of work.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.440]   I'll give you an example.
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.560]   And I get hate mail every day about this.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.680]   But we have, as you know, a very active chat room.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.600]   There's 773 people in it right now.
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.680]   And in order to keep that chat room from descending
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:38.000]   into the eighth pit of hell, which every IRC chat, every form
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.560]   does, we have a dozen moderators at all times.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.400]   I didn't know that.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.800]   I never knew that.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.720]   We have Dan, Bear, Brass.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.920]   Right now, CWBP, Darth Emma, Hip, Legat, Life's Azoo,
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:56.080]   Marmot, Mick, Nightflyer, Slyfer, Texan, TTK, and Warpoli.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.880]   Those are all mods.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.360]   Thank you all, mods.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.280]   And I get email all the time from people.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.120]   So I was kicked out of your chat room.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.720]   And what people don't understand is, yeah,
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.040]   the minor infraction that they were kicked out for,
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.400]   and often it is minor, multiplied by 1,000
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.200]   becomes an unusable thing.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:15.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:20.440]   And so I do think that to create a community requires
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.440]   immense amount of care and feeding.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:22.920]   It does.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.640]   And you know, John O'Bacon wrote a book on the art of community,
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.800]   which I think is a good start.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.800]   But mostly, I think the takeaway is,
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.320]   you've got to participate heavily to keep that moderated
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.040]   and to keep that good.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.240]   I also think, in this post-arm reign that I'll put up in a day
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.960]   or so, that we also need new norms where we redefine what's
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:45.600]   rude.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.480]   Right?
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.240]   It's almost seen as-- where we carry over the old norms,
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.400]   world communication that says, if you don't respond to somebody
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.720]   that's rude.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.760]   The new rude needs to be-- if you send me something
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.960]   I didn't ask for and you expect me to respond immediately,
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.000]   that's rude.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.960]   And I know you've admitted, I think in the past, Leo,
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.320]   that for certain kinds of communications,
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.200]   you're not going to touch it until you get sent two or three
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.160]   times.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.040]   Right?
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:09.600]   Right?
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.560]   This would be just-- and I can't.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.200]   If it's that important to you, then try two or three times,
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.400]   I'll pay attention.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.600]   And I'll admit that I'm on certain kinds of communication.
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.920]   I'm like that, too.
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.080]   And in the old days, that was rude.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.960]   But now it's rude to give us noise.
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.440]   Right.
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.080]   So no such thing--
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.520]   Especially pitches for things, like requests for things,
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.480]   even among your friends.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.760]   I mean, if someone-- if PR people email me and I don't respond,
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.480]   it just means I'm not interested.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:32.480]   Right.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.400]   Or if I'm--
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.000]   Stop bugging me.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.840]   Bladed friends have learned that if they don't--
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.880]   if they ask me to help them with their phone
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.800]   and I don't respond, it means I just
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.600]   don't know what to help you with or whatever.
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.000]   Lately, there has been a trend.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.480]   I don't know if you've noticed this, Kevin.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.000]   From PR people to send three or four follow-ups saying,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   I didn't see a response.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.520]   I was wondering, did you want me to do that?
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.640]   Just making sure you didn't miss your opportunity
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.360]   to meet with--
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:54.620]   No.
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.620]   I'm ignoring you on purpose.
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.280]   I'll be in New York next week.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.960]   And hey, I notice you're in New York in my case.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.520]   You must get a mess of those before CEOs are in New York.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.240]   I can't use my email for three or four months before CES
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.880]   and then for three or four months after.
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.520]   So really, if you don't get an email from me,
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.520]   it's only you have to email me in the summer.
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.280]   That's the only time I can--
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.040]   I can accept to read email.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.360]   Oh, it's amazing.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.040]   You're like a Japanese samurai.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.520]   You only venture out that you collect it all in the fall
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.020]   and green form and bring it home.
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:29.460]   Yeah, it's just--
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:30.740]   I think we are in a--
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.940]   I think your next book, Jeff, your sequel to Public Parts
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.620]   has to be the rude society.
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.620]   Well, I'm thinking about just that, Leo.
[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.820]   I'm thinking about new norms.
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.420]   What occurred to me in the whole privacy debate
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:47.340]   is that we're trying to put old behaviors onto a new reality
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.980]   and when it doesn't work--
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:49.480]   Ah.
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.540]   --we go crazy, right?
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:53.220]   And so you could think of so many areas where that's true,
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.620]   but email and communication is a great one.
[00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.140]   But so much of the rest of society
[00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:58.640]   have been taking notes and notes and notes and notes.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.420]   But what we're really doing is we're just adjusting our norms.
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:05.520]   And that's a process of negotiation that occurs.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:06.260]   You know, what's it rude?
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.260]   Is it rude when you're standing and talking with someone
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.560]   to pull out your phone and read it?
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:09.900]   Right.
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:11.940]   Right?
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.160]   It depends on who it is.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.180]   I wouldn't say it's rude.
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.560]   There's a new meme I've been seeing on Twitter and on G+
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.580]   for when the power technorati gather.
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.300]   They do a stack of the phones.
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.620]   Everybody's supposed to take out the phone
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.620]   and put it in the middle of the table.
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:29.020]   And leave the-- you can leave the beeping and buzzing on.
[00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:29.980]   That's OK.
[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.860]   And the first person to reach for his phone
[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.220]   pays for the meal.
[00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.540]   Brilliant.
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:36.820]   Brilliant.
[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:37.620]   And then you're never going to get--
[00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.260]   I don't understand the stacking thing, though.
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:39.700]   I mean--
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.260]   Well, you don't have to stack it.
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.460]   It doesn't have to stack.
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.860]   They said you could stack it or you could put it on.
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.940]   And I like the idea-- and I've started using it myself,
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.340]   just putting the phone out on the table
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:49.540]   as my own personal challenge.
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.860]   But I was always hoping it would be like a jangle
[00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.060]   like-- I always thought it would be like a jangle-like thing.
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.780]   Like if your phone goes off and you
[00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.020]   can extract it from the pile--
[00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:57.580]   Oh, like jangle.
[00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:58.500]   --it does not knock your phones.
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:59.700]   Then you can.
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.860]   But then it makes you really, really want to read that email.
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:02.540]   Oh, that's good.
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:03.260]   I like that.
[00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:07.060]   Well, that's an additional rule we can add, the jangle rule.
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.980]   We put it in a stack this way.
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.340]   You have to do it like this.
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.420]   And then if you can get your phone out without knocking--
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.460]   Delillo, you'd have half the stack.
[00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:16.740]   I'm already there.
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.100]   I've already got a jangle stack.
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.540]   It would penalize people with really thick cases.
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.260]   More so than Steve Jobs didn't even want them to be.
[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:23.900]   That's true.
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:24.420]   That's great.
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.060]   That's a great point, yeah.
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:27.420]   And then you got the rubbery case.
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:28.900]   You can't yank out.
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:33.180]   People with-- there'll be a market for slippery cases.
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:34.180]   Great.
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.740]   The new Android phones are more slender
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:37.660]   so you can pull them out.
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:38.260]   That's right.
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:41.180]   That's right.
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.380]   What's your kid's behavior versus yours, Leo?
[00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:47.580]   My kids yell at me because I'm so bad.
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.020]   You know, I stopped doing force-grow.
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:50.820]   But when I was doing force-grow, the first thing
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:52.340]   I had to arrive anywhere, like a restaurant,
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:54.300]   we arrive all fomie.
[00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:55.860]   And I have my phone out checking in.
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.180]   And it takes up 30 seconds or a minute.
[00:23:58.180 --> 00:23:59.260]   And they yell at me.
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:01.100]   They do not like me to do that.
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.060]   On the other hand, we were at dinner the other night.
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.220]   And my wife says to Henry, my 17-year-old,
[00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:08.900]   we could see the glow of your phone.
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.340]   Holding in your lap does not hide the fact
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.460]   that you are in fact texting right now.
[00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.460]   It just means you eat at fewer French restaurants.
[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:20.780]   You're in the beating at more like open-air restaurants.
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.140]   Yeah.
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:23.500]   On the side.
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.380]   Kitty, it's girl.
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:31.620]   I remember vividly--
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.540]   texting wasn't very popular here in the States
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:34.580]   until a few years ago.
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:36.700]   I remember vividly about five years ago,
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:37.740]   sitting in a square.
[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:39.060]   I can't remember if it was Italy or France.
[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.140]   I think it was Italy.
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:42.420]   And watching people go by, and they
[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:45.460]   were buried in their phones because texting took off earlier
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:46.900]   in Europe than it did here.
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:48.500]   And I thought that is really weird.
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.140]   And now, of course, everywhere you go,
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.460]   people are buried in their phones.
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.300]   That's all that you see everywhere.
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:59.180]   I don't know what to say about it.
[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.220]   It's just the way it is.
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:00.700]   And I'm--
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:01.300]   That's what I say.
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.380]   Anybody.
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:02.900]   Yeah.
[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.060]   I mean, I think we have to--
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.820]   if we're going to be talking to Siri on the street,
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.220]   these are just cases where we're going to readjust.
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:13.140]   And to tell people you can't change your behavior just
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.700]   doesn't work to tell you can't change industries.
[00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:16.220]   Doesn't work.
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:17.260]   We are going through change.
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:20.460]   And we're trying to figure out how to adapt to that.
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.100]   And you're right.
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.100]   And what's rude.
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.140]   This is what Tim O'Reilly also says.
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:25.340]   It's not about laws.
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.540]   It's about norms.
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:31.180]   We need to pass norms.
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.620]   Has he written about that?
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:33.020]   I don't know.
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.580]   I saw him speak at a food camp about it.
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.420]   And I can't remember.
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:42.500]   I think the context was probably soap or something like this.
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.340]   But his position was the government and laws
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.420]   are not the solution to these kinds of things.
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.220]   We've had norms for years.
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:52.780]   A lock on a door doesn't really stop anybody.
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:56.180]   You can walk down the street in most neighborhoods at night
[00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.140]   and look through windows.
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.860]   There are laws against both.
[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.900]   But really, it's the norms that stop people
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:05.300]   from walking up to the window and going, what's going on there?
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:06.860]   And norms are very effective.
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:12.940]   I look back at the lies we told.
[00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:14.100]   The first lie was once.
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.620]   I didn't get your email because it was broken.
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.140]   So we didn't tell the truth.
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.060]   We had to find the white lie.
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.260]   The next one was it got caught in a spam filter.
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.580]   And the spam filter's got that right.
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:23.860]   Yeah, next one right now.
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:24.940]   Email, yeah.
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.740]   Well, now it's-- you're not a priority in the inbox.
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.940]   And so we're not really adjusting the norms.
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.380]   We're just finding new lies.
[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:31.900]   Why?
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.300]   Catch up with us as technology takes away--
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:35.580]   excuse.
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:38.460]   And so we got to have the courage to say no.
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:39.980]   Or that doesn't matter to me.
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:41.340]   Or you don't matter to me.
[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:43.820]   Or you're bothering me.
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:46.980]   How do we find the ways to express those things in a way
[00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:48.380]   that we still consider to be civil?
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:55.260]   Silence is one way, by the way, yes.
[00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:59.220]   Empathy toward other people being as buried as you are, I guess.
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:03.180]   Empathy toward other people who either maybe
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.340]   don't want to get email notifications every minute
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:10.100]   on the minute, who only check their Twitter twice a day,
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:11.500]   that kind of thing.
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.220]   You can do what Dana Boyd did.
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:15.740]   Dana has more than once now taken complete email
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:18.020]   sabbatical for as long as--
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:18.540]   Montermore.
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:21.220]   So if you send her email, it will bounce back and say,
[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:22.180]   I'm not going to read this.
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:23.300]   I'm not going to see it.
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:24.500]   You can't get me.
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:25.940]   If you really need to find me, you
[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.460]   can figure out who my mother is.
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.580]   And I needed to reach her recently for something.
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:33.460]   I won't reveal the world and ruin it how I got to her.
[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:35.300]   Did you call her mom?
[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:36.940]   No, I actually did research.
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:38.860]   So I thought it was actually a violation of privacy
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:40.940]   to figure out what's her mother's name and where they live.
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.940]   And Pennsylvania, you're not that decent.
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:44.180]   That's worse.
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.620]   Let's figure your mother would do this.
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.300]   You know what's really bad?
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.180]   People now call my wife.
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:51.100]   They call my home number.
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.540]   And to get ahold of me.
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.780]   And I told Jennifer, you're not my appointment secretary.
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:57.420]   You don't have to help them.
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:58.940]   Please don't.
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:00.180]   And I get angry at people.
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.500]   I say, don't call my home number.
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.900]   Why are you calling my home number?
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.860]   It's radio stations and others who, well, have the home
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.980]   number, because maybe I sometimes
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:10.140]   do the thing from there or something.
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:11.580]   But that's terror.
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:17.380]   I mean, people get very annoyed when you're not available.
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.380]   Yep.
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.300]   People go to the clerk of courts to find you.
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.460]   They really want to get ahold of you.
[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:24.500]   Yeah.
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:28.340]   It's so tempting just to disappear off the grid.
[00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:30.260]   You couldn't bear that, would you?
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:32.460]   No.
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.180]   That's really why this is a discussion,
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.540]   because we love it and we hate it at the same time.
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:37.180]   Yes.
[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:38.180]   Yes.
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:42.860]   Um, CES is going on right now.
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:45.380]   That's why we're doing the show on a Monday instead of a Wednesday.
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:46.940]   In fact, after the-- immediately after the show,
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:49.100]   I'm going to get on the plane and go to Vegas.
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.300]   Most of our team is down there.
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:52.580]   And Google is down there.
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.140]   They made a big deal about being down there.
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.180]   And they're down there in a lot of different ways.
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.580]   Of course, there's Android phones.
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:01.060]   There's Android tablets.
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:05.380]   In fact, we're starting to see a number of televisions--
[00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:07.580]   LG just announced a line of televisions--
[00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:09.820]   running Honeycomb.
[00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:12.980]   Parrot, barely according to a Charlie Osborne writing
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:18.100]   for ZDNet iGeneration blog, Google is paying vendors
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:23.420]   to put Android in television sets.
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:25.020]   According to Neo, when Google has struck deals
[00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:28.060]   with multiple suppliers to include Android and the TV
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.380]   said maybe this is what Eric Schmidt was talking about.
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:31.740]   I think this starts to--
[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:35.580]   Yeah, well, we'll buy our way into TVs.
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.380]   Yeah.
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:38.140]   And it makes sense.
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:41.380]   There's revenue for them in their long run.
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:41.860]   Yeah.
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.300]   I mean, how much would they pay, though?
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.260]   I'm wondering.
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:50.140]   So these are TVs like Lenovo's is running Android 4.0,
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:54.580]   which I assume is not Google TV as you and Gina know it,
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:54.980]   right, Leo?
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:56.500]   Right.
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:57.260]   You have--
[00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:57.860]   Honeycomb--
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:59.300]   Yours is not technically an Android.
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.380]   It's a very particular framed version of Android.
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:03.540]   Well, it is Android.
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:07.260]   But yes, it's Google TV.
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:09.580]   So-- and in fact, that's part of the disappointment.
[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:10.780]   I wish it were--
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:12.540]   I wish I had full access to the Android market.
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:15.740]   But the issue, I think, is that the Logitech review,
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.580]   which is the one I use, doesn't have enough horsepower
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:19.740]   to run most of the-- I mean, you can't put angry birds on it.
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.340]   They won't run.
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:23.020]   I would guess.
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:25.100]   I'm just guessing.
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:26.060]   Right.
[00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:27.220]   So I don't know what--
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:28.820]   it says Android in this article.
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.020]   Does that mean Google TV?
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:30.740]   Does that mean Android?
[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:33.180]   I don't know.
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.380]   So which is more powerful to have?
[00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:36.380]   Google TV or Android?
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:36.820]   I'm confused.
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:39.140]   Well, it's not which is more powerful.
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:40.780]   I mean, Android is more choices because you'd
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:42.060]   have the Android marketplace.
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:43.060]   Right.
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.620]   I mean, presumably, Android means Android marketplace.
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.420]   It means some Google apps.
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:50.300]   Google TV doesn't have Gmail on it.
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:51.860]   It doesn't have Android marketplace.
[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:52.260]   It does.
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.660]   It has a limited Android marketplace
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:56.420]   with just a few appropriate apps.
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.100]   And I think that comes down to the fact
[00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:02.300]   that the processor in some of these devices is just not enough.
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.780]   Well, that's also the other news is Marvel.
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:08.340]   Not the comic book company announced a deal with Google
[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:13.780]   and is showing a box at CES.
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:14.500]   A reference box.
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:15.460]   A reference box.
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:16.020]   A reference box.
[00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:16.380]   Yes.
[00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.780]   So Marvel has a chip and a chip set that
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:24.580]   is used by a lot of embedded products.
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:29.260]   And by showing this, this Armada 1500 chip,
[00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:32.420]   they're basically telling people how to build it now.
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:36.460]   So 1.2 gigahertz chip, which means it's probably fast enough
[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:40.140]   to do a lot of the applications that you'd want.
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:44.100]   The Lenovo product is Android with a Snapdragon, 1.5 gigahertz
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:47.340]   Snapdragon, means it probably could play Angry Birds.
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.140]   Well, I really hope that's a reference to sign
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:51.500]   because it's an ugly looking box.
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.180]   It is ugly.
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:53.420]   It's ugly.
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:55.420]   Marvel doesn't make stuff.
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:55.700]   No.
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:55.980]   Yeah.
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.700]   No, they're just saying that you can--
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.700]   and they want-- you know, it's without a fan.
[00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:00.340]   It's small.
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.820]   It's cheap.
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:02.180]   OK.
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:02.660]   No power.
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:04.020]   That's the point.
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:07.940]   You know, it's basically looks like a Roku, doesn't it?
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:09.700]   Yeah.
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:13.540]   So I don't know what Google is paying these vendors.
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:17.340]   I guess it could be as much as $5 or $10 device.
[00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:19.300]   That would make it very attractive.
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:20.780]   Well, it becomes really interesting.
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:23.180]   I just saw just now on Twitter that you
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:26.780]   can get the low-end nook for free with a one-year subscription
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:27.860]   on it to the New York Times.
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:29.420]   Wow.
[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:32.540]   So the Times is giving away a nook, basically.
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:33.540]   Or--
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:35.620]   Oh, it's a global list.
[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.220]   We said this-- well, somebody is.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:38.260]   We said this would happen.
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.420]   That at some point, the content creators
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:44.340]   would be giving away these devices as a reader.
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:44.860]   Yep.
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:47.620]   Why-- it's got to save the New York Times a ton of money
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:50.300]   not to have to print it, right?
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.180]   Yeah, and it's the future strategy.
[00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:53.620]   It's the future revenue stream.
[00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:55.380]   And it's a way to get new customers
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:57.860]   they buy out of cotton, otherwise.
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:00.740]   You know, it's in the old days.
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:04.500]   But there's danger here, while Robinson was when I worked
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.260]   at Time Inc, the Sports Illustrated
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:09.100]   was famous for having the sneaker phone.
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.180]   And it was a--
[00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:11.100]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:14.660]   --and people were buying the subscription to get the phone,
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.140]   which is to say they weren't buying the magazine,
[00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:16.940]   they're buying the phone.
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:17.940]   They had to take the damn magazine.
[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:19.460]   I want my football phone.
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.420]   Yeah.
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:25.380]   Which means that at year end they cancel their subscription.
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:25.940]   Exactly.
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:26.440]   Exactly.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.840]   The Sports Illustrated was known to have a warehouse full
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.200]   of sneaker phones in some--
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:36.440]   --scandal of the circulation world at the time.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:39.520]   So the premium business can be a dangerous one.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.680]   Philadelphia newspaper has been giving away its own tablets
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.080]   with subscriptions, and it's not working very well.
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:47.080]   But that's something-- who wants the Philadelphia paper?
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:50.680]   And for the organizations that try to do this and think
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:54.360]   that they can trap you just because you get the device,
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:57.680]   no, they probably can't.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.680]   So there's some danger here, but it's still interesting
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.120]   that it does say that's the future,
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.440]   and that's where we had.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.880]   So we did see the Lenovo TV last night.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.960]   I think that they covered it when we did our live stream
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.040]   from the CES unveiled.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.600]   But we'll go over to the Lenovo booth and--
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:12.880]   Yeah, very curious.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:13.440]   Take a look at it.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.840]   Apparently it's running ice cream sandwich.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.320]   It's a 55-inch TV.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:22.160]   It's interesting because you've got computer manufacturers
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.120]   going to the TV business.
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.320]   And then you've got Visi on the TV company
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.840]   going to the computer business.
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:31.040]   That's really-- now we're really talking convergence.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:31.880]   You know, when you get--
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.960]   Well, what it says is, it's-- yeah, it's--
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.360]   who cares what the device is.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.640]   Everything is connected.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:37.000]   Right.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.280]   It is, clearly.
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.200]   Yeah.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.040]   I love the idea.
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:41.120]   Or full-size thinking.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.080]   It's full-size thinking the grass is greener.
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.000]   Oh, maybe that's it.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.040]   I'd rather be in the TV.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.720]   But the fact that Lenovo's making a TV really lends
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:50.840]   a little more credence to the idea of an Apple television.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.960]   Of course, Lenovo's a big Chinese conglomerate.
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:57.920]   They probably own TV manufacturing facilities.
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:02.000]   And I mean, they probably have a better end-to-end solution.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.560]   What do you think an Apple TV could be if you think like--
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.840]   I am one of those people who just doesn't get it
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:12.480]   who thinks Apple should not get in the TV business.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.240]   Although, you know, this Lenovo TV might make me think twice.
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:18.480]   I just-- you know, the TV is such a different business
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.920]   than the computer business.
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.360]   How do you--
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:21.000]   It's an awful business.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   It's a terrible business.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   Margins are terrible.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   It's changed constant.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   I have a friend-- someone I know in Buffalo who works for iLounge.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:36.320]   And the way he put it was that until Apple has a device that controls the entire experience
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:41.360]   from turning on your TV, watching something, turning it off, and knowing that when you
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:45.120]   come back to your TV, everything you would have wanted to watch is available.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:48.600]   He doesn't think Apple will do it until that is possible.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.440]   And as you all know and as previously say on the show,
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:56.840]   content companies aren't willing to be turned into pipes like that.
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:03.040]   So I don't think an Apple TV will exist until that is possible, until Apple can control
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:07.760]   the entire experience, you know, like it as with an iPad from start to finish, you know,
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:08.760]   on to off.
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:13.400]   And I'd be surprised if it was coming out in the next year.
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.280]   I think you're right, Kevin.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.760]   I think we're all going to be surprised because I think it is going to come out next
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.200]   year, but I just don't understand why.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.360]   It just baffles me.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.360]   So that quote in the book, the quote in the--
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.840]   He says we've licked it.
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.320]   Yeah, I've licked-- I figured out the TV thing.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:31.200]   That could mean we've conceptually licked it, you know, like--
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.440]   Doesn't mean it's a product, right.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:38.680]   The idea for the iPhone existed sometime before the iPhone was available as a device.
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:43.920]   You know, supposedly that whole thing about the-- or I mean the iPad actually, supposedly
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.760]   they kind of delayed development on the iPad to do the iPhone.
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:47.760]   Right.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.200]   And then the iPhone gave them their entree into the iPad market.
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.200]   Right.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.200]   Once they figured out the phone, then they'd figured out, oh, we've also figured out the
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:54.200]   iPad.
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:59.080]   It could be that type of thing where we have the idea for what we want to do, but it's
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.080]   not in place yet.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.080]   Right.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:05.480]   I think that quote is always-- has a lot of mystery behind it.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:06.960]   We shall see.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:07.960]   We shall see.
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.760]   We're going to take a little break.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:10.760]   We are here.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.000]   Kevin Purdy is here.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.720]   The Purd Man.
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:21.760]   Kevin Purdy on Twitter and Google Plus, freelance writer and expert on Android.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.840]   Good to have you.
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:24.840]   Thank you.
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.120]   Gina in the White House right now.
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:29.320]   I think Gina, has she tweeted from the White House?
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.320]   No, I looked.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.320]   I've seen--
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.320]   It's so cool if she said--
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.320]   It would be--
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:34.320]   I'd be in the White House right now.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.760]   They probably take your phone when you go in, right?
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.560]   No, I don't think so.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:39.560]   No?
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:40.560]   I don't think so.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.760]   I remember there was a guy named Rex Hammack.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:48.080]   He was a wonderful blogging guy who runs a custom publishing company in the South.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:52.000]   And he got a bit-- meeting with George Bush as a typical small businessman.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.240]   And he was tweeting-- he was not tweeting.
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.240]   He was blogging.
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.840]   There was no Twitter at the time.
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.120]   But he was blogging from leaving the Oval Office.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.680]   It was pretty cool.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:00.680]   Wow.
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:05.560]   We will watch carefully to see if she tweets from the Oval Office.
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:08.400]   I've just been asked to run as vice president.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.720]   Anyway, we miss Gina, but Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:17.600]   He's the author of Public Parts in this Professor of Journalism at City University of New York
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:21.120]   and a man who is really on the forefront of the new journalism.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.120]   I like that.
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.920]   Every decade has its own new journalism.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.800]   Well, it's what you need for a new century, Adil.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:31.440]   Yeah, this is journalism for the new century, OK?
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.760]   We'll be back with more in just a bit, lots to talk about.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.440]   But first, let's talk about backing it up.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:40.320]   We've talked about the cloud all the time and the idea of-- I think it's got to be very
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:44.600]   attractive of taking the data that's on your systems and putting it in the cloud so that
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:49.200]   it can be safe, accessed, and restored at any time.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:53.040]   But doing so can be a little tricky.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.240]   How do you do it?
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.280]   You set up an S3 account.
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.280]   That's why I love carbonate.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:04.760]   It really is a straightforward way to get cloud storage and cloud backup for everybody.
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:08.360]   Mac or PC, if you go to carbonite.com, you can see what I mean.
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.560]   Try it free for two weeks.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:10.560]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:14.000]   Just the off-code Twig, T-W-I-G.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.840]   They have-- the base carbonite account, perfect for a laptop, is everything on your internal
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:23.280]   drive for less than $5 a month for $59 a year.
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:26.160]   In fact, if you use Twig, you'll get 14 months for the price of $12.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:27.720]   So it's even more affordable.
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:30.840]   That backup happens whenever you're online.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:34.280]   It's very carefully designed not to slow you down or your internet connection.
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.920]   So it trickles the data up as changes are made.
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.520]   It's always kept up to date.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:43.560]   You can see that data at any time you log on to your carbonate account from any computer.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.560]   You don't have to install anything.
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.720]   You just log on to your carbonate account or on a smartphone.
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:52.520]   They've got apps for iOS and Android or even Blackberry 2 or on a tablet.
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:53.520]   And there's your stuff.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:54.800]   So it's cloud storage.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.520]   And should the worst happen-- and by the way, disasters always happen.
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.520]   You lose the laptop.
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.800]   You destroy the hard drive.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:05.480]   Or most commonly, you accidentally human error throw out something you really needed.
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.480]   It's right there.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.960]   It's up to date, always available.
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.760]   It's the best way to backup.
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.880]   Automatic offsite backup for less than $5 a month.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.760]   They do have plans for people who want to backup.
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:18.960]   External drives or multiple computers, it's all there at carbonite.com.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:22.920]   And use the offer code Twig for any of those, the home, the home office or the small business
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:23.920]   plans.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.320]   And you can use carbonite right now.
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.000]   They say backup, move forward.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.400]   I like that.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.640]   You got to back it up to get it back.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.000]   Do it right with carbonite.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.640]   C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.com.
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:39.960]   Use Twig as the offer code.
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:43.520]   The easy way to do the cloud.
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:52.360]   Speaking of cloud, I think it's almost now-- this is one of those buzz words that even
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:56.560]   if you have no idea what you're doing, you've got to offer cloud services.
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:00.040]   Lenovo, Acer, everybody at CES.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:05.520]   This is the cloud E-C-E-S is announcing some form of cloud service.
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:08.360]   The last year's trend was Android, right?
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.520]   This year is clouds.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:10.520]   I guess.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.520]   But who cares?
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.480]   Who was the Lenovo cloud?
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.960]   Well, you know, Dell's done this for a long time.
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:19.680]   Apple, of course, has iCloud now and Microsoft has SkyDrive.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:24.000]   Google, you know, Google, I think probably does the best job of this.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.480]   I don't know if people really know that you can upload any file to Google Docs.
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:29.600]   Do people know that?
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:30.600]   Not generally, no.
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:31.600]   Yeah.
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.000]   I'll give you an example.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.600]   Somebody would call the radio show and say, "Hey, I need a way to print my PDF.
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:39.520]   Acrobat's barfing on it."
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:44.760]   And the chairman said, "Well, just upload it to Google Docs and print it from there."
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:47.640]   Because they translate PDFs.
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:51.800]   So Acer's going to introduce Acer Cloud on all Acer PCs.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:55.760]   Instantly sync state across your PC smartphones and tablets.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:59.560]   Lenovo's personal cloud will also sync data across PCs.
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.440]   I don't know if it'll go to the Lenovo TV.
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:03.240]   Oh, yes, it will.
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.200]   It'll go to their K91 Smart TV.
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:08.400]   You can sync it to the cloud.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:15.320]   I can't imagine, though, the PC buyer who, two years after they buy their $400 Windows
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:22.160]   laptops says, "Well, I really want to upgrade to Mac, but on my summer basis, I can't think
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:26.960]   of a less loyal tech product than PC laptops."
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:30.120]   Also, these guys are not software wizards.
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:34.160]   The software interfaces on these tools is always horrible.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.160]   It's abysmal.
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:40.480]   My poor mother's Dell desktop PC has the Dell cloud backup thing installed.
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:43.320]   And man, that is not great.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:45.880]   I lack for words.
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:47.720]   It's not, it's very painful.
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:53.040]   We never, for years, I've always told my team when we go to cover CES.
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:57.520]   Don't decide until you get there what the story is because you might be surprised.
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:01.720]   And often there are, although lately, there have been fewer and fewer surprises at CES.
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:02.840]   But this one surprises me.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:06.680]   I did nothing cloud would be a buzzword at CES as your tablets.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.320]   Yeah, Android, yeah.
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:11.240]   A TV's, of course, but cloud.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:12.240]   Cloud TV.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.240]   Wow.
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.240]   There's some free marketing.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:18.640]   Get Dropbox to sign up with Lenovo and say, "Hey, if you buy a Lenovo PC, you get six
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.640]   extra gigs for your Dropbox."
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:21.440]   Why don't they do that?
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.440]   That's smart.
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:23.760]   It makes cloud to your brand.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:29.480]   I mean, find someone who's not device dependent and have them offer.
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:31.560]   Or, you know, carbonite or someone, anyone.
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.200]   Just don't make your own island.
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:36.080]   And Dropbox is such a good brand.
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:38.440]   Everybody knows it.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:40.280]   I mean, it may not be the best cloud service.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.440]   There's issues about encryption and so forth.
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:46.280]   But that doesn't, you know, for most people, for your mom, it's just, you know, just do
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.280]   it that way.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.800]   Don't make a Lenovo cloud.
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:49.800]   But part of this--
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:50.800]   I mean, you're right, Leo.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.120]   It's just the hot thing in the moment.
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:54.120]   It's me too.
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:55.520]   I didn't put this up to the list.
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:44:02.000]   But a report from Wanted Analytics that reports on recruitment says that there are 10,000 new
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.720]   job ads posted online the last night, days looking for employees with cloud computing
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:07.720]   skills.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:08.720]   What does that mean?
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.000]   That means that the person hiring doesn't know what the cloud is.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.360]   So it was a 61% increase.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:16.360]   Cloud computing skills.
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:17.360]   Yeah.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.360]   I've got mad cloud skills.
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:20.360]   Well, we're sending Greece.
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:24.320]   Hey, kid, use G-Mectin to wipe out the time.
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:26.640]   I've got mad cloud skills.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:27.640]   Well, good.
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:31.720]   Now you know, kids, how to get a job.
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:33.440]   Wild.
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:38.080]   So I guess Tom Hanks decided he was watching how Louis CK was doing the thing.
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:40.360]   And he says, I got to get on that internet thing too.
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:41.360]   He's going to do a web--
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:42.920]   Wait, get on the internet.
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.960]   He got on a suburb with the internet.
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.360]   Yahoo, it's called.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:48.360]   Oops.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.360]   Yeah.
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:53.320]   Electric-- yeah, Tom, you should have called me.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:57.080]   Electric City, an animated futuristic series he's been developing for years will premiere
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:00.240]   on Yahoo this spring, according to Associated Press.
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:03.320]   20 episodes, each three or four minutes long.
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:05.360]   This is another Me Too play, right?
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.360]   I got to have a web series.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:10.240]   Well, he's been trying this for a long time, the story he said.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:16.320]   And it's an animated series about the post-apocalyptic better life things he wants to say politically,
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.320]   which is great, which is fine.
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:21.480]   So he wanted to do it originally with puppets, it says.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:25.440]   Yeah, it's called Electric City, and he originally tried it to do it with puppets.
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:27.880]   So it sounds like it's circa 1982.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:34.320]   What was that horrible show?
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.320]   Alf.
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:36.320]   Alf.
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:38.560]   And then there was "fragl rock."
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.560]   Remember that?
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:40.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.560]   I guess--
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:45.560]   What was the ones going back that-- oh, god, it was a space one when we were kids, Leo,
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:46.560]   or age?
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.800]   Oh, yeah, supercar and thunderbirds.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.840]   Thunderbirds are a go.
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:55.840]   Yeah, because they all walked like this.
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:56.840]   They were marionettes.
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:57.840]   Yeah.
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:58.840]   It was ridiculous.
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:45:59.840]   No, protect.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:04.840]   I don't know if this is a soft puppet or a marionette.
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:06.080]   I doubt it was a marionette.
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:08.440]   Although Team America, that's right, Team America.
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:09.440]   I tried--
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:15.400]   You tried a dangerous generation wine nostalgia ground, Leo.
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:19.120]   Leo, here's the problem.
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:20.840]   He doesn't know who Alf is.
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:21.840]   Oh, come on.
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:22.840]   Oh, come on.
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:23.840]   Kevin's pretty.
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:24.840]   Kevin's pretty.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:27.440]   From Burger King, I had to send my mom to every Burger King in Central New York.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.440]   See?
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:30.000]   Alf was aimed at him.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   Oh, OK.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.880]   Yeah, he's aimed at him.
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:33.880]   And then "fragl rock."
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:35.160]   Am I not able to discern the quality, but--
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:41.080]   "fragl rock" was for stoners, basically, right?
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:42.080]   I think it was.
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:46.200]   Because it was originally on "Saturday Night Live," and it was like the weirdest bubble
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.200]   lane.
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:48.200]   It was the muppets for stoners.
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:54.400]   So Tom Hanks' show, though, does-- it supposedly touches on some interesting ground about a,
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:57.880]   like, almost like a more lock in upper level society, or above ground.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:58.880]   Everything's fine.
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:46:59.880]   Everyone has great internet.
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:00.880]   That's cool.
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:01.880]   I like that.
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.880]   And then underground, you know, there's all these issues with privacy and freedom of speech
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.120]   and stuff like that.
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:09.600]   But no one's seen a minute of it yet, so.
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:15.520]   I just-- there's this whole-- it's conventional wisdom that if you do a video on the web,
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:17.880]   it should be four minutes long.
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:20.480]   And if it's 10 minutes long, it's way too long.
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:23.160]   And I really wish that people would just do long form and stop.
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.160]   Yeah.
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.160]   It's television, kids.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:26.160]   It's OK.
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:28.440]   You can make a half hour show, Tom.
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:30.680]   It doesn't have to be four minutes.
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:32.480]   It's not even worth starting a four minute show.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.600]   And then I'll have a 30 second pre-roll.
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.600]   No.
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:36.600]   Yep.
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:38.600]   Felicia Day proved that with Dr. Horrible.
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:39.440]   Exactly.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.240]   And people love to watch that.
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:42.000]   I like it too.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.080]   And it's-- well, those are usually 10 minutes, 15 minutes, I think.
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:50.440]   I think you could be-- well, all our shows are two hours long, so.
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:52.160]   Another wrong kind of ask.
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:56.040]   But I just-- I think that that's conventional wisdom that I don't think is actually true.
[00:47:56.040 --> 00:48:00.480]   And I think what you get when you do short attempts in spam theater is you don't get the
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.520]   audience that you really want to sell to advertisers.
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:06.320]   It's just one of the reasons that the YouTube audience, despite the millions of views,
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:11.120]   is very hard to monetize because these people-- it's short attention.
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.400]   I watch my kid watch YouTube.
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:15.040]   You probably know the same thing, Jeff.
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:17.600]   You know, it's like Epic Meal Time.
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:21.520]   He's not going to buy anything advertised on that.
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:24.520]   It's not-- there's no engagement there at all.
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:26.880]   Yeah, and why is Google trying to get more long for them on?
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:27.880]   They must know something.
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:31.760]   I got a big-- I am starting to get more and more concerned.
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.760]   Remember, we did our year ender.
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.840]   You asked me, what should Google do?
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.200]   And it was completely off the top of my head.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:39.840]   I said, they should spin off or get rid of YouTube.
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:43.680]   And I'm starting to feel more and more that this is the case as I see you.
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.680]   Did you read the article in The New Yorker this week?
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.400]   No, I didn't yet.
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:53.640]   There is an article on streaming on YouTube's plans.
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:54.640]   They call it streaming.
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:55.640]   I see.
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:58.480]   I don't think of the live stuff that we're doing is streaming.
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:48:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:03.720]   It's not really-- it's watching video on the web, not live.
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:07.760]   They are really getting-- they hired this guy--
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:14.920]   I don't know how he pronounces last name, but they are getting very aggressive about
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:15.920]   this.
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:20.640]   And I just feel like Google, as we talked about last week, should not be in content.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:21.640]   No.
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:25.800]   Kevin, what do you think about this?
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:33.280]   So I don't mind if YouTube is the channel for which when the Oscars are on or let's
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:39.600]   say the Super Bowl or something like that, if they want to be the provider of web video
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.600]   for events and things like that, I think that totally fits their mission.
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:45.240]   Yeah, because they get the bandwidths to do it.
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:49.560]   They have the bandwidth, but it also brings people into looking at Google as a place to
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:53.320]   go for information and events and what's being talked about.
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:50:00.560]   But I guess I tend to agree that I don't think that original content creation is something
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:03.080]   that they should be trying to do.
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.840]   So they kind of accidentally do it as another matter.
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:07.480]   I'm not saying it's bad business for them.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:09.720]   In fact, it probably is very good business for them.
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:16.800]   I'm just saying it's bad business for me because of Google as being the arbiter of what
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:19.240]   exists on the internet, they have way too much power.
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:21.760]   And so they shouldn't be making content.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:29.640]   That's a conflict of interest because I'm a feared that if it's not on YouTube, it doesn't
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:30.640]   exist.
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:31.640]   Right?
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:35.600]   And when you subscribe to People's YouTube channels, which is currently kind of the method for
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:41.040]   monetizing YouTube, which channels do you see recommended to you?
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:43.360]   If you like this, you might also like this.
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:44.960]   That's a lot of power.
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:45.960]   A lot of power.
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:46.960]   Exactly.
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:51.400]   How much viewership do you get for the network from YouTube?
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:58.040]   Well if YouTube doesn't yank the show because of the right shootative copyright violations,
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:04.440]   it just varies to show some of our shows get a significant portion of our downloads, maybe
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:05.760]   30%.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:08.840]   Most of the shows, it's maybe 10% or less.
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:11.920]   So it gets magic, it's more heavy geek.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:12.920]   It's less?
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:13.920]   Yeah.
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:16.040]   iPad Today is a popular show.
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:21.000]   I think our Before You Buy show is going to be carefully cultivated for YouTube.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.320]   There's 19,000 views on a show that we didn't even put out as a podcast yet.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:32.960]   It was the rehearsal for our gaming show, which launches next week.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:37.840]   And then we had a couple of million plus view shows as well.
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:41.720]   But we also have a very hard time monetizing it because you turn on that switch and then
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:46.040]   Google says, "No, but you got copyright violations and turns it back off."
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:47.320]   So it's not a role.
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:52.720]   If you're not in the Google sphere, if you're not a Google partner and Google decides in
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:59.000]   arcane ways how to make you a partner, you really are second class on Google very much.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.160]   And that's the essence of your concern about them being content business.
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:04.440]   Yeah, I don't think they should be in the content business.
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:07.240]   John Seabrook's article is in this week's New Yorker.
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:09.880]   It's called Streaming Dreams.
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:15.880]   And the dream and the dreamer is Google.
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:18.000]   It's Google and its views.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.840]   Last week's Twig has 785 views.
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:22.520]   So it's not a big number for Twig.
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:25.280]   So talking head shows don't do that well.
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.360]   And it's talking with this guy, Robert.
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:28.360]   It's KYNCL.
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:29.480]   It's his check.
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:35.880]   So it's probably Kinshel or Kinshel who is the architect of all of this new content
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:36.880]   on Google.
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:39.160]   Well worth reading is a very interesting article.
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:43.000]   It's Scared the How Out of Me.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.440]   Well we try to, for instance, we try to become partners with YouTube Live and they told us
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:48.280]   we can't, you have ads.
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:50.520]   We do the ads, buddy.
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:51.520]   Yeah.
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:54.440]   Hey, let's talk about Twitter.
[00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:56.880]   Last week Rupert Murdoch tweeting now.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:59.840]   Alec Baldwin is back, baby.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:01.280]   I didn't even know he left.
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:02.280]   But he didn't.
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:03.280]   Oh yeah.
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.280]   After the airplane he left.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.280]   After the words with friends incident.
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:07.280]   Yeah.
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:13.680]   So now he's talking about politics conversing with his yoga teacher girlfriend and opining
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:16.160]   on Super Bowl picks.
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:21.640]   Daniel Lara Hertzfeld writing at News Brief Study W, I guess that's Entertainment Weekly.
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:24.240]   Is that your old magazine Entertainment Weekly?
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:25.240]   That's you, isn't it?
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:26.240]   Yep.
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.240]   Yep.
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.240]   Long, long ago.
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:29.240]   Jeff started that magazine.
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:32.440]   Did we talk about Howard Stern's drunk violin last week?
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:33.440]   No.
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:34.440]   We didn't.
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:35.840]   Howard, is this on Twitter?
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:37.000]   Yeah, I was on Twitter.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.960]   So Howard on New Year's, well he actually told the full story on a show that he got a
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:41.960]   call.
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:44.800]   The quick story is he has something like Google Voice.
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:47.600]   So the message came in, Paul is calling.
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:49.560]   He knew one Paul who was the new boss.
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:50.560]   He's going to have an American's God talents.
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:51.560]   We took the call.
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:52.560]   He had a pay attention.
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:54.480]   And he said, Paul, this is great.
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:55.480]   I'm really happy.
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:57.040]   I wouldn't be here to support for you.
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:58.720]   Boy, can you believe all his publicity we're getting?
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:01.320]   And he gets kind of confused silences in the other end.
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:05.960]   And finally the conversation goes on and he realizes this is not Paul, the British guy
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:06.960]   he's working with.
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:07.960]   It's Paul McCartney.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:08.960]   Oh my God.
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:10.920]   Calling to thank him for something nice he'd said.
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:11.920]   Oh my God.
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:14.240]   Longer than the short of it is he thought, you know, that just made my day.
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.120]   That was just the coolest damn thing to have a beat.
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:17.120]   It was great.
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:18.520]   So we thought, who can I do that for?
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:21.640]   So we wanted to call one of his backpackers, Mary Ann from Brooklyn.
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:23.960]   And then his wife said, why don't you just drunk dial people?
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:25.920]   Go on Twitter.
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:29.680]   And so we went on Twitter and said, tell me your phone numbers and by God, thousands
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:32.480]   and thousands went by and hours started calling people.
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:33.960]   He spent three hours on New Year's Eve.
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:34.960]   Good on him.
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:35.960]   It was really very cool.
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:36.960]   Oh my God.
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:37.960]   Is that cool?
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:40.280]   I, uh, I DMmed him.
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:43.360]   I abused him on the air once for, do it to forget him to follow me.
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:44.360]   So he follows me.
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:49.040]   I DM'd him my number and then he said back on Twitter, I can't, you're blocking call
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:50.560]   callers who bought their numbers.
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:52.360]   And I said, no, I'm not your screw up.
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:53.360]   It's not me.
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:54.360]   And in fact, I had.
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:55.520]   So I missed a call from Howard Stern.
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:57.120]   He tried to call you.
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:58.120]   Tried to call me.
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:00.120]   But it was very cool what he did.
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:01.560]   It was very, you know, it was, and it was, you know, he's kind of struggling and say, why
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:03.160]   do people think it's a big deal?
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:07.240]   But it's him looking at the audience as a relationship, not just your product and realizing
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:08.240]   that relationship.
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:09.480]   So it was cool.
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:11.440]   So he actually tweeted, just tried the number again.
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:14.440]   And the message says you do not wish callers who blocked their number.
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:16.600]   Jeff Jarvis always had problems.
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:17.600]   Folks.
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:21.880]   Because I said he always had problems with phones.
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:22.960]   Great speaking to so many of you.
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:24.640]   Amazing how great the conversations were.
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:29.160]   You know, pay, my phone number, of course, has leaked out many times on the air here.
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.880]   And many people have my phone number.
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:35.760]   And every once in a while, I happened yesterday, I was getting in the shower and a guy called
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:36.760]   and said, little bit visually.
[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:37.960]   Oh, I don't want to know that.
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:39.720]   Well, it was a blocked call.
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:44.600]   And actually I do answer blocked calls because some very close family members have blocked
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:45.600]   calls.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:46.600]   I wish they wouldn't.
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:48.280]   And so I have to answer blocked calls.
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:49.280]   So I answered the block call.
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:50.840]   I said, hey, just really love the show.
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:51.840]   And you hear the show?
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:54.560]   I'm sure you can hear the shower running in the background.
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:56.840]   And I'm kind of normally I would actually say thanks.
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:58.880]   It's nice to hear where you're calling from.
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:02.200]   But I said, you know, I was kind of brusque because I'm like, I'm standing here naked.
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:04.800]   You know, I.
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:06.760]   So it kind of goes both ways.
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:07.760]   That does.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:10.080]   Actually, I don't mind.
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:11.440]   I use Google voice.
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:12.880]   The number of people have is Google voice.
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:15.240]   So I can see if it's somebody I want to talk to or not.
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:18.600]   And so I, you know, most of the time people don't block their numbers.
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:22.480]   You're more likely to, you know, if I now I've given out the secret that if you block
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:24.880]   your number, I'm more likely to answer you.
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:25.880]   You're full.
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:27.880]   But I'm such an idiot.
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:31.200]   Hey, if Howard can do it, I can do it.
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:36.080]   But he, but I was responding to the tweet he said where I'm surprised actually these conversations
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:37.080]   are pleasant.
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:40.440]   Yeah, no, he loved it as fans were because his fans can abuse him online.
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:41.440]   But these were all really nice people.
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:42.440]   He had a great time.
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:43.440]   Well, thanks.
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:47.520]   One guy's secret, by the way, all of the trolling is anonymous.
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:48.520]   Yes.
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:52.120]   As soon as it's somebody and you're really face to face with them, people don't mean
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:53.120]   things.
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:55.040]   No, they were great.
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:58.700]   One guy he called one guy said, you know, a friend of mine is purple, a jic you would
[00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:01.400]   really make his day if you called him.
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:02.400]   And Howard did.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:04.960]   And he got the mother and the mother said, you know, come on, you're screwing my son
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:05.960]   here.
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:07.520]   And then I'm going to convince her that no, no, I really am.
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:09.440]   Howard Stern, the friends that I should call.
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:12.400]   Yeah, they had a nice chat with him.
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:17.560]   Now Kanye West, on the other hand, has been tweeting and completely incomprehensibly.
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:22.240]   This is a new, this is going to be the newest journalistic meme explaining what the hell
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:31.400]   they're tweeting MTV news actually did an article explaining what Kanye was talking about.
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:37.720]   A 91 message manifesto.
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:42.720]   Yee, Yee, who was currently in London, went off on a gang of topics, including his women's
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:43.720]   fashion.
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:45.280]   Oh, I guess they called Kanye.
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:46.280]   Yee.
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:47.280]   Yee.
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:48.280]   Yes.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:49.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:50.280]   I'm so unhip.
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:55.040]   He went off on a gang of topics, including his women's fashion line, the Grammys, his design
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:58:00.000]   ideas for the MTV video, video music awards, and his vision, he must have been high.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:05.520]   An organized but informative, Yeezy put the string of tweets into context and has 39 posts
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:09.680]   writing, "This is just a train of thought, but figure it's better to read than train
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:10.680]   thoughts."
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:15.040]   Somebody, I have to find this, it was on Google+, did illustrations of these tweets.
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:19.120]   I'm going to see if I can find this because it's very funny.
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:23.160]   Harvey, if you have anyone to apply that, Kanye lives inside his own head.
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:25.520]   Oh, it's just three more consciousness.
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:31.120]   Illustrate, I'm going to see if I can Google Kanye, illustrated tweets.
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:34.880]   Yeah, illustrated by a five-year-old.
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:39.000]   I bet it didn't affect his follower count at all.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   I bet nobody.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   People love it.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.040]   People thought it was the most interesting thing in there.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:47.240]   He's like the horsey books of rappers right now.
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:48.240]   Right.
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:49.240]   The teacher said I couldn't focus.
[00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:53.000]   I used to get kicked out of class for bringing dirty mags and drawing nikes in fourth grade.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.560]   There is a picture of him getting kicked out of class.
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:58.720]   I know this is not a very rapper thing to say, but I haven't bought a new car a piece
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:58:59.960]   of jewelry in about two years.
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:02.920]   Dear Kanye, we miss you, the car store.
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:04.080]   The car store.
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:05.080]   The car store.
[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:06.080]   Me.
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:07.640]   He believes cars come from the car store.
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:10.880]   I want to put creatives in a room together with like minds that are all way doper than
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:11.880]   me.
[00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:13.520]   You must be this dope to enter.
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:15.080]   I'm not dope enough.
[00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:16.640]   Oh, this is the one I like.
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:19.280]   My dreams keep me woke.
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:20.680]   Stay awake.
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:21.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:29.560]   This is from the buzz, which is a fun site about, you know, internet memes and stuff.
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:31.800]   You must be this dope to enter.
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:35.960]   Google, instead of kicking kids out of school for using their iPhones, why not promote it?
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:39.360]   Allow kids to use search engines to do tests.
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:40.360]   Who at?
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:46.960]   So he, the Google searches who had the best video of all time.
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:47.960]   Okay.
[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:48.960]   So now I've learned something.
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:50.960]   We call him Yee or Yee-Zee?
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:51.960]   Yee-Yee.
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:54.480]   I believe so.
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:56.960]   I'm so not with it.
[00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:58.520]   So on hip.
[00:59:58.520 --> 00:59:59.760]   Is our chat room any hip early?
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:00.760]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:01.760]   I don't know.
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.760]   They're much hipper.
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:03.760]   They're very hip.
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:07.520]   And of course, then you have the government, the US government saying, yeah, we can pull
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.080]   people off of Twitter.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:16.120]   And we have Joe Lieberman saying, you ought to get off Twitter because your Taliban, which
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:20.240]   is not, by the way, an illegal governmental, you know, it's not Al-Qaeda.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.480]   It's not a terrorist organization.
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:24.280]   You may not like them, but-
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:26.280]   Did you just open an office somewhere, I think?
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:28.040]   They just opened an office.
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.040]   So there you go.
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.040]   They did.
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.640]   But they want somebody to work on the cloud.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:38.080]   We're going to open the hiring cloud skilled people.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.840]   By the way, happy birthday iPhone.
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:45.040]   Five years old today, Apple announced the iPhone on this day in 2007.
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.520]   They didn't ship it till June.
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:50.000]   But I will never forget that speech effect.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.120]   And Steve Jobs passed away.
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:55.880]   That was one of the speeches that was shown over and over again because it was one of
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:59.560]   his best keynotes, the one where he says, you know, what did he say?
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.060]   It's a phone.
[01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:02.520]   It's an iPod.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.640]   It's an internet device phone, iPod internet device phone.
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.600]   And then it turned out it was one device, the iPhone.
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:09.680]   I'll never forget that.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:13.640]   I was sitting next to Scott Borne, I remember.
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:16.200]   And he was like, he was squeeing the whole time.
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.200]   He couldn't.
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:19.120]   He's so excited.
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:22.440]   I can't remember how much was known before the announcement.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.200]   How much leaked before the announcement?
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:27.240]   Scott thought it would be called iPhone.
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:30.880]   Everybody was pretty sure Apple was going to announce a phone, but we didn't know what
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:33.480]   it would look like.
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:34.480]   What do you think, Kevin?
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.480]   What do we know?
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:39.640]   I don't, I remember I was working in a newspaper and I had to write like a next day story for
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:40.640]   it.
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:45.280]   And it was, I don't think anyone was expecting the form that it came in, especially the
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:46.280]   one button thing.
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:47.280]   No.
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.880]   One button, no, one button and then all touch screen.
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:53.240]   Although in hindsight, it's obvious, right?
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:59.000]   But as always with Apple, oh, of course, because when you make something that is so,
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.840]   you know, so is the platonic ideal of something, then everybody goes, oh, well, of course it
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:03.840]   had to be that way.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:06.400]   But at the time, I, we knew there would be a phone.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.760]   We were pretty sure there would be a phone.
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:10.400]   There was no guarantee, but we were pretty sure there would be a phone.
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.400]   Scott Borne.
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:15.160]   The phone before that though, you know, Apple had teamed up with Motorola to make this really
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:18.400]   cruddy, you know, Moto rocker phone.
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.400]   Horrible phone.
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:23.840]   Yeah, all it did was it kind of synced to iTunes if you hated yourself.
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.480]   And you can only put a hundred songs on it.
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:27.480]   It was awesome.
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:28.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:32.560]   And I remember looking at the museum, the museum for those don't know, they have a collection
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:34.840]   of all the front pages for any one particular day.
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:38.480]   I don't think you could find a front page in America that didn't have the iPhone reveal
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:42.280]   at least like linked to inside the inside the paper.
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:43.760]   Everyone was caught so off.
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:44.760]   Huge.
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.760]   So huge story.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:53.000]   Any other stories we want to cover before we get to our tip?
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   Oh, let's see here.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.680]   Was there a little buff?
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:57.680]   Talk for a bit.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:00.800]   I have to run and get something for my tip or my turn.
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:02.320]   I shot return.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.320]   Talk amongst yourselves.
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.320]   Talk amongst yourselves.
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:05.320]   Oh geez.
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.080]   How's the weather in Buffalo, Kevin?
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:14.160]   Surprisingly warm, like global climate change, inducingly fear warm.
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.920]   It's snowed to the point where I had to scrape my car only twice this winter.
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:19.120]   I kind of like that.
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:23.560]   The whole city is not miserable enough and that makes them scared.
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:27.720]   Well, you know, like I'm not one of those folks who believe that like climate change
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.440]   can be based on how warm it is or whatever, like this particular day.
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:36.640]   But man, like I haven't pulled out snow blower at all this year.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:37.840]   It's freaking me out.
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:40.360]   It's freaking a lot of people I know out.
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:45.720]   But yeah, it's odd.
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.720]   So what else was I going to see a hairless list?
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:52.200]   Now you can have to plug your essay for think quarterly and explain what that could do
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.200]   that.
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:56.080]   Think quarterly is Google's kind of like McKinsey quarterly.
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:57.480]   They're kind of in-house thing.
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:58.680]   They send advertisers and such.
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.080]   And so they did an issue on speed.
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:01.080]   Misty Ward do something for it.
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:02.680]   And I said, yeah, I thought about it.
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:05.880]   I wanted to do a piece on something I've talked about here.
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:08.280]   The idea that the change is not happening as fast as we think.
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.440]   That is actually very slow.
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:11.240]   It's only just begun.
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.000]   And what does that mean?
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.320]   What will be changed by the internet and technology and society and all that?
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:22.360]   We think it's this volcanic huge lightning speed change upon us.
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:23.360]   And I think it's actually very slow.
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.360]   I think we've just begun.
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:26.000]   Oh, I was an interesting article, wasn't it?
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   I thought that was very interesting.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   That was fun.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   It was fun.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   The speed.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   The speed.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.840]   It's based on I'm guessing.
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:36.560]   I'm just going to guess that if you look, it has a reference to Gutenberg somewhere in
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:37.560]   there.
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:38.560]   I know.
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:46.680]   In terms of how long it took Gutenberg to, you know, for his ideas to actually go, it's
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:49.720]   a really cycled element that Kevin gave you comments.
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.160]   We glisteners, you get rewarded.
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:56.560]   You get to get some private insights here without even having to read stuff.
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:57.560]   All right.
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:00.800]   Unfortunately, I packed the thing I'm just going to get.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:01.800]   So I'll have to describe it.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:05.520]   We'll get to our tool, but it's I'm going to I'm bringing it to Vegas.
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:06.520]   So that's why I.
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:07.520]   Those magic box people.
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:08.760]   It's a magic thing.
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:12.480]   But let's start with you, Kevin, because you said that you at the behest of Gina Trepeney
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:14.480]   prepared a tip for us.
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:15.480]   Indeed.
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:16.760]   We have the Google+ guy here.
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:19.560]   I mean, this is the king of using Google+.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.400]   So I hope it's a Google+ tip.
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.400]   No.
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.400]   It's not.
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:24.400]   It's Android.
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:25.400]   I'm so sorry.
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:26.400]   Okay.
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:27.400]   No, you're also the king of Android.
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.400]   That's fine.
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.600]   My Google+ tip is somewhere on the internet you might be able to find a guide to using Google
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:31.600]  +.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.600]   Yes.
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.600]   And you should buy it now.
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:34.600]   You should probably.
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.080]   It's an ebook form.
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:41.560]   So I really I have a device problem where I'm always wiping my devices.
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:46.080]   I'm rooting my Android, you know, five times a year reinstalling operating systems for
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:48.360]   my laptops because I like to tweak things.
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:51.800]   And every time I go over to a friend's house, I have to ask them for their Wi-Fi password
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:55.560]   and they give me this look that implies they've given me the Wi-Fi password for their house
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.560]   eight or nine times this year already.
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.920]   Why do I have to keep doing this?
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:03.200]   And even if you've taken your laptop to work, you know, the local Starbucks, your coffee
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.680]   shop.
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:08.560]   You have the Wi-Fi password on your laptop, but not on your phone.
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:10.680]   And then you get there and you wish you had it and you can't remember it.
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:16.440]   So I found a really neat program recently in the Android market called Wi-Fi PC Sync.
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:19.360]   That's Wi-Fi all one word.
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:21.080]   PC Sync.
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:22.080]   Search for you.
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:23.080]   You have to scroll down a little bit.
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.800]   I think the developer recently had to resubmit it or something.
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:31.680]   But I checked it out and basically it takes all the Wi-Fi passwords off of your right
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:36.640]   now windows hopefully, so smart, takes all the Wi-Fi passwords off your Mac or excuse
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:42.680]   me off your Windows PC encrypts them, which I had to check and flings them over to your
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:43.680]   Android.
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.080]   So you don't have to enter anything.
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:46.080]   I love it.
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:47.080]   Nope.
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:50.800]   Every single Wi-Fi password on your Windows PC is over to your Android.
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:55.440]   And so therefore whenever you go somewhere, you know, your phone hopefully will see the
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:59.400]   Wi-Fi network detected and connect to it automatically.
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:03.920]   It makes me wish for like a service that was Dropbox like and did this for all your
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:04.920]   voice.
[01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:05.920]   Oh, there's a good idea.
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:06.920]   Yeah.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:07.920]   Yeah.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:08.920]   Let's write that right now.
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:11.720]   Yes, just kind of pull out the 3D book here.
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:14.440]   But no, obviously not.
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:20.600]   So if you have a Windows PC and you have an Android phone, this is the really great app
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:24.360]   that just, you know, will save you battery life actually.
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:27.040]   Wi-Fi almost always does better on battery life than 3G or 4G.
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:32.720]   So Wi-Fi PC sync in the Android market, free, grab it now.
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:33.720]   Very cool.
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:34.720]   Cool.
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:37.560]   I wish they did it on the Mac though, because all my passwords are Macs.
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:38.560]   Yeah.
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:39.560]   Yeah.
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:42.000]   Oh, I want to, I want to figure out how to write something like that.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.440]   That actually would be a great little thing.
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:48.640]   You press a button that goes to a encrypted folder on Dropbox and then you could run it
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:49.640]   on your other devices.
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:50.640]   Well, I like that.
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:51.640]   That's a good touch.
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:52.640]   That's a good touch.
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:53.640]   Oh.
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:54.640]   You see what I'm saying?
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:57.720]   So we can start off ideas.
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:00.560]   I bet I could write that in five minutes.
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:01.560]   We've.
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:04.400]   Jeff and Kevin talk amongst yourselves.
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.800]   I'll be right back.
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:09.480]   Jeff Jarvis, your tip of the week.
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:11.040]   My number of the week, I mean, yes.
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.400]   The week is $4 billion.
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:19.080]   Piper Jeffery says Google's mobile ad business will hit $4 billion this year.
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:24.040]   That for perspective is 9% of Google's total revenue of $40 billion.
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:28.440]   But it's also from perspective equals Facebook's entire ad revenue.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:31.040]   So just mobile.
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:35.320]   And I think that goes back to our earlier discussion on why would Google pay to get
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:37.760]   Android on TVs?
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:38.760]   Ta-da.
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:40.080]   They're going to make money.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:45.760]   And it's worth them to see that everywhere they possibly can and to win the TVOS before
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:47.080]   somebody else we know.
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:52.280]   Do you think that they consider TV mobile?
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:53.280]   I think Piper Jeffery might.
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:56.600]   I don't think Google does, but I think it's non.
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:00.360]   It's non computer devices, non laptop, non desktop.
[01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:03.200]   I think is mobile and mobile is, you know, meaningless, absolutely meaningless.
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:06.840]   Is it tablet mobile when most of its usage is inside the home?
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:09.800]   No, but it registers that way in these kinds of discussion.
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:10.800]   Right.
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:12.480]   The tablets, mobile is not mobile.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:13.480]   Mobile.
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:14.480]   Mobile.
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:16.400]   I have long argued on this show is a meanless word.
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:20.920]   It means, you know, a local it means around me.
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.960]   It just means it is with me.
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.720]   And the TV is where I am right now.
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:27.120]   And so that you, okay, I know where you are.
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.120]   You're in your living room.
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:29.120]   You're in your home.
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.120]   This is what you're thinking.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.480]   This is the kind of advertising I can give you as opposed to knowing this is a phone.
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:34.120]   And that is out somewhere.
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.120]   Right.
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:39.760]   So it's more signals generated, more revenue, more relevance, more revenue.
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:40.760]   I have to say.
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:44.160]   The division of a, the division of Motorola that Google bought was called Motorola Mobility
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.440]   and they make this that top box chips.
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:47.440]   Right.
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:48.440]   Exactly.
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:49.440]   So even more useless.
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:57.000]   A lot of people in the chatroom are suggesting that I instead of my pick tell you about this.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000]   And I will.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   It's called no SOPA.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   It's a Chrome extension.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   It's getting a lot of press.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.560]   You probably already heard about it.
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:06.120]   That when you visit a website like let's say the Motion Picture Association of America
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:10.840]   that supports SOPA, you'll get a big red bar on it that says this company is a known
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:11.840]   supporter.
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:18.920]   Now the only reason I'm not crazy about this is it's, it's, it's not always clear if this
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:21.400]   company is supporting, actively supporting SOPA.
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:27.480]   Now SOPA is fact, we talked about this on, uh, uh, uh, twit.
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:32.560]   It's maybe a stalking horse for IP protect, which is the Senate bill, which is more likely
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:36.040]   to get passed while everybody's paying attention to SOPA.
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:37.840]   There is an Android app that will also do this.
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:43.280]   Uh, you know, it's fun to just, uh, just see, um, the reason I, I, I, um, I worry a little
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:49.160]   bit about it is because, um, Ford is widely accused of being pro SOPA.
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:52.000]   In fact, uh, Ford is not pro SOPA.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.240]   Uh, uh, I'm going to actually have dinner with Alan Malawi tomorrow and ask him to clarify
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:58.240]   that.
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:02.720]   But Scott Monte has tweeted and said the Ford never went on, on the air supporting, uh,
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:04.640]   or said anything supporting SOPA.
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:09.200]   There was an older statement pre SOPA, pre SOPA even being a bill saying we do support,
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:12.280]   uh, private, you know, public, uh, IP rights.
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:16.840]   Um, but so this is, this is where I worry a little bit about this bar is I don't know,
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:20.680]   you know, Ford is getting that red bar and I don't know where they're getting this information
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:21.680]   from.
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:22.680]   Right.
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:23.680]   In this case, it's kind of anecdotal.
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:27.520]   It is not in fact, uh, the case that's Ford supports SOPA.
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:29.760]   And it gets more complicated too because you're right.
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:30.760]   It's not just SOPA.
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:32.400]   It's protect IP and then there's the new Darryl Isabill.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:33.400]   Exactly.
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:37.400]   It is getting some support from some tech companies, but all that really reveals to me
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:40.880]   is that once again, we're wrong to put the tech companies in the position of protecting
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:46.080]   the internet, we want to protect the internet from all those parties, government and companies.
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:47.080]   Right.
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:52.000]   And, um, the thing I was going to show you, I don't have it and I don't, it was actually,
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.160]   I, you know, so I was looking for a clip when I had the nexus, you know, one of the things
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:58.080]   the nexus does is time lapse.
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:02.160]   And I, and I was doing a bunch of time lapses for my car and I was looking for a way to
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:08.320]   mount the Google Nexus phone, the Samsung Nexus, Galaxy Nexus into my car so that I
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:10.200]   could do time lapses out of the window.
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:15.560]   And the chatroom suggested a fantastic suction cup clip that is, it was cheap.
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:20.160]   I bought it on Amazon and in fact, it's so good that even though I'm not just, I no
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:26.400]   longer have the Google Samsung Nexus, um, and I have so it means I no longer have ice
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:27.600]   cream sandwich.
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:31.600]   Even on my, uh, my old Galaxy S two, I want to, when I do videos, I'm going to do some
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.360]   videos from C.E.S.
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:38.480]   I'm bringing this clip to C.E.S. and that's why it's in my bag that it, it holds any phone
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:41.160]   very gently, very securely.
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.400]   And it's really fantastic.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.400]   Do you remember chatroom?
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:46.880]   Um, I'm going to have to ask you guys the name of it.
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:51.360]   I want to say the XO clip, but I, it's something like the XO clip and now I can't find it.
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:52.360]   Somebody says GoPro.
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:57.680]   No, no, the go, go pros are those great little cameras, but this is something that will hold
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:58.680]   your smartphone.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:01.440]   It works very well with the iPhone is anything else.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.440]   And it's fantastic.
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:07.760]   And very specifically for, uh, ice cream, sandwich, Android 4.0 that does the time
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:08.760]   lapse.
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:09.760]   It's so cool.
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:10.760]   Well, it isn't.
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:11.760]   Yeah.
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:12.760]   It is the XO clip.
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:13.760]   All right.
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:17.120]   Well, um, I'm trying to, I'm trying to find it online.
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:18.120]   It, thank you.
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:19.880]   Chris is the guy who told me about it.
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:22.640]   And I highly recommend, or XO gear, XO mount.
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:23.640]   That's it.
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:24.640]   That's it.
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:25.640]   XO gear.
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:26.640]   XO mount.
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:28.960]   And it is fantastic for holding a phone.
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:29.960]   It's cheap.
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:32.560]   You can get it on, uh, on, um, for 16 bucks.
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:35.520]   Uh, it's on Amazon for 20 bucks.
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:36.760]   That's where I bought it.
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:40.720]   Um, and it's, it really works, uh, really well for holding your phone.
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:42.160]   It's very cool.
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:47.200]   So it's just a little doodad, but there are a number of programs, uh, heads up displays
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:49.200]   and so forth that you might want to have on your phone.
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:52.760]   And if you're using the ice cream, sandwich, time lapse, it's really great for doing time
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.760]   lapses out of your window.
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:56.840]   Oh, but don't, don't watch videos, people.
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:57.840]   Don't watch videos.
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:58.840]   Okay.
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:13:59.840]   I'm going to confess.
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:00.840]   I'm going to make a confession.
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:05.280]   Oh, I wasn't watching videos, but I did make a few Skype calls with the thing.
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:07.280]   Uh, that's okay.
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:08.280]   Oh, Skype calls.
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:14.040]   Oh, so I did, I did a Skype call with Rick Salmon, who's a great photographer.
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:15.840]   And his video is there and he can watch me.
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:16.840]   I'm driving along.
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:20.240]   We're talking and he's clipped up there and he's watching me.
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:23.800]   And, uh, the phone went out, the call went out and he called me back.
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:25.400]   He said, did you have an accident?
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:29.880]   I had to call back to make sure that you were all right.
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:30.880]   It's pretty fine.
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:35.200]   My problem is I'll be on calls on, in the car and I, I, being me, I will use words
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:38.800]   that one won't use on twig, uh, aimed at other drivers.
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:39.800]   Yes.
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:40.800]   In the middle of the call.
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:45.040]   Something I'm just a normal sentence that I'll say, ah, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.840]   I'd be afraid to actually switch from the front to the back camera and all of something
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:49.840]   other person would see like the road coming out.
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:50.840]   How are you driving?
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:51.840]   Yeah.
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:52.840]   Yeah.
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:53.840]   Right.
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:54.840]   That's cool too.
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:57.680]   So this is, you know, it's a cheap little doohickey, but I, it's the first one I found that really
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:02.200]   makes it easy to put your phone in your windshield and the clip just never comes off.
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:03.200]   It's really good.
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:05.040]   Even on a dashboard, it doesn't have to pass.
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:07.560]   Well, it says, it's got some sticky.
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:09.840]   It's better on, they say yes on the dashboard.
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.360]   I always put it on the glass.
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:15.720]   Uh, so, so if the dashboard's not too pebbled, it works.
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:16.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:17.720]   It works.
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:20.120]   You can turn off the bad synthesizer music.
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:24.760]   Um, they say it'll look at, they're holding a 26 pound microwave.
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.160]   No, come on.
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:27.160]   Yeah.
[01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:29.920]   It's a pretty good suction cup.
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:33.440]   Now I have to watch it.
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:35.440]   I guess it'll work or they wouldn't put it on.
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:36.920]   They look around the office.
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:37.920]   What's heavy here?
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:39.480]   What can we look at a microwave?
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:41.080]   It's not even more accurate.
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:42.320]   Look at that.
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:45.440]   It's lifting a 26 pound microwave.
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.440]   Can your car do that?
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:47.440]   All right.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:48.440]   Does it make it good?
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:52.080]   Just general smartphone dock or is it only specifically for this like shooting purpose?
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:53.080]   No, you could.
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:57.440]   Well, basically it's got these nice rubberized clips that will hold any, any roughly any
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:58.440]   shape like this.
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:01.320]   So I've used it both the iPhone and the Android phone.
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:04.720]   And what, the reason I'm bringing it to Vegas is because I'm going to put it on the table
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:06.760]   and do videos and say it's like it's better than a tripod.
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:08.520]   Because how do you do a tripod on a phone?
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:09.520]   You don't.
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:10.520]   So you need a clip.
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:11.520]   Yeah.
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:12.520]   Right.
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:13.520]   Anyway, it's fun.
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:14.520]   I'm just, I'm just saying.
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:17.000]   I'm sorry it's in the car.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.440]   Kevin Purdy's newest book.
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:19.920]   Of course he wrote the Android book.
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:20.920]   Uh, the, what is it?
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:22.560]   The complete guide to Andrew?
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.120]   The complete Android guide.
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:25.120]   Yeah.
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:26.120]   Must have.
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.600]   And his newest is Google plus the missing manual, the book that should have come with the
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:33.760]   site just came out from O'Reilly, get it right now.
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:37.160]   And I would have a copy in my hands, but I haven't got it yet.
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:39.560]   I do have a copy of this as Jeff Jarvis's book.
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:40.560]   Thank you for the plug.
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:41.920]   Great book, public parts.
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:46.080]   And of course his previous book, which is also a must read, what would Google do?
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:49.600]   And Tom getting on a call shortly, Google's going to announce some stuff tomorrow related
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.400]   to pluss and searching things.
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.200]   Yeah, they're, they're serious.
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:55.400]   Seriously, I think it's very interesting.
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:56.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.400]   Sorry, Kevin.
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.040]   It's going to the way of wave, man.
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:00.040]   It's over.
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:02.040]   No, I can update the book.
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:05.440]   There's, there's some, there's some neat stuff coming.
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:06.440]   It's a bargain for tomorrow.
[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:07.840]   Neil, what was the new bargain stuff?
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.640]   I, I, I figure out the fact that.
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:10.640]   Yeah.
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:13.520]   So, uh, you listen to it and then we'll talk about it next week.
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:15.400]   I guess I'll know because I'll be at CES.
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:17.360]   I'm actually about to get on the plane.
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:21.800]   Uh, and we will begin our, uh, well, we began our coverage last night, but our next, uh,
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:26.360]   CES, uh, live coverage is the Microsoft keynote, the very last Microsoft keynote.
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:29.760]   Microsoft's announced it will not be going back to CES after this year.
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:31.240]   Steve Balmer will be speaking.
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:35.000]   And there are very strong rumors that Steve might be showing some unusually interesting
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000]   things.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.240]   Uh, Microsoft's keynote history is kind of checkered.
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:40.240]   Yeah.
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:42.400]   It's worse than checkered.
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:47.400]   They basically have never shown anything of, of interest, but, uh, they, they, they,
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:49.560]   they apparently there's going to be a, a connect pro.
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:51.520]   I've heard rumors, just be a connect pro.
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:55.840]   Uh, they will have that new Nokia phone, which, uh, it's actually going to give Android
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:57.840]   and iPhone for money, the money.
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:58.840]   Yeah.
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:17:59.840]   This is nice.
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.360]   Uh, no key at 900 slash ACE.
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.360]   I think.
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:03.360]   Yeah.
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:04.360]   The ACE is the key is the code word, huh?
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:05.360]   Yes.
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:06.360]   The 900 is beautiful.
[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:10.240]   I mean, I love the N nine and this is the N nine with windows phone seven, an actual
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:11.240]   operating system.
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:15.640]   The New York Times wrote a slathering, a long piece about how wonderful a windows phone
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:17.320]   is and who would have guessed it?
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:18.480]   It's, it's, yeah.
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:20.280]   It's better than you'd expect.
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:21.280]   Yeah.
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:24.320]   Well, the piece was like critics love it.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:25.320]   Now what?
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.320]   Right.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:30.040]   Well, one of the things apparently Microsoft is going to start doing, and this is according
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:36.600]   to a Paul Thorett of Windows Weekly, is offer spiffs just as Google and Apple do to the
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:40.920]   salesmen and saleswomen in the phone stores, uh, to sell windows phone.
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:43.960]   Because you go in an AT&T store, it's very hard to get them to sell you at a windows
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:44.960]   phone.
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:48.440]   They'll, they'll steal you towards a, steer you towards an iPhone or an Android phone
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:51.080]   first because they make 25 bucks.
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:52.080]   Yeah.
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:55.520]   So, uh, Microsoft's announced, yeah, we're going to do this.
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:56.680]   So, uh, yeah.
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:57.680]   So exciting.
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:01.360]   So we'll start that coverage of the keynote and Paul and Mary Jo will be commenting in
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:06.760]   the background, uh, at six 30 Pacific nine 30 Eastern tonight.
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:09.840]   Right after that, uh, we go to the digital experience event.
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:14.680]   Another one of those ballroom events where lots of vendors show up and Tom Merr and Sarah
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:16.800]   Lane will be hosting, uh, there tonight.
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.560]   I'll pop in as soon as I get off the plane.
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:21.920]   I'm going to go right over there because they have a chocolate fountain.
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:28.040]   I just want to bathe my head in it.
[01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:29.160]   Thank you so much, Jeff.
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:31.760]   Thank you, Kevin, for filling in for Gina filling in.
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:34.760]   So basically, Kevin, thank you all for being here.

[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:50.520]   Do you recommend for podcasts on Android, Kevin?
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.680]   I like listen, listen, okay.
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:59.600]   Yeah, I guess I'm not a power podcast listener, um, even though I'm occasionally on them, but,
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:05.840]   uh, yeah, I like listen, some folks like a cast AC AST, um, those, you know, those ones
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:06.840]   are often here recommended.
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:12.320]   I'm looking for a good pod catcher on, uh, on Android dog catcher.
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:13.320]   That's a good one.
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:14.320]   Actually, I know people like dog.
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:15.320]   Ah, yes.
[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:16.320]   That one too.
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:17.320]   Yeah, definitely.
