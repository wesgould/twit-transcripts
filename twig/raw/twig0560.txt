[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:51.620]   Wait a minute. Let me get my cue card so I can read it. Stacey Higginbotham from StaceyOnIOT.com.
[00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.020]   Hello Stacey.
[00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.180]   Did you do that for me?
[00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.820]   No, I'm kidding. I was joking. Hi Stacey.
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.020]   Hello.
[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.500]   Good to see you. I want to ask you about your event. You just happened and that sounds so cool.
[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.780]   It was. It was awesome. It's going to get you banned from Android, but that's OK.
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:16.820]   Oh, we should talk about this because so many of my people were going to show that listen to the show. They were like Stacey and I'm like, uh, help.
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:26.100]   Also on the line, the Leonard Taill professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York, Mr. Jeff Free.
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.940]   T.
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.860]   Well done. And there's, can you see it? There's our neighborhood box.
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.380]   Oh, the Fox. What does the Fox say? Would you ask real quickly?
[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.860]   You missed it. We missed. I'm sorry.
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.300]   I saw some red in the bush.
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.060]   I have a neighborhood Fox.
[00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.420]   Yes.
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.580]   Yeah.
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.900]   Family.
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.340]   Oh, yes.
[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.540]   Have you heard them at night though? They're very annoying.
[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.860]   Oh, really?
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.300]   Yeah.
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.020]   They go over to another neighbor's house where they sleep, where the little foxes are.
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.140]   But here I see them carry in a way. They're, uh, they're catches.
[00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.380]   Oh, baby foxes are called kits.
[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.180]   Kits is not cute.
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.020]   It's it belies their vicious nature.
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.660]   Foxes are vicious. Oh, no, how else do they kill their things?
[00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.020]   Yeah.
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:17.500]   So it's the middle of the night and we're hearing call and response from the front of the house to the back of the house that sounds a little like turn off my on my sound, Jeff, this.
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.300]   Well, so you can't hear it.
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.660]   It was a very quiet night.
[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.500]   Turn on my sound. Can you?
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.260]   Do you know what's going on?
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.260]   Okay.
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260]   Is your sound on? Did you turn it up?
[00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.260]   Yeah.
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.260]   The video.
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.260]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260]   Is it going to sound like it's got helium?
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260]   Did you hear that?
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.260]   Wow.
[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.260]   Have you ever heard that?
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260]   That sounds like me screaming moral panic.
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.260]   This is what, yes.
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.260]   This is what, that's what red foxes screams sound like.
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260]   And we heard this and I thought something.
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.260]   I don't know.
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260]   Something horrible was happening because we are not.
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260]   Of the nature, one with nature.
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.260]   We are two with nature.
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.260]   But, but I, but I had an instinct because I'd seen these red foxes around.
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260]   So I, I googled it and thanks to YouTube.
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.260]   I know what the sound is.
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.260]   And that's what we were hearing front and back.
[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.260]   They were meeting, I think.
[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260]   So now we know.
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.260]   I don't think I've heard that.
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.260]   I think I've heard that.
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.260]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.260]   See?
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260]   Oh, that's how you get little foxes.
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.260]   Little baby foxes.
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.260]   Little kids.
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.260]   Little kids.
[00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.260]   Also in the backyard.
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260]   Yesterday there was a fawn nursing.
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.260]   Oh.
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260]   Oh, baby foxes.
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260]   Kind of nice that nature is coming back.
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.260]   It just shows you.
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.260]   It's only been two months.
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.260]   Yes.
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260]   If in 20 years everything would be like the planet of the apes.
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.260]   Yeah.
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.260]   Statue of Liberty be buried in his eye and sand would be ivy all over the.
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.260]   You know, Tower of Eiffel.
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.260]   It'd be.
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.260]   The ice looking back.
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.260]   The ice is coming.
[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260]   Turkey's everywhere too, right?
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.260]   Wild turkeys.
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.260]   Yeah, I got that.
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.260]   What puzzles means?
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.260]   What were we doing that was scaring them off?
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260]   It's not like driving.
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.260]   Driving.
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260]   I must be cars terrify them.
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260]   Well, they're pretty deadly.
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260]   Yeah, you don't want to walk in front of one.
[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.260]   I've learned that.
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260]   Tell that to a dear, stupidest animals on earth.
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260]   Turkey's a way dumber.
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.260]   Tell me about your event because Stacey did a COVID-19 event today.
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.260]   Yes.
[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260]   First work, we can find it.
[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.260]   You will be able to find it on staceyniot.com/covid.
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260]   OK.
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:28.260]   And I'm actually putting it in my podcast stream not at this moment, but in a day or two.
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260]   And this is the first online conference you've ever done.
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260]   Yes, it would so well.
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.260]   I had.
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.260]   So great.
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.260]   I had Intersing, who is the CEO of Kinza.
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:47.260]   I had a woman from a company called Electro Labs that does validation of consumer wearables for clinical studies.
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.260]   And then I had someone from Scripps Translational Institute, an epidemiologist from that.
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:58.260]   And they all got together and the topic was, hey, why didn't IOTC COVID-19 coming?
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260]   And what can we do?
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260]   So we talked about actually, it did see it coming.
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260]   We talked about how we can make things better.
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260]   We talked about privacy.
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.260]   That was really delightful.
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260]   We had a lot of disagreement.
[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260]   We talked about what kind of devices you need.
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.260]   It was really good.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260]   I mean, it was something it was.
[00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:22.260]   It broke down exactly how you would think of it.
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.260]   Dina, who used to work for Consumers Union, which publishers, consumers, consumer reports,
[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:36.260]   was calling for if we want to use this, she thinks that we should have a governmental rule around privacy and data protection.
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:43.260]   Kind of like what you call for, Jeff, which is against malicious or problematic use of the data.
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:48.260]   And I think that the editor was like, no, I think everybody should kind of opt into it.
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.260]   But if we have too much regulation, it's going to stifle innovation.
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260]   You know, that that old chestnut.
[00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260]   And so, yeah, it was really good.
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260]   And so nobody had to fly in.
[00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260]   You didn't have to make lunch for anybody.
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260]   You didn't have to write a call.
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.260]   You know what I really like to do?
[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.260]   I think this would be amazing.
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260]   And I'm not sure how to do it.
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260]   I would love if people paid and registered for an event.
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:18.260]   I would love to actually arrange something with like an Uber, eats or something to deliver lunch.
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.260]   Oh, bring food in there.
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.260]   That ought to be cool.
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260]   Your box lunch will be arriving shortly.
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260]   Seriously, I just, I think, like, or do something with FedEx.
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.260]   So everybody opens up the same bag, you know, that day.
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260]   Microsoft did that for build.
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260]   You know, they're doing their developers conference.
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260]   Google skipped it last week.
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260]   Microsoft builds going on right now.
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260]   And to the, at least to the press, Paul and Mary Jo were talking about this.
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.260]   They sent, you got a packet that had like a Starbucks certificate in it.
[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260]   And a few things to make up for the fact that it isn't an in person event anymore.
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.260]   I think you should do it in the evening, Stacey, with a little recommended Stacey Gin.
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.260]   There you go.
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.260]   Excellent.
[00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.260]   There we go.
[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260]   They also, Microsoft also did digital swag.
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260]   So they had a page where you could download wallpapers and stuff.
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:04.260]   So it's just, I think this is, you know, honestly, the build conference has been ten times better
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.260]   because it was all online.
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:09.260]   Everything went faster, was more interesting, was more natural, was more human.
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:14.260]   So let me ask you, Stacey, why didn't, or how did IoT predict it?
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260]   So, Anders, Anders, what are you saying?
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.260]   His thermometer is predicted.
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.260]   His thermometer is predicted.
[00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260]   He's like, we saw the spikes in temperature coming.
[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:26.260]   We let people, or the spikes in atypical temperatures coming.
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260]   We let health officials know.
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:34.260]   And, you know, from their things sort of happened.
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:40.260]   They have a map online healthweather.us that you can see atypical illness.
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:45.260]   Their thermometers have been handed out for a long time for flu, you know.
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.260]   For flu and cold.
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:50.260]   So they had a program going as far back as, I think, 2014.
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.260]   You know, it's funny.
[00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260]   I bought a Kinza thermometer and I've been using it.
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:59.260]   And then I was going through the drawers a couple of days ago, and I found an old Kinza thermometer that I've had for years.
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.260]   So I guess somehow that we participated in that somehow.
[00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.260]   Yeah, well, they gave it out to elementary age school children.
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.260]   Yeah.
[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:13.260]   So, we talked about how do you get good population data, right?
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:23.260]   And their next effort is going to be sending thermometers out to underserved populations who don't have $60 or even $20 to spend on a connected thermometer.
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:32.260]   We also talked about the need for how to send more money to local areas.
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:36.260]   So we really need more of a local response for public health.
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260]   So we talked about how to make that possible.
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:46.260]   And the other challenge is, and one of the reasons why, you know, I know Kinza says they saw it coming, but a lot of this isn't validated research yet.
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:56.260]   So we think that we know what disease looks like on a Fitbit, for example, but we don't have validated research and we're still getting that.
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260]   It's really cool.
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:03.260]   So, geek questions, Stacy, did you use Zoom or StreamYard?
[00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:14.260]   So we use Zoom for this one. My next one, I'm doing one June 11th on machine learning at the edge, and I'm using a platform called Hopin for that.
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260]   And that's going to be new and different.
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260]   One P or two.
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.260]   One P.
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260]   Hopin or Hopin?
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:28.260]   Well, so it's Hopin.to.
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.260]   So Hopin to.
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.260]   Oh, I like it.
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.260]   Oh, you got it.
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.260]   StreamYard.
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.260]   Have you seen StreamYard?
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.260]   No, I haven't.
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.260]   I'm looking at it right now.
[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.260]   Yeah.
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.260]   So it's very good.
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260]   It lets you put in lower thirds and other messages and things.
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:44.260]   It's more for, you know, arbitrary events like this.
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.260]   Oh, cool.
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260]   And you can stream live to, I think, two platforms at once.
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:52.260]   Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, which is neat.
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260]   StreamYard, multiple platforms simultaneously.
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:58.260]   Also, Periscope, Twitch, and Custom RTMP.
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260]   So you have you used this, Jeff?
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:06.260]   No, I was a friend of mine used it, and we're going to use it at the school for an event, and I think next week.
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260]   It's really interesting how many choices there are.
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260]   The nice thing about Zoom is you don't have to teach anybody how to use it.
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.260]   Everybody just kind of knows, right?
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260]   Zoom was pretty darn good.
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:21.260]   Washington Post did awards for all the platforms today, and everybody got an award.
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260]   And Zoom was the best in show.
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:31.260]   The other one I used recently is the, oh, we're going to find it.
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:40.260]   It's a audio podcasting tool where I record, I'm here, you're there, on the web.
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:48.260]   It records me separately, and then sends that up to the other one, and then merges the two.
[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:53.260]   Oh, does it allow you to, because that's one of the things I hate is that I can't un-zoom.
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260]   That's Zencaster, I was going to say.
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260]   Zencaster is not great.
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.260]   Oh, really?
[00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.260]   Oh, OK, well, a lot of podcasters use it because it's double-ended automatically.
[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:08.260]   Yeah, but it's, and you have to leave your browser open while it still processes it at the end.
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:13.260]   So if you're, that it's, if somebody shuts their browser before it's done.
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260]   Oh, that sucks.
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:20.260]   So it is, it is like, you're like, remember, leave it open, leave it open.
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260]   Oh, then it told me when I could get rid of it.
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:27.260]   Then the other, your opinions like whereby.
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260]   Is that spelled W-E-H-E-R-E?
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260]   Be wide.
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:33.260]   Whereby.
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.260]   Whereby.
[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260]   Video meetings, video conferencing.
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260]   So there are a lot of choices out there.
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.260]   There are amazing.
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.260]   There's a challenge now.
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.260]   Yeah.
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.260]   And there's mini event.
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.260]   Mini camp.
[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260]   OK, we don't have to list them all, Jeff.
[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.260]   All right, I'm sorry.
[00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260]   Well, people like geeky things.
[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.260]   There are a lot of them.
[00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260]   I mean, you can go on quite a while.
[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:58.260]   Google has its own and Microsoft has its own and Apple has its own.
[00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:05.260]   I was looking at all this because I was going to, I was so desperate to not be pink anymore.
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260]   That I was looking at cameras.
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260]   I was trying to figure it out.
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:16.260]   And then I finally, before the show, I mentioned I uploaded eyeglasses, which is just a different adjustment for the camera.
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:21.260]   And even though I don't look spectacular right now here, it's a lot better than I've been.
[00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:22.260]   Oh, this is from Ecamm.
[00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260]   They do good stuff.
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.260]   They do.
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.260]   I like Ecamm a lot.
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260]   I use Ecamm for recording my podcast.
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.260]   Yes.
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.260]   The best option I have.
[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:31.260]   Yeah.
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.260]   They know.
[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.260]   I do not.
[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260]   I do not do weird screens.
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260]   Yeah, don't do the twerly screen.
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260]   Don't be a frog.
[00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:44.260]   So Stacey, you had two other people.
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260]   Did you have?
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.260]   How did you handle questions and that kind of stuff?
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:56.260]   Because of the Zoom, they could drop it in the chat or they could drop it in the Q&A.
[00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260]   I made everyone go to the Q&A.
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260]   So it was a little weird.
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:04.260]   I guess it's no weirder than this, but hosting.
[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.260]   This is weird.
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260]   Well, this is, I mean, it was just here at least I have the chat.
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:12.260]   Like, I know that there are actually people out there for this.
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260]   I was like, hello, everybody.
[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.260]   Welcome.
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260]   And I'm like, I feel like I'm shouting into the void.
[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.260]   Yeah.
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260]   So it was a...
[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260]   It takes them to get a used to, doesn't it?
[00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.260]   Yeah.
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.260]   And I'm doing another...
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:30.260]   I'm doing a speech this week that's pre-recorded for June 9th, I think.
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:35.260]   And that's going to be super weird because it's a 40-minute keynote that I'm giving.
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:42.260]   And I have to do it sitting down just to, like, my daughter stuffed animals.
[00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260]   That's going to be strange.
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:45.260]   I don't know.
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260]   I have no trouble doing this, but I've been doing it for my whole life.
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.260]   Yeah.
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:53.260]   Because that's all radio is, is you close your eyes and you talk and you imagine that there's
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.260]   somebody listening.
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260]   I must have a very vivid imagination.
[00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:57.260]   I don't know.
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:03.260]   I've got to start recording my classes, my lectures for orientation.
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:04.260]   Yeah.
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.260]   And normally I have an audience.
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.260]   Normally I have people react.
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.260]   I can get some laughs if I'm doing a good job.
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260]   And the worst part is recording.
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260]   And then I screw up something, "Argh!"
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:18.260]   Start over again, so I'm going to have to edit a lot.
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:24.580]   You know, I found when I wrote my speech, I actually pulled in because I think people
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:30.900]   are going to be doing other things, maybe while this, maybe they're going to be so focused
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.620]   on me, but I kind of doubt it.
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:33.620]   They'll be doing it.
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:37.540]   So I'm like setting aside little interludes where I'm like, "Okay, hey everybody, take
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:38.540]   a minute.
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.460]   If you're checking your email, come back to me for a second because this is a really
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.100]   important point."
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.940]   So I'm going to do that.
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:45.940]   We'll see.
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.620]   I constantly imagine what people are doing while they're listening.
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.620]   I don't know.
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:53.380]   I'm able to do it partly because I'm a monologist in life.
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:56.100]   Like I talk to myself all the time.
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:16:02.660]   It just might just be, you know, it doesn't matter if somebody's listening to me.
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.220]   I don't know.
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.460]   Well good luck on that.
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:06.460]   Yeah, it's great Stacy.
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.460]   It's great.
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:08.460]   I'm really glad.
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:12.700]   By the way, just a little point of order for people who are looking at eyeglasses.
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.580]   Eyeglasses is not compatible with FaceTime, Photo Booth, or the latest versions of Skype
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.500]   or Zoom.
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.660]   We've seen this a lot because they don't like virtual.
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.140]   Oh for us, Skype right now and it's working.
[00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.140]   I know.
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.380]   They don't like, well you may not be using the latest version.
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.380]   They don't like...
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:29.660]   Zoom, they got rid of all those other cameras.
[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:30.660]   I hope they're going to go back.
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:31.660]   Yeah, they don't like virtual cameras.
[00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.740]   They don't want you to use virtual cameras.
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:34.940]   So it is a virtual camera.
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.820]   So there is a way to do it on the web.
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:38.820]   So be careful when you upload.
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:39.820]   What is a virtual camera?
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:40.820]   Upgrade Skype.
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.100]   It's a software that pretends it's a camera.
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.460]   That's how these work.
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:49.740]   Do they capture the camera, but they try to look like a camera?
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.820]   You're going through them.
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:56.340]   So they try to look like a camera to Skype or Zoom and I guess it's tricking your Skype.
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.340]   That's how you do Snapcamp.
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:00.140]   That's how you have an Apple camera that'll snap.
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.780]   Okay, I got you now.
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.180]   I'm like, what are you talking?
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.180]   I don't get this.
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:05.660]   I don't understand.
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:09.860]   Speaking of COVID, you're taking a chance because you saw that Google kicked podcast
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:16.940]   addict, a nine year old podcast app out because it let users play podcasts that reference
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:17.940]   COVID-19.
[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:20.260]   For a little bit they do.
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:25.260]   Yes, K-Roshi Lockhammer actually was very chagrind.
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.900]   Personally apologized.
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:33.300]   This is a constant problem though on all platforms where they're simultaneously too generous
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.540]   and too locked down and it's very hard.
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.220]   And they get crappy their way.
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.220]   Right.
[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.220]   Right.
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.740]   So I put a speech, kill it and they're caught in the middle.
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:48.620]   So I put a post up on Twitter that went crazy and I put the same post up on Facebook and
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:54.460]   what it was was a church in Georgia had opened on April 26th and then families got sick
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.660]   sadly and so it's closed again.
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:57.660]   So I tweeted that.
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:04.740]   Then I looked at the sermon the minister gave that day and I quoted it and he said, "My
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.420]   Lord is not named Corona.
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.340]   My God is not named COVID-19."
[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:13.300]   So I put that quote and the video into Facebook.
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.300]   No reaction.
[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.620]   I have 4,000 retweets on Twitter.
[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:19.500]   No reaction zero on Facebook.
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.740]   So I've got to believe that those are the C words you can't use now.
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:23.740]   Oh.
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:24.740]   Interesting.
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:25.740]   Okay.
[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:26.740]   I don't know.
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:27.740]   I could be wrong.
[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:28.740]   I don't know.
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:29.740]   World.
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:30.740]   I'm just betting.
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:31.740]   It is.
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:36.700]   It's the difficulty we've talked about for years now on censoring fake news because the
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:42.100]   whole thing, this is all coming from a desire not to show, you know, not to recommend chloroquine
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:48.900]   or drinking bleach or whatever it is that, you know, people are doing so they want to
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.060]   protect people and that's reasonable.
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:56.340]   But any attempt to stop fake news inevitably seems like it goes south in some ways.
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:01.500]   Which is why I think that their main job is to amplify expertise now and the effort
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.740]   to stop fake news is quixotic.
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.740]   Um, and.
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.740]   Quixotic or futile?
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.740]   Both.
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:10.740]   Okay.
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:11.740]   Both.
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:15.660]   By the way, we're on COVID.
[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.660]   I want to show off.
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:17.660]   It's tilting and windmills.
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.580]   Oh, I want to get one of those.
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.060]   Where'd you get that?
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:23.700]   I'm a TV visor.
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:24.700]   So I got one.
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:25.700]   Can you hear me still?
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:26.700]   Yeah.
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.700]   No, that's.
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.660]   So the advantage of doing it is people can read your lips.
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:30.900]   They can see your expressions.
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:31.900]   Exactly.
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:32.900]   It's a clear plastic visor.
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.100]   I don't know if it works quite as well as a mask.
[00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:40.900]   So I, under my, I screwed up the holes on this one.
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:46.060]   Under my number, I have a paper there from a, a scientist I follow in my COVID Twitter
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.180]   list, which you can see.
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:49.260]   This is what I just bought by the way.
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.260]   You didn't really.
[00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:51.260]   Yeah.
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.260]   You didn't really.
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.260]   Yeah.
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:56.100]   It's only 22 bucks.
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:00.060]   I have a feeling it's, it says it's replacement.
[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.060]   That's what worries me.
[00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.660]   I don't know what it's a replacement for.
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.260]   I'm wondering if I have the, the actual.
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:09.220]   Don't you, aren't you supposed to have a tube that goes up into that?
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.220]   Yeah.
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:11.220]   Yeah.
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.220]   I did.
[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:16.140]   I have taken, I made a mask that I put quilting material in.
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.140]   So it's like a little mini quilt.
[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.740]   It's, it's like a quilt square.
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:25.020]   And it really filters so well so that I've almost passed out because I didn't realize
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:28.180]   I wasn't getting any oxygen.
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.140]   So you have to be careful with this.
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.140]   You really do.
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:37.180]   So this Eli Para the Savage is a, is a epidemiologist at University of Iowa.
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.180]   I think he is.
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:42.780]   So there's a paper journal of American Medical Association I put up at the very bottom of
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.580]   the, of the rundown.
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:49.900]   And I've been following it on the Twitter and this protects me from.
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:50.900]   Spit incoming.
[00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:51.900]   Yeah.
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.900]   Parr, spit in your eye.
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:54.900]   Van a mask.
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:55.900]   Yeah.
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:56.900]   And your eyes and your mouth.
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.940]   It's unclear as to how much outgoing my spit.
[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.780]   Well, it's going down.
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.780]   So I've been wearing safety glasses.
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:08.660]   I've been wearing safety glasses with my mask.
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:13.300]   I feel like because, because the problem with a mask alone is your eyes are, are, you
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.260]   know, that's the, that's the third entry point is eyes.
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:20.060]   Dr. Fair on NBC thinks that's how we got him on a plane.
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:21.060]   Yes.
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:26.500]   But because he was wearing a mask is better for me than a mask.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.420]   I'm clear the other way.
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:32.780]   And so I can imagine teaching this is awkward and ridiculous as it is.
[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:33.780]   But you can see me.
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:34.780]   We can talk.
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.940]   It's, it's, it's not quite so wacky, but I'll get it.
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:38.940]   Isn't it?
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:45.180]   Like it's also interesting how we're all kind of just figuring that together.
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.420]   It's like there's nobody.
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.180]   And it's not, it's not a US issue.
[00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:52.340]   It seems like nobody in the world really kind of understands it.
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:55.340]   We're all just trying stuff to see what works.
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.620]   It wasn't what that's what I watched the scientists on my list.
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.620]   And it's so fascinating to see science in action.
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:01.620]   This is how it works.
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:02.620]   Yeah.
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:03.620]   This is how it works.
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:04.620]   Science and action, real time science.
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:05.620]   Yeah.
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:06.620]   They still have not decided.
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:07.620]   Yeah.
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:08.620]   Sorry.
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:09.620]   They still have not decided aerosolization.
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.860]   They still don't know.
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:11.860]   They still don't know.
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:12.860]   Yeah.
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.780]   Um, uh, and so six feet is almost random.
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.740]   They don't know where the six feet is the right, the right distance.
[00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:19.740]   It might be 13 feet.
[00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:20.740]   It might be time.
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:21.740]   We don't know.
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:22.740]   Right.
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:27.980]   So we did a list that once one epidemiologist raised everything she can find in the news.
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:32.140]   There's a German journalist, a guy, Kupferschmitt, and he wrote about this.
[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:35.540]   What do we know about super spreaders?
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:37.260]   And there's this fascinating list.
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:46.420]   If you look at my Twitter feed, it's, it's high up where it goes, you know, school, workplace,
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:53.300]   dormitory, ship, and one by one by one church, one by one by one, where people are getting
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.820]   it and they're learning more day by day about how it spreads.
[00:22:55.820 --> 00:23:01.140]   And they think they're super spreaders who for some reason spread more.
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:06.420]   There was the guy in the clubs in Seoul where there's a hundred cases now because of him.
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:07.740]   Hey, would you do me a favor?
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:12.740]   They're asking put on your, your clear shield and well, you may already know you may not
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:13.740]   have to put it on.
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:14.740]   Does face ID work through?
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.380]   Oh, you don't have an eyeball phone.
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:17.380]   I don't have space ID.
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.380]   Do you think I am a cultist?
[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:25.540]   If you just wear the blue, you just wear the blue ring without the mask.
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.580]   You kind of look like a gulpist.
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.580]   It's kind of like that is true.
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:35.060]   The wild hair and I bet if you start screaming moral panic, we'll be like, Oh, it's done.
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:42.420]   So Jennifer, my ex wife found, we was driving around and there was a podium on the street,
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:45.900]   thrown out at we have there's a little Herman sons hall over here.
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:51.340]   There's a little auditorium and actually used to be the home of the German American boond
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:52.340]   during World War II.
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:54.900]   The Nazis would gather there.
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:59.940]   That's so hum and sons hard and there's beautiful handmade.
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:01.700]   It looks like heavy wood podium.
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.900]   She sent me a picture said, Do you want this?
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.100]   I said, Hell yeah.
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.340]   So now I can't show you.
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.340]   I wish I could.
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.780]   Is there a camera over there?
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:15.860]   Now we have a giant podium and I was thinking if only I could get this to you Stacy.
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:19.260]   It might help you to deliver your talk.
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.260]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.940]   Instead of sitting down, if you're standing at a podium and I've seen some professors
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:26.860]   do that right make kind of fake podiums.
[00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:32.780]   I wish every but I, you know, I have no real use for this, but I kind of wish everybody
[00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.020]   had a podium.
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:38.580]   So Jeff is our Jeff is going to he's setting up a camera so you can you can see this thing
[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:39.580]   is it's gorgeous.
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:43.460]   I don't know what I'm going to do with it, but I figured, you know, I ought to have a
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:44.460]   podium.
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.580]   It's better than a soapbox.
[00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:51.260]   I mean, it's a podium that comes with its own soapbox, by the way, you get up on a little
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:52.260]   stand.
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:53.260]   Oh, nice.
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:55.620]   So I can't for short German for sure.
[00:24:55.620 --> 00:25:00.660]   I could bring this to Hyde Park and give a speech.
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.660]   Preach to the magic of the master.
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:03.660]   Yeah.
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.180]   I don't see if we get a shot here of this.
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.180]   Jeff's.
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:08.180]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.180]   How heavy is it?
[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:11.180]   It's really, really heavy.
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:15.180]   Jeff, go stand at it.
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.620]   You got to pull it back because it's hard to tell.
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.580]   Yeah, you already it's already got a twit logo on it.
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:26.740]   Oh, yeah, because, you know, so ladies and gentlemen, I come to you the great state of
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:35.460]   California casts all 372 ballots for Jeff Jarvis, former TV guide critic.
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:36.460]   What do you think?
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:37.460]   Pretty good, huh?
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:38.460]   It's a pretty thing.
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:40.660]   It feels like the proportions might be wrong.
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:44.740]   Well, it's just the way the angle it's if you saw it front on.
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:45.740]   It's pretty.
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:50.180]   Yeah, it's made out of like looks like looks like some Nazi hammered it together in the
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:57.620]   thirties and donated it to her when sons off.
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.980]   Mr. Speaker, I paid for this microphone.
[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.180]   OK, anyway, moving on.
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:03.180]   Yeah, who said that?
[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:04.900]   Who said that?
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:05.900]   That's a good one.
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:06.900]   I don't.
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.620]   I re it resonates.
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:11.500]   I'm sure we can use.
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:12.500]   There must be.
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.900]   Well, Reagan's just the moment in the 1980 GOP debate.
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.060]   That's right.
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.060]   That's right.
[00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:19.060]   I am paying.
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:22.500]   Well, this is my I am paying for this microphone.
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.900]   Um, now he's playing it.
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.660]   Sorry, I didn't mean to.
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:34.540]   I was mute on actually since we're talking about podcasts with the podcast addict.
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:38.060]   Big story in my world, probably not in anybody else's world.
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:43.300]   Joe Rogan, who is widely considered to be kind of far and away the most successful
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:48.780]   podcaster of all time, he claims 190 million downloads a month.
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:50.700]   Good Lord.
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:54.820]   We might get that in three years, literally.
[00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:56.540]   So that's that's an awful lot.
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:27:01.660]   If I do my math correctly, yeah, that would take us three years.
[00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:08.020]   So he says every month he has made a deal with Spotify, which of course, you know,
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:11.020]   of course, it looks like it's trying to corner the podcast market.
[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:13.940]   They've spent, they said they would spend half a billion dollars.
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:16.620]   They bought gimlet media, big podcast maker.
[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.660]   They bought anchor.
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.860]   They bought the ringer.
[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.380]   They've been buying a podcast networks and they must have paid.
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:26.740]   I have to think that they paid Joe Rogan a significant amount of money.
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:27.740]   A million.
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:28.740]   That would be that was my guess.
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:29.740]   Is that the actual number?
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.380]   That's what Wall Street Journal says.
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.380]   Yeah.
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.380]   Oh my.
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:35.740]   He, I mean, Joe Rogan is the PewDiePie podcast.
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:36.740]   Yes.
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:42.540]   Perfect example, controversial, a bit of a jerk.
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:43.780]   He's a former wrestler.
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:50.980]   He, you know, the most successful podcasters both were on the man show and Adam Corolla
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:52.900]   both and Jimmy Kimmel.
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.580]   All three of them came from the man show.
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.940]   So there, I should have been on the man show instead of tech TV.
[00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.380]   I made a mistake.
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:05.860]   So all 11 years of the Joe Rogan podcast will be on the Spotify service September 1st.
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:09.020]   And at some point before the end of the year, it, they, and this is the deal.
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.020]   This is the big deal.
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:12.420]   They will be exclusive to it.
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:17.460]   And that's what I think is going to be very telling.
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.700]   This is like Howard Stern going to XM.
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:20.700]   Yes.
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:21.700]   Yes.
[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:25.100]   And except Howard made five times more money, but still a hundred million a bad.
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:27.020]   I'd say Howard wouldn't sneeze at that.
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:28.020]   Yeah.
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.020]   No, nor would you.
[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:31.540]   It's a multi year licensing agreement.
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:35.020]   The amount of time cannot be learned according to the journal.
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:37.660]   They're saying it will likely be worth more than a hundred million.
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:41.820]   So they're making it up, but that was actually the number that came to mind as well.
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.020]   It's certainly worth that.
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.380]   And here's why.
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:51.140]   And this was my concern from day one with Spotify getting into podcasting with exclusive.
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.900]   I was worried that they said, Oh, no, no, we're not going to make it exclusive.
[00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:59.140]   But as soon as it's exclusive, then they know more about every single Joe Rogan listener
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:03.020]   because you have to be, you don't have to pay for it, but you have to be a subscriber,
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:04.820]   which means they probably have a credit card.
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:05.940]   They certainly know who you are.
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:07.620]   They have your email address.
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:12.100]   And more importantly, you have to listen in the app, which means they'll know exactly
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.460]   how often you listen.
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.420]   We'll know if that hundred and ninety million a month is real for what they can tell their
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:20.780]   advertisers beats what any other podcast or tell their ever time.
[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:25.820]   And we, I know this is a problem for all digital media because everybody who's not Facebook
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:31.460]   and Google lives in the world where Facebook and Google can tell advertisers, everything
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:35.380]   they'd ever want to know about the people who are seeing the ads and advertisers love
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:37.540]   that they gobble it up, whether that's valuable or not.
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:40.180]   We've just debated many times, but it's going to hurt.
[00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:45.940]   I think it's going to hurt RSS podcasting real traditional podcasting because RSS does,
[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.580]   there's no way we can gather information on you.
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.700]   We're on a million different platforms.
[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:50.700]   It's just a stream.
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:52.780]   Same thing with your podcast, Stacy.
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.900]   You know that you can't really tell about who's listening.
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:58.180]   All you could, the best you could do is see the download and know that somebody downloaded
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:59.180]   it.
[00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:00.460]   Apple has stats.
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:04.660]   Yeah, but those are only good if you listen in iTunes and an Apple device, right?
[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:05.660]   Right.
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:09.140]   And most of my audience, well, a good chunk of my audience does not.
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.140]   Right.
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.780]   Almost half of ours does not.
[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:12.780]   Yeah.
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:13.940]   And that's, I want to keep it that way.
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:15.260]   In fact, I was mad when Apple did this.
[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:21.580]   Now what it really is going to be is Spotify is going to kill the ad market, or it's going
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:24.780]   to hurt anyway, the ad market for RSS podcasts.
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:29.700]   Well, what you need to do is establish a newsletter and a virtual event business.
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:33.340]   Oh, you are so smart.
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.620]   I should have thought of that.
[00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:37.740]   I mean, what are you doing in your spare time?
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:38.740]   Come on, Leo.
[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:39.740]   Yeah.
[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:45.580]   So, so Stacy, the way you just said that, you were planning real events.
[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:50.300]   Now having done this virtual event, do you think you would try to plan real events again
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:51.460]   or screw it?
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.100]   Virtual is better.
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:58.420]   I would like to have real events because I think there's a lot of value in having people
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:02.180]   be face to face, but I don't think that's realistic until 2022.
[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:04.260]   Yep, I agree.
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:12.700]   So and right now, I mean, just as an open, open into my business, part of the event strategy
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:17.700]   was I happened to be planning one, but also this is a good way to offer people who might
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.780]   be on the fence about advertising additional value.
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:26.980]   So you can sponsor an event and you also get a discount on a podcast slot too.
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:29.820]   And that way you feel like you're getting more bang for your buck.
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:32.180]   You are.
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:36.980]   And that's keeping my revenue stable through COVID, hopefully.
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:38.780]   You are a deep thinker.
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:41.940]   I am a good entrepreneur.
[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:42.940]   Yeah.
[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.500]   That's smart, right?
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:45.500]   I try.
[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:50.380]   And my partner does most of the deep, deep thinking.
[00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:52.060]   Because I'm worried about the Internet of Things.
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:54.940]   Yeah, honestly, I think that's a good division of labor.
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:55.940]   I do the same thing.
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:32:02.460]   Lisa worries about the business and I try not to because yeah, I want to focus on the
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:07.420]   content and see if you can do that on the media front since we're talking about media
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.340]   and Jeff is here.
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:13.940]   Did you see the New York Times building their own ad network finally, Jeff and you know,
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:14.940]   what does that mean?
[00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:17.540]   I saw that and I'm not sure they were.
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:22.100]   They were using a third party.
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:23.100]   Is it on the rundown?
[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.100]   I don't know.
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:25.100]   No, maybe not.
[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.100]   I saw it as well.
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.340]   And maybe I neglected to get it on the rundown.
[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:29.340]   It's not really a.
[00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:33.300]   Let me find a Google story, but it's okay.
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:36.300]   They're just me.
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:37.300]   Oh, no.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:45.660]   They said that they're going to do that they're dropping third party ad networks.
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.260]   And it's next year.
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:48.740]   Why can't I not find this story?
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.140]   Where did I see this?
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:55.300]   All right, well, I'll keep looking.
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:56.820]   We can remember way back.
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.220]   The New York Times can get away with that.
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:32:59.300]   Most anyone else could not.
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:00.300]   Right.
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:04.460]   I remember when Google AdSense came out, I was at the event where Google and New York
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:09.260]   Times announced it and Martin Nissenholz, the VP of New York Times and I'm Mr. Google
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:10.260]   fan.
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:11.260]   You know, hey, cool.
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.260]   Google, those are the play along.
[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:15.620]   But even I said at the time, why are you putting this up on your site?
[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:16.620]   Why?
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:20.780]   And Martin said it's going to expose us to all kinds of other advertisers.
[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:23.220]   We're going to get revenue we couldn't otherwise get.
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:28.980]   Yes, the danger is people will go around our own buying, but we have the strictures so
[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:29.980]   that won't happen.
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:32.780]   But then of course, as time moves on.
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:34.580]   Oh my God, Google stole everything.
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:39.980]   Well, Google actually sends billions of dollars to publishers through this network.
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:44.060]   And the New York Times can back off because it has all the data because everybody's a
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:45.060]   subscriber.
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.660]   I don't think it's going to work for most anybody else.
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:50.540]   Yeah, I can't find it.
[00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:51.540]   I'm so sorry.
[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:52.540]   That's OK.
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:53.540]   We just talked about it.
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:54.540]   We're done.
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:55.540]   Oh, done.
[00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:56.540]   That's all we didn't know.
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:59.580]   It's just a little stone skip in the water, you know, put it up next to you.
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:03.100]   You know, the Red Fox screams when in house.
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.380]   I got one for you today.
[00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:08.020]   Apple pushed an update to iOS.
[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:10.140]   Google will push an update to Android.
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:14.380]   The API is on your phone.
[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:15.380]   How do I know?
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:16.380]   How do I file you?
[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:17.380]   It's just right here.
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:18.380]   That's an interesting question.
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:19.380]   Check on your-- let me see.
[00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:20.380]   I have my pixel.
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:21.380]   Where's my pixels in the other room?
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:24.060]   But I would presume it would be come with the--
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:26.740]   Wait, this is the contact tracing app?
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:27.740]   Yes.
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:29.060]   It's the API, not an app.
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:30.500]   So I presume it would come with--
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:31.900]   That's why you wouldn't necessarily know it.
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:32.900]   You wouldn't know.
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.380]   I'm going to guess, though, it would come with an update.
[00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:35.380]   It does with Apple.
[00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:38.100]   It comes with a 13.5 update.
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:43.020]   Right now, Alabama is working on an app.
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:45.700]   South Carolina is working on an app and North Dakota--
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:47.940]   Hey, explain this to me.
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:51.740]   So if you live on the border of North Carolina and South Carolina and they have different
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:52.740]   apps--
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:53.740]   How do they know?
[00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:54.740]   Yeah.
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:56.820]   I don't know.
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:04.660]   And then North Dakota is planning to incorporate the API into its Care 19 app, which apparently,
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:09.340]   according to the Verge, drew significant criticism from users in its early version.
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.900]   Utah is-- or is it Idaho?
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:12.900]   I don't know.
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:13.900]   We talked about it yesterday in security now.
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:14.900]   Now, I can't remember.
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:15.900]   It's Utah.
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:19.380]   Idaho has its own app, which has nothing to do with these APIs.
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:23.220]   Well, it's just the one that costs millions that only 40,000 people are using.
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:24.220]   Probably.
[00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:27.260]   But what state is it?
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:28.260]   I don't know.
[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:29.260]   Utah.
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:33.100]   Is it going to come to Google Play system or is it going to come with the Verge?
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.100]   Unknown.
[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:35.100]   I don't know.
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.100]   That's what--
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:40.540]   I think the API is accessible to people in the public health community that want to build
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:41.540]   the apps.
[00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:42.540]   Yeah.
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.940]   But the question he's asking is, how would he know if he's got it yet?
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:48.700]   Well, it's supposed to come out today.
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:49.700]   And I don't know.
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:52.660]   I always forget how to find my version.
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:53.660]   You go, OK.
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.780]   You pull it down.
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:56.780]   You hit the gear.
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:59.540]   Yeah, I go to the very bottom about phone.
[00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:01.540]   We'll tell you the version.
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:03.700]   But I don't have my Pixel 4 with me.
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:04.700]   I mean, I do.
[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:05.700]   It's just in the other room.
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:07.700]   I don't want to get up and run over.
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:11.380]   Exposure notification available on Android 6 Plus, Marshmallow and Later.
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.060]   It's powered by Google Play services.
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:19.220]   So you would have an app, an update to Google Play services.
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:22.860]   So you can from your phone's settings app--
[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:23.860]   Oh, read update.
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:24.860]   Let me see.
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:25.860]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:26.860]   That's it.
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:29.820]   And from your phone's setting app, you can visit the Google menu to control it.
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:33.620]   So you could go into the Google menu and then control it.
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:37.460]   Oh, I'll let you know.
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:40.260]   Anyway, just a point.
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:49.180]   We're going to contact tracing in this kind of catch-as-catch can.
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:51.500]   Let's try and see if it works world.
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:55.780]   Seems to be widely agreed to be one of the things we'd need to go to be able to get back
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:56.780]   to the floor.
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:58.500]   It's going to be incredibly imperfect.
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:03.820]   But every case you reduce is a reduction from the R.
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:04.820]   Yeah.
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:05.820]   So.
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:06.820]   Yep.
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:13.220]   I mean, it's completely empirical.
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.220]   We're just-- try it.
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.220]   See what happens.
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:16.220]   I don't know.
[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:17.220]   What are they doing?
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.220]   I don't know.
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:21.300]   The Google menu, to get to the Google menu, you actually just go to the app called Google
[00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:22.300]   and forget.
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:23.300]   No, no.
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:27.660]   You pull down your notifications, you hit the gear, and then there is a Google entry
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:29.820]   in the settings.
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:31.820]   And it's supposedly in there.
[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:34.460]   I-- you know, like I said, I don't have it.
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:39.300]   I mean, I don't have my phone.
[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:43.020]   And it doesn't matter if the API's on there, because until you have an app that takes advantage
[00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:44.220]   of it, nothing's happening.
[00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.220]   Whoa.
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:46.380]   That's what I was curious.
[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:48.380]   I was like, why do we care?
[00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:50.220]   So I wonder whether it's under security.
[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:51.220]   Sorry.
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:54.300]   What are we trying to look up again?
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:55.580]   In your version?
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:57.620]   On your Pixel 4.
[00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:00.860]   In the settings, there is a Google setting.
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:02.380]   Oh, OK.
[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:08.020]   And there, supposedly, there will be settings for this API which to turn it off for on.
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.300]   Actually, I'm very curious to see if the default is off.
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:13.100]   I may be my guest at default is off.
[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:19.140]   Google account services, ads, backup data messaging, device connections on device sharing,
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:20.140]   security--
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:21.140]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:22.140]   There's a bunch of stuff in there.
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:23.140]   But--
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:24.140]   Is it under security, you said?
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:25.140]   No, no.
[00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:26.140]   It's just under Google.
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:27.140]   No, I was guessing.
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:28.140]   Oh.
[00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:29.140]   It's just under Google.
[00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:30.140]   So--
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:31.140]   Oh, that is not there yet.
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:32.140]   Yeah.
[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:33.140]   So--
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:34.140]   Oh.
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:35.140]   Just keep--
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.980]   I always hate going on this.
[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:39.740]   I'm pretty sure it's going to be off by default.
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:42.420]   Now, my iPhone is now updating.
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:43.940]   So I don't-- let's see.
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:44.940]   I don't know.
[00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:50.060]   Let's see if Apple says how you can control it on the iPhone.
[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:51.060]   Just security updates.
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:54.940]   You know, saying a whole lot about it.
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:56.540]   So I don't know.
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:39:02.020]   But that is, supposedly, the API is now in the phone.
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:03.500]   Meanwhile, for us old people--
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:04.500]   Yes.
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:05.900]   Hello, Gertrude.
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:07.860]   OK, Gertrude.
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:10.220]   Apparently not that old.
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:11.220]   No.
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:14.180]   What was the joke when the old people trying to use OKG?
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:16.500]   No, it was a joke about--
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.500]   Gugu.
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.060]   There was Gugu.
[00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:20.060]   And then there was the one--
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:21.060]   The Amazon Echo.
[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:23.660]   The Echo Silver, where they'd say, "Andrea."
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:24.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:30.540]   So Google is now working on a simplified version of the--
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:34.220]   whatever is it-- Home Hub, Macs, Duo, whatever the hell
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:35.220]   that thing is.
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:36.540]   Retirement Macs.
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:37.340]   Retirement Macs.
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:40.100]   Yeah.
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:42.260]   So I don't know.
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:45.700]   There'll be, "What can you do, cards?"
[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:48.700]   So that'll tell people what they can do, which is good.
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:49.180]   It's good.
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:50.180]   I like this idea.
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:54.100]   Every time I come in my kitchen, my Nest Hub Macs
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:56.740]   makes a little tone because it recognized me.
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:59.660]   And what's really interesting is it recognizes me
[00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:02.860]   if it just glimpses me out of the corner of its camera.
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:05.540]   It can recognize me now from the back of my head.
[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:06.780]   He's a good devil.
[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:07.660]   Hi, Leo.
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:10.700]   Sneaking in for a little late night peanut butter cup.
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:11.700]   Hi, Leo.
[00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:12.700]   Hi, Leo.
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:13.140]   So--
[00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:15.540]   Mine doesn't recognize me when I wear them glasses,
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:16.980]   which is hilarious.
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:18.540]   It seems to be getting better.
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:20.260]   I think it's training.
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:21.300]   OK.
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.780]   I'll have to keep working.
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.860]   I pop by, and it's like--
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:25.820]   I feel like--
[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:26.980]   Oh, you.
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:27.700]   I kind of like it.
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:28.660]   It goes bloom.
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:29.740]   And then it says, hi, Leo.
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:31.460]   And then it says, it's your morning.
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:33.180]   Here's what you have on tap today.
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.100]   I really like it.
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:38.100]   I know many will find it highly creepy.
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:41.220]   No, I think it's great because when it works, it's awesome.
[00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:44.740]   And when I tell it to call mom, it's like rolling my mom
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:45.180]   on duo.
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.220]   And if my husband says, call mom, it calls his mom on.
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.220]   It knows the difference.
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.180]   Isn't that great?
[00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.180]   Wow, that's pretty cool.
[00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:53.140]   It seems, though, maybe this is just me.
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.300]   But tell me if this is the case, Stacey,
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:41:00.100]   that capabilities come and go.
[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:02.420]   One used to announce who was at the door,
[00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:04.420]   and it doesn't do that anymore.
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:07.380]   But now, when my daughter calls me on duo,
[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:09.580]   it makes a hell of a ruckus.
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:13.740]   It just seems to be doing different things at the--
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:17.340]   Did it-- did you switch your Nest account over me?
[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:18.540]   No, OK.
[00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.140]   That's the only thing.
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:24.260]   I don't have any devices, like Google Nest devices,
[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:25.020]   attached to mine.
[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.340]   So I have all pumped into it.
[00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:29.940]   I used to be able to say, show me the front door,
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:31.980]   show me the backyard.
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:34.140]   It used to say, somebody's at the door.
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:35.020]   Well, I haven't tried.
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:36.780]   I mean, just notice that people are at the door,
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:41.220]   and I used to ring the Nest Hub Max.
[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:42.820]   Anyway, I think this is a good thing.
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:46.780]   I think seniors, speaking as somebody who--
[00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:48.900]   Am I a senior or not?
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:49.420]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:50.140]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:52.300]   Yeah, you're a senior.
[00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:54.420]   Can you get the discount on Taco Bell?
[00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:56.020]   That's the only question.
[00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:58.420]   Wait, there's a discounted Taco Bell for old people?
[00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:00.580]   How old do you have to be to get to this count?
[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:01.460]   65.
[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:03.180]   No.
[00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:03.620]   I'm only--
[00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:05.580]   Is it an ARP thing, or is it just a--
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:07.340]   I'm this old?
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.220]   You just don't know this old.
[00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:13.340]   I can go-- I can get the senior discount at the grocery store,
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:16.780]   because I think that's 62 or 60 or something.
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:18.900]   Anything with a 6 in the age, you're--
[00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:22.100]   You could get into Whole Foods senior hour now at 60.
[00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:23.020]   Yeah.
[00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:24.140]   Yeah.
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:25.940]   So I guess I'm a senior.
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:29.740]   So it's OK for me to say that these devices are good for seniors.
[00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:32.500]   I've talked to a number of people on the radio show
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:33.500]   who are thrilled.
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.420]   They have their echo or they have their hub,
[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:36.580]   and they can talk to it.
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:39.340]   And it plays music form.
[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:41.820]   We gave an Amazon Echo to Lisa's parents.
[00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:43.180]   They love it.
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.220]   Play a lot of Elvis.
[00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:44.700]   Yeah.
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:46.260]   A lot of Elvis.
[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:48.860]   My-- and they gave them an Amazon Echo,
[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:50.100]   and they love it, too.
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.100]   They play music.
[00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:54.060]   And their grandkids love it, because the grandkids
[00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:56.140]   come in and they're like, echo, play this.
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:43:00.780]   And I think they regret it when that happens.
[00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:07.380]   Somebody's saying that the Taco Bell discount is Medicare Plan T.
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:08.140]   You're eligible.
[00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:09.460]   Congratulations.
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:14.140]   I still haven't had Taco Bell now since the first week of March.
[00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:14.660]   Why not?
[00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:18.860]   It's killing me, because we have done no takeout.
[00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:22.420]   Now, don't you care about the future of your restaurateurs?
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:23.180]   I do.
[00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:24.020]   I do, indeed.
[00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:25.420]   But no, my wife won't--
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:27.900]   She doesn't say-- think it's safe.
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:29.020]   I think-- yeah, maybe it's a--
[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.020]   Maybe it's a lot.
[00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:31.340]   She doesn't like eating that.
[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:34.540]   No, I don't think-- we have not done takeout once.
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:36.260]   We do it probably once a week.
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:36.900]   In fact, it--
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:37.740]   We do it once a week.
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:38.980]   Yeah.
[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:40.940]   It's nice, because you don't have to cook that day.
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:43.020]   It's a nice thing.
[00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:46.700]   And you get variety, because I've got to say,
[00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:49.740]   I'm totally burnt out on thinking of new things to eat.
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:50.620]   OK, we're not--
[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:51.420]   We're just--
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:54.140]   Meatloaf the other night, it was delicious.
[00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:56.900]   I'm going to add it to my repertoire.
[00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:57.900]   repertoire.
[00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:58.900]   repertoire.
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:00.900]   [GROANS]
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:01.740]   We are--
[00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:03.340]   [LAUGHS]
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:04.180]   I was like--
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:06.340]   You try to get us back on track, are you here?
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:07.340]   I'm trying.
[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:07.820]   I'm trying.
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:08.340]   I'm trying.
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:09.340]   I'm trying.
[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.580]   We got Facebook shops?
[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:13.900]   OK, you do that one, because I don't know anything
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:14.420]   about that.
[00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:16.660]   What is Facebook shops?
[00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:19.300]   So Facebook shops is competing with Amazon,
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:21.340]   and the stock--
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:22.340]   I would result--
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:23.180]   I would like somebody to compete--
[00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:25.900]   It's a full-time high.
[00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:26.940]   I would like--
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:28.020]   Really?
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:29.820]   I would like somebody to compete with Amazon.
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:32.500]   So can I buy the same things on Facebook
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:33.380]   that I can get?
[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:35.340]   That I can't tell.
[00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:39.820]   I think you have to use the Facebook payment
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:41.180]   structure, whatever that is.
[00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:44.620]   Not the crazy one.
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:45.620]   Not Facebook.
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.020]   Not Zuckbucks.
[00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:49.260]   Yeah, not Zuckbucks.
[00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:51.580]   But it's a way to start serving local people.
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:52.700]   So I did it.
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:54.540]   I call-- there was a--
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:56.220]   I haven't written this up yet.
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:56.820]   Hey, wait a minute.
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:00.540]   I see that Jeff Jarvis has a room, right?
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.900]   You're in a room on Facebook.
[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:03.460]   Oh, no.
[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:03.820]   Oh, no.
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:06.620]   It just says, say hi to Jeff.
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:07.740]   Oh, I see.
[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:08.740]   You can create a room.
[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:10.380]   Yes, I clicked on that.
[00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:11.820]   So I couldn't-- should we do that?
[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:12.420]   OK, hold on.
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:14.460]   What happens if we have a room?
[00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:15.460]   Get a room.
[00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:15.980]   Because--
[00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:18.980]   Aren't you always telling us to get a room, Stacey?
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:21.180]   Who's invited one friend?
[00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:23.540]   Is one friend invited to my room?
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:25.540]   OK, so how do I get to the damn rooms?
[00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:27.340]   I don't know.
[00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:28.500]   I don't know.
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:30.300]   So where would I shop on Facebook?
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:31.820]   There you are, Leo LaPorte.
[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:33.180]   It's Join Leo's room.
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:35.820]   This part of the problem with Facebook
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:37.540]   is it's so damn complicated.
[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:38.940]   I need a Facebook for seniors.
[00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:44.220]   That's just Facebook.
[00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:45.820]   Join is Jeff Jarvis.
[00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:47.300]   I'm waiting for Leo to join.
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:48.300]   Well, please--
[00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:50.380]   Just damn well joined, Leo's.
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:50.980]   Wait a minute.
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:53.060]   I asked you-- oh, I have to join, too?
[00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:54.620]   You have to join your own damn room.
[00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:55.460]   No route if you leave.
[00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:56.380]   I invited you.
[00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:57.180]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:02.900]   Oh, this browser is not supported.
[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:07.860]   To join this room, copy the link and paste it into Google Chrome.
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:10.340]   I'm in Firefox.
[00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:11.100]   Well, so what?
[00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:12.980]   I'm not doing it.
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:14.740]   No.
[00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:15.740]   Nope.
[00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:17.060]   Not going to do it.
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:18.020]   Not going to do it.
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:19.060]   Bye-bye.
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:22.060]   Go hang out in my room by yourself.
[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:23.820]   You give your phone?
[00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:24.900]   Yeah, you give your phone.
[00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:25.260]   Do it there.
[00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:25.940]   Go to Facebook there.
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:28.380]   I don't have Chrome on my iPhone.
[00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:30.300]   Look, it's probably in the app.
[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:30.820]   Facebook app.
[00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:35.060]   I bet you.
[00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:37.260]   Is this the new Facebook layout, by the way?
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:37.780]   I don't know.
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:38.540]   I can't tell.
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:40.380]   I have not-- I can't tell-- no, I don't know.
[00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:41.180]   It looks the same to me.
[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:43.020]   It looks the same to me.
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:45.860]   This feels like the most senior thing that I have to happen
[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:46.860]   to be all day.
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:49.660]   I can go get some Taco Bell if you want.
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:52.980]   Daisy, you know I got 10% off.
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:54.020]   Oh, I love it.
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:57.380]   I'm just like, oh, how long can we do this?
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:57.980]   I don't have this.
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:00.300]   I'm trying to try and put it on.
[00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:01.460]   Oh, no.
[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:06.300]   Is this Facebook's highest stock price ever?
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:07.900]   That's what a record high.
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:09.900]   Now, record-- that's the fool says here.
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:11.500]   Everybody's happy now.
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:12.340]   Everybody's happy.
[00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:13.140]   It's over.
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:13.740]   It's over.
[00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:15.100]   The market's going through the roof.
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:16.300]   Everybody's happy.
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:17.140]   We're coming out.
[00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:18.060]   We're-- we're--
[00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:18.740]   Stand up.
[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:20.140]   It's up 6% today.
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:22.020]   Wow.
[00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:24.620]   By-- by 12.45 PM.
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:26.140]   Facebook shops will allow small businesses
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:29.540]   to create online storefronts on Facebook and Instagram.
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:31.060]   These periods, third party data.
[00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:36.780]   So I also-- there's a newspaper in Germany in Minden,
[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:39.660]   the town of Minden, that in the crisis
[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:45.460]   is delivering beer and shoes for local shops
[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.900]   using their delivery people.
[00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:49.020]   So the question is, how do we--
[00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:50.020]   Beer, of course.
[00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:52.100]   What about why shoes?
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:52.780]   I don't know.
[00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:54.220]   They've delivered 80 pairs of shoes.
[00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:56.020]   And shoes?
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:58.420]   I could see beer and maybe you're misinterpreting.
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:00.300]   Maybe it's really beer in front of furtors.
[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:03.500]   I actually emailed the pretzels.
[00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:05.140]   The publisher.
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:06.460]   No, he said shoes.
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:07.180]   Shoes.
[00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:12.140]   You know, the word crock in German means mustard.
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:12.660]   No?
[00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:14.860]   No, it doesn't.
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:19.420]   Zends-- actually, look at this.
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:20.300]   Facebook stocks.
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:24.420]   So that was tumbling like everybody else.
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:25.980]   And then all of a sudden, boom.
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:28.300]   All that-- all that-- it's a V shape recovery
[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:29.180]   for all the tech stocks.
[00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:30.700]   That's a V for everybody.
[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:31.660]   It's a V for everybody.
[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:32.260]   For all the tech stocks.
[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:33.140]   They said it would be--
[00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:34.140]   Amazon, Google.
[00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:36.500]   Because we're using tech like crazy.
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:37.620]   Yeah.
[00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:39.780]   I understand that.
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:42.780]   I understand that.
[00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:43.980]   Well, that was not a very exciting story.
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:46.660]   Amazon, cut the pay for its workers.
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:47.820]   But there's good news.
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:50.700]   You're going to get a thank you, T-shirt.
[00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:52.580]   They are tone deaf sometimes.
[00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:53.420]   Oh, man.
[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:54.420]   They tone deaf.
[00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:57.180]   I guess you could cut it up and use it to make your mask
[00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:58.180]   that you're not getting it.
[00:48:58.180 --> 00:48:58.180]   Yes.
[00:48:58.180 --> 00:48:59.180]   Exactly.
[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:00.260]   Oh, I would do that.
[00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:01.100]   Yeah.
[00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:02.660]   I would do that.
[00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:05.660]   Thanks to you, Together We'll Deliver.
[00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:08.860]   I am very grateful to my Amazon.
[00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:10.060]   Oh, so am I.
[00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:12.340]   Because with four of them, I really--
[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:16.420]   I wouldn't have all of the luxuries, the luxury items
[00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:16.900]   I'm having.
[00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:19.780]   In fact, many of the mask-making items came from Amazon.
[00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:22.060]   So fabrics and--
[00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:24.020]   We stopped ordering on Amazon.
[00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:24.500]   I know.
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:26.700]   I want Facebook to be better.
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:28.540]   But I can't shop at Facebook.
[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:29.380]   OK.
[00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:29.860]   Yeah.
[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:32.380]   That is like choosing--
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:34.500]   They probably just take the order
[00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:36.580]   and give it to Amazon anyway.
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:38.460]   Which dictator should I support?
[00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:40.220]   I would Walmart any better?
[00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:41.500]   Didn't we used to hate Walmart?
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:42.340]   Oh, big news.
[00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:43.940]   Big, big, big news is because--
[00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:44.940]   Yeah.
[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:48.380]   Walmart bought Jet for $3.3 billion and just killed it.
[00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:49.380]   Killed it.
[00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:50.380]   It's done?
[00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:51.380]   Yeah.
[00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:52.380]   Well, they-- OK.
[00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:53.380]   There's a couple of things.
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:56.340]   They killed it and they did buy it for that much.
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:58.660]   But basically, they spent a lot of money hiring
[00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:01.340]   the head of Jet, the founder of Jet,
[00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:04.540]   and built out their e-commerce build, like--
[00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:07.340]   But a $3.3 billion acquire is pretty expensive.
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:08.340]   OK.
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:09.340]   But doesn't mean--
[00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:10.340]   I agree with you, Stacey.
[00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:11.620]   I mean, they're shutting it down.
[00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:13.540]   They're just shutting the name down, right?
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:14.540]   They're shutting it.
[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:17.620]   And the vision behind Jet didn't work really well.
[00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:18.620]   No, it didn't work initially.
[00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:21.780]   But the people that came over helped build out
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:23.700]   Walmart's e-commerce platform in a way,
[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.340]   not just the guy who--
[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:28.100]   not just the founder, Laura.
[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:29.540]   I can't think of his first name, Michael.
[00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:30.220]   No.
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:31.980]   Anyway, it's not just him.
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:35.100]   It was also a bunch of data nerds, a bunch of technology,
[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:35.820]   know-how.
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:38.380]   So I know the brand is getting killed.
[00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:42.580]   But Walmart actually is pretty good at fulfilling--
[00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:45.780]   I've ordered online at Walmart, whereas I don't usually
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:47.020]   go into the Walmart store.
[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:48.660]   And people can call me a leadist,
[00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:55.140]   but my local Walmart has a terrible, terrible UI as it is.
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:57.220]   And it smells funny.
[00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:58.860]   Mine does not smell funny.
[00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:00.020]   It just takes forever.
[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:00.700]   It scares me.
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:02.020]   Walmart scares me.
[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:03.980]   Not the people, just the size of it.
[00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:04.980]   Mark-Loor.
[00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:05.980]   Mark-Loor.
[00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:07.980]   Thank you, Chumly, in the chat room.
[00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:10.300]   So yeah, they're shutting it down.
[00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:13.540]   It never-- you know, from day one, Jet.
[00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:16.020]   How many companies have gone on the rocks
[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:19.740]   trying to beat Jeff Bezos at his own game?
[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:20.940]   A lot of them.
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:24.460]   Mark-Loor was aiming straight at Amazon, right?
[00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:24.940]   Yeah.
[00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:28.300]   Well, that's the idea.
[00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:30.060]   That was the rumor at the time.
[00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:31.740]   Yeah.
[00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:33.780]   You'd think now today would be the day
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:36.740]   the Jet Division of Walmart would be doing so well,
[00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:37.740]   but maybe not.
[00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:38.740]   Right.
[00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:42.260]   Well, so Jet had this idea about just in time pricing
[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:44.020]   and personalization that never came around.
[00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:45.380]   Yeah, it was too complicated.
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:46.380]   Yeah.
[00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:47.380]   People just wanted--
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:48.780]   people just wanted-- in their heads say,
[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:51.220]   this is the lowest price I know it is, I'll take it.
[00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:53.060]   Also, as Amazon has showed us, that
[00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:56.620]   might get them some antitrust attention otherwise.
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:57.620]   So--
[00:51:57.620 --> 00:51:58.620]   Right.
[00:51:58.620 --> 00:51:59.620]   All right.
[00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:01.780]   Then meanwhile, this is rumors-- no light up,
[00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:03.220]   but rumors in the rundown.
[00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:04.620]   But this one mazes me.
[00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:08.060]   The rumor hot and heavy is that Amazon might buy
[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:11.260]   JCPenney out of bankruptcy.
[00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:11.980]   Oh, yeah, it just went bankrupt.
[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:13.500]   Right.
[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.220]   This is the question I had.
[00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:15.740]   I mean--
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:16.260]   They wouldn't.
[00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:17.660]   Why would they?
[00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:21.260]   Do they need physical storefronts in malls?
[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:22.980]   No, malls are dying.
[00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:26.300]   Our JCPenney went away years ago.
[00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:26.740]   You know, I--
[00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:28.380]   I just-- I don't see it.
[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:29.780]   I don't either.
[00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:30.580]   It's hot and heavy.
[00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:32.340]   And Amazon's stock went up--
[00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:33.140]   went up as a result.
[00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:34.180]   You think it would go down?
[00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:37.460]   Like, why would you do that?
[00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:40.620]   Yeah, I mean, the idea is, yeah, that this is a place
[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:42.340]   where people could go visit.
[00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:45.700]   There's the other idea is that it is a more local extension
[00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:49.020]   of their delivery warehousing.
[00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:52.980]   But again, I feel like Amazon would be better off
[00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:56.420]   if they want to show people things, buying a store,
[00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:59.380]   a brand like beta that is designed solely
[00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:01.180]   to show people things, right?
[00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:01.500]   Right.
[00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:04.220]   As opposed to let you show room.
[00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:05.380]   Trigger warning.
[00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:08.740]   I'm going to show you a really disgusting bug.
[00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:09.260]   OK.
[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:16.020]   It is named Troglomyces twitteri, named after Twitter
[00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:20.740]   because the entomologist who discovered it
[00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:24.860]   first saw a picture of it on Twitter.
[00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:26.460]   And what does it do to the bug, Leo?
[00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:27.740]   Because this is the fascinating part.
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:31.700]   Nowhere's the genitals of millipedes.
[00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:34.220]   It is the perfect--
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:36.020]   No, it's not an insult to Twitter.
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:37.260]   It's a tribute to Twitter.
[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:38.500]   It's a parasite.
[00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:39.260]   It's a parasite.
[00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:40.780]   A parasite after Twitter.
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:42.620]   Yeah, an entomologist at the Natural History Museum
[00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:44.860]   of Denmark at the University of Copenhagen.
[00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:46.620]   The parasite first came to her attention
[00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:49.660]   when she saw a colleague share a photo of a North American
[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:53.700]   millipede on Twitter with two strange white dots
[00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:56.540]   flicking the millipedes exoskeleton.
[00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:59.700]   She immediately-- this is how good she is--
[00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:02.300]   and a Sophia Ribolera-- immediately
[00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:05.780]   pegged it as a parasite, did a little research.
[00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:08.500]   And yep, the Troglomyces twitteri.
[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:12.900]   This, by the way, is not the Troglomyces twitteri.
[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:14.580]   This is the millipede.
[00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:18.780]   The little white dots circled in red.
[00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:20.140]   That's what she saw.
[00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:20.660]   And she said--
[00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:23.020]   This is the original photo that she saw and thought--
[00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:23.660]   Yep.
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:24.700]   That's a parasite.
[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:25.180]   Yep.
[00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:25.700]   Dang.
[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:26.140]   Dang.
[00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:27.580]   These scientists are so amazing.
[00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:28.980]   So amazing.
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:32.380]   Well, if you consider finding a new millipede parasite
[00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:34.100]   amazing at naming it after Twitter--
[00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:37.140]   A genital eating millipede parasite.
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:38.660]   Come on, photos points.
[00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:39.660]   Bonus points.
[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:42.540]   Hey, here's an interesting thing that Twitter's doing
[00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:45.060]   that I really like.
[00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:46.260]   And it's only a rumor.
[00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:47.740]   It's on Tech meme.
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:51.220]   But apparently Twitter is considering--
[00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:52.980]   Let me find the story here.
[00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:58.020]   A feature that lets a tweets author limit who can reply
[00:54:58.020 --> 00:54:59.380]   to the tweet.
[00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:00.220]   Yes, it's awesome.
[00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:01.220]   I've got that one's actually people.
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:02.140]   It's out.
[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:02.580]   Is it out?
[00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:04.500]   Hunter Walk was tested today.
[00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:05.020]   Yes.
[00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:06.820]   Yeah, some people are already testing it.
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:07.780]   This is great.
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:10.500]   I love this because I would not have
[00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:13.740]   to listen to people who I don't care to listen to.
[00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:15.820]   Tell me what they think about my thoughts.
[00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:18.580]   I would pretty much everybody who adds me.
[00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:20.020]   I don't want to hear from.
[00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:21.100]   So you could just say--
[00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:22.900]   I have added you.
[00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:26.620]   I include you in that list, Ms. Higgermutham.
[00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:28.060]   Probably some grammar.
[00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:29.220]   No, no.
[00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:32.500]   But you can choose everyone, which is the default.
[00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:36.140]   People you follow or only people you
[00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:39.340]   mention in the original tweet.
[00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:45.740]   So what happens is a small glove icon, glove,
[00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:49.980]   in the corner of your tweet, tapping it.
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:51.460]   Should I try it?
[00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:54.940]   Every time I tweet, I get in trouble with you guys.
[00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:56.940]   Because the last time I swore a jest--
[00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:57.700]   Yes, yes.
[00:55:57.700 --> 00:55:58.780]   You just spread people up.
[00:55:58.780 --> 00:55:59.580]   What's the matter?
[00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:00.220]   What do you do?
[00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:01.220]   Oh, my God.
[00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:04.420]   What are you guys having to fall in?
[00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:09.900]   So if I make a tweet, if you go to Hunter Walk,
[00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:11.740]   at Hunter Walk, you'll see him using it.
[00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:12.220]   OK.
[00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:12.820]   Go ahead and you do it.
[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:13.140]   OK.
[00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:13.620]   No, no.
[00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:16.980]   It's probably safer.
[00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:17.660]   I'm sorry.
[00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:19.100]   He has a tweet that says, this is a test
[00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:20.580]   of the new Twitter feature, will they say?
[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:24.220]   Is this Hunter Walk the Theater of Magic, the pinball Hunter
[00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:25.220]   Walk?
[00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:26.420]   Uh, yes.
[00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:26.940]   Yes.
[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:28.220]   That's how they walk.
[00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:30.500]   Yes, that's him.
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:30.940]   Oh, look.
[00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:34.100]   People they mentioned can reply.
[00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:35.860]   People they follow can reply.
[00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:37.980]   Oh, that is nice.
[00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:38.980]   And it's nice.
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:40.180]   This is me off.
[00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:40.940]   Allegiant.
[00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:42.580]   Well, the other thing is it's going to encourage
[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:44.460]   people who are going to do the thing we don't want,
[00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:47.020]   which is screenshots of tweets, so they can reply to that.
[00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:49.020]   But of course, I could retweet his tweet
[00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:52.260]   and put Smart Mastermarks in there, which is what I did.
[00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:52.540]   Oh.
[00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:52.900]   OK.
[00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:54.020]   I see your point.
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:56.740]   But as someone who, like, it's trying
[00:56:56.740 --> 00:57:00.340]   to target some of the abuse that people get on the platform.
[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:00.660]   Yes.
[00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:02.540]   Like women and people of color.
[00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:03.620]   Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:05.140]   I'm just thinking to myself, which is--
[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:07.780]   So I typed hello, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:09.580]   And then where's the glove?
[00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:11.300]   I don't know what the glove is.
[00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:14.180]   If I press tweet and it just goes out.
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:15.500]   Well, you may not already have it.
[00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:16.260]   I don't have it.
[00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:19.020]   No, you've got to set the standard to say no.
[00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:19.540]   It's a setting.
[00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:20.220]   No one can do it.
[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:21.980]   Oh, it's in the settings.
[00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:22.340]   Yeah.
[00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:23.900]   So go to settings and privacy.
[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:25.620]   OK, Doki.
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:27.220]   Let's see if I can make it that way.
[00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:31.060]   No, don't show it because it's going to show all my private stuff.
[00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:34.260]   Privacy and safety content preferences.
[00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:37.460]   We see notifications.
[00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:41.780]   Mute, OK, it's in advanced filters and then notifications.
[00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:43.100]   Where's advanced filters?
[00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:44.500]   I don't have that.
[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:45.020]   Understood.
[00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:45.620]   In some privacy.
[00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:47.140]   Under notifications.
[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:47.540]   OK.
[00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:47.980]   Sorry.
[00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:48.380]   Sorry.
[00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:48.940]   Under notifications.
[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:50.780]   Mute notifications for people you don't know.
[00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:52.340]   This is not the same thing.
[00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:53.180]   Is it?
[00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:55.820]   Mute notifications for people you don't follow.
[00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:57.060]   Oh, you're right.
[00:57:57.060 --> 00:57:57.500]   You're right.
[00:57:57.500 --> 00:57:58.020]   You're right.
[00:57:58.020 --> 00:58:04.780]   This says you can limit who can at reply you your tweet,
[00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:05.780]   which is a different thing.
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:06.780]   So I guess I don't have it yet.
[00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:07.620]   But that's cool.
[00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:08.940]   I think that would help, right?
[00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:12.940]   Sorry.
[00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:15.020]   I would unmute so my dog would stop yelling at me.
[00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:15.980]   I don't mind your dog.
[00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:17.180]   I like your dog.
[00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:20.820]   So anyway, look for that.
[00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:22.220]   I'll take her.
[00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:24.060]   What kind of dog is she?
[00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:24.860]   She's a mutt.
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:26.460]   I'll take her.
[00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:27.820]   I'd like dogs.
[00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:29.380]   I totally--
[00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:32.580]   if we're still in quarantine at the end of the year,
[00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:34.740]   can we get a dog?
[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:36.420]   You can't get dogs in New York now.
[00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:39.020]   Yeah, everybody should have a dog.
[00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:40.500]   No, I mean that they're gone.
[00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:42.140]   They're all taken.
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:44.300]   They're gone.
[00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:45.340]   No, they are.
[00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:46.540]   All the adopted dogs have been taken.
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:46.740]   I take too.
[00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:48.460]   We'll make more.
[00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:49.220]   Yeah.
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:49.580]   Yeah.
[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:51.140]   They just need to go to the deep south.
[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:53.020]   There's lots of dogs there.
[00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:54.940]   They're all pit bulls.
[00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:56.580]   Yeah.
[00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:57.860]   That's why there's so many dogs.
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:59:00.300]   I decided, by the way, I'm only going to do happy stories
[00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:00.900]   from now on.
[00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:03.340]   This is going to be the happy show for all of our shows.
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:04.500]   Oh, happy show.
[00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:07.220]   Oh, you want to talk about Google's touch sensitive headphone
[00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:07.740]   wires?
[00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:08.220]   Yes, perfect.
[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:09.020]   Because I am super stoked about those.
[00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:10.020]   Perfect.
[00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:12.020]   See, I put that one in there for you, Stacey.
[00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:12.500]   Only happy.
[00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:13.180]   That was mine.
[00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:14.580]   I put that in there.
[00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:14.580]   Yeah.
[00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:15.500]   I'm thinking of you.
[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:16.060]   Yeah.
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:16.500]   What is it?
[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:18.660]   You know your audience, Jeff.
[00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:21.980]   So this is Google--
[00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:23.820]   I feel like this is an ATAP project,
[00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:26.820]   but it's not an ATAP project, I don't believe.
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:29.140]   This is the I/O braid.
[00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:33.820]   It's a textile user interface that lets you swipe or touch
[00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:35.580]   or tap a fabric cord.
[00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:40.260]   And they've woven fiber optic strings into--
[00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:42.660]   Fiber optic.
[00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:49.140]   So by touching the cord, I'm sending a light signal?
[00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:54.260]   It says the yarns are capacitive and conductive.
[00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:57.100]   So that doesn't--
[00:59:57.100 --> 00:59:59.140]   oh, the fiber optics are for visual feedback.
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:01.180]   Oh, it's just so you can see it.
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:01.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:02.420]   See how it glows?
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:02.940]   That's cool.
[01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:04.220]   Oh, it is cool.
[01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:05.740]   I love it.
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:08.220]   And I guess I had to tell you it was fiber optic as opposed
[01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:11.300]   to fiber, because most cords are fiber.
[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:11.540]   Right.
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:13.260]   Fiber just textile.
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:17.660]   So it's a fabric braided headphone cord.
[01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:19.540]   With fiber optic weaved into it, you
[01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:24.420]   can twist, flick, slide, pinch, grabber pat, which sounds like--
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:26.420]   most of which sounds illegal, yes.
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:30.260]   Like the sexual harassment complaint.
[01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:34.140]   So continuous twist or flicker slide
[01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:36.620]   is a discrete motion or pinch grabber pat,
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:38.060]   which are discrete grabs.
[01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:39.780]   Only Google would classify it.
[01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:41.780]   I'm going to screw this up, yeah.
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:44.660]   Those are really important to classify those things, though.
[01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:47.180]   I mean, someone had to come up with pinch to zoom.
[01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:49.460]   I mean, that's what they're doing.
[01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:52.060]   Let's watch this true interactive video.
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:54.060]   And you can play along.
[01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:55.420]   So here we go.
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:57.580]   The following clip will show live interaction
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:02.020]   with a music player using pinch.
[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:04.140]   And it started playing jazz.
[01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:06.340]   You turn it up by twisting it.
[01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:08.420]   Oh my god, that's awesome.
[01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:09.420]   Isn't that fun?
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:11.540]   You pinch it to do what?
[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:20.540]   To pause it, slide it, pat it, fast forward, twist it.
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:23.220]   Oh, so you change the mode by patting it and then twisting it.
[01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:31.380]   This would be fun in like a detail setting.
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:32.940]   So people at home are listening to--
[01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:34.780]   Just style macro interactions, advanced
[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:36.740]   chord-based interfaces by enabling
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:38.940]   the simultaneous combination of personal--
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:40.180]   Oh, this is fun.
[01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:41.020]   --for scrolling.
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:43.140]   And the actual discrete gestures for soft electronics.
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:43.740]   This is great.
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.220]   If they could do this to my hair--
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:47.980]   We leverage the recently introduced aisle proof.
[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:49.220]   And your hair will light up, too.
[01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:49.820]   That'd be great.
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:50.460]   It'd be really cool.
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:52.300]   You need to study in experiments,
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:54.500]   which help us design suitable interactions
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:58.540]   and a real-time gesture recognition pipeline.
[01:01:58.540 --> 01:01:59.580]   So think about--
[01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:01.380]   Imagine this in a homesteading, right?
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:02.300]   Like, you have a chord.
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:02.780]   You have a chord.
[01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:03.860]   On your blinds or something.
[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:06.140]   And instead of actually pulling on the blinds,
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:08.620]   it controls a motor that does something right.
[01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:10.420]   But here's the thing.
[01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:14.140]   Everything is going cordless.
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:16.740]   We don't have ed fun jacks anymore.
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:17.260]   Yeah.
[01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:18.260]   And that is--
[01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:18.780]   --slight bulb.
[01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:20.620]   --we need to add a chord for things like this.
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:21.740]   Oh, that's good.
[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:23.780]   Oh, we took away the headphone jack,
[01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:27.860]   but we're going to give you the new pinch swipe slide.
[01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:29.500]   Which actually connects to nothing.
[01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.340]   It's just a new UI.
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:33.660]   Well, there are still cords everywhere.
[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:36.980]   I mean, imagine that as a layup controller, for example.
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:37.660]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:39.420]   No, blinds is a really good example,
[01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:41.380]   because you're going to have the cord there.
[01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:44.940]   But instead of physically twisting it, you could just--
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:46.580]   You could just slide your finger down.
[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:49.620]   By the way, I'm returning my second pair.
[01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:50.820]   Oh.
[01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:52.860]   The next-- the new Google Buds--
[01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:54.060]   Same thing.
[01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:55.100]   Did not work.
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:56.420]   Not worse, London.
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:57.620]   It's your ear.
[01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:59.980]   Do you have a metal plate in your head?
[01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:01.500]   Hey, hey, hey.
[01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:02.420]   No, I'm not--
[01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:06.380]   No, because they have to communicate through your ear hole.
[01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:07.380]   The hole in the--
[01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:10.620]   --that connects your ears.
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:11.620]   So--
[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:12.620]   I mean, there's--
[01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:14.540]   It's sporadic, but it's there.
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:15.780]   Oh, they're scientists.
[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:17.300]   I got the--
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:20.060]   Your recommendation, guys, I got the job, Rose.
[01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:20.660]   Yeah?
[01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:21.340]   Did they work for you?
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:22.940]   They're OK, but I'm unhappy.
[01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:25.580]   I actually prefer the Pixel Buds.
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:26.380]   They're better designed.
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:28.460]   They're nicer, nicer UI, nicer sound.
[01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:33.220]   I was much happier with them, but they just do not work, Google.
[01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:35.340]   And it's the problem of the early product, right?
[01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:37.260]   They're eventually-- they'll probably figure it out.
[01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:41.220]   Meanwhile, I've spent $199 on these.
[01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:42.620]   So I'm not happy.
[01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:44.340]   So forget your happy stories, fell off.
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:46.100]   Here's a happy story.
[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:48.300]   So you probably don't want that to be true.
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:49.460]   Wait, just--
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:49.940]   Go ahead.
[01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:50.940]   Done.
[01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:51.940]   Your job is--
[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:52.940]   Diagnosis.
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:53.940]   --if you want to--
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:54.940]   The doctors in--
[01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:57.940]   They have an app, and you may hate it, but if you download the app--
[01:03:57.940 --> 01:03:58.940]   Don't do it.
[01:03:58.940 --> 01:03:59.940]   It's dark mode for sound.
[01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:00.940]   Is this what it is going to be?
[01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:01.940]   Yes.
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:02.940]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:03.940]   No, no, no.
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.540]   It's-- it just-- it helps you tune it so it sounds better for your ears.
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:07.540]   That's all.
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:08.540]   Oh, OK.
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:09.540]   That's all.
[01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:10.540]   Thank you.
[01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:11.540]   I just wanted you to know that.
[01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:12.540]   Yeah, I used the app.
[01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:13.540]   Did you get the '65s or '75s?
[01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:14.540]   '75s.
[01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:15.540]   Ooh.
[01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:16.540]   Fancy.
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:18.340]   Yeah, I figured I might as well do it.
[01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:19.340]   I mean, I'm for it.
[01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:20.340]   I'm taking my mind--
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:22.580]   Sorry, you like-- did you replace your ear thing?
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:24.780]   Did you adjust your ear size thingy?
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:25.780]   The little--
[01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:26.780]   I don't know.
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:27.780]   I've done it so much.
[01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:28.780]   Yeah, I've done every permutation and computation class.
[01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:30.020]   Because it comes with a ton of them.
[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:31.020]   It even has some--
[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:32.020]   The three.
[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:33.020]   --memory foam.
[01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:35.620]   Oh, it didn't-- oh, because mine came like with a lot of different tips.
[01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:36.620]   Oh, no, it's just three.
[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:37.620]   Just three, OK.
[01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:41.860]   So the driver's fine, but I prefer everything about the--
[01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:43.500]   I like the Google Buds.
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:44.500]   Google Buds.
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:45.500]   That's not--
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:49.060]   Wow, Jeff, you're all in on the Google Cult.
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:50.060]   I love it.
[01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:51.060]   I am.
[01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:52.060]   I am.
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:53.060]   How about the Samsung Buds?
[01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:54.060]   Those are good, the Galaxy Buds.
[01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:55.060]   Those are good.
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:56.060]   I was wondering whether that would be better for me.
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:57.060]   Those are $99.
[01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:58.580]   At least you won't have spent so much.
[01:04:58.580 --> 01:04:59.580]   $149.
[01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:00.820]   Are the Surface Buds out?
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:02.620]   Yes, they are.
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:03.620]   $249.
[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:06.460]   But they look so good.
[01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:08.660]   Yeah, the Microsoft Surface Buds.
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:10.660]   They're not going to work with that.
[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:11.660]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:12.660]   Oh, they have to be positive.
[01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:13.660]   Yeah, don't they look good?
[01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:14.660]   They look pretty.
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:15.660]   Oh, hey.
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:18.260]   Hey, they're only $200 right now.
[01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:19.260]   Oh, on sale.
[01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:20.260]   Yeah.
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:22.260]   Go get up in $199.
[01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:28.060]   Oh, and $179.99 for eligible students, parents, teachers, and military.
[01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:29.980]   You're a teacher, Jeff.
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:31.300]   They won't stay in my ear.
[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:33.300]   Well, no, that's the outside.
[01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:34.300]   That's the outside.
[01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:35.940]   I need no idea the rubber thing.
[01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:37.940]   The rubber thing's a good thing.
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:38.940]   No, look at it.
[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:39.940]   No.
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:40.940]   It's not the rubber thing.
[01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:42.780]   It's kind of like the air pod.
[01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:43.780]   It's like the air pod.
[01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:44.780]   That'll never--
[01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:45.780]   Yeah.
[01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:46.780]   I have wacko.
[01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:47.780]   Yeah, no, they won't stay.
[01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:50.460]   Well, it's almost like it's a really bad piercing job.
[01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:51.460]   I know.
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:52.860]   It looks like a gauge.
[01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:53.860]   OK.
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:54.860]   No.
[01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:55.860]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:58.300]   This is not-- I like soft plastic.
[01:05:58.300 --> 01:05:59.300]   Yeah, I don't--
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:01.300]   I don't-- that's not going to stay in my ear.
[01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:02.860]   Exactly like the air pods.
[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:03.860]   That's interesting.
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:06.460]   It's air pods on a big pedestal.
[01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:08.580]   Yeah, air pods on a pedestal.
[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:09.580]   Yeah.
[01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:13.620]   All right, because I'm trapped.
[01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:16.820]   Google got some heat.
[01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:20.260]   Some employees said that they had canceled the diversity programs.
[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:25.980]   The presumption was they did it because of criticism from political conservatives.
[01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:28.140]   Sundar Pichai has a response.
[01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:34.580]   He says, Google is investing more research in diversity than ever.
[01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:36.420]   We did not cut them.
[01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:38.900]   This was on the verge cast.
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:41.660]   What we are doing in the company is constantly at our scale.
[01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:42.660]   We look at that first.
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:45.060]   We see what works, what we could scale up better.
[01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:49.700]   All I could say is we probably have more resources invested in diversity now than at any other
[01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:52.900]   point in our history as a company.
[01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:58.900]   Now, they-- NBC had reported that they had canceled the Sojourn program as well as two
[01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:04.420]   other programs, DEI for managers and Allyship 101.
[01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:08.620]   But that doesn't necessarily mean that they didn't replace them.
[01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:12.020]   So.
[01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:17.300]   Pichai said, we have definitely made efforts to make sure the company can accommodate viewpoints.
[01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:20.900]   And no one feels they're not a part of the company regardless of their political viewpoints.
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:27.540]   There are people inside Google who are unhappy, who are feeding people like NBC's stories saying,
[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:30.220]   oh, yeah, they canceled it because they don't believe in diversity anymore.
[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:34.460]   It's pretty hard to know why they might have canceled one program or another especially.
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:36.300]   Or another one is, yeah.
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:40.060]   Have you heard anything about-- so, Deimor's suit was dropped.
[01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:41.060]   It was obviously a settlement.
[01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:42.140]   They settled, obviously.
[01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:44.900]   They can't talk about it when that-- when you settle--
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:46.580]   I wonder who settled for what.
[01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:49.500]   Yeah, we'll never know, will we?
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:51.100]   It's in the clause in the contract.
[01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:56.300]   It says, if anybody asks you, say, everybody was satisfied.
[01:07:56.300 --> 01:08:02.780]   Everybody got what they wanted.
[01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:03.660]   No, you can't say that.
[01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:07.780]   You have to say, everybody-- it was mutually satisfactory solution.
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:08.780]   Right.
[01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:09.460]   So mutually satisfactory.
[01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:10.820]   I thought you weren't supposed to say anything.
[01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:11.820]   You're not well.
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:17.060]   If they ask and you have to say something, you could say, you could say, I can't say.
[01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:20.900]   But I think the best thing is to say, oh, no, it was a mutually satisfactory solution.
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:21.900]   I'm fine.
[01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:22.900]   I'm fine.
[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:23.900]   Yeah.
[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:25.140]   It's like when your wife says, that's fine.
[01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:26.140]   It's fine.
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:27.140]   Yeah.
[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:28.140]   It's one of those.
[01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:29.340]   Oh, it's fine.
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:31.460]   I'm fine.
[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:33.540]   I'm fine.
[01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:36.980]   I think that's just a general passive aggressive treat.
[01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:37.980]   It's not just--
[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:38.980]   I do not know all the time.
[01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:39.980]   It's not only wives.
[01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:41.980]   Do you use fine, Stacey?
[01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:43.420]   Do you say you lose the deal?
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:46.020]   I'm the most aggressive aggressive person that you would ever meet.
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:47.020]   That's good.
[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:48.460]   If I'm telling you, I prefer that.
[01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:49.460]   Oh, me too.
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:50.460]   I'm passive aggressive.
[01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:53.060]   I cannot deal with passive aggressive people.
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.900]   I get aggressive about passive aggressive people.
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:55.900]   Yeah, no, I don't like it.
[01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:57.220]   I want-- tell me the truth.
[01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:58.220]   I can take it.
[01:08:58.220 --> 01:08:59.220]   Just think.
[01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:00.220]   Yeah.
[01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:01.220]   I think.
[01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:02.220]   But I'm fine.
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:03.220]   Excellent.
[01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:04.220]   OK.
[01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:06.220]   Let's move on.
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:07.220]   Hey, you guys.
[01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:08.220]   This is so exciting.
[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:09.220]   I think it's exciting.
[01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:10.220]   I think it's exciting.
[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:11.220]   They are going to do it.
[01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:16.220]   They're going to have a real live in person conference in Berlin.
[01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:17.220]   What?
[01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:18.220]   What?
[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:19.220]   It's a little weird.
[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:21.220]   So, IFA, which is a huge straight show.
[01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:22.220]   I mean, like--
[01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:23.220]   It's like Canik.
[01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:24.220]   Yeah.
[01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:25.220]   And it's--
[01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:26.220]   Let's put their ones.
[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:27.220]   It's crazy.
[01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:30.420]   And it's usually-- is it-- what's that place in Germany?
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:31.420]   It's not usually in Berlin.
[01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:32.420]   Oh, it's in Hamburg?
[01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:33.420]   No.
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:34.420]   Is it in Hanover?
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:35.420]   I don't know.
[01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:36.420]   I don't know.
[01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:37.420]   It's always Hanover.
[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:38.420]   You've got to be in Berlin.
[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:39.420]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:40.420]   OK.
[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:41.420]   IFA is in Berlin.
[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:42.420]   Hanover Bess is in Hanover Bess.
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:43.420]   Yeah.
[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:44.420]   OK.
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:47.660]   So IFA, they've moved it to September.
[01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:51.300]   They're going to only allow 5,000 people because the German government says you could
[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:53.900]   only have 5,000 people.
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:57.620]   So they're going to have-- it's going to be invite only.
[01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:01.860]   They're doing four smaller events and you-- no more than 1,000 attendees can be at each
[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:05.060]   of the smaller events each day.
[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:08.740]   But press conferences only going to have 800 journalists.
[01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:10.780]   So that's pretty-- pretty big.
[01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:11.780]   I mean--
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:14.140]   Now they say they're going to enforce social distancing.
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:19.020]   So will they set these three chairs apart, that kind of thing?
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:20.020]   I don't know.
[01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:23.580]   Because think about how aggressive journalists can be in terms of like cutting in line and
[01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:24.580]   things like that.
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:26.260]   I mean, it's kind of part of your nature.
[01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:29.500]   IFA is almost press conferences.
[01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:31.500]   IFA's tweets.
[01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:33.700]   What happens at promos press conferences?
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:34.700]   Almost.
[01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:35.700]   They're sitting at six feet apart.
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:36.700]   Right.
[01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:37.700]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:39.860]   And the-- well, you watch-- I watch the Hoop press conference and they-- you know, they're
[01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:43.220]   at a round UN table, but they're very far apart.
[01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:47.860]   IFA will offer you-- this is the tweet-- a real life experience and the human connections
[01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:49.500]   we all crave.
[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:52.100]   I'm giving it 50/50.
[01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:56.980]   Yeah, the German government could just say, no, you're not.
[01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:57.980]   Yeah.
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:11:02.900]   Or people could not attend.
[01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:04.780]   It sounds like a recipe for disaster.
[01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:08.180]   I mean, I don't want to be in a room with 1,000 people at any time.
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:09.180]   No.
[01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:10.180]   In a way.
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:14.700]   Well, and this will be-- I mean, there's also virtual events.
[01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:18.380]   A lot of shows-- I enjoy Microsoft Build.
[01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:19.380]   It was great.
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:22.700]   I miss being in person.
[01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:25.940]   I miss-- I don't like people.
[01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:29.020]   I don't even like people, but I do like to do shows.
[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:30.020]   I'm fine.
[01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:31.020]   I'm fine.
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:32.020]   I'm fine.
[01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:33.020]   Fine.
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:34.020]   Fine.
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:35.460]   You know, I'm fine.
[01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:38.100]   No, I agree with you, Stacey.
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:42.940]   Like, if you-- if you-- the three of us were at Google I O, I'd be so thrilled to see you,
[01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:45.100]   and it would be fun, and we'd say hi, and all that stuff.
[01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:47.460]   But I don't know if you have to have that.
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:48.940]   Do you have to have that?
[01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:49.940]   It's nice.
[01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:50.940]   I don't know.
[01:11:50.940 --> 01:12:00.900]   So I miss-- I miss-- there is an element of focus at these things where you can see,
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:05.620]   in real time, you can see what they're putting all their wood behind in terms of who's getting
[01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:08.300]   keynote time and stage and how elaborate it is, right?
[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:10.340]   So that's part of it.
[01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:15.080]   The other thing is you can see how people are reacting, where people are going, like
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:17.780]   where they're-- what sessions they're attending.
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:22.300]   So where the zeitgeist is moving, judging by stuff like that.
[01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:29.460]   And I don't-- there's not a applicable-- there's not a-- the same kind of thing that you can
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:33.060]   see in a virtual setting all the time.
[01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:35.900]   And then there's also just the nice meetings.
[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:40.260]   Like, one of the reasons we chose the platform that we chose for our next event is because
[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:41.860]   there's virtual networking.
[01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:43.700]   And you can go in there and just click.
[01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:48.140]   It'll be randomly allowed to talk to someone for three minutes.
[01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:49.340]   And that's just--
[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:50.340]   It's just be dating.
[01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:53.780]   Yeah, but-- and you can leave early if you don't like the person you're paired up with.
[01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:54.780]   But it's just really random.
[01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:58.580]   And it's kind of like this idea of like when you're in line waiting for something and someone
[01:12:58.580 --> 01:13:00.460]   turns around and is like, yeah.
[01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:01.460]   Yeah.
[01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:02.460]   No, I love that.
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:03.460]   No.
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:04.740]   But as I said, it's enjoyable.
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:05.740]   Is it necessary?
[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:06.740]   How--
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:07.740]   It's necessary for me.
[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:08.740]   That's how I do my job.
[01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:09.740]   That's how I find people.
[01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:10.740]   That's how I find people.
[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:11.740]   Yeah, OK.
[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:13.740]   So you do-- you make connections that you need doing--
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:18.380]   I make up-- and it's also like-- it's part of talking to real people.
[01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:20.780]   Like, Jeff, I'm sure you tell your students, you got to go out.
[01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:24.820]   You can't just trust what executors a company tell you.
[01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:27.420]   You got to talk to users and normals.
[01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:31.380]   By the way, we've got your T-shirt, Jeff.
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:34.620]   This is from the chat room.
[01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:36.260]   Thank you, Zephyr.
[01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:37.260]   It says, I'm fine.
[01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:39.260]   What a cheery chat room we have.
[01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:44.980]   It looks like you were hit by a large caliber shell.
[01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:46.300]   That's terrible.
[01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:47.300]   Terrible.
[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:49.380]   Only going to good news.
[01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:54.300]   So I'm not going to mention that a trade war could break out because the president
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:59.700]   has extended a ban on Huawei and ZTE to Chinese companies.
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:07.340]   And according to 9 to 5 Mac, now China is considering retaliating, calling Apple an unreliable
[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:10.460]   entity as revenge.
[01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:11.860]   I don't think that'll happen.
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:15.380]   I would hope.
[01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:18.740]   China is said to be ready to label Apple an unreliable entity.
[01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:22.700]   Apple makes a lot of money in China.
[01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:28.540]   Since it was the first stores to reopen while the rest of the world's Apple stores or closed
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:30.900]   the Chinese stores were wide open.
[01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:34.500]   Oh, I found a great story.
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:36.700]   Thank God, because I got nothing.
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:37.700]   I have a good one.
[01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:38.700]   Hold on, please.
[01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:39.700]   I'm serious.
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:45.860]   It was in protocol on the beta store because I feel like I'm almost forced to do a changelog
[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:46.860]   here.
[01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:47.860]   There's just nothing.
[01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:50.300]   Oh, I can't do that.
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:51.300]   I'm trying to find it.
[01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:52.300]   I'm so sorry.
[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:56.380]   In protocol, it's all about the beta store and I keep trying to spell the beta store correctly
[01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:57.900]   and it's not helping me find it.
[01:14:57.900 --> 01:14:59.820]   What is the beta store?
[01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:06.140]   The beta store is a store that lets you try things.
[01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:08.060]   Oh, here it is.
[01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:09.060]   Okay.
[01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:12.620]   Finally, Stacey, you think I'd be a better Googler than this?
[01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:15.860]   I'm putting it in the chat room.
[01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:18.380]   Okay.
[01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:22.140]   So this is a store where you can go and test out different devices.
[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:28.300]   So drones, VR goggles, smart old stuff, all kinds of stuff.
[01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:29.940]   V8 TA, I get it.
[01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:30.940]   Yes.
[01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:34.260]   So they actually opened in Texas and in, well, in Texas.
[01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:39.060]   So they have stores in Houston, Austin, and protocol talk to Vibu Norby, who is the CEO
[01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:44.140]   of beta, about what they're doing to open up safely and sanitize.
[01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:53.820]   And it was really interesting, his comments about their, they're very, they're relatively
[01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:55.020]   small.
[01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:59.780]   Each employee is going to guide each customer group through the store.
[01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:04.140]   And as people touch things, the staff members dropping a token.
[01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:05.140]   Oh, wow.
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:06.140]   This has been touched.
[01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:07.980]   Behind each person as they touch.
[01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:08.980]   Yeah, that's smart.
[01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:11.700]   And then he's also, he also created a.
[01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:13.460]   They have one way aisles.
[01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:14.780]   You can only go one way.
[01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:17.460]   Then I started to see that in grocery stores too.
[01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:22.020]   So you don't, yeah, you don't, your breath doesn't encounter somebody else.
[01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:26.220]   So my wife was in the store today and a woman, a woman got halfway down and then turned around.
[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:28.060]   My wife looked at her and she's like, I'm sick of this.
[01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:29.060]   I've had enough.
[01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:30.780]   Just turn around.
[01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:34.380]   Oh, well, shop and they created something called shop safely.
[01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:35.700]   Now this is by them.
[01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:41.540]   So, but this is, this is their basically, they've created a shop safely score for retailers
[01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:45.060]   around the country, including like Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot.
[01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:50.020]   And I just thought this was a really interesting shop safely.co.
[01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:51.700]   Yanko wrote this.
[01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:53.700]   Yeah, yanko.
[01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:54.700]   My buddy.
[01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:59.180]   Your buddy, formerly former Giga home colleague for a long time doing great job reporting and
[01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:01.820]   variety on technology and entertainment.
[01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:03.180]   I guess he's a protocol now.
[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:04.180]   That's great.
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:06.180]   Three former Giga owners are protocol.
[01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:07.260]   You should start looking at their style.
[01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:08.580]   I'm going to start reading protocol.
[01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:10.980]   It's a pretty nice publication.
[01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:12.180]   It's an excellent publication.
[01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:14.140]   I really like it.
[01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:17.700]   The underwhelming reality of a virtual build.
[01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:18.700]   Is this Tom?
[01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.540]   I bet this is my former editor.
[01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:21.540]   Yeah.
[01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:22.540]   Crazy.
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:23.540]   Yeah.
[01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:24.540]   Crass it.
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:25.540]   He doesn't like that.
[01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:26.540]   He's a cranky person.
[01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:27.540]   He is a cranky person.
[01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:29.180]   He and I got in lots of screaming matches.
[01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:30.180]   He's got it.
[01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:32.820]   He's got a cranky, cranky attitude on all this stuff.
[01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:34.820]   So how do they make money protocol?
[01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:36.820]   I don't know.
[01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:38.380]   They have funding.
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:39.380]   They have funding.
[01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:40.380]   It looks free.
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:41.380]   There's no paywall.
[01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:42.380]   It's free.
[01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:44.980]   I assume advertising probably events eventually.
[01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:46.620]   So just starting out.
[01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:47.620]   So yeah.
[01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:48.620]   Yeah.
[01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:50.420]   And to get back to that beta story, that's really the crisis for them.
[01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:52.620]   They started up and then COVID hit.
[01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:53.620]   So they never had a chance.
[01:17:53.620 --> 01:17:54.620]   They've been around for a couple of years.
[01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:55.620]   Oh, they have.
[01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:56.620]   Okay.
[01:17:56.620 --> 01:17:57.620]   They've been around for a while.
[01:17:57.620 --> 01:17:58.620]   Oh, okay.
[01:17:58.620 --> 01:17:59.620]   Yeah.
[01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:00.620]   They're my role.
[01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:01.620]   But this is.
[01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:02.620]   Oh, they are?
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:03.620]   They're in New York.
[01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:04.620]   Oh.
[01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:05.620]   It's.
[01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:09.980]   I mean, it's what was the old store that had the wacky stuff, you know, the chair massaging
[01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:10.980]   all over image.
[01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:15.900]   Yeah, it was better the sharper image because it was actual brand stuff that was good.
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:20.420]   But it had the same appeal of, oh, I want that silly thing that I don't really need.
[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:26.740]   Well, the model is they actually they charge companies to put their stuff in their stores.
[01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:27.740]   Right.
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:28.740]   It's like it's a marketing model.
[01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:29.740]   Yeah.
[01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:32.500]   And then they demo it for people.
[01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:38.780]   And it's for like June actually did an oven demo, you know, in San Francisco stores.
[01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:42.100]   It's the ideas products today are more complicated.
[01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:44.580]   So you want to spend time with them.
[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:48.060]   They don't actually beta's goal is not actually to sell these things.
[01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:49.620]   It's just to show them to you.
[01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:54.020]   If you buy it, great.
[01:18:54.020 --> 01:19:01.060]   Senator Pichai also on the Verge cast says they're going to go slow reopening Google 10
[01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:04.380]   to 15% of the employees at first.
[01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:05.940]   It feels like they were they were.
[01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:11.380]   I mean, the fact that they didn't do Google I/O at all sounds like they were extremely
[01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:17.220]   cautious, more so than Apple, which apparently is already asking people to come back to work.
[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:19.460]   Of course, Apple be in control freakin.
[01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:22.500]   Well, it's really hard for Apple to do what they do.
[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:23.500]   It is.
[01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:24.500]   It is.
[01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:25.500]   Yeah.
[01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:27.860]   Meanwhile, Jack, both of his companies.
[01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:28.860]   I love it.
[01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:29.860]   Rest of your life.
[01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:30.860]   Don't ever come back.
[01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:38.780]   So I'm thinking about I'm curious about this one uses of useless real estate.
[01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:39.780]   Right.
[01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:41.980]   There's a lot of we works.
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:44.340]   There's a lot of we works available.
[01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:45.340]   Hold on.
[01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:46.340]   Hold on.
[01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:51.340]   I wonder whether we work could have a reinvention.
[01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:52.340]   Yeah.
[01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:53.940]   So I'm not going to my office.
[01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:55.180]   I'm here at home.
[01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:57.220]   My wife is fed up with me.
[01:19:57.220 --> 01:19:59.180]   We, you know, we can move to Kansas.
[01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:00.660]   We lose less cheap, right?
[01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:06.340]   But I still, I don't want to have to put the space in my home.
[01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:07.340]   Do I go to where we work?
[01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:08.340]   I live in Manhattan.
[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:09.340]   There's no room in my apartment.
[01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:11.180]   Do I go to where we work?
[01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:19.580]   I wonder whether there's a Starbucks alternative home office future for we work smaller.
[01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:21.660]   That's like executive suites.
[01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:24.300]   And those have been around forever.
[01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:26.820]   We work as an upgrade on that.
[01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:28.740]   Yeah.
[01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:35.140]   I think people, I think there's value in bringing small teams together to collaborate.
[01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:38.820]   And that might be interesting there.
[01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:43.060]   You might also see it as like a quarantining station for someone before they go into a
[01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:45.020]   main office.
[01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:48.940]   But I think most people, if you can work from home, I think the home market is going
[01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:49.940]   to change a little bit.
[01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:54.100]   We're going to see more real estate space dedicated to offices in the homes.
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:55.580]   I think you're right.
[01:20:55.580 --> 01:21:00.860]   Well I have New York friends, obviously, who now, who looked down their noses at me for
[01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:05.300]   being a bridge and tunnel guy who are now saying, I think I'm moving out to Jersey.
[01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:09.780]   They get more space and it'll come in as often it changes your calculus of where you
[01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:11.220]   want to be.
[01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:16.020]   My calculus was really changed when I could just park in front of my house.
[01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:20.760]   And it really changed when we moved and added the downtown Petaluma, which is turning into
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:25.020]   a giant metropolis to our east side studio this year.
[01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:27.820]   And I could park and I didn't get any tickets.
[01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:32.260]   I have to say, after a while, as you get older, living in the country ain't so bad, bridge
[01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:33.260]   and tunnel guy.
[01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:36.700]   Oh yeah, no, I agree.
[01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:38.620]   And you're living on Ireland.
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:41.700]   Well I've never had to work.
[01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:46.340]   When I left New York, I had to live in New York to work at the publication there.
[01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:50.620]   And then I went to my next job where I had to work in an office.
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:52.980]   But after that, I never did.
[01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:54.980]   My husband's never had to work in an office.
[01:21:54.980 --> 01:21:57.020]   You had to be well motivated though, right?
[01:21:57.020 --> 01:22:02.100]   I mean, you don't need to say, you don't need somebody to say, okay, you're in a deadline,
[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:03.660]   let's get going or anything like that.
[01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:08.500]   Well, no, that's the beauty of a journalism job is I have a deadline all the time.
[01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:09.500]   So, you know.
[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:15.820]   My problem is the radio show from my house, I used to do my radio show from the house.
[01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:20.500]   And it was terrible because it was too easy to get up and slide in your slippers.
[01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:23.100]   And because it's radio, you don't have to put, you don't have to do it.
[01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:24.100]   You just slide in.
[01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:25.460]   Sit down.
[01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:27.260]   And the energy level was awful.
[01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:33.220]   So I ended up renting a studio out of the house just because it didn't work wasn't good.
[01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:35.780]   My energy was not very good.
[01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:37.860]   So imagine, I need to come to work.
[01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:41.900]   Notice, I'm the only host at Twit that comes into the studio.
[01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:46.260]   And I can, it's my luxury because I can say, well, I'm going to be here.
[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:48.060]   But that, and that you can't be here.
[01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:51.380]   I don't know, actually, I should ask them if they mind working at home, they all seem
[01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:55.300]   to be doing great jobs, doing their shows from the house.
[01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:57.460]   And you guys are all working at home.
[01:22:57.460 --> 01:23:01.420]   I'm the only one who's in here with me and Jeff.
[01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:02.420]   I can't.
[01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:04.220]   I like how you literate Jeff there.
[01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:05.220]   Not that Jeff.
[01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:06.220]   The other Jeff.
[01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:07.220]   No, the other Jeff.
[01:23:07.220 --> 01:23:11.020]   Jeff one, Jeff two, we'll let you guess which one I got to figure out how to do this.
[01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:13.820]   I'm going to call you Jarvis from now on.
[01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:14.820]   I can't like it anyway.
[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:17.380]   Sounds like you're my lover.
[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:18.380]   Jarvis Jarvis.
[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:19.380]   What do you say?
[01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:21.500]   Some people think it's my first name.
[01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:22.980]   Hickenbotham and Jarvis.
[01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:24.700]   That's what we should call this show.
[01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:25.700]   Wow, I like that.
[01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:27.780]   It sounds like a tea brand.
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:35.780]   Yes, I drink only, I drink only a fine formosa from Hickenbotham and Jarvis.
[01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:37.780]   Oh, that is fancy.
[01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:38.780]   Yes.
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:39.780]   I like that.
[01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:40.780]   I like that.
[01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:47.340]   Hickenbotham, are you excited about Microsoft's 285,000 processor supercomputer in the cloud?
[01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:48.340]   Yes.
[01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:52.820]   That's not what I was excited about.
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:54.660]   That didn't get much.
[01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:55.660]   Yes.
[01:23:55.660 --> 01:23:59.460]   Yes, it's using Azure Azure.
[01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:01.860]   What were you excited about by build?
[01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:02.860]   Fluid?
[01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:03.860]   You say about fluid?
[01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:11.460]   No, I was excited about the digital twin stuff in Microsoft RTOS or Azure RTOS.
[01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:12.460]   But that's just me.
[01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:13.460]   But let's talk about that.
[01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:14.460]   That is you.
[01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:18.540]   I mean, okay, RTOS, real-time operating system, Azure.
[01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:21.020]   Let's talk about normal people stuff.
[01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:23.340]   It's just because I was excited about the Internet of Things.
[01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:24.340]   You're so amazing.
[01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:25.940]   I just love that.
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:28.340]   I like people who have oddball enthusiasms.
[01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:31.340]   No, it's always the best people.
[01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:34.020]   So I'm reading about the supercomputer really fast.
[01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:35.020]   No, you don't have to read that.
[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:36.020]   And I can trust the author.
[01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:37.020]   I'm moving on.
[01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:38.020]   Yeah, you trust him.
[01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:39.860]   No, you think that's a stone skipped on the water?
[01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:40.860]   That's it.
[01:24:40.860 --> 01:24:41.860]   It's now sun.
[01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:42.860]   It's fun.
[01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:45.740]   And it's like a framework sounds to me kind of interesting.
[01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:48.740]   And we've been talking about it on Windows Weekly without much understanding of what
[01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:50.540]   they're trying to do.
[01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:56.620]   It is something that for a long time computer companies have wanted to do, Microsoft too,
[01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:59.300]   where a document isn't just a document.
[01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:01.660]   It's what it sounds like.
[01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:02.660]   Fluid framework.
[01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:03.660]   It's way.
[01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:04.660]   It's a little dot.
[01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:05.660]   It sounds like way.
[01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:06.660]   It's a little wave.
[01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:07.660]   Yeah.
[01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:08.660]   It sounds like wave.
[01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:10.340]   You embed different bits and pieces.
[01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:12.060]   It's very web focused.
[01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:15.260]   They're changeable wherever they are.
[01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:16.260]   That's why you're right.
[01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:17.260]   It's wave.
[01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:18.260]   It is wave.
[01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:19.900]   It is the vision of wave.
[01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:22.460]   And what's said is wave was really cool.
[01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:23.460]   It was.
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:27.260]   Poor Gina Jopani wrote her book and it died so fast.
[01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:33.060]   Well, that's because Google sucks at marketing and explaining its cool tech to people.
[01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:37.260]   Well, maybe the fluid framework will be, you know, the wavy thing.
[01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:39.180]   Microsoft will overcomplicate it.
[01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:41.780]   People have to have talking paper clips to tell you how to use it.
[01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:43.700]   But other than that, it'll be fun.
[01:25:43.700 --> 01:25:44.860]   Looks like you're trying to make it work.
[01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:46.500]   Clippy was like 20 years ago.
[01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:47.740]   We've got to let it go.
[01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:49.540]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:51.900]   Never, never, never, never, never, never.
[01:25:51.900 --> 01:26:01.580]   And that brings me to the Google change log.
[01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:02.580]   Wow, Jeffy.
[01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:03.780]   Good job, Jeff.
[01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:06.780]   Jeffy did it.
[01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:09.380]   Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:13.460]   Now I am not a tab maven, but maybe, and as you know, I don't use chrome, but maybe you
[01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:15.500]   guys are tab mavens.
[01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:18.100]   They are now in Google Chrome in what is it?
[01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:19.100]   83.
[01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:22.660]   They're putting, they're rolling out grouped tabs.
[01:26:22.660 --> 01:26:24.140]   Cluster tabs.
[01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:25.140]   Cluster tabs.
[01:26:25.140 --> 01:26:26.140]   I like that.
[01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:27.140]   I'm giving it a.
[01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:28.780]   So I like pinning tabs.
[01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:31.980]   You can see here in Firefox effect, I've pinned some tabs.
[01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:35.100]   They have a little button and then they're persistent so that when you close the window
[01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:38.300]   and you reopen them, the tabs, these little pin tabs are there.
[01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:40.540]   And Google's Chrome's got that too, right?
[01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:41.700]   You can pin a tab.
[01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:43.900]   So how does this relate to that?
[01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:46.700]   What is the group tab feature?
[01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:50.860]   I just thought you could group your tabs together so they all stayed like.
[01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:52.460]   They're persistent groups.
[01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:53.460]   Yeah.
[01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:59.260]   I only, so I'll confess Kevin actually showed me pin tabs probably like two months ago.
[01:26:59.260 --> 01:27:00.260]   And I was like, what?
[01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:01.900]   That's the best thing ever.
[01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:02.900]   Yeah.
[01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:06.340]   So I don't know how they would differ because I am.
[01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:12.260]   Well, I, you know, so for instance, I have a folder right now called study.
[01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:17.140]   So it's the, you know, it's my online study class and the various documentation and things
[01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:19.820]   I need is, and I can open them all.
[01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:24.460]   It's a folder, but I can just, if I open it all, all the tabs will open, but whatever,
[01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:25.980]   like that.
[01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:26.980]   But I'm not sure.
[01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:33.100]   So this is similar it looks like because here's Google showing a tab called reading.
[01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:38.540]   It's highlighted in special and inside reading are, I would presume, are a bunch of other
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:39.540]   tabs.
[01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:43.380]   So basically nobody ever figured out bookmarks.
[01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:44.380]   Right.
[01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:46.620]   What was the great, oh, I'm forgetting.
[01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:49.420]   What was the great service, the bookmark service that we all used?
[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:51.420]   Oh, I love it.
[01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:52.420]   Just.
[01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:57.220]   And I had to, you know, deliver.
[01:27:57.220 --> 01:27:58.220]   Delicious.
[01:27:58.220 --> 01:27:59.220]   You are a horrible.
[01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:00.220]   You are delicious.
[01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:01.220]   That's it.
[01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:05.220]   See, I use pinboard because pinboard took the delicious API and Machia Chiglaski said, I'm,
[01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:06.220]   you know, he missed it.
[01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:08.360]   He said, I'm just going to write something that uses the API.
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.600]   And that's why I've used pinboard ever since.
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:11.600]   But delicious.
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:12.600]   We all used that.
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:13.600]   Oh, it was wonderful.
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:14.600]   Yeah.
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:15.540]   It was delightful.
[01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:17.880]   It was delicious.
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:20.360]   So people do know how to use bookmarks.
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:21.520]   Is that why you use a mark?
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:23.400]   I've got, I've got my bookmarks.
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:25.120]   I use the people.
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:26.120]   They're going to clean up their bookmarks.
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:27.120]   Like, I have a weekend.
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:28.120]   I'll clean up my bookmarks.
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:29.120]   So do the taxes.
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:30.120]   Right.
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:31.120]   Nobody ever cleans up the bookmarks.
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:32.120]   Oh, no, I do.
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:33.120]   I use Google keep.
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:35.320]   Oh, you actually wait, what?
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:37.820]   I have very tidy bookmarks.
[01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:38.820]   He's talking to me.
[01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:39.820]   I'm not obnoxious.
[01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:42.320]   You probably have email box.
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:43.320]   You wrote to.
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:48.520]   He's talking about me because I have organized folders, sub folders.
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:54.080]   And because I use Firefox, my bookmarks sync to everywhere I go.
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:55.560]   So I have, it's a muscle memory.
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:57.440]   I know exactly where all my bookmarks are.
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:59.080]   I love bookmarks.
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:03.840]   I don't really, like I have a bookmark bar with my essential things, but there's only
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:06.600]   10 bookmarks that I have at all times.
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:10.760]   And I don't add to bookmarks because usually when you bookmark something, well, this is
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:16.160]   probably our job, but like I want to save articles for a relatively short amount of time.
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:18.000]   And so then I stick them in keep.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:24.320]   Yes, bookmarks are not for their for pages, not for their for sites, not for pages.
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:30.600]   Well, yeah, but there's only like, I mean, yeah, but you start bookmarking pages, you're
[01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:32.520]   going to have a lot of.
[01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:39.920]   Well, I had a recipe folder where I took my bookmarks, like I bookmarked recipes and
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:44.000]   stuck them in the recipe folder, but I moved on that to keep.
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.800]   See, okay, I get, I get where the problem lies.
[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:48.800]   Yeah.
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:52.200]   Cause so for instance, I have a news folder of news bookmarks.
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:55.560]   It's not individual news stories.
[01:29:55.560 --> 01:30:00.240]   It's, it's, that's what I use delicious or, or pin board for.
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:01.400]   So these are all sources.
[01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:06.600]   So tech meme, nuzzle, Reddit, pin board, popular bookmarks, h hacker news.
[01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:08.040]   So these are all sources.
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:12.080]   But then if I go to hacker news and I say, Oh, this is good.
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:17.000]   And this I will, I will, I will put on pin board.
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.320]   So that's what pin board is it?
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:19.320]   Cause it's too big.
[01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:21.360]   It's too, it would be too ungainly to bookmark.
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:24.960]   And from pin board, it goes on with, with that's the one where this then that's the
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:25.960]   app.
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:26.960]   You're into the rundown with zappier.
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:27.960]   Yeah.
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:29.160]   It goes into the rundown and all sorts of places.
[01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:30.160]   Yeah.
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:34.920]   So my pin board is actually doing that individual page thing.
[01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:36.360]   And that's what delicious was.
[01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:38.240]   So and the pin boards organized to do that.
[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:42.040]   You can look at, if I look at my pin board, these are all the news stories we're covering.
[01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:45.400]   And then I use tags to organize them.
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:50.120]   So these are all that, these are all the stories we've ever done for Twig.
[01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:53.680]   So these are this, if you wanted to go back in history to every story I've ever done
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:57.680]   on Twig, it's, it would be there, which would be ridiculous.
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:30:58.680]   It's Austin.
[01:30:58.680 --> 01:30:59.680]   Yeah.
[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:03.240]   But if you just go to the top, these are the most, they're in chronological order.
[01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:05.160]   And that, yeah, I think this works really well.
[01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:08.440]   So that's so the, those are the ones you put on, but when I put something on the rundown,
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:09.600]   it doesn't show up there.
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:10.600]   No, no.
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:13.960]   The rundown is kind of the final arbiter that we put together.
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:14.960]   You can show this.
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:15.960]   It's okay.
[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:18.040]   This is the final arbiter that we put together for each show.
[01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:19.040]   Karsten does this.
[01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:23.880]   You can see each, this is a Google sheet that has tabs for every show.
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:25.360]   And that has all the stories.
[01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:30.960]   And so when you give us something, that's, that's where that goes.
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:31.960]   Right.
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:34.160]   So I think it's using the right tool for the right job.
[01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:39.440]   I don't, I don't use browser bookmarks for, for pages so much.
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:44.040]   So though you see, here's my programming folder with every language I'm interested in.
[01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:47.840]   And in many cases, these are individual pages, but they're kind of the pages that I want
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:52.280]   to keep forever, you know, like I'm always going to want, sometimes there's sites, but
[01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:57.520]   most of the time there are, there are things I'm going to want for a long time.
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:00.680]   Not just like a ephemera like news stories.
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:03.280]   Yeah, that shouldn't go in your bookmarks here.
[01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:06.360]   You'll just end up having too many.
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:07.360]   Right.
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:10.320]   Well, and I don't mean them forever.
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:11.480]   Keeps a good idea.
[01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:12.680]   You should try pin board Stacy.
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:15.800]   If you haven't tried it, I really, it's perfect for that.
[01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:20.400]   Because the tags will give you a taxonomy, making it very easy to find what you're looking
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:21.400]   for.
[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:22.400]   What about my ontologies?
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:25.040]   Will they give me an ontology?
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:27.820]   I'm so sorry.
[01:32:27.820 --> 01:32:29.960]   You are being very helpful and I will try out pin board.
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:32.240]   I'm a huge fan of pin board.
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:36.400]   And then there's a lot of additional stuff you can do.
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:40.120]   For instance, there's a, I use a bookmark as I'm going through pages.
[01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:41.120]   You could use pocket for that.
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:42.520]   Do you ever use pocket for that or instant?
[01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:43.880]   I did use pocket for a while.
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:44.880]   Yeah.
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:45.880]   Pocket's a good way to do that.
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:47.480]   But pin board to me is a little bit better.
[01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:52.200]   It has pocket like features, but see, I just, these little summaries, I put those in.
[01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:58.800]   So if I just use keep because it's on my phone, it's on my, uh, thing I'm talking to you
[01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:01.120]   right now, computer computer.
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:05.240]   So let's say here's this article, by the way, which we should talk about door dash and pizza
[01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:08.240]   arbitrage, which is a great article.
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:09.240]   Yeah.
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:10.240]   So great article.
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:17.600]   And the, and the funniest one is so the guy's making money because he charges $24 for
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:20.840]   pizza, but door dash is listed for 16.
[01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:26.280]   So he was buying pizzas from door dash and reselling them, thereby making $8 a pizza.
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:31.920]   So what I'll do is I will, I will highlight that, that salient point, go to pin board.
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:37.600]   See pin board now has the link, the title and that paragraph.
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:42.600]   And then I can tag it twig, for instance, and it suggests tags.
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:44.120]   And then I had the bookmark.
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:50.080]   And now when I go to pin board, it's, it's already there with that little highlight.
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:51.880]   I think this is a really good way to work.
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:53.840]   I love pinboard it.
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:56.920]   And it's got the Zapier link or it's happier.
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:34:00.680]   Well, it, there was a kind of Zapier program.
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:01.760]   Now is that your does?
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:02.920]   I do it via RSS.
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:05.120]   So I just have the RSS feed for this.
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:09.760]   And when something new enters the RSS feeds, Zapier automatically puts that in Google sheets.
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:14.960]   And they also tweeted, I have a Twitter account called links for tweet that it goes to.
[01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:20.720]   So I've talked about that before, but yeah, I think pin board is really a good solution.
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:24.800]   And Machade had a good idea because he saw it delicious go by the wayside that gets sold
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:27.680]   to Yahoo where it was neglected and blah, blah, blah.
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:30.360]   So what he said is I'm going to charge.
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:31.360]   But he did something clever.
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:32.840]   He said it was cheaper.
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:35.520]   The sooner you bought it, the less it cost.
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:39.600]   And I have a life, I bought it paid like $20 for a lifetime membership.
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:41.760]   I don't know how much it costs now.
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:44.160]   But as he got more members, he charged more money.
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:46.640]   It was a very interesting plan.
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:50.280]   But he's basically set it up so it's self supporting.
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:54.520]   I have 12,494 bookmarks on pin board.
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:56.280]   I joined in 2010.
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:35:00.360]   Oh, and by the way, people can subscribe to your bookmarks.
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:02.040]   165 people follow my bookmarks.
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:06.160]   I even know that, which is wild.
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:08.080]   They might not even know it either.
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:10.520]   They may not be one of those whimsical decisions you make.
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:12.200]   And you're like, why is this happening?
[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:16.160]   My email is filled with this crap from Leo.
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:18.440]   And you use this works with pocket.
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:22.760]   They also have a pocket like feature that will save a whole page for later reading.
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:25.840]   They have a read it later feature, which I don't pay for.
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:27.520]   It's additional cost.
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:28.800]   I think there's a lot of nice features.
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:32.440]   It has a lot as an API is anyway.
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:34.000]   We're in the middle of the changing line.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000]   I don't know.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.440]   I'm so sorry.
[01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:37.440]   This is the question.
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:38.440]   It out.
[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:41.640]   This is the kind of service, by the way, Google could really have offered.
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:44.240]   Yahoo should have done a better job.
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:49.280]   ASUS announces hardware dedicated to Google Meet.
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:51.240]   This is an advantage Cisco had early on.
[01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:52.920]   They had dedicated hardware.
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:58.680]   ASUS, a Taiwanese computer manufacturer, is going to make specific hardware, including
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:06.840]   a camera, a screen, a computer, and a switch for video conferencing with Google Meet.
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:07.840]   It is a...
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:11.400]   Oh, a meet quality in the midst of the pandemic has been really bad for me.
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:13.160]   Yeah, me too.
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:14.160]   Maybe this will work better.
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:16.360]   It's an i7 processor.
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:18.760]   It's 128 gig SSD.
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:25.360]   It has a magnetic chassis so you can knock it, just dump it to the included stand or mounted
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:28.360]   out of sight, which I think is really clever.
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:29.360]   This is pretty nice.
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:31.600]   I think it's a nice idea.
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:33.280]   It's not cheap.
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:37.120]   It'll be about $2,000 for the starter kit.
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:44.080]   The medium room, small medium room kit, $2400, the large room kit, which doesn't include
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:48.480]   a camera $2,000 you provide your own camera.
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:49.800]   I thought that was kind of interesting.
[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:54.080]   That's really more of an ASUS thing.
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:58.240]   We mentioned already that the Exposure Notification API is out.
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:03.000]   Actually, what we didn't do though is go to the Google blog post where they announced
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.680]   this.
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:10.240]   This is the joint statement by Apple and Google, if you want to learn more.
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:14.800]   They don't talk too much about how it works.
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:18.680]   But someday you'll get it, today's the day.
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:21.240]   Someday today you'll get it.
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:27.920]   Chrome has been updated quite a bit with more privacy tools, easier to manage cookies and
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:29.280]   site settings.
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:33.680]   They've reorganized the controls to make it easy to find the most sensitive website
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:40.880]   permissions like camera access, microphone access, location access.
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:44.760]   If you just got the new Chrome, which you probably did, you might want to take a look
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:49.560]   in the privacy and security section of the settings because there's some new settings
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:50.560]   in there.
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:51.560]   You may want to manage.
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:53.360]   Chrome is playing catch up.
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:55.000]   There's Brave, Firefox.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:01.520]   There are a lot of browsers out there, even Microsoft's Edge that have somewhat better
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:03.800]   security controls built in.
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:10.600]   There's new controls in Google Photos for how you share albums.
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:16.640]   They keep talking about this sharing stuff, and I keep trying to use it.
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:20.840]   You can still do it via a link which you can embed, of course, in an email or text or
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:23.680]   blog.
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:28.560]   But you have the option to turn a link sharing on or off anytime.
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:31.800]   You can decide if you want to let other collaborators add photos to an album.
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:33.280]   I like the shared album.
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:37.200]   I think that's really cool, where you could say, "You go to a wedding and say, "Everybody
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:39.120]   share your pictures into this shared album."
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:40.120]   I've done that.
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:42.760]   So, take a look at the sharing features.
[01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:44.200]   I'm not sure how this has changed.
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:48.440]   Rolling out this week, when sharing an album, the default option will be to share it with
[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:53.400]   a specific person via their Google account.
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:58.400]   Oh, and then when you remove stuff, it will pull the stuff from the album that they may
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:38:59.400]   have.
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:00.400]   Yes.
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:01.400]   They may have this.
[01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:02.400]   Yes.
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:03.400]   It gives you more long-term control over that.
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:05.840]   That's one of the problems if you share it with just a link.
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:10.000]   You can potentially lose control.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:16.880]   I think we all want to celebrate the Aloha spirit with Israel.
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:20.560]   Kamah, Kamahoha, Khokah, Khaokki.
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:24.720]   His 61st birthday.
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:29.280]   It wasn't so beautiful.
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:31.920]   The recording of this is amazing.
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:33.480]   It was many years ago.
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:37.840]   It was pretty young.
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:41.320]   The producer tells the story of, "I shouldn't play this whole thing, right?
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:44.760]   Because Israel's people will come after us."
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:49.880]   Yeah, Khristan started to run out and get this car and run over here.
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:54.120]   He called the producer in like two in the morning and said, "I have to come over.
[01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:55.200]   I just have to..."
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:57.200]   Did it in one take?
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:58.200]   Cheers.
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:00.480]   It was just amazing.
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:01.920]   It's amazing story.
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:09.160]   So we all have the Aloha spirit now, especially with Hawaii in our minds.
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:12.880]   That's the Google Doodle celebrating.
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:16.080]   Here it is if you go to google.com.
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:17.440]   There's Israel.
[01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:19.720]   I'm sorry, I'm going to ruin his name.
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:22.760]   Kamah Kawiyule.
[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:25.520]   Kawa Ule.
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:26.520]   I cannot help you.
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:28.480]   You can ask Google how to pronounce his name.
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:29.800]   If that means pronounce his name.
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:34.800]   Kamah Kawiyule.
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:41.120]   Anyway, if you press the button and play, which is cool, they put the video right in there.
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:43.960]   So how could I get in trouble for playing this?
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:47.720]   I'm just playing the Google front page.
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:48.720]   Brother Izzy.
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:50.520]   I'll just call him Brother Is.
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:53.200]   Oh man, that is such a good song.
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:55.320]   I never tire that song.
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:56.320]   Yeah.
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:58.280]   That and Hallelujah.
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:40:59.280]   Yes.
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:00.280]   Which version is your favorite?
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:04.360]   Well, it's the most recorded song ever.
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:05.360]   What was your favorite version?
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:06.360]   Was it the...
[01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:07.360]   Of course...
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:09.680]   Katie Langs is good.
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:10.680]   Okay.
[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:11.680]   Okay.
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:12.680]   Heroes.
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:18.720]   I really like the original, even though he's not the greatest singer ever.
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:21.160]   He passed away from the letter Cohen.
[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:23.120]   He passed away a few years ago.
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:25.200]   He wrote it.
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:28.400]   He's wrote it and he deserves the credit for writing the most amazing song.
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:30.200]   It is a beautiful listen to.
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:36.040]   And then the most pretty version, it's on my funeral playlist, actually.
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:38.600]   Luden Wainwright.
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:39.600]   No Rufus.
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:40.600]   His son.
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:41.600]   Loud and Wainwright's son Rufus.
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:42.600]   Loud and Tack.
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:43.600]   Yeah.
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:44.600]   Rufus Wainwright.
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:45.600]   Thank you for remembering.
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:47.040]   You must have my funeral playlist.
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:51.760]   I sent it to many people as I could so that it would get played.
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:53.920]   It's just most people's answer.
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:54.920]   So...
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:55.920]   Yeah.
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:56.920]   Rufus Wainwright.
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:57.920]   It's beautiful.
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:41:58.920]   Yeah.
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:41:59.920]   It is overplayed.
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:02.480]   I'm going to give you something that's really cool.
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:03.560]   Copy link address.
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:05.560]   Put into the...
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:10.680]   I just put it in the second tweet, last tweet there in the rundown chat.
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:16.440]   Carsten does, by the way, say that Leonard Cohen was, in fact, a great singer.
[01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:17.680]   And I guess in many respects he was.
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:19.200]   He was a great singer for his music.
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:21.760]   If you listen to Bird on a Wire, it's pretty amazing.
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:22.760]   Like Bird.
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:24.720]   I don't know why.
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:25.720]   Yeah.
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:26.720]   I love him.
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:27.720]   No, I play him all the time.
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:29.320]   But it's like Bob Dylan.
[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:30.640]   It's an acquired taste.
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:33.160]   So I just put in a TikTok version.
[01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:34.160]   Which is great.
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:35.160]   Hallelujah.
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:36.160]   He starts it off and then, yeah.
[01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:37.160]   Nice.
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:39.360]   Let's play that for everybody.
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:41.720]   This is Austin Owens.
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:43.720]   And it's the Hallelujah duet.
[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:45.720]   Somebody do it.
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:46.720]   This...
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:47.720]   It's made just amazing.
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:48.720]   Oh, I'll do it.
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:49.720]   What song we singing?
[01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:55.720]   I know this one.
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:43:00.720]   See, I like it a lower register.
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:03.720]   Oh, wait.
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:05.720]   Yes.
[01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:07.720]   My turn.
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:10.720]   When it goes like this, the fourth.
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:11.720]   Yeah.
[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:15.720]   Give it some church.
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:22.720]   How do they do this in sync?
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:26.720]   A little bit like that.
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:27.720]   That's TikTok.
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:28.720]   TikTok will do.
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:29.720]   So TikTok puts it up there.
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:31.720]   And then you follow along.
[01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:33.720]   Oh, so they didn't do it together.
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:35.720]   No, they don't do it together.
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:36.720]   No, it's...
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:41.720]   That first guy, the little guy, puts it up and then he can have a hundred people who
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:43.720]   will then do it next.
[01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:46.720]   This Austin Owens doesn't know the little guy.
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:47.720]   No.
[01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:48.720]   No, that's...
[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:49.720]   But he's acting like...
[01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:50.720]   But he's acting like...
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:51.720]   They're like buddies, but there's not.
[01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:52.720]   That's just how you do it.
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:55.720]   You can embed multiple TikToks.
[01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:56.720]   Oh.
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:57.720]   So that's how people...
[01:43:57.720 --> 01:43:58.720]   That's the whole...
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:01.720]   I'll throw the ball and somebody else catches the ball.
[01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:03.720]   Then they throw the ball and somebody else catches the ball.
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:05.720]   That's kind of how they do the TikToks.
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:06.720]   I'm gonna have to get on the TikTok, man.
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:08.720]   The kids are so good.
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:09.720]   And that's...
[01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:10.720]   That's...
[01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:12.720]   Is it everything?
[01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:13.720]   Is that it?
[01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:14.720]   Is that the Google change log?
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:15.720]   Or is it not?
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:16.720]   It's enough.
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:17.720]   It's enough.
[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:18.720]   Yes, it is.
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:19.720]   It is.
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:20.720]   That's the Google change log.
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:24.720]   By the way, not to return to the things you've already skipped on the water and put
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:31.720]   down, but right above that in the chat there is Twitter's example of the new feature.
[01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:32.720]   Okay.
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:33.720]   Let's see it.
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:34.720]   Let's see it.
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:37.720]   And they're telling me in the chatroom that cousin...
[01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:38.720]   Brother is dead.
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:41.720]   I know he passed away a long time ago.
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:42.720]   You up?
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:43.720]   NASA?
[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:46.720]   So Twitter says to NASA, "You up?"
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:47.720]   Yeah.
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:48.720]   NASA say...
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:51.720]   The conversation between Twitter and people they mentioned, the tweet's the only NASA
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:53.720]   can answer and NASA says...
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:54.720]   Yeah.
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:55.720]   Tweeting from Earth.
[01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:56.720]   What's up with you?
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:57.720]   Nice.
[01:44:57.720 --> 01:44:58.720]   We love Earth.
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:44:59.720]   Just look at it.
[01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:00.720]   How's the Wi-Fi up there?
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:03.000]   And what's your favorite space snack?
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:07.320]   Is this actually somebody in the space station?
[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:08.320]   Wi-Fi is pretty decent.
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:11.680]   Some of our NASA astronauts can tweet up from up their favorite snack.
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:12.680]   Launch me.
[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:14.240]   Ha ha ha ha.
[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:22.000]   So Mars, V, our NASA Perseveral Rober is launching there in July.
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.000]   Watch with us.
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000]   It's a date.
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.160]   How do they do that?
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:28.920]   That's so cool.
[01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:30.320]   So no one else can...
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:31.800]   This is why you do that.
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:34.640]   No one else can get in on this.
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:35.640]   And you know what?
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:38.160]   That's my biggest problem with Twitter is you're having a nice conversation.
[01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:41.280]   So, can you enroll their message?
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:48.440]   Well, Stacey noted the question is Stacey, does that solve any of your raised issues about
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:49.600]   Harris' business stuff?
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:50.600]   She doesn't have a problem.
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:51.600]   People, she knows Twitter.
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:52.600]   I don't know.
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:54.040]   I don't understand it.
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:56.440]   People are asking me how to do it.
[01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:58.040]   Anyway, I just wanted to make sense.
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:45:59.200]   Smart stuff.
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:02.880]   I even have my DMs open.
[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:07.880]   Okay, don't show this on the screen, but six people replied to my "Hello, Jeff Jarvis."
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:09.520]   But see, this is why I don't know.
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:11.760]   I don't want to open that.
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:16.840]   Who knows what's in there, right?
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:18.440]   One of them, I replied to.
[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:21.800]   Yeah, but I'm not going to look at it because I don't know.
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:23.280]   It's a package.
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:27.800]   Every time I get a package of a certain shape, I worry about what's in it.
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:29.480]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:32.960]   It's that package.
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:37.240]   Let's take a break and then...
[01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:39.000]   Too much of my psyche is bleeding out now.
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.000]   This is not good.
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.840]   I'm going to put a lid on it, Leo.
[01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:45.400]   Be the show host you were meant to be.
[01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:47.840]   Don't let any of your personality come out.
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:48.840]   Okay.
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:49.840]   We're going to take a break.
[01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:55.480]   When we come back, picks numbers and final thoughts from Stacey, Higginbotham and Jeff
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:47:00.600]   Jarvis, the fabulous tea company, Higginbotham and Jarvis.
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:03.160]   Hey, Gable, I'm in Jarvis.
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:05.480]   Higgin, Balfoom and Jarvis.
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:07.200]   Oh, I like them.
[01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:09.360]   I make a great kappa.
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:12.240]   Our show today brought to you by ExpressVPN, boy, now more than ever.
[01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:16.520]   Now that we know that the Patriot Act has passed, we can talk.
[01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:18.400]   Yeah, we can talk when we come back.
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:22.880]   And that without a warrant, law enforcement can go to your internet service provider and
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:26.800]   say, "I'd like to see everything Leo looked after the last 20 years."
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:27.800]   And you know who knows that?
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:31.280]   You're an internet service provider because you go through them every time, right?
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:35.040]   That's one of the many reasons people love ExpressVPN.
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:38.400]   A virtual private network protects your security.
[01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:43.120]   We all know that if you're on an open Wi-Fi network.
[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:49.200]   But nowadays, we're not doing that as much, but you also protect your privacy because whatever
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:53.060]   the carrier, whether it's at the coffee shop, your phone company or your internet service
[01:47:53.060 --> 01:47:57.640]   provider at home, they see everything you do and they record it.
[01:47:57.640 --> 01:47:59.440]   You can, I know people say, "Well, it's all right.
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:00.440]   I use incognito."
[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:06.520]   No, incognito mode doesn't hide from your internet service provider.
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:11.000]   Even if you clear your browsing history, your internet service provider is a record of every
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.080]   single website you've ever visited.
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:17.520]   And now, law enforcement can get it without a warrant.
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:18.760]   Just ask for it.
[01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:22.560]   That's why when I'm home, I never go online without ExpressVPN.
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:25.160]   First of all, I know some people say, "Well, I don't want to do that because it's going
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:26.160]   to slow me down."
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:28.400]   ExpressVPN is the fastest VPN you've ever used.
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:32.360]   It is indistinguishable from not using a VPN.
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:34.720]   So you're really moving fast.
[01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:38.240]   Several times I've accidentally left the VPN on and not even noticed.
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:39.800]   It's that fast.
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:43.200]   And they make sure your ISP can't see a thing.
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:45.880]   Your internet connection is rerouted through their secure servers.
[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:51.440]   Now, it's very important to understand that, yeah, sure, you're private for the ISP, but
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:53.960]   the VPN now in effect sees all of that.
[01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:57.680]   So it's really important that you use a VPN that is not logging, is not tracking what
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:48:58.680]   you're doing.
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:48:59.680]   And that's ExpressVPN.
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:04.920]   Their trusted server technology means they spin up a new server the minute you log in,
[01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:06.320]   it cannot write to the hard drive.
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:07.320]   It's sandboxed.
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:12.800]   And the minute you leave, it shuts down with absolutely no trace, no footprints left in
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:13.800]   the sand.
[01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:18.800]   ExpressVPN cannot and will not log your data.
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:24.680]   And that's been validated and verified by an independent third party audit.
[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:26.680]   I really love ExpressVPN.
[01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:29.920]   And because when you emerge in the internet, you're coming from their servers, no one knows
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:30.920]   that's you.
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:32.760]   Thousands of other people use that same IP address.
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:34.600]   So you're anonymized.
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:39.400]   Also your data is encrypted with 100% of the best in class encryption.
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:42.400]   So your information's safe.
[01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:46.440]   And it works on every device you've got, even your smart TV ExpressVPN is on your phone.
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:47.640]   It's on your computer.
[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:48.640]   It's on your laptop.
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:51.320]   Just tap one button and you're protected.
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:55.080]   Rated number one by CNET, wired, the Verge, countless more.
[01:49:55.080 --> 01:50:00.240]   That's the one I use, the fastest and the most trusted VPN on the market.
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:03.280]   And now more than ever, we really need it.
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:04.280]   ExpressVPN.com/twig.
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:07.920]   You'll get an extra three months free and a one year package.
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:08.920]   That's the best deal.
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:11.680]   ExpressVPN.com/twig.
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:16.000]   Please use that address so they know you saw it here.
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.520]   It's great to have them as a sponsor and it's even better to have them know that you
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:21.560]   saw it and bought it because of us.
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:24.480]   ExpressVPN.com/twig.
[01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:26.680]   Thank you, ExpressVPN.
[01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:29.160]   Yeah I wasn't going to do bad news so I didn't want to.
[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:30.760]   Oh I forgot about the bad news.
[01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:36.480]   I didn't want to mention the in the reauthorization of the Patriot Act.
[01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:41.040]   Ron Wyden tried but the by one vote.
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:47.240]   One vote the Senate did not enforce a amendment that would have prevented law enforcement
[01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:49.200]   from getting your search history.
[01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:53.920]   I love the petition that said Mitch McConnell, if you believe this so much why don't you show
[01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:55.920]   us your search history.
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:51:00.160]   Yeah, why don't you show us your search history?
[01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:01.400]   Has it gone through the house?
[01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:08.640]   Yeah, it was about to say isn't this a it's not done yet because they can still.
[01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:12.120]   Can they still rescind this?
[01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:13.280]   Is it a done deal?
[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:15.960]   Is it going to the president's desk to be signed or what?
[01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:17.960]   Let me check.
[01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:21.760]   That is a good question.
[01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:27.040]   If it originated in the Senate, which I think it did then it would have to go to the house.
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:28.560]   It would have to go to the house.
[01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:34.760]   So or in reconciliation if the house is already passed it they could add it but it seems unlikely.
[01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:40.960]   This was something proposed by the ACLU.
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:45.280]   Yeah I don't know I don't think it's the law of the land yet but.
[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:49.200]   Oh okay yeah they're going to.
[01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:51.600]   Does the house have its own Patriot Act?
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:57.800]   They're going to ask the president to veto the legislation.
[01:51:57.800 --> 01:51:58.800]   Or is this the FISA?
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:01.320]   There's three amendments.
[01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:06.120]   I'm like yeah that Ron Paul has a FISA amendment.
[01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:08.280]   I don't know.
[01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:09.280]   They postponed.
[01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:11.360]   It looks like maybe the postpone the vote.
[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:12.600]   I don't know.
[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:16.600]   They can't postpone too long because if it doesn't get reauthorized it expires.
[01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:18.960]   Right, hold on.
[01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:22.040]   Well it already expired.
[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:25.120]   I'm sorry I shouldn't have brought this up cold.
[01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:28.280]   I apologize.
[01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:33.200]   Okay these were amendments.
[01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:37.400]   It just shows you this is why privacy advocates are so concerned about the contact tracing
[01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:39.400]   because this stuff never dies.
[01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:47.960]   This was Patriot Act was in response to 9/11 almost 20 years ago and it just never dies.
[01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:49.840]   Let me look at this is the 9-5 Mac.
[01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:51.080]   It says the FBI.
[01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:52.560]   That does not answer it.
[01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:53.560]   It doesn't answer it.
[01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:54.560]   Okay.
[01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:55.560]   I just read that.
[01:52:55.560 --> 01:52:58.360]   I'm like God, Politico, no.
[01:52:58.360 --> 01:53:02.480]   There's some clear reporting on this.
[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:05.800]   We need a song about how a bill is passed.
[01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:07.440]   Well I know how it works if the Senate.
[01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:11.720]   I don't know which way to say this is the second verse.
[01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:13.240]   Yeah yeah.
[01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:17.000]   And if the Senate passes it and the House passes something different then it goes into
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:21.560]   reconciliation which at some point somebody negotiates it and then they come out with
[01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:27.520]   a joint bill which then goes to the president and that's what I'm a bill on Capitol Hill.
[01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:30.760]   They have to vote on their reconciliation bill.
[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:31.760]   Do they?
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:32.960]   Before they send it to the president I thought.
[01:53:32.960 --> 01:53:34.720]   It's not just made up.
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:38.520]   I think you reconcile in committee it has to get out of the committee and then-
[01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:41.680]   These two are probably a quick voice vote like what do you think?
[01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:44.040]   Okay go ahead.
[01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:49.440]   Democrats are also trying to ban internet shutoffs until the pandemics over that that'll
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:53.200]   go well.
[01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:54.360]   I think we're done.
[01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:55.360]   I don't want to.
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:56.360]   I don't want to.
[01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:57.360]   This is bad news.
[01:53:57.360 --> 01:53:58.360]   I'm sorry.
[01:53:58.360 --> 01:53:59.360]   Let's only have some good news.
[01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:00.360]   Okay.
[01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:01.360]   Okay.
[01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:02.360]   Group tabs on Chrome.
[01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:03.360]   Yay.
[01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:04.360]   Yeah.
[01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:05.360]   Yeah.
[01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:12.360]   Yeah.
[01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:20.360]   Yeah.
[01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:23.360]   Pastrati millipedes.
[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:24.360]   Yay.
[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:26.080]   All right.
[01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:30.040]   Let us do you have a thing for us Stacy?
[01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:35.320]   I went and I did my demo on the level lock and so I'm coming back.
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:38.200]   That was so good.
[01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:39.400]   It's actually really cool.
[01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:45.160]   So I learned a little bit more about it for the people who were inquiring and it is really
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:46.520]   just a replacement bolt.
[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:54.000]   The bolt is I cannot say and and see and see and see and see great security so you can't
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.280]   saw through it.
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:55:04.000]   The innovation there and it's a former Apple person is that you take off your lock face
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:09.800]   you replace the internal deadbolt basically and what they've done is they've made it very
[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:12.440]   easy.
[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:15.600]   Traditional deadbolts and its battery powered.
[01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:20.600]   Traditional deadbolts they're designed for a physical movement right for me to twist the
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:23.800]   locks so there's a pretty hefty spring in there.
[01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:28.120]   This lock isn't so it's very lightweight it slides back and forth if you're playing with
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:29.120]   it.
[01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:33.600]   So that's how they got a lot of the battery savings because I was like that's ridiculous.
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:34.600]   It doesn't.
[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:35.600]   It doesn't.
[01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:37.240]   It seems like it's a little loose.
[01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:44.080]   But no because you can't you can't push it back if it's open and you can't saw through
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:48.320]   it so I'm trying to think of the use case would be a problem.
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:52.120]   No it just might wear out a little bit because it sounds like it's kind of.
[01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:53.680]   Lucy I don't know.
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:56.440]   Yeah well we'll find out you're using it right.
[01:55:56.440 --> 01:55:58.320]   I am not using it because I am moving.
[01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:00.040]   Oh you took it off.
[01:56:00.040 --> 01:56:02.800]   So that was the August lock I showed you last week.
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:05.320]   Did you use it?
[01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:07.160]   I would use it in my house on the new house.
[01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:09.160]   Good I would.
[01:56:09.160 --> 01:56:12.840]   And the benefit is no one actually sees any of the hardware so like the August I showed
[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:15.160]   you last week you could tell that that was there.
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:22.440]   With the level lock you replace the front plate and the back plate of your lock so no
[01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:28.000]   one has to know that it's a smart lock which is kind of nice for a lot of people I think.
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:29.000]   Very cool.
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:30.000]   And that's that's that.
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.720]   So that's the update there and I felt like someone had a question about it.
[01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:38.160]   Go to Stacy on IOT.com because her COVID panel will be there soon.
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:40.200]   Oh yeah that will be there soon.
[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:49.200]   Oh and I can tell you sign up at Stacy at IOT.com/edge and I have a half day event on machine learning
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:50.960]   at the edge and it's awesome.
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:55.360]   I've got people from John Deere they're going to talk about machine learning on tractors.
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:59.720]   Boop boop I've got shell they're going to talk about why machine learning cannot scale
[01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:03.920]   yet I've got just super awesome people.
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:10.640]   This is great and this is coming up Thursday June 11th Thursday June 11th.
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:13.280]   Karen Pacific cool.
[01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:18.520]   She's putting machine learning she's basically doing vision recognition on like firefighters
[01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:21.160]   and their gear to see through smoke.
[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:25.960]   It's I mean lots of good use cases lots of good explainers on what edges it's going
[01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:26.960]   to be awesome.
[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:32.880]   Well this is so you're doing this Jeff's interviewing epidemiologists my friend Johnny
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:38.640]   and don't forget the stakums guy and the stakums guy which was great and my friend Johnny
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:42.440]   Jett is a travel guru and obviously there's not much to talk about with travel.
[01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:47.040]   He's been interviewing all the other travel gurus about their travels and stuff.
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:51.680]   I think this is an interesting development that a lot of people that we now the technology
[01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:55.440]   to make this so this was hard to do even a few years ago.
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:57.920]   That's what the net really is which is conversation.
[01:57:57.920 --> 01:58:00.760]   Yeah so I think it's that's pretty darn cool.
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:07.960]   I look for this June 11th machine learning at the edge Stacey on IOT.com/edge.
[01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:09.960]   Jeff do you have a number?
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:12.400]   Well let's see I'll go a simple one.
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:18.040]   So we talked about we were earlier the valuation has dropped from forty seven billion to three
[01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:19.040]   billion dollars.
[01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:21.200]   Oh probably goes with your theories.
[01:58:21.200 --> 01:58:23.600]   Oh ow.
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:28.320]   Off bank sunk a lot into we were.
[01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:30.560]   Yeah they lost a ton of money didn't they?
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:34.880]   Well have they lost it I mean are they going to take a write off or are they going to hold
[01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:36.360]   on and I think that's what this is.
[01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:37.360]   Yeah this is the write off.
[01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:38.360]   Yeah yeah.
[01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:43.040]   Yeah so I was talking to an earlier I mean I wonder about dead malls becoming schools
[01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:44.760]   with social distance.
[01:58:44.760 --> 01:58:46.000]   Oh interesting.
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:47.800]   That's a good idea.
[01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:51.560]   What happens to to office buildings.
[01:58:51.560 --> 01:58:57.600]   My friend Bill Gross has a company that moves cement blocks up a tower as a means of storing
[01:58:57.600 --> 01:58:58.600]   energy.
[01:58:58.600 --> 01:59:01.640]   I even built them as a well now maybe you can use an old office tower.
[01:59:01.640 --> 01:59:09.440]   666 fifth and moves cement blocks up and put one time square is nothing but the ball
[01:59:09.440 --> 01:59:10.440]   and billboards.
[01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:14.040]   Maybe you put solar panels on the outside of buildings.
[01:59:14.040 --> 01:59:16.280]   What happens to these buildings.
[01:59:16.280 --> 01:59:19.120]   The big box turns them all into the walls that go away.
[01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:20.680]   They go to what.
[01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:25.840]   You turn them into high lights will data centers some malls are becoming data centers.
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:26.840]   Yeah are they.
[01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:28.040]   Yeah that's a good thing.
[01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:29.040]   That's what Rax Bayes did.
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:30.040]   Rax Bayes was in a mall.
[01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:31.040]   That is.
[01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:33.960]   Yeah they were really years ago yeah.
[01:59:33.960 --> 01:59:36.440]   And the roof is painted white for energy saving purposes.
[01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:39.240]   Brilliant brilliant yeah because it's in Texas right.
[01:59:39.240 --> 01:59:42.400]   Yep San Antonio hot I've been there hot hot hot.
[01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:43.400]   There's a slide.
[01:59:43.400 --> 01:59:47.080]   Haha another thing you could do with a mall turn it into amusement park.
[01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:48.480]   Well that's what I said.
[01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:52.720]   That's what's happening in New Jersey with with the.
[01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:54.840]   It's going to be it's already gone bankrupt.
[01:59:54.840 --> 01:59:56.800]   I think two or three times it'll go bankrupt again.
[01:59:56.800 --> 02:00:02.160]   There's a huge mall formerly called Xanadu that there's wasn't even opening now.
[02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:04.120]   Along comes COVID it's doomed.
[02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:05.120]   Yikes.
[02:00:05.120 --> 02:00:06.120]   Yikes.
[02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:09.120]   I worry about Las Vegas you know there's a lot of there.
[02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:11.920]   There's a massive development.
[02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:16.000]   Was it show world or something that's going on in Vegas that's going to be stopped completely.
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:20.200]   But they have really good filtering technology from the cigarette smoke.
[02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:25.720]   So I'm curious to see if like they optimize the heck out of that.
[02:00:25.720 --> 02:00:29.720]   If you're dumb enough to go gamble you're dumb enough to go there and get COVID you know.
[02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:30.720]   You think.
[02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:32.880]   People will be able because it's an addiction.
[02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:36.080]   They can't help it they can't stop it yeah.
[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:39.040]   I don't know I mean I just yeah I'm glad we didn't move there.
[02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:40.040]   I said turned down.
[02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:42.800]   You were thinking of moving there.
[02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:43.800]   Yeah.
[02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:44.800]   That's hardcore.
[02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:46.800]   It's fun.
[02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:47.800]   Sad.
[02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:55.440]   I thought it'd be fun to retire there because there's lots of great restaurants and entertainment
[02:00:55.440 --> 02:01:01.600]   and there was a giant there's a Madison Square Garden guys building a giant planet sized
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:06.640]   theater dedicated theater there that's also in trouble and they just finished a Legion
[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:11.720]   Stadium for the Oakland Raiders who are moving to Las Vegas for major so much football so
[02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:14.560]   much for that.
[02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:20.040]   But on the bright side those condos we were looking at are really going to be cheap soon.
[02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:22.960]   Meanwhile I think my suburban real estate is going to go up.
[02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:23.960]   Yeah it might be.
[02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:28.120]   Oh yeah that would be nice if our suburban real estate got more valuable than we can move
[02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:30.400]   to the big city.
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:32.440]   As just as everybody moves out.
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:35.320]   Then you'll have plenty of room to park.
[02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:36.320]   Yes.
[02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:37.320]   Yes that too.
[02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:42.160]   So I don't know if this is an appropriate pick or not it's kind of a cookie pick.
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:44.120]   I've been playing with websites.
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:51.320]   I always wanted a website that would be, wouldn't have any trackers running on it or
[02:01:51.320 --> 02:01:52.520]   anything.
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:58.680]   It would just be content driven and really fast because I wanted to use what's called
[02:01:58.680 --> 02:02:02.080]   a static website generator instead of a content management system.
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:04.120]   So medium is a content management system.
[02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:07.080]   I'm sure Stacy what do you use for your website?
[02:02:07.080 --> 02:02:08.080]   WordPress.
[02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:09.080]   WordPress.
[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:10.080]   I have a WordPress site too.
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:11.640]   So that's a content management system.
[02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:15.000]   It's basically a big PHP program that's running all the time.
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:20.400]   When you go to my site the PHP program says, "Oh quick get a page ready."
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:23.280]   It pulls from a MySQL database.
[02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:25.080]   It pulls content.
[02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:32.760]   It pulls style sheets from another database, puts them together and then throws this, it's
[02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:37.320]   what we call dynamically generated each visit.
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:39.440]   That is very costly and slow.
[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:40.800]   So I thought, "What if I have a website?"
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:45.120]   Because it's my stuff simple that would be statically generated.
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:46.720]   So I created Leo.fm.
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:50.920]   It's running on a server just over here.
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:53.280]   I don't know if this will be a good test to see if it breaks down here.
[02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:54.680]   Let me show it to you.
[02:02:54.680 --> 02:02:55.680]   Leo.fm.
[02:02:55.680 --> 02:02:56.680]   Go ahead.
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:02:57.680]   You can show it.
[02:02:57.680 --> 02:02:58.680]   It's okay.
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:00.840]   Oh, and you'll like this, Jeff.
[02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:03.280]   You see that hideous dark mode that you hate so much?
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:09.040]   There's a button right here that makes it bright just for you, Jeff.
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:10.240]   It's just for you.
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:11.240]   But the reason-
[02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:12.240]   It's a little sunshine in my life.
[02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:14.480]   I'm not sharing the blog particularly.
[02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:19.320]   The reason I'm sharing it, and in fact there's nothing really interesting on it yet because
[02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:25.640]   I'm just kind of playing with it, but it's kind of cool because I can generate it.
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:31.000]   I'm using SSH into my server and use Emacs to write a markdown file.
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.840]   Then I run the generator and this doesn't have to be generated.
[02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:35.120]   This is static.
[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:38.240]   It's just HTML pages that are loading when you visit it.
[02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:40.000]   So it's a lot faster.
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:43.880]   It's using a program to do that called Hugo.
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:46.240]   That's what my pick of the week is.
[02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:50.960]   If you're interested in doing a website, then you could put this anywhere you could have
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:51.960]   it.
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:54.600]   I'm using engine X and HTTP server.
[02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:57.880]   Digital Ocean, you could put it up in there if you have a box lying around.
[02:03:57.880 --> 02:03:58.880]   Then you run Hugo.
[02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:03.760]   You can either run it locally on your computer and then just copy the files over.
[02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:08.200]   I run it actually on the server because then I can SSH into the server and write the content
[02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:09.200]   there.
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:11.440]   It's a very quick and easy way to write the content.
[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:12.440]   Hugo's free.
[02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:13.440]   It's written and goes.
[02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:14.440]   It's very fast.
[02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:16.760]   GitHub has its own system called Jekyll.
[02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:20.600]   It's also very popular for static site generation.
[02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:23.200]   I really like the power of this.
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:25.520]   There's a lot of themes.
[02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:28.200]   It's very capable.
[02:04:28.200 --> 02:04:33.480]   It makes it easy for me to write blog posts anywhere very quickly.
[02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:36.120]   In a build, literally, they're right.
[02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:37.680]   It takes milliseconds.
[02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:43.120]   When I put up a new post, and Hugo generates the site, it's literally 30 milliseconds,
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:48.440]   30,000 of a second to create the static HTML page.
[02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:51.240]   You don't need to run a very ... You can run this on Wasabi.
[02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:52.240]   You could run this anywhere.
[02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:57.640]   You don't need a very fancy server to do it because all the work is done once.
[02:04:57.640 --> 02:05:01.120]   Then anybody visits the site, it's just loading those existing pages.
[02:05:01.120 --> 02:05:02.120]   I've been playing with it.
[02:05:02.120 --> 02:05:03.120]   I really like it.
[02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:04.120]   It's pretty cool.
[02:05:04.120 --> 02:05:06.120]   Hugo@go-hugo.io.
[02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:09.720]   No, it's not a sponsor hosting.
[02:05:09.720 --> 02:05:11.600]   It's a box.
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:13.480]   It's a black box over there.
[02:05:13.480 --> 02:05:17.440]   It's actually my Minecraft server, which I realized, nobody's at work.
[02:05:17.440 --> 02:05:18.600]   I might as well use the bandwidth.
[02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:20.360]   Here we got a lot of bandwidth.
[02:05:20.360 --> 02:05:23.120]   No one's using it.
[02:05:23.120 --> 02:05:24.120]   That's true.
[02:05:24.120 --> 02:05:26.760]   I've been running a Minecraft server at home.
[02:05:26.760 --> 02:05:32.880]   It's the same server I'm running, my Jitzy server on twit.team.
[02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:34.760]   What else is in this mystery box?
[02:05:34.760 --> 02:05:39.240]   Well, it's nice to have ... It's got a lot of storage and it's got a lot of RAM and it's
[02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:40.240]   fast.
[02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:42.440]   It's a Xeon.
[02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:47.360]   It's a nice thing to have just a box that you can SSH into and put stuff on.
[02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:53.440]   Whenever I want to play with a new device or thing, I can create a server.
[02:05:53.440 --> 02:05:54.840]   Jitzy's running on it.
[02:05:54.840 --> 02:05:58.600]   I think I have five Minecraft worlds running on it.
[02:05:58.600 --> 02:06:00.080]   Now I have my website on it.
[02:06:00.080 --> 02:06:01.080]   It's kind of cool.
[02:06:01.080 --> 02:06:03.400]   It's kind of fun.
[02:06:03.400 --> 02:06:09.200]   Next Wednesday, SpaceX launch says John G. We know you like space.
[02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:11.440]   Have you tried the SpaceX simulator?
[02:06:11.440 --> 02:06:17.880]   That's another pick I meant to tell you about.
[02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:20.880]   You can do a docking.
[02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:23.440]   See if you can dock.
[02:06:23.440 --> 02:06:27.120]   That's what I failed at when I was a kid and we went and did our NASA field trip.
[02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:29.040]   I was a navigator and had to like ...
[02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:30.520]   Well, now you can try again.
[02:06:30.520 --> 02:06:36.480]   This is the actual interface used by NASA astronauts to manually pilot the SpaceX Dragon
[02:06:36.480 --> 02:06:41.240]   2 to dock with the International Space Station.
[02:06:41.240 --> 02:06:45.320]   You can download it and run it, but you can also run it on the web.
[02:06:45.320 --> 02:06:49.240]   Oh my gosh, we're drifting off.
[02:06:49.240 --> 02:06:52.960]   I don't know how it works, but I've never been able to do it.
[02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:56.040]   Is this the one that's going to have astronauts on it?
[02:06:56.040 --> 02:06:57.040]   Is this Dragon launch?
[02:06:57.040 --> 02:06:58.040]   No.
[02:06:58.040 --> 02:06:59.040]   Is it still an unmanned?
[02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:00.040]   Maybe it isn't.
[02:07:00.040 --> 02:07:01.040]   I don't know.
[02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:02.040]   It is a manned launch.
[02:07:02.040 --> 02:07:03.040]   Yeah, astronauts.
[02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:06.400]   Well, if they get too close to the space station too quickly, they will have astronauts.
[02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:07.760]   Yes, no.
[02:07:07.760 --> 02:07:10.400]   There are astronauts coming to the space station.
[02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:12.520]   So SpaceX's launch is on Wednesday.
[02:07:12.520 --> 02:07:13.520]   That's fun.
[02:07:13.520 --> 02:07:16.240]   And you could practice beforehand to see.
[02:07:16.240 --> 02:07:17.240]   That's pretty cool.
[02:07:17.240 --> 02:07:18.560]   That was like my best field trip ever.
[02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:19.560]   Yeah, no kidding.
[02:07:19.560 --> 02:07:20.920]   It's fun, isn't it?
[02:07:20.920 --> 02:07:22.480]   It's hard to do this.
[02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:24.360]   I mean, this is not easy.
[02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:27.000]   I'm going to do a little roll.
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:30.320]   Let's do a little roll thruster.
[02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:32.360]   But you don't want to roll too much.
[02:07:32.360 --> 02:07:35.080]   You remember what happened.
[02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:39.720]   So the crude Dragon 2 is May 27th.
[02:07:39.720 --> 02:07:42.080]   Ooh, right after Memorial Day.
[02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:47.640]   Y'all, we've got a holiday that many of us will find meaningless next Monday.
[02:07:47.640 --> 02:07:51.160]   You can barbecue by yourself.
[02:07:51.160 --> 02:07:52.160]   Yeah.
[02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:56.320]   When I was young, I used to do the lunar lander at the Chuck E. Cheese.
[02:07:56.320 --> 02:07:59.320]   This is a little harder.
[02:07:59.320 --> 02:08:01.040]   Leo, you were never that young.
[02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:04.520]   You did that as a father and you're not an idiot.
[02:08:04.520 --> 02:08:07.520]   Jeffrey Jarvis, thank you so much.
[02:08:07.520 --> 02:08:13.280]   Jeff is officially the director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the
[02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:17.800]   beautiful Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University in New
[02:08:17.800 --> 02:08:18.800]   York.
[02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:21.160]   Look how gorgeous his shot looks.
[02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:24.200]   Thanks to E. Cam and eyeglasses.
[02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:26.760]   It's a little laggy.
[02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:29.360]   Well eyeglasses get in the other way.
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:32.760]   And you have kind of like an amber hue behind you, which is really interesting.
[02:08:32.760 --> 02:08:34.440]   Well, I changed it because the sun was coming in.
[02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:38.680]   There's not a way to go back to, let me put the temperature back down.
[02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:39.680]   That's better, right?
[02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:42.480]   I mean, yeah, your face still looked great.
[02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:44.840]   Your color looked fine, but just behind you.
[02:08:44.840 --> 02:08:46.240]   It's all about it.
[02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:48.200]   Jeff encased in amber.
[02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:52.440]   You can't be really patient to dock this thing.
[02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:55.240]   Oh my gosh, we lost Leo.
[02:08:55.240 --> 02:08:57.240]   Oh, I touched.
[02:08:57.240 --> 02:08:58.760]   That's Stacy Higginbotham.
[02:08:58.760 --> 02:08:59.760]   Somebody's hungry.
[02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:02.640]   Of the law firm of Higginbotham and Jarvis.
[02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:05.040]   She is of course Stacy on IOT.
[02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:06.840]   It's Stacy on IOT.com.
[02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:09.680]   The IOT podcast with Kevin Tofol is also there.
[02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:13.120]   And don't forget to sign up for her upcoming event and watch.
[02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:14.120]   Yes.
[02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:20.120]   And watch today's event on COVID-19 Stacy on IOT.com.
[02:09:20.120 --> 02:09:22.360]   I set up a background just for the event.
[02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:23.360]   Look at that.
[02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:24.440]   That's beautiful.
[02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:25.440]   I know.
[02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:26.440]   It's really good.
[02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:27.600]   You got llamas.
[02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:29.080]   I took the burner out.
[02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:30.480]   Yeah.
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:34.040]   Well, golly, I'm glad that you finally found something that mattered.
[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:41.280]   Something worth decorating for.
[02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:42.520]   Oh, sorry.
[02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:43.360]   You guys are just--
[02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:43.800]   We don't care.
[02:09:43.800 --> 02:09:44.720]   We don't care.
[02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:45.680]   We don't care.
[02:09:45.680 --> 02:09:47.160]   I know you all don't care.
[02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:47.600]   No.
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:49.640]   My husband, he was like--
[02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:51.000]   I think you should have a cleaner background.
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:52.320]   The printer is not great.
[02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:53.320]   And I was like, dude.
[02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:53.800]   No, he's Kevin.
[02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:55.040]   The printer's in all of my shots.
[02:09:55.040 --> 02:09:55.560]   I know.
[02:09:55.560 --> 02:09:56.040]   I know.
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:09:56.560]   Right.
[02:09:56.560 --> 02:09:57.080]   That's right.
[02:09:57.080 --> 02:09:57.800]   We want to see your--
[02:09:57.800 --> 02:09:59.960]   I want to see what you do in the new house.
[02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:01.800]   There's going to be a high standards set.
[02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:03.080]   We're doing a rape by Skype room.
[02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:04.600]   It's going to be so amazing.
[02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:05.720]   Are you going to be like Georgia Dow
[02:10:05.720 --> 02:10:09.840]   and have four virtual reality rooms for your family members?
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:10.440]   No.
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:10.960]   No.
[02:10:10.960 --> 02:10:14.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:14.800]   Thank you.
[02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:16.200]   But my office is going to be amazing.
[02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:16.400]   Isn't it?
[02:10:16.400 --> 02:10:17.720]   I'm going to try to out Jeff Jeff.
[02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:18.960]   Are you going to do some stuff?
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:19.960]   That's good.
[02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:21.880]   It's nice to have a great office.
[02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:24.640]   I'm very happy with my sewing workstation now.
[02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:25.760]   I can really crank them out.
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:27.440]   That's great.
[02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:29.080]   Good to have a good office.
[02:10:29.080 --> 02:10:29.880]   Thank you, everybody.
[02:10:29.880 --> 02:10:32.120]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday,
[02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:35.280]   130 Pacific, 430 Eastern, 20, 30 UTC.

[02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:49.680]   And by the way, if you're feeling a little lonely,
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:51.200]   you need a little geek companionship.
[02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:54.200]   There's almost always somebody in there 24/7
[02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:56.640]   because we have visitors from all over the world,
[02:10:56.640 --> 02:10:57.680]   from Australia and everywhere.
[02:10:57.680 --> 02:10:59.560]   So there are people in there in the middle of the night.
[02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:00.560]   You never have to feel alone.
[02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:04.720]   Go on in there and say hello if you're ever looking
[02:11:04.720 --> 02:11:05.720]   for somebody to talk to.
[02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:08.960]   We love our chatroom IRC.twit.tv.
[02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:11.200]   After the fact, you can download the show at our website,

[02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:15.920]   You can also watch it on YouTube or ask your Amazon
[02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:19.200]   Echo or your other voice assistant to play this week
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:22.520]   in Google podcast and it should play it for you.
[02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:26.720]   I do want to get you, if you will, to subscribe

[02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:31.080]   Look, there we are in real life.
[02:11:31.080 --> 02:11:33.920]   And even then, Jeff, you were social distancing.
[02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:37.880]   And it looks like you're saying, fine, I'm fine.
[02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:38.720]   (laughing)
[02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:40.360]   - You don't look friendly.
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:41.200]   - Fine, fine.
[02:11:41.200 --> 02:11:45.600]   - Fine, that was when Jeff was being a little bit
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:47.520]   if he was visiting us and Stacey was still
[02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:50.080]   in a little box over there.
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:54.480]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google, bye bye.
